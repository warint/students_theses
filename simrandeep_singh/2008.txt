Jürgen Stark: Main challenges for monetary policy in a globalised world Speech by Mr Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Conference “Monetary Policy in Sub Saharan Africa: Practice and Promise”, Cape Town, 28 March 2008. *      *      * 1.  Introduction The issue I have been invited to reflect upon today, namely the challenges to monetary policy in an increasingly interdependent world, is a topic that ranks highly on monetary policy makers’ agendas. The ongoing global financial market turmoil reminds us that no country is immune from economic and financial shocks originating outside the boundaries of its jurisdiction. In pursuing their mandates, central banks need, therefore, to assess the implications of economic and financial integration for the conduct of monetary policy. In my remarks today, I would first like to address three questions: 1) How has globalisation affected domestic inflation? 2) How does globalisation alter the way that domestic economies react to economic disturbances? 3) How has globalisation affected the way that monetary policy impulses are transmitted to the economy?  The answers to these three key questions will allow me to stress what I consider to be the main challenges for monetary policy in a globalised world.1  2.  The impact of globalisation on domestic inflation  We all agree that globalisation offers great opportunities. It increases the scope for efficiency gains through increased specialisation and better use of comparative advantages in the international production of goods and services. In the medium to long term, this reduces production costs, increases the world’s production capacity and generates gains that are passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices for a large number of goods and services. Globalisation brings about a more efficient allocation of factors of production, which, in any economy, increases the level of output that can be sustained without generating inflationary pressures.  In the short to medium term, an increase in the volume of a developed country’s trade with emerging low-cost countries exerts downward pressure on the prices of imported goods and close substitutes in the developed economy while giving rise to a gradual relocation of production. Viewed from this perspective, globalisation has resulted in a very significant shock to the terms of trade of developed economies, with the integration of China, India and eastern Europe into the world economy gradually increasing the global supply of labour – particularly low-skilled labour. By making skilled labour relatively scarcer, globalisation has reduced the relative wages of unskilled workers in industrialised countries.2                                                   1  For stylised facts about trade globalisation and its probable effects on euro area inflation, see ECB (2008). 2  The relative returns on skilled and unskilled work measure relative shifts in labour demand. This measure incorporates both relative wages and relative hours worked. For instance, in the euro area, globalisation seems to have led to a relative increase in hours worked in those sectors that employ highly skilled workers, while relative wages have remained fairly stable. In the United States, it appears that both hours worked and wages have increased in those sectors that employ highly skilled workers (ECB (2008)). BIS Review 35/2008 1 
The secular decline observed in transportation and communication costs has made it easier for firms to relocate the production of goods and services requiring larger amounts of low-skilled labour to those newly emerging economies, while industrialised countries tend to specialise in the production of goods and services requiring larger amounts of skilled labour. For example, the euro area specialises more in medium to high-tech exports, by comparison with China, which has specialised mainly in low-tech sectors such as textiles, clothing and footwear. In fact, technological progress has been so fast that for many goods and services it is even possible to allocate different stages of the production chain to different parts of the globe, in accordance with their relative levels of skilled or unskilled labour. As a result, in all major OECD economies import prices have declined relative to domestic producer prices over the last 20 years. Estimates by OECD staff3 suggest that in the period from 1996 to 2005 the integration into world trade of non-OECD economies – particularly China and other Asian economies – reduced annual domestic inflation by an average of around 0.2 percentage point in both the United States and the euro area.4  Over the last two to three years, however, globalisation has also been seen to have an effect on world demand. Economic development has brought about an increase in global consumption of food and other commodities, especially in China and other Asian countries. This has resulted in higher food and commodity prices worldwide, which have, to some extent, offset the effect that lower prices of imported goods and services have had on domestic inflation. There is not much that monetary policy can do about the sudden, perhaps permanent, increase in the relative prices of food and commodities, but to accommodate its mechanical, first-round, effect on headline inflation. However, a central bank aiming to maintain price stability in the medium term has to carefully monitor price and wage formation dynamics so that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored and no second-round effects emerge.  This implies that the objective of monetary policy must be defined in terms of an aggregate and not in terms of a partial or so-called “core” price index which excludes, for example, food or energy prices, in order to allow the central bank to identify in a timely manner long-lasting trend dynamics. In their assessment of the monetary policy stance, central banks realise that the ultimate impact of increases in the prices of oil and commodities – including food – on inflation and output dynamics will depend crucially on the reaction of economic agents, particularly participants in labour and product markets. Their reaction will be influenced by their expectations regarding the response of monetary policy to such developments. An absence of second-round effects following food and commodity price pressures depends crucially on inflation expectations being firmly anchored at levels in line with the central bank’s objective. In the presence of food and commodity-driven pressures on headline inflation, there is always a risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored and a damaging wage-price spiral being established. Given the costs of curbing such unpleasant inflation dynamics once they have started, a price stability-oriented central bank should react in a timely and pre-emptive manner on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the shocks to headline inflation.                                                  3  Pain and Sollie (2006). 4  Pain and Sollie (2006) argue that in the United States the impact is evenly distributed over the ten-year period considered, whereas in the euro area the disinflationary effect is concentrated mainly in the period 2001-05. 2 BIS Review 35/2008 
3.  The impact of globalisation on the structure of the domestic economy Over the past 20 years we have experienced a significant decline in the level and volatility of inflation in both developed and emerging economies. This has often been associated with the growing empirical evidence of a flattening of the Phillips curve. Can globalisation alone account for changes in the way that the domestic economy – and inflation in particular – reacts to economic shocks?  Globalisation may have played a role in this process through two distinct channels. First, the short-run Phillips curve, which typically relates inflation to excess domestic demand, may have flattened owing to the increase observed in trade and production specialisation across countries, with domestic inflation increasingly being affected by cost pressures arising in trade partners.5  Second, globalisation may have played a role in reducing the inflationary effect of excess demand is linked to the reduced ability of firms to increase their mark-ups in the presence of aggregate demand shocks.6 Globalisation may, for example, increase competition, reducing firms’ ability to pass an increase in costs on to consumer prices.7  Without neglecting the impact of globalisation on inflation, the main factor responsible for the reduced sensitivity of inflation to excess domestic demand is certainly the substantial improvement seen across many economic regions in the conduct of monetary policy. After the great inflation of the 1970s, policymakers worldwide have progressively recognised the importance of a sound institutional framework for macroeconomic performance, in particular the role of central bank independence in achieving and maintaining price stability. The independence of central banks ensures that monetary policy focuses on inflation without being distracted by political desires to fine-tune the economy or exploit a perceived short-term trade-off between inflation and output growth, which does not exist in the long term and is conducive only to the creation of higher levels of inflation. Economic agents have gradually come to terms with this significant shift to a credible, price stability-oriented monetary regime and have adjusted their inflation expectations accordingly.8  The lessons for monetary policy-makers are very clear: there is no room for complacency and no reason to believe that inflation has been brought under control forever. Independence alone does not suffice if it does not translate into actual price stability.                                                  5  Galí and Monacelli (2005) model a small open economy trading with an infinite number of other foreign economies. In the model’s Phillips curve, they show that the more open the economy is and the more substitutable domestic goods are with regard to foreign goods, the lower the coefficient for the domestic output gap becomes. Research conducted at the IMF and the BIS (IMF (2006) and Borio and Filardo (2007)) finds supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the increase in international trade and production specialisation has increased the importance of global indicators of economic slack and inflation, relative to domestic indicators, in explaining domestic inflation in developed countries. Ciccareli and Mojon (2005) also argue that in a sample of OECD economies domestic inflation is driven by a global inflation process, which at short horizons is a function of global real developments. The robustness of such evidence remains controversial, however, as empirical estimates depend on the specification of the estimated Phillips curve (Ihrig et al. (2007)). 6  Batini et al. (2005). 7  Rogoff (2003) contends that globalisation may, in fact, have had the opposite effect on firms’ pricing behaviour, arguing that the increase in competitive pressures arising from globalisation means that the cost for firms of setting the price at the wrong level is much higher than it would be with less competition. Hence, globalisation would lead to firms revising their prices more frequently and, eventually, increase the sensitivity of inflation to demand fluctuations through a steepening of the Phillips curve. 8  Coogley and Sbordone (2008) also argue that the lack of persistence in inflation in recent years is due to the low inflation environment. BIS Review 35/2008 3 
Central banks would be well advised not to regard the observed flattening of the Phillips curve as a structural feature of the economy that is unrelated to monetary policy. The ongoing increases in the prices of oil and commodities – including food – are already threatening to spill over to other price sub-components and increase pressure on the general price level in both developed and emerging countries. In these circumstances, central banks must not deviate from their commitment to price stability.  4.  The impact of globalisation on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy Let me now turn to the impact that globalisation could have on the way that monetary policy affects inflation, namely the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, and its implications for central banks. In particular, I will focus on developments in financial markets, given their fundamental role in the chain that transmits the monetary policy impulse to the rest of the economy. First of all, increasing financial markets integration is likely to have increased the impact of shocks – including monetary policy actions – originating in a particular country or economic region on the global economy. In the last 25 years the ratio of total foreign assets and liabilities to GDP has more than tripled in industrialised countries and has increased by 150% in emerging and developing countries.9  The liberalisation of national financial markets, declining communication costs and vibrant financial innovation have fuelled cross-border investment flows. This has increased the importance of global factors on the pricing of assets, on the relationship between supply and demand for capital and savings, as well as on the risk premia that investors require for holding certain assets.10  Thus, it is not surprising that central banks have traditionally devoted a substantial amount of resources to understanding the way in which foreign developments affect their domestic objectives and the way in which monetary policy decisions are transmitted to the rest of the economy. To fully appreciate the impact of changes of the global financial system on the monetary policy transmission mechanism, one should bear in mind two key features of financial markets developments: rapid financial products innovation and the emergence of new financial intermediaries.  Financial innovation, in theory, is generally supportive of economic growth and improves the allocation of savings, because it contributes to create deeper and more complete financial markets. Furthermore, under normal circumstances, it increases the efficiency of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy because central banks’ actions can potentially influence a larger number of economic agents. In general, monetary policy can be more stable and interest rates less volatile because smaller policy rate changes would be needed in order to achieve the desired effect on aggregate demand.                                                  9  Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2006). 10  There is a growing body of literature that supports the view that the transmission of financial market developments across the world has in recent years reached a point at which financial markets in any given country will react to economic news that is expected to change the path of monetary policy rates in the major industrialised economies.. See, for example, Ehrmann et al. (2005). 4 BIS Review 35/2008 
However, in several episodes of post-war history we have witnessed waves of financial liberalisation and innovation that have been associated with excessive market euphoria, leading to unsustainable asset price dynamics. The ongoing financial market turbulences are one example. In the last few years new computing and information-processing technologies have supported the rise of new – often esoteric – financial instruments explicitly designed to unbundle and repackage the pay-offs and risks associated with primitive, more conventional financial products and securities. This trend – which originally aimed to improve the sharing of risks across savers – was later extended to lending institutions, which, in the context of a search for higher returns, led to exponential growth in credit derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDSs) and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs).  Together with a number of benefits, such as improved diversification of risk and deeper capital markets, these developments also had two negative side effects, namely a significant increase in leverage and unprecedented growth in the marketisation of financial instruments. The fact that banks’ balance sheets shifted away from relatively illiquid assets (such as mortgage loans) towards a business model whereby the banks originated underlying loans which were then made tradable and negotiated in the open market (the so-called “originate and distribute” model) made it harder to draw clear distinctions between previously distinct categories of financial player. At the same time, new investors – notably hedge funds – were born out of the need for market-makers in previously unknown types of securities. The emergence of these new categories of investors and financial intermediaries, the behaviour and incentives of which can be quite different from those of traditional market players (such as banks),11 in combination with product innovation, has probably changed the way that shocks spread across financial markets. This probably also has an effect on the way that monetary policy impulses are transmitted to the rest of the economy. The proliferation of financial intermediaries adding value primarily by securitising and making liquid – i.e. rendering tradable in the market place – assets that until a few years ago would have been highly illiquid and remained on banks’ balance sheets has increased the ability of the financial system to create and supply liquidity. However, if the securitisation of illiquid assets such as mortgage loans is fostered by unsustainable dynamics in the price of the underlying assets, and if the products are not sufficiently transparent, an “originate and distribute model” that seeks to create market liquidity in this way can increase systemic risks and ultimately increase the risks to price stability.  The mechanism that was, until last summer, fuelling the creation of liquidity and credit could start to work in the opposite direction. Regulatory weaknesses allowed the explosion of credit creation on the basis of what, ex post, have clearly been shown to be faulty assumptions regarding the true level of market risk. Beyond these considerations, however, the question for policy-makers is whether central banks ought to be more active in such circumstances and adapt their conduct to the changes that have occurred in the monetary transmission mechanism. In my view, the ECB has shown itself to be ready to take all necessary steps to ensure the provision of sufficient liquidity to allow the financial system to continue functioning properly. Since the first signs of strain appeared in the money market, the ECB has provided additional liquidity to money markets.                                                  11  Rajan (2006). BIS Review 35/2008 5 
Liquidity-providing measures should by no means be confused with a weakening of the monetary policy stance. The ECB remains firmly focused on price stability, with its policy stance reflecting the Governing Council’s assessment of the risks to price stability in the euro area.  Central banks should devote maximum effort to understanding the extent to which the transmission channel of monetary policy may, in a stable macroeconomic environment, be affected by a high degree of integration in global financial markets and ever more complex market microstructures. For example, globalisation and financial innovation may have combined in the last two years to make the long end of the yield curve less responsive to the tightening of monetary policy than would be expected on the basis of historical experience – especially in the United States, but also in the euro area. It is very likely, in fact, that the global ample liquidity, in particular global savings flowing into the United States was driven by the unsustainably low risk return profile offered by new financial products and the illusion that the credit risk premium had almost disappeared. Finally, central banks should be very cautious when communicating with the markets, and the public in general, in order to make very clear the conditional nature of monetary policy decisions and avoid fostering unsustainable expectations among market participants. In some circumstances, unfounded expectations of a particular future policy could have an amplifying effect on asset prices and thereby contribute to the build-up of such financial imbalances, which would unwind quickly, and in a costly manner, once expectations change. This last observation leads me on to another issue on which central banks and academic scholars have been working for many years, namely the question of whether central banks should include asset prices in some way in their targets when setting interest rates – and if so, when.  5.  Asset prices and monetary policy To help me in my discussion of the role of asset prices in monetary policy, I would like first to summarise what I think are some generally shared views and to look at the positions held by the two broad camps that have emerged from this debate. These camps have arrived at opposing policy conclusions.  I believe that almost everybody in the central banking and academic communities agrees on four points: First, central banks face an exceptionally difficult task in assessing whether or not asset prices are being driven by fundamentals at any given point in time. Therefore, while central banks ought to do their best to obtain as much information as possible on the sustainability of asset price developments, they should be aware that identifying bubbles in real time is a very risky business. Thus, the results of their assessment should be interpreted with particular caution.  Second, central banks should not target asset prices. Targeting asset prices would, by definition, mean that monetary policy’s response to fundamentally-driven increases in asset prices is similar to its response to asset price bubbles, as bubbles are often difficult to identify in real time.  Third, central banks should take into account information from asset prices both in their forecasting exercises and in their assessment of the current state of the economy, as asset price movements can affect the behaviour of economic agents and can have an impact on price stability. Nonetheless, the typically high levels of volatility in asset prices and their unstable links with future macroeconomic conditions suggest that they should have limited weight by comparison with other indicators. 6 BIS Review 35/2008 
Fourth, although central banks can influence asset prices by means of monetary policy actions, the relatively large swings in policy rates that could be needed to curb boom and bust cycles in asset prices could pose a significant threat to macroeconomic stability in the short term. Building on these generally agreed conclusions, two possible monetary policy approaches have been suggested. On the one hand, some argue that central banks should lean against asset price bubbles, as such bubbles have the potential to create lasting distortions in the economy. In a world in which asset price bubbles are very difficult to identify and the curbing of boom and bust cycles in asset prices can prove very costly in terms of inflation and output, leaning against a possible bubble can be seen as an insurance policy in case a bubble is indeed being created. The proponents of this view argue that even if a central bank does not wish to target asset prices directly, some insurance is desirable, given that boom and bust cycles in asset prices may be damaging to economic stability.  Others, by contrast, advocate a sort of flexible inflation-targeting approach. They argue that the premium for this “insurance policy” is too expensive, since, by reacting to changes in asset prices, the central bank could seriously destabilise the economy in normal times when no bubbles were present. As a result, they argue, a policy of leaning against asset prices could lead to serious communication and accountability difficulties. Instead, they propose that central banks remain focused on maintaining price stability and respond to asset prices only to the extent that they provide information about current and future macroeconomic conditions. Overall, central bankers may draw some lessons from both camps: First, asset prices should not normally be granted a special role in monetary policy-making. Second, leaning against asset price movements may be advisable under some circumstances: 1. when the probability of asset prices being driven by non-fundamental forces is estimated to be high; 2. when the probability of the bubble bursting in the near future is low; 3. when the bubble is expected to be sensitive to modest interest rate increases; and 4. when the cost of the expected collapse in asset prices, were the bubble to be allowed to persist, is estimated to be significant.  While leaning against asset prices can be considered by central banks on a case-by-case basis when the four conditions I have just listed are met, this tends, admittedly, to happen only very rarely.  The ECB’s two-pillar monetary policy strategy is well suited to cope with the challenges brought about by asset price developments. In particular, having an explicit monetary pillar guarantees that the ECB has considerable expertise in the analysis of monetary and credit developments and in the analysis of their impact on price stability. The close link between monetary developments and evolving imbalances in asset and credit markets implies that monetary analysis enables to detect such imbalances at an early stage and to respond to the implied risks to price and financial stability in a timely and forward-looking manner. This has proved to be an invaluable asset for the ECB, notably in times of global financial turbulence. BIS Review 35/2008 7 
6.  Conclusion: Globalisation does not change the rules of monetary policy-making Challenging though globalisation may be for monetary policy, globalisation does not fundamentally alter the rules for monetary policy-making.12 Over the medium to longer term, inflation still remains a monetary phenomenon. This means that price stability is there for us to achieve.  While international liquidity conditions may influence market interest rates and thus the transmission of monetary policy to real activity and inflation, central banks retain the ability to control short-term interest rates, which have an effect, in turn, on the domestic cost of credit and long-term interest rates. However, as I said earlier, the success of monetary policy is dependent on central banks properly adapting their analyses in line with the changing environment, taking account, among other things, of the potential impact of financial innovation and liberalisation on the monetary policy transmission channel.  In such an environment, it is clearly important for stability-oriented monetary policies to analyse developments in areas such as external prices and international trade and financial flows. Asset prices and exchange rates should not necessarily be given any special status and should instead be taken into account by monetary policy only to the extent that they have an impact on price stability in the medium term.  I shall conclude my address today with a few remarks on the structure of the international financial architecture and its relationship with domestic price stability-oriented monetary policies. My view, which is shared by most members of the central banking community, is that the best international monetary architecture is one in which each central bank focuses on achieving price stability at home. This does not mean, however, that individual monetary policies should function in isolation. On the contrary, the ongoing financial turmoil has shown the value of a timely and open exchange of information on an international level between central banks and regulators in the presence of increasing financial globalisation. Thanks to the existing framework for cooperation, the ECB, in conjunction with other major central banks around the world, has been able recently – and without changing its monetary policy stance – to help to avoid a global liquidity squeeze by providing the euro area financial system with additional refinancing during this period of heightened risk aversion.  However, cooperation does not mean coordination. Each central bank has just one policy instrument, and this instrument can only achieve a single domestic objective, namely price stability. As a result, central banks would be well advised to react to foreign developments only if these become relevant for domestic price stability. International cooperation helps to exploit the synergies that exist in monetary policy-making with a view to establishing an environment of global monetary stability.  References Batini, N., B.

Ranee Jayamaha: SAARC Payments Initiative and policy responses Speech by Dr Ranee Jayamaha, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the inauguration of "SAARC Payments Initiative", Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Colombo, 28 March 2008. *      *      * 1. It is with great pleasure that I thank all of you for attending the inaugural session of the SAARC Payments Initiative. It is indeed a historic event and a landmark in the development of payment systems in the SAARC region, because this is the first time the member central banks, as a group, have decided to pay focused attention to this area of activity. It is also an important achievement for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to be able to pioneer the efforts in establishing the SAARC Payments Initiative. 2. The SAARC Payments Initiative, which is launched today, intends to • assist individual SAARC countries to prepare a domestic payment strategy and a forward looking development plan;  • design a coordinated regional approach to cross-border payments, taking into consideration the implications for trade, investment, central bank policy, foreign exchange positions and their management; and • clear any impediments experienced by the members in the areas of policy, operations and communications, legal and regulatory aspects, technical and institutional infrastructure, and engage in research and statistical analysis. 3. During the course of the SAARC Payments Initiative, member countries will be able to learn from the efforts and experiences of developments of payments within the region, as well as outside. Some of our member countries may have to acquire modern communication infrastructure and advanced payment systems to support the delivery of the payment and settlement services required, not only by their own markets, but also by the regional market. In effect, the SAARC Payments Initiative will be able to: (a) guide the efforts of member countries in modernizing their national payment systems; (b) assist in establishing appropriate technological links with others in the region; and (c) bring their payment systems to appropriate standards compatible with international standards.  4. The importance of payment systems 4.1 The broader term “payment systems” includes not only payments, but also clearing and settlement systems. Payment systems represent a basic infrastructure for the functioning of market economies and in developing more inclusive financial systems, including enhancement of access to finance. The soundness and efficiency of payment systems are fundamental to the stability of the currency, as well as the financial system and, therefore, to sustaining economic development.  4.2 It is in this context that some of the governing laws of the region’s central banks include references to the responsibility of central banks to promote the monetary, financial and payment systems in their respective countries. If I may quote from John Exter’s Report of 1949 on the establishment of the Central Bank of Ceylon, (the former name of the present Central Bank of Sri Lanka), it states “It is the monetary, financial and payment systems that facilitate the flow of money in the economy and as such, the Central Bank of Ceylon undertakes a great responsibility in promoting the economic well-being of the country”. Although modern central banks concentrate primarily on price stability and financial system stability, these objectives cannot be satisfactorily achieved without simultaneous development in the payment systems. Therefore, at some stage, all central banks have to BIS Review 35/2008 1 
pay attention to payment system development, although it was taken for granted by many until recent times.  5. Advances and transformation in payment systems development 5.1 Payment systems have undergone profound changes in recent years, primarily in terms of the increased complexity of the production and differentiation of payment services offered to customers nationally, regionally and internationally. Payment systems are evolving towards an evermore universal and sophisticated level of operation. In both wholesale and retail areas, new technologies, new participants and new alliances are beginning to transform the payments system landscape. This transformation is largely due to developments in information and communication technology, and integration and globalization of financial markets at the regional and international level.  5.2 One by-product of this transformation is the blurring of the distinction between wholesale and retail activities. Another is the growing integration of domestic and international payment flows, and efforts made to develop efficient cross-border clearing mechanisms. The emergence of non-banks in the payments system, playing a prominent role in introducing significant new developments, is a further by-product of this transformation. Banks still remain at the forefront of change, but the speed at which non-banks advance in these new areas of activity, is a significant threat to banks. This trend is now emerging in Sri Lanka too where non-bank card issuing agencies have begun to compete with the banks in providing payment services. These changes have prompted central banks, in pursuit of their mission to ensure the smooth functioning of payment systems, to establish structured oversight functions to foster the stable, orderly and efficient development of this area in the financial system. 6. The public’s preferences and public policy 6.1 In assessing what might drive change and influence outcomes for payment systems, we must start by understanding the public goals. Regardless of the mechanism involved, people expect the payments system to possess at least three fundamental characteristics. First, it must have integrity, i.e. transactions must be safe, reliable, and secure. Second, it must be accessible and available to all. Finally, it must be competitive and efficient, i.e. the cost of making payments should be affordable. To make an effective contribution to the development of payments & settlements and also to increase trade and investment flows nationally and regionally, it is necessary to identify the common themes in the form of public policy goals. In this context, the central banks are called upon to take certain minimum actions to further these goals.  6.2 However, the manner and intensity of the current involvement of central banks in payment systems development differ from one country to another. The roots of each central bank’s specific pattern of involvement lie in the different institutional structures and traditions of each country. The central banks may accordingly decide on appropriate action, beyond the minimum, which depends on the national and institutional background.  7. Importance of regional efforts 7.1 By and large, central banks in the SAARC region and elsewhere are currently involved with payment systems in three main ways, namely, in an operational capacity, as payments system overseers, or as catalysts or facilitators of market and regulatory evolution. 7.2 As all central banks are aware, markets may encounter persistent impediments to payment systems development and may become unable to produce efficient and safe services. The existence of such impediments would give rise to policy issues for central 2 BIS Review 35/2008 
banks, especially due to their responsibility in achieving the core objectives, such as price stability and financial system stability. These impediments can take the form of legal and regulatory inefficiencies, structural and performance weaknesses of the markets, the outmoded standards and infrastructure used, or the lack of attention by the central banks and regulatory authorities. While it is important for the national central banks to address these issues and find remedial action early, given the increase in trade, investment and cross-border financial flows, it is essential for the region to have a common understanding and apply, where possible, common standards.  7.3 The design of every payment system requires a series of trade-offs between the different elements of its objectives. The precise outcome of these trade-offs will vary, because they will be closely based both on national realities and international best practice. This emphasizes the need for close and continuous consultation in each country between the suppliers of payment services and the central banks as the overseer and regulator of the systems. The ultimate target of these consultations is to ensure the easy availability in each country of a payment system that meets the needs of its users, that enables the suppliers to cover their costs, and that does not absorb an excessive proportion of the national resources. That is why many regional payment system development initiatives have sprung up over the last few decades. For example, South African Development Community (SADC Payments Initiative – 1996), the Western Hemisphere Payments Initiative (1999); the Commonwealth Independent States Payments Initiative (2004); and the Arab Payments Initiative (2005) are some of the well functioning regional payment Initiatives. The common objective of all these efforts is to identify possible measures for improving the safety, efficiency and integrity of the regional payment systems.  7.4 The most demanding factor, common to all, is the rapidly changing global payment system infrastructure that is challenging the existence of domestic and regional payment systems, which are lagging behind. Given the increasing sophistication of cross-border transactions, the need to mitigate risks involved in using outmoded infrastructure has to be given priority. The SAARC payment system development strategy should therefore be designed to cater not only to the region’s present needs, but also its future demands.  8. How does the SAARC Payments Initiative work? 8.1 Let me briefly set out the proposed institutional structure of the SAARC Payments Initiative. 8.2 By consensus, Hon. Governors of the SAARC central banks requested the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to take the lead in this effort. We are happy to be the catalyst and promoter, but hope that at an appropriate time, this Initiative will be driven by the other SAARC member central banks. In consultation with the SAARC Governors, we have already appointed a SAARC Payments Council (SPC), which is composed of the chairpersons of the National Payments Councils (NPCs) in each of the SAARC member countries or by senior officials appointed by the Governors of central banks in countries which do not have NPCs. The NPCs or payments committees will coordinate and liaise with all stakeholders in the payments area, in particular, banks and financial institutions, stock exchanges, securities traders, stock brokers, service providers, regulators and legal professionals.  8.3 The SPC will be reporting to the SAARCFINANCE Governors at their annual general meetings and will obtain general approval for implementation of the road map which will be discussed during the rest of today. The SPC will be assisted by a Secretariat for operational matters. For the time being, Mrs Siriwardena, Director/ Payments & Settlements of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, has kindly agreed to be the Secretary to the SPC. The Secretariat will take the lead to prepare a road map by establishing working/study groups in the key areas, in particular, policy and communication, infrastructure, research and statistical analysis and legal and regulatory framework.  BIS Review 35/2008 3 
8.4 The advisory role played by the international standard setters and other agencies on regional payment initiatives has been important. In this regard, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) in the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which is the standard setter for payment system development on a global basis, has intimated its willingness to provide technical assistance and guidance to the SAARC Payments Initiative. Similarly, we are informed that the World Bank is also willing to provide technical assistance and advice to enable the SAARC Payments Initiative to start off on a sound footing. The presence of some distinguished officials from the World Bank at this inauguration is an encouragement.  8.5 The SAARC member central banks should be happy to have been able to get the SAARC Payments Initiative off the ground within such a short period of time. Given the enthusiasm and commitment by all of us, I hope that we, as a regional group, will make a substantial contribution to trade, investment and economic activity of each of our countries and also the region, as a whole. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 35/2008 
Seong-Tae Lee: Household debt – implications for monetary policy and financial stability  Opening address by Mr Seong-Tae Lee, Governor and Chairman of the Bank of Korea, at the Bank of Korea/Bank for International Settlements Seminar, Bank of Korea, Seoul, 28 March 2008. *      *      * Opening remarks Ladies and gentlemen, I bid a sincere welcome to central bankers participating in this seminar held jointly by the BIS and the Bank of Korea. Let me also express my deep gratitude to our keynote speaker, Dr. Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. This seminar, a part of the Asian Research Programme of the BIS, is held to allow the exchange of each central bank's experience and opinions concerning major monetary policy issues. The theme of this seminar, "Household Debt: Implications for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability", should be of great interest to us all. It is very closely related to the current international financial market turmoil generated by the US sub-prime mortgage meltdown. Background to the increase of household debt As you are all well aware, household debt in many countries has increased quite sharply since the early 2000's. In the US, the ratio of household debt to GDP rose from 75% in 2000 to 104% in 2007. This was led largely by an expansion in mortgage lending. According to an analysis by the IMF, household debt in some 12 Asian countries including Korea, Japan and China grew by an average 15% per year between 2002 and 2006. About two-thirds of this growth consisted of increased mortgage debt. The reasons for this rapid buildup of household debt are to be found to a certain extent in demographic changes. The aging of the baby boom generation, together with urbanization, fueled a steady increase in housing demand. To my mind, however, an even greater factor behind the increased household debt was the continuation of low inflation and low interest rates. Over the last few years, heightened productivity based on the IT revolution and the progress of globalization served to keep prices more stable. In line with this, central banks in every country maintained their policy rates at low levels. This resulted in low lending rates, which subsequently led to even greater demand for household loans. As anticipations of real estate price increases formed owing to the abundant global liquidity, mortgage lending for the purpose of speculative housing purchases also expanded sharply. In the US and other advanced countries, moreover, mortgage securitization and the transfer of credit risk were made easier thanks to the development of advanced financial techniques. This acted as an additional factor boosting household debt. Assessment of the increase in household debt This great increase in household debt did bring positive effects to the macro economy, as well as household welfare and financial institutions business. BIS Review 35/2008 1 
The expanded borrowing opportunities of households helped to improve their qualities of life, by making life-cycle consumption-smoothing and house purchases easier. Financial institutions were able to enjoy a wider range of profit opportunities, through household lending and through transactions in credit derivatives with household loans as the underlying assets. The total outstanding volume of credit derivatives worldwide is estimated to have swollen more than 110 times from 180 billion US dollars in 1997 to 20 trillion US dollars in 2006. In Korea, the share of household lending in banks' total loans rose from 28% in 1996 to 50% in 2006. With corporate demand for funds greatly blunted after the 1997 financial crisis, Korean banks instead increased their profit bases through household lending. This increased household lending helped to heighten housing market vitality, to stimulate consumption and to enhance banks' profitability. In these respects, it is evaluated as having contributed to the improvement of the macro economy in terms of the trends of business activities and of employment. Having said this, however, I should point out that if household debt rises to an excessive level, there is a greater likelihood of households being unable to repay the principal and interest on their loans when interest rates rise or housing prices fall. This, of course, generates financial institution insolvency and financial market turmoil, which in turn has a negative impact on the real economy. This possibility has been dramatically demonstrated by the US sub-prime mortgage meltdown. In the case of the sub-prime mortgages, strict screening of borrowers' redemption capacities was often neglected at the time of loan extension. Credit risk was then passed through to the financial system as a whole by way of MBSs and CDOs. For these reasons, when economic conditions weakened, it aggravated the seriousness of the problems of non-performing mortgages with corresponding severe impact on the financial market. In case of Korea, however, there has been no signs of household debt turning sour so far, although it has increased very rapidly since the early 2000's. The delinquency rates on banks' household loans stood at only 0.6% at year-end 2007. Future policy tasks In many countries, a large proportion of household debt is made up of housing finance loans. To maintain household debt soundness, therefore, the absolutely crucial thing is to avoid a housing boom and bust cycle. To ensure this, policy initiatives are naturally required from the micro angle targeting the supply and demand of housing and the tax regime. An even more important task, however, is to carry out macro economic policies that keep the overall economy on a stable course. What is more, given that financial innovation can amplify financial unrest, central banks and financial supervisory authorities should redouble their efforts to construct effective systems for monitoring and supervision of financial derivatives. Closing remarks Ladies and gentlemen, I expect this seminar will be a forum for a policy debate, involving in-depth and constructive discussions about household debt issues. 2 BIS Review 35/2008 
In closing I should once more like to voice my deep thanks to all of you taking part. Although you have a crowded and hectic schedule, I hope you will be able to spare some time to gain a taste for Korean culture and the beauty of spring here. Thank you. BIS Review 35/2008 3 
Thomas Jordan: Current challenges for the Swiss National Bank in the area of monetary policy Summary of a speech by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Money Market Event of the Swiss National Bank, Zurich, 27 March 2008. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * With its forecast that GDP will grow by 1.5%-2.0% and the average inflation rate will amount to 2%, the National Bank is cautiously optimistic for the Swiss economy in 2008. However, since the summer of 2007, the international environment has taken a clear turn for the worse: Financial markets are in a serious crisis, the major economies are weakening and inflation rates are rising worldwide. This means that the SNB’s monetary policy is facing challenges on several fronts simultaneously. With regard to economic growth, the SNB is called upon to assess the consequences of the international financial crisis for the Swiss economy as precisely as possible and to analyse their implications for monetary policy correctly and at an early stage. On the inflation front, it must ensure that the measures taken in connection with the financial market crisis do not jeopardise the credibility of a monetary policy geared to long-term price stability or shake established inflation expectations. Finally, the challenge in the money market is two-fold. First, the SNB must try – despite volatile risk premiums and interest rate expectations – to keep the targeted three-month Libor as close as possible to the desired goal. Second, with its operations and its choice of instruments, it must contribute to a well-functioning money market. Even though there have been several innovations in the area of monetary policy instruments, the SNB’s options in this complex environment are limited, however. In particular, there is no magic bullet with which central banks could restore the lost confidence among market participants. In dealing with the financial market crisis, therefore, banks and other financial market participants must also try to help restore the proper functioning of markets by implementing measures to shore up confidence.

Njuguna Ndung’u: IFRS, Basel II and the challenges ahead in Kenya Keynote address by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, during the Official Opening of Financial Reporting Workshop for the Banking Sector, Nairobi, 27 March 2008. *      *      * Distinguished Participants, Distinguished Resource Persons, Ladies and Gentlemen Let me first thank Ernst and Young for the invitation to give today’s keynote address, on the Financial Reporting Workshop for the Banking Sector. Looking at the agenda, this meeting in the next two days will dwell on a number of important accounting and regulatory issues. Therefore, to help set the stage for the discussion to follow, I would like to take this opportunity to expound on the Central Bank of Kenya’s perspective on compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and specifically at the benefits from such compliance, the progress we have made, the link between IFRS and Basel II and the challenges ahead. Acceptance and use of IFRS has become virtually universal, with many countries that hitherto operated their own national standards having phased them out for IFRS despite the associated challenges. International flows of investment capital and capital instruments across geographical boundaries have added a new impetus to the adoption of international standards globally.  It is no wonder that in 1998, the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK), moved from Kenya Accounting Standards in favour of International Accounting Standards. The Central Bank as the principal regulator of banks and non-bank financial institutions, formulates prudential guidelines that are in harmony with IFRS in order to minimize conflict and enhance compliance with international standards. The Central Bank of Kenya recognises that financial reporting standards play a crucial role in enhancing financial stability. On one hand, Reporting Standards provide the foundation for the production of credible financial statements and other disclosures that communicate the performance of the industry and at the firm level. On the other hand, disclosure of reliable information facilitates market discipline, cultivates confidence and reduces the possibility of adverse instability. The credibility of information allows market participants to process the right information and make appropriate decisions, thus a good signalling mechanism. Disclosure of information, however, should not compromise proprietary data, but must be flexible enough to accommodate future advancement in risk management. Such outcomes therefore, have obvious implications for the supervisor’s ability to oversee the safety and soundness of financial institutions. It is necessary for banks and non-bank financial institutions to prepare quality financial statements so that shareholders and other stakeholders are well-informed and a sound judgement on their financial status can be made by the market. Quality and reliable information depends in turn, on the reporting standards being applied. In this respect, IFRS ensures that financial reporting is prepared under accepted principles that convey a true and fair view of the financial position of an institution. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Central Bank has made significant progress in strengthening the supervisory approaches and risk management guidance for banks and non-bank financial institutions. This is aimed at encouraging the banks and non-bank financial institutions to implement sound risk management practices at all levels and in all market segments. BIS Review 34/2008 1 
It is for this reason that the Central Bank will continue to attach great importance to risk management and reporting standards so that financial statements produced by banks and non-bank financial institutions convey adequate information about their risk management activities to key stakeholders, such as shareholders, creditors, depositors and any other interested parties. It is hoped that with adequate and timely information potential investors can make correct judgement/assessment of this market. The choice of Basel II as a topic for discussion during the workshop is indeed timely. Basel II represents a crossroad, a watershed and a turning point for the future of global supervisory practices. Basel II presents us with an opportunity to enhance risk management systems in our banks, upgrade our supervisory approaches and inculcate market discipline. This can only serve to enhance financial stability. Central Bank recently issued an information memorandum to banks and non-bank financial institutions thereby setting the stage for the implementation of Basel II. Unlike Basel I which focused on a single risk measure, Basel II puts more emphasis on the banks’ own internal methodologies, supervisory review, and market discipline. The Accord is based on three mutually reinforcing pillars that allow banks and supervisors to evaluate properly the various risks that banks face. All of the reinforcing pillars will contribute to safety and soundness in the financial system.  Market discipline reinforces the incentives for the management of banking enterprises to manage them along sound lines. It operates on the basis of disclosures and other information available in the market and defines the reward system for the management. Periodic and meaningful disclosures by banks relating to their capital, risk exposures and risk management techniques enable market participants to make an assessment of a bank's risk profile. The information is also appropriate for supervision in that it generates advice and /or strengthens partnership. Enhanced, high-quality disclosures are mandated in IFRS from an accounting perspective and in Basel II from a prudential perspective. While IFRS disclosures focus on assessing the current financial position of an enterprise, Basel II disclosures are more forward-looking. Given the different focus of accounting and prudential standard setters, it is to be expected that the disclosure requirements under the two standards differ in some respects. IFRS disclosures are made in the financial statements by all enterprises that prepare and submit financial statements. On the other hand, disclosures under Pillar 3 are required to be made only by banks that are implementing Basel II. Moreover, Pillar 3 disclosures need not necessarily be made in the financial statements.  IFRS and Basel II disclosures do, however, complement as well as supplement each other in several ways. Both require corporates to provide information on their capital, the risks exposed to, and how these risks are managed. Disclosures are required to be made "through the eyes of the management". This enables the user of information to view and assess a firm in the same way its management would. Disclosures under both IFRS and Basel II include a good mix of quantitative and qualitative aspects.  Consistent, comprehensive and comparable disclosures contribute to effective market discipline. IFRS and Basel II disclosures try to ensure that this goal is met. There is potential for achieving synergies in disclosures under IFRS and Basel II by defining risk parameters in a common way, and developing common processes and data collection methodologies. This could lead to a consistent basis for internal reporting to the management of the enterprise and external reporting to the supervisors or regulators and other stakeholders.  Challenges with IFRS and Basel II Compliance with IFRS will assist banks to comply with certain aspects of Basel II. Both IFRS and Basel II intend to leverage on market discipline by requiring the disclosure of certain information. Basel II encourages development of more refined approaches to the 2 BIS Review 34/2008 
measurement of risks and greater transparency while IFRS strives to support broader and more sensitive recognition and disclosure of risks. Through financial reporting, the management of banks and non-bank financial institutions provide their shareholders, potential investors and other stakeholders with the past results of the business being managed and supervised. These reports give more in-depth insight into the income statement, balance sheet and cashflow and therefore, help the users of these reports better understand and assess the financial performance of the business. The market participants base their investment decisions mainly on the financial reports, thus reinforcing the importance of providing adequate and accurate information. Although financial reports are a crucial management tool, they at the same time provide the management with an opportunity to explain to stakeholders the institution’s performance, achievements and future plans. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recognises the importance of IFRS in Basel Core Principle (BCP) 22 by requiring regulators to ensure that banks maintain adequate records which are prepared in accordance with consistent accounting policies and practices. Compliance with IFRS and Basel II will however, pose certain challenges to banks and non bank financial institutions. For accounting standards, the most recent challenge is the accounting methods for sophisticated financial products, such as bonds, in which differences in financial assets’ classifications can result in different financial impacts. For example, held-to-maturity classification conceals profit or loss until maturity, while trading classification charges profit or loss to financial statements in every accounting period. The interpretation for a suitable classification relies significantly on the intention of bank management as well as on the judgment of external auditors.  Another practical challenge is the use of complex financial models to measure risks in banks’ portfolio. These models are important as they provide adequate predictive power. But there must be sufficient data, appropriate risk measurement techniques, and a rigorous validation process for the benefits of the predictive power of the models to be analysed. At present, the most important concern is the lack of consistent data points over time. For example, for credit risk measurement, a certain amount of data on default is required. Such data is typically not readily available. Banks may need to rethink their operations and strategies on account of the expected greater involvement of third parties. The point here is that new regulations allow banks to use financial models to estimate required capital and fair values of assets and liabilities. This means that banks can take advantage of the lower capital requirements by offering cheaper or more cost efficient products to their customers. But these aspects in the market place are driven by the market niche the bank is serving. The combination of market niche, requisite information and efficiency will be the core of operating strategies in the banks. Banks must increase their knowledge base regarding risk management techniques, especially on risk modelling. Going forward, a good internal rating system is key to business expansion and growth. To do so, banks can initially seek support from external consultants to transfer the know-how on risk management. But, in the longer term, it will be necessary for banks to train their own staff and build expertise to work as specialists on internal rating system and risk modelling. But we all do know that at the end of it all, these requirements and their derivative innovations are driven more not by the regulator like CBK, but the market niche the bank or any other firm in business is operating in. The more we understand our market niches, the more we perform better and above all adhere to the rules of the game. Market niches provide a drive to innovativeness. I should now end my talk. It has been a pleasure to share with you a regulator’s view on compliance with IFRS. I hope my remarks and observations have been useful. We are travelling on an important and challenging path towards achieving a robust and resilient financial system, and steady progress is being made. Indeed, this progress is usually BIS Review 34/2008 3 
noticeable in times of economic vibrancy. You, as a key stakeholder, are also an important part of this journey.  It is a great honour and privilege for me to declare the Financial Reporting Workshop for the Banking Sector officially opened and to thank Ernst and Young for organizing such a workshop. Thank you very much. 4 BIS Review 34/2008 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at a hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 26 March 2008. *      *      * Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les membres de la Commission Economique et Monétaire, je me réjouis d'apparaître devant votre commission aujourd'hui et de poursuivre notre dialogue régulier. Je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique et monétaire, en expliquant les raisons sous-jacentes à nos récentes décisions de taux. Ensuite, je vous donnerai de plus amples explications sur la distinction opérée par la BCE entre la définition de notre politique monétaire d’une part, et la preservation du bon fonctionnement du marche monetaire d’autre part. Zum Abschluss möchte ich einige vorläufige Schlussfolgerungen für die Regulierung, Aufsicht und Stabilität der Finanzmärkte ziehen. Economic and monetary developments Since my previous appearance before the European Parliament in mid December, inflation has remained at relatively high levels of above 3%. The incoming information has confirmed our assessment of prevailing upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of continued vigorous money and credit growth. Strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term mainly stems from the recent increases in energy and food prices. Looking ahead, the inflation rate is expected to remain significantly above 2% for most of the year. Hence the period of relatively high inflation rates will be more protracted than previously expected.  The March 2008 ECB staff macroeconomic projections foresee HICP inflation to range between 2.6% and 3.2% in 2008, and between 1.5% and 2.7% in 2009. These projected ranges have shifted upwards, mainly as a result of higher food and energy prices. I should stress that the staff projections are based on a number of purely technical assumptions which are unrelated to policy intentions, such as the use of market expectations in the assumptions for short-term interest rates.  In the view of the Governing Council, risks to the medium-term outlook for inflation are on the upside. These risks include further rises in oil and agricultural prices. Furthermore, taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions, wage growth may be stronger than currently expected, as well as the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition. Moreover, administered prices and indirect taxes may increase beyond what is foreseen. At this juncture, it is therefore imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on price and wage-setting stemming from current inflation rates are prevented. To that end, schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices must be avoided. This is key to preserving price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens.  Turning to economic activity, in the fourth quarter of 2007, real GDP grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, following a rise of 0.8% in the third quarter. Incoming information confirms the picture of moderating growth. Looking forward, ongoing growth is expected. The euro area economy has sound fundamentals and does not suffer from major imbalances. Investment growth – while dampened by the global slowdown – should provide ongoing support. At the same time, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and BIS Review 33/2008 1 
unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. Accordingly, consumption growth should continue to contribute to economic expansion. This assessment is reflected in the latest ECB staff projections, which foresee annual real GDP growth in the range of 1.3% to 2.1% in 2008 and of 1.3% and 2.3% in 2009. These ranges have been revised downwards, reflecting weaker global demand, stronger pressure from commodity prices and less favourable financing conditions than foreseen in December.  In the view of the Governing Council, uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth remains unusually high. Downside risks relate to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of financial market developments. Further downside risks stem from the scope for additional increases in commodity prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. On the basis of data available up to January, the underlying money and credit expansion remains strong, even taking temporary factors into account, such as the relatively flat yield curve. There is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since August 2007 strongly influenced the overall dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates. Bank loans to the domestic private sector have grown at annual rates around 11% for the past two years. While the growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months, loan growth to non-financial corporations remains very strong. In line with its mandate, the ECB’s Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. Against this background, on 6 March, we decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our price stability objective. Indeed, the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority. The Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments.  The separation of the tasks of determining the monetary policy stance on the one hand and the preservation of the proper functioning of the money markets on the other hand Let me now address the issue of the separation between the determination of the monetary policy stance on the one hand and its actual implementation on the other hand, meant as keeping short-term rates close to the level chosen by the Governing Council. In accordance with the Treaty provisions, the primary objective of the ECB is to maintain price stability in the euro area. To that end, the Governing Council determines, on the basis of its economic and monetary analyses, the appropriate monetary policy stance by setting the key ECB interest rates at the level that ensures the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. In view of safeguarding its credibility and firmly anchoring long-term inflation expectations, it is crucial that the Governing Council sets the appropriate monetary policy stance on the basis of no other considerations than the delivery of price stability in the medium term.  Once the appropriate level of the key ECB interest rates has been set, the Executive Board of the ECB implements monetary policy so that the level of the key interest rates decided by the Governing Council actually prevails in the money market. For this purpose, the ECB steers, primarily by means of open market operations, the liquidity which is lent to euro area credit institutions against adequate and sound collateral and for a given and short period of time. By so doing the ECB also fosters a smooth functioning of the euro area money market.  The steering of liquidity has been an important element of the Eurosystem’s framework for monetary policy implementation since the launch of the euro. By these means, market participants get clear and loud the signal about the orientation of the monetary policy stance and this fosters the predictability and credibility of the Governing Council’s monetary policy decisions. The fact that these decisions are firmly based on the objective of price stability 2 BIS Review 33/2008 
and the concomitant fact that the steering of liquidity is in turn dependent on these decisions, but in no way influences them ensures that price stability is maintained over the medium term. This also ensures that the liquidity provision aimed at promoting the smooth functioning and resilience of money markets is also fully in line with the primary objective of price stability.  Particularly after the onset of financial tensions in August 2007, the principle, that the steering of liquidity is subservient to the monetary policy stance and does not affect it, appeared of the essence.  In this period of acute turbulences, the ECB has succeeded in containing deviations of very short-term interest rates from the official interest rate set by the Governing Council. As a result, the ECB has ensured a continued effective implementation of monetary policy in line with the stance, thereby also contributing to safeguarding overall financial stability.  Since the last Hearing in December, tensions have continued. During this period, the Eurosystem remained, as usual, in close contact with other major central banks. In this context, on 11 March the Governing Council of the ECB decided, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve to offer US dollar funding to Eurosystem counterparties as it did in December 2007 and in January 2008. Through the operations currently being undertaken, liquidity for an overall amount of up to USD 30 billion is provided. The Swiss National Bank is following an analogous course of action. Overall, given its flexible design, the Eurosystem’s operational framework with its broad range of instruments has thus far proved to be resilient and effective. Even in the course of the ongoing financial turmoil, there has been no need to adjust or extend the existing framework, e.g. by introducing innovative instruments or a broader range of collateral.  Recent developments regarding financial stability and supervision  I would now like to share with you the ECB’s assessment of the current financial stability situation. I will also touch briefly upon the possible policy measures which are being prepared at the European and international level in response to the financial turmoil.  With the global financial system undergoing a process of de-leveraging, the euro area financial stability outlook continues to be clouded by considerable uncertainty. Since my last hearing before your Committee, it has been argued that the total valuation and income losses facing the global financial system are clearer. Yet considerable uncertainty still remains about the reliability of total cost estimates and about how the costs will eventually be spread. There is also uncertainty about the possibility of feedback effects onto the financial system, including questions about what the ultimate impact on the intermediation of credit – both through financial institutions and markets – will be. Moreover, until conditions in the US housing market show signs of improvement, the possibility of continuing tensions in structured credit markets cannot be excluded.  In the period ahead, large euro area banks are likely to face pressure on their revenues on account of lower activity levels in the structured credit markets as well as from a general retrenchment from risk-taking across many business lines. At the same time, the banks are facing increased funding costs. Consistent with this, a number of financial market indicators – including bank equity prices and credit default swap spreads – have generally been reflecting expectations of weaker profitability as well as concerns about credit and counterparty risks. On the positive side, several years of strengthening profitability had by mid-2007 left the euro area banking sector in a strong financial position to face the possibility of a credit cycle downturn.  All in all, given the heightened uncertainties, and in an environment where balance sheet conditions could unexpectedly change, vigilance is more than ever of the essence. Financial institutions will need to step up their efforts to effectively manage the risks that may lie BIS Review 33/2008 3 
ahead. From the central banks’ perspective, restoring confidence among economic agents and market participants is crucial in the current environment of great uncertainty and high market volatility. One very important contribution the ECB makes to preserving confidence is to continue firmly anchoring medium to long term inflation expectations for the euro area while at the same time ensuring the smooth functioning of the short-term money market.  At the current juncture, priority has been given to comprehensively draw lessons and formulate policy responses to address the challenges raised by the financial market turbulence. The key areas have been identified and since my last hearing before you, work has been progressing intensively both internationally and in the EU. The Financial Stability Forum and the ECOFIN have developed preliminary assessments warranting further policy action. In that context, let me mention some areas I see as requiring timely responses: First, with regard to improving disclosure and valuations of structured finance products, financial institutions are called upon to promptly and fully disclose on- and off-balance sheet risk exposures. Moreover, guidance is warranted by auditors and supervisors with the aim of enhancing the clarity and robustness of structured product valuations, particularly in relation to illiquid assets.  Second, credit rating agencies, whilst eliminating conflicts of interest, should take measures to expand the scope of information provided to investors – thus facilitating their exercise of due diligence, while improving governance and rating methodologies. If their endeavours will not prove to be adequate, public policy action would need to be considered.  Third, supervisors should ensure that banks retain adequate capital and liquidity buffers. In this context, work is underway to refine certain aspects of the capital adequacy framework, especially in relation to the treatment of securitisation and off-balance sheet exposures. Moreover, further supervisory guidance needs to be developed for liquidity risk, incorporating the lessons from the turmoil and focusing on liquidity stress-testing and contingency funding plans.  These are three examples of areas where very important progress should be made. More generally, I would call for a further significant change of culture at the national, European and global level. I would sum up this cultural change with two words: transparency and anti-cyclicality. “Transparency” because enhanced public information on financial instruments, on markets and on institutions is not only necessary to permit market participants to take optimal economic decisions, but is also the only way we have of avoiding contagion, herd-behaviour and, therefore, the propagation of turbulences in times of difficulty. And “anti-cyclicality” because a large number of rules, regulations and procedures have a tendency to foster behaviour that is largely procyclical, amplifying the booms as well the busts in the cycle. We must look at all parts of global finance with a view to diminishing progressively their pro-cyclical components, which implies, in particular but certainly not exclusively, eliminating to the greatest possible extent asymmetry in the treatment of booms and busts and, where necessary, extending as far as possible the time-horizon adopted by all the institutions concerned.  I am now at your disposal for questions. 4 BIS Review 33/2008 
Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Banking sector developments in the Philippines Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas), at the ILF MOA Signing Ceremony, Manila, 25 March 2008.  *      *      * Members of the Monetary Board, Undersecretary Roberto Tan, BAP President Ramon Sy, Mr. Paul Favila, fellow bankers, special guests, good morning.  I am glad we now have this Memorandum of Agreement for the Enhanced Intraday Liquidity Facility. This MOA will help the Philippine banking sector adapt and respond better and faster to increasingly dynamic and challenging developments in the financial markets.  Congratulations are therefore in order to all those involved in the process that has led to this MOA signing today. Let us give everyone a well-deserved round of applause.  Indeed, operational adjustments in the ILF provide participants greater flexibility in the use of their securities. For instance, instead of earmarking the securities for ILF use for the whole week, participants can now make daily changes in their securities pool.  In addition, availments will be made only when the need arises. Furthermore, availment costs have been reduced to encourage more participation to the ILF. Ladies and gentlemen. These are challenging times and now, more than ever, we need to close ranks to address the issues that concern the banking sector in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.  On our side at the Bangko Sentral, we assure you that our lines of communication are kept open at all times for discussions and consultations. I expect the same from your end, particularly when it concerns programs that will benefit the financial system in particular and our economy in general.  I will be the first to say that we have done a lot to strengthen our banking sector. This has been validated and repeatedly acknowledged here and overseas. However, we should continue our reform agenda to keep in step with global developments. Let us choose innovation, over stagnation.  United, we can make further improvements in our banking sector as well as our payment and settlements system to make it stronger, more efficient, and consistently aligned with world-class standards.  Mabuhay ang Philippine banking sector! Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat. BIS Review 33/2008 1 
Shamshad Akhtar: Policy tradeoffs and structural issues Speech by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the Golden Jubilee of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economic, Islamabad, 11 March 2008. *      *      * Resilience of Pakistan’s economy in the face of unforeseen global and multiple domestic shocks has been a subject of debate – proponents of outgoing Government arguing that it has strengthened, while opponents criticize the state of the economy. In these circumstances, I propose to provide a neutral, unbiased and economic reasoning for why and where we stand today? I encourage Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) to further investigate and provide a professional economic perspective on the economy with the objective of feeding properly into policy advice. In providing my perspectives, I propose to highlight the emerging challenges posed by the weak global economic scenario, its consequent impact on the domestic economy which was already under strain, and then discuss the policy options and solutions, especially the structural changes that are required to put Pakistan on the road to sustainable economic recovery. Pakistan entered the 21st century after displaying an average economic performance in the 1990s on numerous fronts. In deference to the historical pattern of growth path and associated business cycles, the economy gained momentum. From 2000 onwards: foreign exchange reserves grew, the debt-to-GDP ratio fell, and inflation, in particular core inflation, decelerated. Dynamism of financial sector, benefiting from the change of ownership and management and strong regulation and supervision, helped revive real economy and exploited untapped economic potential. Financial sector assets rose to $180 billion (125% of total GDP) as banks’ were capitalized and the stock market remained buoyant. Corporate and banking sector profitability attracted cumulatively foreign direct investment of $11.9 billion, remittances at $22.4, and net portfolio flows were $5.0 billion. Since late 2004 domestic vulnerabilities reemerged and mounted as the fiscal and external current account deficits rose above 4% of GDP and induced inflationary pressures. Risks to macroeconomic stability just after few years of robust growth and stability are not surprising. A quick review of Pakistan’s economic history reveals that episodes of strong economic growth in the 1960s and then in 1980s were both followed by the slowdown in growth and weaknesses in macroeconomic indicators.  Why is Pakistan vulnerable to these cyclical downturns? Why cannot the country have sustainable economic performance? The oscillating growth performance over the years is largely because of inherent domestic structural rigidities which have yet to be effectively tackled to ensure macroeconomic stability and the desired growth path. Proper diagnosis and effective resolution of issues and implementation of broad ranging structural reforms is critical to skirt such bouts of slowdown in growth and instability.  Aside from the broader development debates, what is unusual currently is that Pakistan’s economy is simultaneously faced with twin shocks, global and domestic. The global shocks are represented by international financial market turmoil and the unprecedented increase in global commodity prices, while rising fiscal and external current account imbalances characterize the domestic shocks. In the backdrop of (relative) slowdown in foreign exchange inflows in FY2008, these shocks have resulted in pressure on the exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves, heavy government borrowings from the central bank, and a rise in domestic inflation.  Combined, both international and domestic events have complicated short term economic management disrupting monetary management which had succeeded in bringing the core inflation down to 5.2% by May 2007 – below the peak levels of 8.3% in October 2005 and brought to surface more starkly the vulnerabilities economy faces. Like most economic BIS Review 33/2008 1 
phenomenon, these international shocks and domestic deficits are interrelated and entail stringent tradeoffs when it comes to devising and implementing a well-coordinated, timely, and enduring policy response. Unless immediately addressed, the present economic vulnerabilities emerging in Pakistan’s economy risks reversal of the high growth trajectory and even disruption of the gains achieved. Below, I attempt to give the basic reasons for the (re)emergence of these shocks and deficits, highlight the complexities, and suggest some sustainable solutions.  The global scene Worldwide central bankers, economic policy makers and businesses are overwhelmed as global economy slides in tailspin. Financial market turmoil caused by subprime debacle has sparked numerous debates regarding the origins of this event, effects of its aftermath, both in terms of contagion and policy responses across the globe. Risks of spread of contagion associated with US and UK’s credit crisis and liquidity crunch have compounded as the financial and economic losses magnify and thwart global financial stability and economic growth prospects. Combined with record-high international commodity prices (in particular oil and food prices) global inflationary risks have intensified. Emerging markets like Pakistan, which were thus far insulated mainly due to low exposure to the subprime paper, are likely to be impacted by the second round effects of the financial market turmoil which are now visible by way of sluggish world economic growth as US downturn is setting in.  To mitigate these risk, US has launched a unprecedented package involving: easing liquidity through special funding windows, cutting policy rate, in five rounds, to 225 bps and providing US$200 billion fiscal package. This package, while warranted, is fairly controversial because of the associated moral hazard and inflationary consequences of rate cuts and easing of liquidity. Since the appropriate size of the stimulus cannot be calibrated with any precision, the aggressive stimulus by way of a monetary accommodation is likely to compound the global inflationary pressures which were already rising in wake of (i) supply constraints magnified due to world wide shortages of strategic products (such as wheat) and oil substitution efforts that diverted use of corn as a bio-fuel and (ii) growing demand pressures with rising world income. Fuelling the international commodity prices has also been the fall in US dollar which has driven investors to chase gold and oil markets. In a globally integrated world the costs of re-anchoring inflation expectations are likely to be punitive. No wonder, other central banks, with the exception of few such as Federal Reserve and Bank of England, have either further tightened their monetary policy or kept on hold to existing levels of tightening.  Developing understanding of the origins of the financial crisis and adequacy of its policy responses is critical. Analysts have largely identified collapsing US sub-prime mortgage market as the key cause for financial market turmoil. However, the sub-prime mortgage debacle appears more of a symptom rather than a cause of this evolving credit crisis. Underlying causative factors is the sustained decline in inflation and inflation volatility and the associated notable decline in nominal and real interest rates in most developed and developing economies. This resulted in complacency and central banks’ adopted accommodative monetary policy for longer period that induced excessive liquidity. Combined with regulatory and supervisory gaps in oversight of off-balance sheet and nonbank transactions, this provided opportunities for overleveraging without appropriate risk management frameworks. Arguably, these developments increased appetite for and under pricing of risk (although the pricing of risk was (and is) becoming increasing difficult in the face of fast-paced financial innovations), elevated asset prices, increased capital flows across borders in search of better yields (reflecting global macro imbalances), “carry trade” and currency misalignments. Although, monetary conditions had begun to tighten, the sub-prime mortgage crisis caused liquidity squeeze that resulted in loss of confidence and panic among investors and lenders 2 BIS Review 33/2008 
(and now central banks) as they could not offload the complex risky assets and structured financial products. Since banks turned to rescue and bought off chunks of these papers, with low mark-to market valuations these resulted in losses to a number of financial institutions and write offs required capital injections. This fortunately was possible given the growth in sovereign funds which are waiting for acquisition and other deals. Could it be possible that by accommodating the oil and food prices and (attempting) to revive the economy, US is setting the stage for another round of easy monetary policy and liquidity situation. In my opinion, the key issue for central banks is to differentiate between need for short-term liquidity to rescue troubled financial entities and need for adoption of a credible monetary policy stance which aims to calibrate liquidity management in a way that it does not aggravate inflationary risks which in turn would trigger further complication and protract the global economic recovery. While lowering interest rates, central banks have to weigh inflationary risks against the risk of recession and financial instability. In bailing financial entities, the central banks have to be concerned with “moral hazard” associated with such policy response as it often encourage more risky endeavors by salvaging institutions whose sole purpose of existence is risk taking and profit making.  Not only is Pakistan facing different sets of complex challenges, but the emerging global economic scenario itself underscores that country does not mimic the policy response of advanced economies. Advanced countries that are selectively lowering interest rates are those that have enjoyed low inflation for sometime but are now facing steeper risks of downturn. As such, there trade off for growth supportive policies relative to inflation is understandable as risks associated with US slowdown would threaten global economic outlook and financial vulnerabilities. Pakistan on the other hand has relatively stable financial system, but mounting aggregate demand pressures are now visible in rising inflation and rising inflationary expectations. Tightening of monetary stance and flexible exchange rate management are the two key central bank policy responses. These however will have more distinct impact if the Government reverts to fiscal prudence and efforts to this count are visible through recent reduction in oil and other subsidies.  Turning to the domestic front Structural Reforms: An Assessment. To understand the economic complexities at hand it is important to trace briefly Pakistan’s economic growth trajectory and experience of structural reforms. Over the last three decades, economic growth has stumbled: While growing around 6-7% in late-1970s-1980s and growth faltered over 1988-2001 to 4.4%. From 2000, efforts launched have resurrected growth to an average of 6.3% over the last few years. The growth path was disrupted frequently by the inability of the government to adhere to prudent macroeconomic management and to consistently implement structural reforms.  There is evidence, corroborated by the IMF Independent Evaluation Office1 that Pakistan’s macroeconomic framework and structural reforms suffered because of the lack of ownership of economic agenda and excessive focus on macroeconomic stabilization without supportive real sector as well as institutional and structural reforms. This resulted in slippages in conditionalities and/or weak implementation of the reforms at best as releasing disbursement to meet economy’s financial crunch outweighed compliance with structural reforms.  Problems with design and sequencing of structural reforms resulted in suboptimal outcomes of policies adopted. Few striking examples would illustrate this. Macroeconomic stability has often been disrupted as fiscal slippages were a norm given spending was not aligned to resource envelop that has been for years constrained by narrow tax base. These trends                                                  1  IMF (2002), “Evaluation of Prolonged Use of IMF Resources”, Chapter 9: Pakistan, Independent Evaluation Office, Washington D.C.  BIS Review 33/2008 3 
made fiscal-monetary coordination difficult. Continued recourse of deficit financing from central bank and other domestic financing sources has prevented containment of inflationary pressures, while constraining private sector credit demands. In real sector, industrialization has suffered because of excessive emphasis on import substitution and the incentive regime carried anti-export bias; consequently Pakistan suffers vulnerabilities stemming from lack of industry and export diversification.  Nevertheless, structural reforms, adopted since 1990s have been refined in the recent decade. Among others, notable are following steps:  Openness of the economy. Deregulation, price liberalization and lowering of tariffs,2 and the government’s increased willingness to cede greater role to the private sectors in the economy has improved the incentive regime.  Greater fiscal space. Broadening of sales tax base, lowering of tax rates and improvements in tax administration together helped in raising the tax revenue; offsetting the losses stemming from tariff liberalization. Tightening of fiscal deficit over FY2002-2005, decline in debt3 and lower debt servicing (partly through the restructuring of external debt and partly through improved debt management) allowed space for raising development expenditures. Sustaining growth in development expenditures is becoming a challenging as tax base is limited by exemptions and a significant proportion of taxable bodies/incomes remained outside the tax net.  Privatization and deregulation. Government’s success in extricating itself from the provision of goods and services in a number of areas by sale off of public companies has helped generate proceeds. This has helped temporary alleviate fiscal needs and would also reduced state enterprises recourse to budget. Privatization has already helped improved accessibility and efficiency particularly in banking, telecommunications, and airline industries as well as the mass media (radio, television, etc.).  Improving demographics. Albeit slow, Pakistan has managed to reduce its population growth rate. Large population offers strong domestic market and human resource for industry, but it does pose challenges and tradeoffs. Feeding population when crop productivity and yields are low, meeting their social services obligation and growing demands overstretch infrastructure and natural resource base. Besides harnessing better population potential, emphasis on slowing population growth is likely to generate significant gains in coming decades.  Governance and institutions. Over the last 10 years, institutional reforms have helped establish regulators and NADRA (that has helped reduce transaction costs through issuance of IDs etc.), unbundled power sector, building capacities for public: private partnership in infrastructure development etc. According to the World Bank’s Report on Doing Business 2008, Pakistan ranked at 76th position out of 178 countries in terms of ease in doing business and placed at 11th position amongst Asian economies.  Supported by these reforms and capital inflows, Pakistan’s investment rate, which has hovered around 18%, has now risen by almost 5 percentage points to 23% in FY07. Encouragingly, public investment has also risen from 3.9% of GDP in FY03 to 5.2% of GDP by FY07. Enhanced resource mobilization would be key to maintaining momentum for growth in public investment.                                                  2  The average tariff rate has declined from 56% in 1994 to around 7.6% by 2007. The decline in the tariff led to a significant increase in trade volumes (correspondingly the trade to GDP ratio has risen from 25 percent in FY00 to 33 percent in FY07). 3  In time, the fiscal reforms led to a sustained reduction in the debt to GDP burden (92.9 as % of GDP in FY00 to 57.7% by FY07). 4 BIS Review 33/2008 
Current challenges. Pakistan is at a critical cross road. On one hand, there are achievements to be recounted. The country’s smooth, though protracted, transition to democracy and the preceding few years’ economic performance that managed to excite foreign interest in Pakistan lends us confidence that Pakistan has strong economic potential and can attract global capital. On the other hand, there remain key economic risks and challenges that the country faces. Unless addressed holistically these could threaten economic prospects; a luxury Pakistan can ill-afford given the geopolitical context and the emerging global challenges.  Re-emergence of twin deficits has complicated monetary management. Borrowings from SBP induce expansion in reserve money and Government’s high recourse to banking system potentially crowds out private sector credit. These complications introduce volatility in overnight and other interest rates weaken the monetary policy transmission mechanism and hurts investment potential.  Growing demand for goods and services, both from domestic sources and from abroad has helped domestic industry, but has also enhanced import reliance. Over FY03-07, import growth (including oil) averaged 24.7% outpacing export growth (13.4%) leading to a widening external current account deficit. During this period, capital inflows funded fully the external current account deficit and the residual helped in building foreign exchange reserves (growing by $5.6 billion over FY03-07). Even if oil prices fall and foreign inflows are restored, sustainability of external account will remain under stress as export growth may be impacted by the global slowdown. Containing both the external and the fiscal account imbalances is one of the challenges for the government.  Solutions, strategy and structural reforms: future agenda. So what is the solution in this situation? The answer is to conduct counter-cyclical policies to curb demand pressures by dealing with the root cause of deficits; the sustainable and enduring solution is not only how to finance these deficits but more importantly how to introduce structural changes to reduce these deficit in a sustainable manner, while reflecting on approaches to meet the country’s development requirements.  To resolve macroeconomic imbalances on a sustainable basis and meet the growing development requirements, there is need to as high priority focus on enhancing national saving rate, which is a basic ingredient to increase the productive capacity (possible only through well sequenced structural reforms) of the economy to match rising demand. Saving rate has now been historically low and a combination of policies including a country wide campaign through incentives can help encourage savings. This among others requires to maintain high and stable real interest rate, which given the current high inflationary environment is only possible with high nominal interest rates. In turn, a higher production level in the economy will encourage more savings. The challenge in this context is to remain vigilant about controlling consumption through counter cyclical policies.  Recognizing the need to bring the twin deficits within sustainable levels and to increase national savings, the new Government will need to strengthen the Medium-Term Macroeconomic Stabilization Program and front load it, while accelerating the implementation of structural reforms. These steps will be crucial to re-invigorate growth and strengthen economic resilience. Keeping this in perspective, the Government’s broader economic strategy for the next few years will need to include: i. Increasing domestic resource mobilization to raise revenue/GDP ratio by at least 5 percentage points of GDP. This is possible given the scope for enlargement of tax base, removal of exemptions and further strengthening of tax administration. The existing tax regime collects almost 68% of taxes from manufacturing and corporate sector, while agriculture and services sectors (aside from banks) are exempt and some segments of the economy are outside the tax net.  BIS Review 33/2008 5 
ii. Restricting large proportion of new resource mobilized for public investment, while prioritizing the recurrent expenditures through a major overhauling of the Government machinery. iii. Restoring the momentum of privatization of state-owned enterprises, which has been one of the most successful in Asia. The Government has sold off cumulatively almost $7 billion of assets over FY2000-FY2008 and there are around 61 state entities in the pipeline.  iv. Providing more autonomy to public sector organizations, with effective leadership and management, to improve their operational and financial efficiencies accompanied by a program to strengthen their balance sheets which should allow them to graduate from budgetary allocations to seeking funding from the market.  v. And raising private investment/GDP from 23% to at least 28% which involves significant tapping of additional resources both from domestic and international financial markets. To address the structural weaknesses that are inhibiting Pakistan’s long term growth there is need for: (i) Exploiting agriculture sector, a key driver for economy, to regain food self sufficiency. Conserving agriculture land and dealing with land holding and entitlement issues so that area under cultivation can be expanded, removing infrastructural bottlenecks (such as inconsistent water availability) and promoting right technology as well as research and development, and strengthening wholesale and retail markets will help improve food availability at a time when global food scenario is worrisome. Greater food production will help cater for rising demand both within Pakistan due to the growing population and its prosperity and outside particularly in the Middle Eastern bloc, India and China.  (ii) Development of a diversified industrial sector is now urgent to cater for both domestic and external demand. Private sector has to be provided the right incentive and environment for promoting the required diversification. For promoting industry, there is need to broaden and deepen private equity and debt markets – this will help diversify financial sector too which is exclusively dependent on the banking system that carries its own attendant risks. Closely held companies should be encouraged to move more and more to capital markets and to examine opportunities for mergers and acquisition and to attract foreign investment to achieve scale and efficiencies.  (iii) Instead of focusing on ad hoc subsidies that reach largely the profitable industry, it is best to design incentives to focus on ensuring adequate supply of infrastructure. All new funding, be it taxes or proceeds mobilized from the privatization of infrastructure should henceforth be kept in a separate account and this funding should be exclusively dedicated for developing infrastructure in dedicated industrial sites. For modernization of the industry, SBP and the Government is already focusing on provision of right incentives for import of plant and machinery. These measures will help industrial the sector’s ability to compete effectively and achieve an organic and natural growth. Scope for exports is significant only if the industry achieves scale, value addition, diversity, and develops information technology and outsourced businesses from the West. (iv) Foreign investment would receive a further impetus if the legal system is overhauled to ensure elimination of cumbersome procedures, effective enforcement of property rights and business contracts and availability of timely justice.  In conclusion, Pakistan has an opportunity to draw lessons from past. Among others listed above, a key lesson is need for effective implementation of reform agenda, though there is a case for launching second generation reforms to strengthen the governance of country and institutions which matter in implementation, but cannot be achieved without further 6 BIS Review 33/2008 
institutional reforms. Commitment in addressing the issues and focusing on reforms can go a long way in creating an environment that is conducive to productive economic activity, business friendly environment, and social cohesion. BIS Review 33/2008 7 
Christian Noyer: Is inflation set for a comeback? Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, at Deutsche Bank, Paris, 19 March 2008. *      *      * With inflation surging everywhere, it is quite natural to wonder if we could have reached the end of this worldwide era of “great moderation” in both output and price volatility which has characterized Alan Greenspan’s tenure of office. True, one could argue that we are just experiencing one-off shocks in commodity and food prices whose inflationary consequences will wane rapidly thanks to the increased flexibility of our economies. But other possible scenarios are more worrying. Second-round effects could, after years of relatively well contained wages, be triggered by shifts in inflation expectations; through the catching-up of developing economy, the globalisation process could have become inflationary; the ageing of our developed European economy, the necessary fight against global warming could structurally add inflationary pressures,.... and the room for monetary policy decisions could be restricted by the state of the financial and banking system and by the risks of slowdown of growth.  I would like to review these issues. In order to avoid any misunderstanding let me immediately make my point. Even if it is clear that inflationary pressures have both increased and changed in their nature, I firmly believe that monetary policy can still ensure price stability, over the medium term. My central scenario for the short term is a scenario where after a couple of months inflation will recede in the euro area and come back “below but close to 2%” in accordance with our definition of price stability. It is not unusual to witness commodity and consumer prices acceleration in the initial phase of an economic slowdown, as there is some inertia in employment and commodity prices dynamics with respect to activity. This has happened previously at the end of the 1990s, with a subsequent moderation in inflation. In the short run, recent inflationary shocks are likely to maintain inflation at a high level for most of 2008 as we may expect a significant degree of persistence in energy, industrial commodity or some food price increases (such as meat). In the euro area, HICP inflation has reached 3.3% in February. It might remain well above 2% in the coming months but ebbs later this year according to ECB staff forecasts. These projections rely on a scenario of global economic slowdown and moderation in commodity prices, which would contain pressures on capacity utilisation in the labour and product markets. They are all the more credible than we do not see at this juncture a major diffusion of price increases: less than 30% of the consumption basket (energy and food) are responsible for more than 60% of the overall increase.  There are nevertheless some upside risks to these projections. First, further shocks on food and commodity prices cannot be ruled out. On the demand side, should emerging countries decouple to a large extend from the United States, their contributions would then be sufficient to maintain a significant pace of commodity prices growth. On the supply side, unexpected climate or geopolitical disruptions may lead to shocks on production, as in the past few years. On top of both factors, in the current context of raising inflation and troubled financial markets, commodities attract a growing part of investment, speeding up sometimes rather artificially their price increases.  Second, the triggering of possible second round effects is a well known source of concern for the Governing Council of the ECB. The common desire of firms and households to offset BIS Review 32/2008 1 
profit margin and purchasing power losses stemming from inflationary shocks may lead to a wage-inflation spiral, ending in deteriorated output prospects and welfare losses to all parties. One should however note that nothing significant has materialised at this juncture. On the contrary, remunerations have remained well in line with productivity gains with, to take an example, reference wages increasing by 0.3% in France during the fourth quarter of last year.  From this point of view, protracted shocks to food and commodity prices put the anchoring of inflation expectations and the credibility of monetary policy to the test. The recent upward trend in European household and market expectations may be of some concern. However, as emphasised in a forthcoming issue of the Banque de France monthly Bulletin1, which is entirely devoted to various inflation related issues, currently available measures of inflation expectations appear crude and limited in terms of information content to explain short run wage formation or consumption dynamics. In practice, the Eurosystem has a prudent and comprehensive approach when considering private agents’ inflation expectations. While taking into account a large range of expectations indicators, the Governing Council does not react to them mechanistically. A firm anchoring of inflation expectations is nevertheless crucial in order to take up the challenges coming from the new inflationary environment. Among the long-run evolutions that can be expected with a high degree of certainty, the changing impact of globalisation on inflation, population ageing and climate change constitute threats to price stability and major new challenges for monetary policy. First, globalisation may turn out to be more inflationary in the future than in its early phase.  This was one of the issues addressed in the recent international symposium of the Banque de France. For over ten years, with the growing integration of our economies, powerful forces, throughout the world, have been acting to enhance price stability. Each year, the integration of millions of people into the world labour market has increased global production capacity, in particular for tradable goods. For monetary policy in developed countries, this process has been equivalent to a sequence of positive supply shocks that took the form of a spontaneous decline in the import price of manufactured goods. All other things being equal, this terms-of-trade gain has allowed for a lower inflation rate for a given capacity utilisation rate. More fundamentally, and although things seem to be less straightforward in this area, it is possible that the increasing openness of our economies have structurally changed the wage and cost formation process in a manner that favours price stability. It is clear that heightened competition triggered by imports reduces the market power of firms at the national level. But, other more indirect effects are also detectable. According to studies carried out at the Banque de France, to be published in our next Monthly Bulletin2, the disinflationary impact of imports appears to be relatively independent of import volumes: the mere existence of potential competition renders the markets, in the words of experts, more “contestable” and influences behavioural patterns. These disinflationary forces are still present. However, there are now other more powerful forces that have the opposite effect.                                                        1  V.Chauvin, D.Irac, N.Maggiar et H.Poncet, « L’information apportée par les anticipations d’inflation sur les salaires et la consommation dans la zone euro » ; J.Coffinet et S.Frappa, « Anticipations d’inflation dans la zone euro : que nous disent les marchés financiers ? » ; J.Coffinet et J.S.Mesonnier, « Anticipations d’inflation du secteur privé et conduite de la politique monétaire »  2  S.Guilloux et E.Kharroubi, « L’impact des prix d’importations sur l’inflation domestique. Le rôle de la structure des échanges ». 2 BIS Review 32/2008 
First, a natural process of real appreciation of currencies in catching-up economies is taking place, leading to upward pressures on the prices of their imports. Along with the catching-up in terms of standard of living, the level of prices in emerging countries tends to converge to the level of advanced countries through a combination of appreciating currency and higher inflation. Although somewhat hampered by exchange rate policies in the past decade, it seems to gather speed now with, as an example, the most needed faster appreciation of the Renmibi and at the same time accelerating inflation in China. This process will affect import prices of manufactured goods in developed economies.  Second, the growth of emerging market economies and the rise in the living standards of their populations are also leading to a surge in the demand for natural resources, food and energy, which logically has a strong and permanent impact on inflation. Furthermore, by strengthening the magnitude of global shocks in relation to more specifically domestic shocks and favouring the international transmission of the latter, globalisation introduces a much greater synchronisation of inflationary cycles between countries, with the ensuing risks of amplification.  Overall, the effects of globalisation have ceased – probably in the long term – to be spontaneously disinflationary. Other factors will add to the inflationary pressures in the medium to long run. Without elaborating too long on them today, I want to mention in particular population ageing and climate change. The ageing of the population will lead to a significant increase in public spending, for retirement pensions and health expenditure. At the same time, the growth in public indebtedness during the past twenty years will require an adjustment at some point. Both issues will lead to a mix of economic policy decisions and there may be a conflict between firms and employees about the final burden sharing, with risks of a wage-inflation spiral.  Climate change could also have both a direct impact on prices, through disruptions in production, and an indirect impact, through policy measures to curb down carbon dioxide emissions.  Climate change, through unusual weather outcome – temperature, rain or unusual seasonality – or disasters, would disturb climate sensitive productions such as food products or electricity (e.g. hydroelectric energy). Scarcity of these products would then lead to temporary overshooting in their prices. Measures to curb down carbon dioxide emissions will have a direct impact on prices through increases of indirect taxes and an indirect impact through the necessary adjustment of the production process. This adjustment will involve heightened tensions on production capacities, as part of the equipment stock will have to be discarded due to changing regulations or due to increases in its operating costs with higher taxes. Some temporary impact on inflation may therefore be expected during this process. However, in the medium run, the challenge of climate change may lead to a significant improvement in technological progress, which will lead a minima to reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for a given level of output but could also stimulate productivity growth. This inflationary impact highlighted before would then be offset both by downward pressures on energy prices and by productivity acceleration. *  * * As we can see from this rapid review of risks factors to inflation in the short to the long run, there is a clear upward bias to risks regarding inflation, which has to be taken into account by economic policy. BIS Review 32/2008 3 
It is thus all the more necessary to insure a proper degree of competition on product markets and a well-functioning price system, inducing changes in consumption or production patterns according to the relative scarcity of products. There are large margins of improvement with respect to product market competition both in emerging and advanced countries. In the euro area, the fulfilment of the Lisbon agenda objectives could have a significant offsetting impact. Higher employment rates and acceleration in productivity would lead to both less inflation and higher growth. The low current employment rates of the younger and older workers provide a wide acceleration margin for European growth. The potential catching-up of information technology use in the Euro area would lead to a substantial increase in productivity growth. Both evolutions would significantly reduce the inflation content of growth and help contain inflationary pressures. However, most of the burden lies on central banks, as “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”. The current “two pillar” approach of the Governing Council with a crosschecking between the economic and the monetary analysis has, I believe, permitted us to deliver a stance of monetary policy which has been totally appropriate to the situation of the euro zone. The anchoring of inflation expectations at a level consistent with price stability, which is currently observed in the financial market, is therefore completely justified. The years to come will give to the central bankers the opportunity to demonstrate that these years of “great moderation” are not just the result of lucky circumstances but are largely due to an improved monetary policy framework. 4 BIS Review 32/2008 
Durmuş Yılmaz: Turkey beyond 2008 Speech by Mr Durmus Yılmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at the Annual Investment Conference "Turkey beyond 2008", organised by the Foreign Economic Relations Board (DEIK) and The Turkish-American Business Council (TAIK), New York, 17 March 2008. *      *      * Dear Guests, As you all may know, the Turkish economy used to experience boom-and-bust cycles throughout the 1990s. The economic crisis in 2001 was the low point of this period, when the economy contracted more than 5 percent. Since then, Turkey has put in place a very intense and ambitious structural reform agenda, coupled with sound monetary and fiscal policies, to establish macroeconomic and financial stability and to improve the business environment. Central Bank independence that was granted by Law in 2001 was one of the milestones of this agenda. The introduction of free-floating exchange rate regime in 2001 and inflation-targeting regime in 2002 were other key steps. The Central Bank of Turkey has also experienced a comprehensive institutional change towards a better communication policy and clearly defined accountability measures. We have experienced a significant disinflation process since 2001. The consumer price index came down from 68.5% in 2001 to 8.4% in 2007. I should call your attention to the fact that the list of countries that lowered inflation in 2007 was quite short, thanks to global inflationary pressures in food and other commodities. In fact, the average inflation around the world increased from 3.5 percent in 2006 to 4.8 percent in 2007 and to 5.5 percent in January 2008. In this environment Turkey was able to reduce inflation by 1.3 percentage points in 2007. In fact, this was the sharpest drop among 60 major developed and emerging countries.  The disinflation process is even more pronounced in core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. It stood at 4.36% as of February 2008. The favorable outlook in core inflation indicators despite the surge in energy and food prices has allowed the Central Bank to cut policy rates since September 2007. The cumulative rate cut reached to 225 basis points as of February 2008 bringing the overnight borrowing rate to 15.25% from 17.50%.  The timing of further easing depends on developments in global markets, demand conditions, fiscal policy performance and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook. According to the forecasts of our January 2008 Inflation Report, the year-end inflation may stay above the target in 2008, but within uncertainty band, due to factors outside the control of monetary policy such as energy and food prices. The mid-point of our forecast for 2008 is 5.5%, whereas the year-end target is 4%. However, inflation is forecasted to converge to the target in 2009 and come down to 1.8-5.5% range with 70% probability at the end of 2009.  At this point let me say a couple of words about fiscal policy of the last six years and fiscal discipline, which has also contributed much to the macroeconomic stability in Turkey. One of the main characteristics of the Turkish economy in the 1990s was high budget deficits, which was around 7% of GDP on the average. During the 2002-2007 period setting ambitious primary surplus targets and realizations of these targets, coupled with almost balanced budgets paved the way for significantly improved debt dynamics. Even before recent upward revisions in GDP figures, Turkey easily met the Maastricht criteria for the budget deficit and debt stock. According to most recent data, the ratio of net government debt to GDP has come down to 29%, whereas budget deficit is less than 2%. Dear Guests, BIS Review 32/2008 1 
As you all know, financial system plays a key role in accumulation of savings and its distribution among productive sectors. Therefore, health and stability of a financial system is crucial for economic growth of a country. We attribute utmost importance to financial stability as a country that experienced deep financial crises in the past. Price stability is the primary objective of the Central Bank. But, we also regard financial stability as our auxiliary objective and monitor the system closely. The achievement on the inflation front has significantly improved the macroeconomic environment and eliminated the vulnerabilities that put burden on the proper functioning of the financial system. The Banking Sector Restructuring Program and other measures that were taken following the 2001 crisis, led to the formation of a very strong and resilient financial system. This contributed to the high growth rates achieved after the crisis. I can comfortably say that today the banking sector in Turkey compares well with those of new members of the European Union. The Banking Law enacted in 2005 is in line with the best international practices.  Asset size of the Turkish banking sector increased by more than three-folds in the last six years and reached USD 500 billion as of 2007. Still, there is a huge and unexplored potential in the sector taking into account the size of Turkey’s young population and low rate of credit utilization among households and private business. Capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of the banking sector stood at 18.8%, well above the minimum legal requirement of 8% and the average of the European Union, which is 12.1%. Short-term liquidity ratios comfortably meet the legal thresholds. Thanks to sound and resilient structure of the sector, foreign direct investment to the Turkish banking system has surged since 2005 and the share of foreign investors in the total capital of the sector is now more than 40%. Rather than financing government deficits, the banking sector has returned to its core function, which is being intermediary between borrowers and lenders. The ratio of total credits to total deposits, which is a proxy for the intermediation function of the banking sector, has increased almost two-folds since 2001 and reached to 80% as of 2007.  The strong growth performance of the Turkish economy may be considered as the fruit of these structural reforms, fiscal discipline, and cautious monetary policies of the last 6 years. Turkey has grown for 23 consecutive quarters since 2002 and has been one of the fastest growing countries in the world during this period. The real GDP has grown almost 50% on a cumulative basis in that period, bringing the average annual growth rate to 7%. This strong growth performance was private sector driven and supported by continuous productivity gains. Along with high economic growth, openness of Turkish economy has also increased substantially. Exports, which stood at only USD 31 billion as of 2001, increased by more than two-folds and reached to USD 107 billion in 2007. Dear Guests, There are four distinguishing characteristics of Turkey that set her apart from other emerging market countries.  First, unlike other countries in the Central and Eastern Europe region, Turkey has a young population, which is a demographic gift that could accelerate economic growth. Of course, having great potential does not guarantee success. Currently, the Turkish economy is utilizing less than half of its workforce. Improving the state of the labor market, removing rigid labor market regulations, reducing the tax wedge, and more importantly enhancing the human capital through education reforms are essential to accelerate the growth rate of the economy on a sustainable basis. Second, Turkey is a net commodity importer in contrast to Latin American countries and South Africa. We need to import in excess of 35 billion USD worth of oil and natural gas each year, almost 5% of our GDP. Looking at the composition of the foreign trade, you can see that our imports are mainly commodities and intermediate goods, whereas industrial goods cover more than 90% of our total exports. Therefore, promoting Turkey's competitiveness is the key to her future success. 2 BIS Review 32/2008 
Third, high domestic savings rate, which is high in emerging countries in Asia, is quite low in Turkey. It is around 20%. We need to attract foreign savings to finance investments. It is not surprising to observe a strong and direct positive relationship in Turkey between growth rate and current account deficit. Of course, the upward trend in energy prices has also contributed to the widening of the current account deficit to 5.8% in 2007. The current account deficit is a structural problem and a source of vulnerability. However, Turkey did not have difficulty in its financing in the last 6 years. In fact, the quality of foreign capital flows has improved sharply. The current account deficit can now be financed through foreign direct investments (FDI) and long-term capital inflows. The FDI inflows were in excess of USD 20 billion in each of the last two years, putting Turkey among the top 5 developing countries in FDI inflows.  Fourth, Turkey is one of the few countries with a “convergence story”. Negotiations with the European Union over the full membership status provide a major stimulus to policy makers to put Turkey’s huge potential into life and complete the reform agenda. This agenda consists of next generation policies and reforms that focus on removing structural bottlenecks and improving the economy’s capacity for labor absorption, innovation, and competitiveness.  Dear Guests, Turkey has had a heavy structural reform agenda since 2001. However, continuation of structural reforms is of vital importance for the sustainability of economic gains achieved in recent years and for the resilience of the economy to further shocks in the future. The most important structural reform in the pipeline is the social security reform that is expected to significantly improve Turkey’s fiscal balances in the medium and long term. It is also expected to contribute to our domestic savings rate. Other prominent steps that should be taken include reducing the size of the unregistered economy and broadening the tax base, reforming the labor market to increase job creation and bringing the business environment to a level on par with international competition, re-designing the education system in order to make it consistent with labor demand and to raise the quality of labor force, privatizing the energy market and ensuring energy supply security. These steps together with macroeconomic stability will undoubtedly make Turkey a more competitive country in the international arena.  Looking ahead, our main goals are to achieve and sustain price stability and economic growth. Prerequisites are macroeconomic stability, structural reforms and adherence to good governance principles both in public and private institutions. We recognize that economic growth at the expense of price stability cannot be permanent. Together with the EU anchor in place, we are moving decisively to become a trillion USD economy. Thank you.

Lucas Papademos: Eurosystem and Bank of Russia cooperation programme Introductory statement by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of launching the Eurosystem and Bank of Russia cooperation programme on banking supervision and internal audit, Moscow, 20 March 2008. *      *      * It is a pleasure for me to be here in Moscow today, together with my esteemed colleague First Deputy Chairman Melikyan of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and His Excellency Ambassador Marc Franco, Head of the Delegation of the European Commission to Russia.  I would first like to thank First Deputy Chairman Melikyan for his kind opening remarks and all those who have contributed to the organisation of this ceremony. I would also like to greet the representatives of the eight national central banks of the Eurosystem who accompany me here today, marking their strong institutional commitment to and support for this cooperation programme: the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Bank of Greece, the Banco de España, the Banca d’Italia, the Banque de France, De Nederlandsche Bank, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank and the Suomen Pankki-Finlands Bank. Today, we are taking a further step that advances the increasingly close cooperation between the Bank of Russia and the Eurosystem, by signing a protocol which accompanies the contract for the Eurosystem cooperation programme with the Bank of Russia that was signed by Ambassador Franco earlier today. Over the past few months, the staff of our institutions have been in very close contact, preparing together the terms of the contract and finding appropriate solutions to a rather diverse set of challenges. I would like to ask you, Mr Chairman, to extend our warmest thanks to the staff of the Bank of Russia for their efforts to address all pertinent issues.  The new three-year cooperation programme will start on 1 April and will focus on banking supervision and internal audit. In the area of banking supervision, the Eurosystem will support the Bank of Russia in its gradual implementation of the internationally accepted principles of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that are commonly known as the Basel II framework. The financial market turmoil that emanated from the US subprime mortgage crisis has highlighted, among other things, the importance of transparency and of sophisticated and effective risk management standards and practices in banks. The Basel II framework provides an advanced approach to capital measurement and capital standards. It represents the regulatory response to the increasingly complex and globally integrated financial markets, where credit risks are often passed from the originators of bank loans to a wide range of investors, instead of remaining on the books of the originating banks. Indeed, the Basel II framework was conceived to support banks in the implementation of advanced risk management standards with the overall aim of improving the stability and soundness of the financial system in all the economies around the world. Within the European Union, we have gathered extensive experience with the implementation of Basel II which we are happy to share. As part of this cooperation programme, experts on banking supervision from the Eurosystem will travel to Moscow and support the Bank of Russia’s internal work on implementing Basel II. With regard to the internal audit component of the cooperation programme, the Eurosystem will offer its expertise and advice on risk-based internal audit methods and best practices. The objective of this cooperation with the Bank of Russia is to enhance the capacity of the Chief Auditor’s Service to carry out risk-based internal audits. In today’s world, central banks also need modern and sophisticated internal audit procedures. Risk-based internal audits provide, on the basis of a risk analysis, assurance on the proper functioning of central bank BIS Review 32/2008 1 
activities, especially on those aspects where the risks are highest, rather than performing a less differentiated, simple compliance audit. Such a risk-based approach represents, in our view, the appropriate response to the challenges faced by the internal audit services and we are pleased to share our experience in this field. During this part of the project, Eurosystem experts will train about 350 Bank of Russia experts on internal audit.  In the implementation of this cooperation programme, we will employ a coordinated “Eurosystem approach” which involves the ECB and a number of national central banks of the euro area. This formula, which was conceived for the first Eurosystem cooperation programme with the Bank of Russia on banking supervision, was successfully implemented between 2003 and 2005. Over the coming 33 months, the ECB and the national central banks that I mentioned earlier will be working closely with the Bank of Russia on the programme. The project will be coordinated by a team consisting of Ms Gulsana Barpiyeva, from the Deutsche Bundesbank, who will be the Eurosystem project coordinator in Moscow, Mr Christian Fehlker, the Eurosystem team leader for banking supervision, and Mr Lukasz Kubicki, the Eurosystem team leader for internal audit. The project will be managed by an ECB team in Frankfurt. The expertise on the implementation of the Basel II framework and the risk-based internal audit practices will be provided by the national central banks and the ECB’s Internal Audit Department. In the context of this programme, Bank of Russia experts will have the opportunity to visit their colleagues in EU countries.  Russia and the European Union are important partners. One key aspect of the partnership is the overall objective of the European Union and the Russian Federation to enhance the regulation, supervision and governance of financial markets in Russia. This should contribute to improving the investment climate and supporting closer economic relations between the EU and Russia. We very much appreciate the assistance of the European Commission in giving substance to this aim, as this cooperation programme is supported by the Delegation of the European Commission to Russia with a budget of €3 million. I can assure you, Ambassador Franco, that we look forward to continuing the successful cooperation with you and your staff that we had during the previous project. I would also like to thank you and your collaborators for having supported the preparations and for your help in handling a number of technical, administrative and legal issues. Sound practices in the fields of banking supervision and internal audit are important not only for the effective performance of the tasks of a central bank, but also because they contribute to the efficient and stable functioning of the financial system that benefits the economy as a whole. We have noted with great interest the reform efforts of Chairman Ignatiev and his team in the Bank of Russia over the past years. With this programme, the Eurosystem hopes to contribute to further strengthening the Bank of Russia’s banking supervision and internal audit functions. Allow me to conclude by expressing my confidence that the implementation of this programme will be characterised by the close and constructive cooperation between the Eurosystem and the Bank of Russia, as well as with the Delegation of the European Commission to Moscow. Za nashe sotrudnichestvo! Thank you very much for your attention. 2 BIS Review 32/2008 
BIS Review 31/2008 1 Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: The international role of the euro and its potential in Latin America Keynote speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the conference “The Euro: Global Implications and Relevance for Latin America”, São Paulo, 17-18 March 2008. *   *   * Ladies and Gentlemen, During our lunch I would like to share with you some brief reflections on the international dimension of Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU. The title of my presentation has an additional part: “and its potential for Latin America”. I am not sure that I should be the one to assess the potential for the euro in Latin America; I should perhaps let a Latin American audience decide for itself. As you know, the policy of the ECB is neither to encourage nor to discourage the use of the euro. What I would prefer to do today is to examine the main lessons that can be drawn from the ten years of experience with Monetary Union, lessons that may also be of interest for the rest of the world, in particular Latin America. I will be very concise and selective, given the time constraints. I will thus focus on the main issues that I think deserve some attention and will inevitably leave aside important aspects that may be taken up later in the discussion. I will focus on five main lessons that I would draw from the first ten years of the euro and discuss a few issues that are currently being debated in Europe and may be of relevance to Latin America, in particular for its policy-makers. Let me start with the lessons. The first lesson that can be drawn from the last ten years is the importance for an economy like the euro area of having its own monetary policy. This seems self-evident, but it is not always the case. We currently see around the world many important countries and economies that have actually chosen not to have their own monetary policy. Consider for instance the case of China, other Asian emerging markets, the Gulf countries, or Russia. By making the exchange rate the main target for their policies they have de facto given up their monetary policy and have imported monetary conditions prevailing in the country whose currency they are targeting, most often the United States. Given that underlying economic conditions in the United States will surely be different from those prevailing in these other countries, the monetary conditions that the latter will import are unlikely to be the most conducive to sustainable growth. Giving up the ability to conduct monetary policy is bound sooner or later to give rise to internal instability. Just as an illustration, an economy growing at 10% per year with inflation rising towards 10% cannot afford nominal interest rates of 5%, even less 3 or 2%. We now know the problems that low interest rates for a protracted period of time can produce.  Ten years of EMU suggest that it is possible – it is actually desirable – for the major economies of the world to have their own monetary policy, attuned to their internal conditions and targeted at domestic objectives.  This first lesson doesn’t seem to be wholly understood by all observers. In particular, some financial market participants and commentators are at times led to think that central banks are more or less bound to act in a similar way. In fact, in the last few months the various central banks have acted quite differently, precisely because of the different situations prevailing in their respective economies. Some have decreased rates, others have kept their rates unchanged and others have actually increased rates. The world economy is becoming more integrated but at the same time also more affected by idiosyncratic shocks and diverging starting conditions, which may at times require different responses from the policy-makers around the world.  
2 BIS Review 31/2008 The second lesson is that price stability should be the primary objective of monetary policy. This is now enshrined in the statutes of most central banks around the world, with the exception of the Federal Reserve System, whose mandate goes back to the end of the 1970s. Ten years of experience of EMU show that price stability can be ensured without sacrificing growth over the medium term. Comparing the last ten years with the ten years before EMU, we see that inflation has been lower, while growth has been broadly similar and employment growth, lately, much stronger. I will not dwell too much on this issue. It seems to me that recent developments confirm that having a clear primary objective, which is also well-defined in quantitative terms, is the best way to anchor market expectations and to ensure a smoother adjustment to external shocks, of a real or financial nature. The third lesson is that an independent central bank is essential to ensuring that the first two requirements I have just mentioned are met. It strengthens the credibility of monetary policy aimed at price stability and therefore enables relatively lower interest rates to be maintained.  Central bank independence has many elements; the personal and institutional aspects are two of the most important. If monetary policy is to be conducted with a view to the medium term, rather than in reaction to very short-term developments, security of tenure for a relatively long time – in the case of the ECB’s Executive Board, for instance, the non-renewable term is eight years – is quite relevant. It helps the decision-makers to set monetary policy independently of the political cycle.1 In theory, central bank independence tends to be taken for granted. In practice, as the European experience shows, it may be challenged even when the statutes of the central bank are enshrined in a constitutional framework. The support of the people for the independence of the central bank and for the objective of price stability is additional protection against any attempt to undermine independence. In all the countries of the euro area, the support of public opinion for these two things is very strong. The fourth lesson is that clarity about the role of monetary policy also helps to clarify the role of other policies, in particular fiscal and structural policy.  With respect to fiscal policy, there is now a consensus that fiscal discipline is essential, not only in a monetary union but also in individual countries, to ensure room for manoeuvre for an anticyclical budget, be it discretionary or automatic. The Stability and Growth Pact and the 3% and 60% limits on a country’s deficit and debt in the Treaty establishing the European Community have now also found a broad application in macroeconomic surveillance in other continents.  Experience shows that countries that have complied with the requirements of the Pact, in particular by maintaining a sound budgetary position in good times, have a wider margin to absorb the negative effects of an economic slowdown. Those countries which instead delay the adjustment are certain to face the next slowdown with much greater anxiety, with negative effects on consumer and investor confidence. The main instrument for enhancing long-term economic growth and employment is structural policy. This has become universally recognised in the EU. The Lisbon process enables structural policies and their results across countries to be compared, on the basis of a simple set of indicators. This has the advantage of focusing discussions within the individual countries on policies that are necessary for growth.  Some results have been achieved. For instance, the structural rate of unemployment has decreased substantially in most countries, following labour market reforms. Overall, some 13                                                  1  See L. Bini Smaghi (2008): “Central Bank Independence in the EU: From Theory to Practice”, European Law Journal, forthcoming. 
BIS Review 31/2008 3 million jobs have been created since the introduction of the euro, against less than 3 million in the previous decade. However, much needs to be done in the labour and product markets, especially in the services sector, to permanently increase productivity in the euro area. Overall, it can easily be seen in Europe that the countries which have implemented the most far reaching reforms have also performed better over the years. A similar comparison in other countries or areas of the world could help to clarify the responsibilities of the various policies in achieving sustainable growth.  The last lesson that I would like to draw to your attention is that EMU in Europe is much more than a monetary union, it’s in fact a political union. The sharing of the same currency has implications for citizens that go beyond what we as economists are used to considering. It entails implicit contractual relations which have a direct impact on citizens’ day-to-day decisions. Furthermore, policy-making structures in the euro area have become much more intertwined not only in relation to monetary policy but also to budgetary policy.  This issue would require much more time to discuss in detail and is not always fully understood, partly because the form that political union has taken in the euro area, and in the EU more generally, is quite unique, evolving over time in a way that does not correspond to other political unions around the world. To be sure, the issue has not been understood by those observers, in particular in the financial markets, who consider leaving the euro area a viable policy option. As Barry Eichengreen recently showed in a paper, the way the euro area has been constructed and developed means that any exit would entail not only economic but also political consequences so as to make it nearly impossible.2 The fact that the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark will enter the euro area only when their people agree to such a decision is further confirmation that EMU is indeed a political union. The five lessons that I have mentioned help to explain why the euro has emerged as the second world currency in just about ten years. I will not provide you with the data illustrating these developments. They can be obtained from the regular ECB publication on the international role of the euro.3 The developments of the last ten years provide us not only with lessons but also with issues that remain open and pose challenges to policy-makers. Let me illustrate three. A first issue concerns the impact that a new international currency has on the functioning, and in particular the stability, of the international financial system. This is an issue on which the literature has so far said very little. In theory, one could think that a world with several reserve currencies would be more stable, because it would confer more opportunities on international investors and would impose greater discipline on policy-makers. However, recent events tend to confirm that relying on markets alone to discipline policy-makers and to allocate funds efficiently across borders might not be always optimal. In certain circumstances markets might tend to overreact and overshoot with respect to underlying economic fundamentals. In particular, the portfolio adjustment in a phase of transition characterised by several currencies acquiring international status might be quite disorderly. This might have negative effects on the world economy. It requires close monitoring and coordination by monetary authorities of the major economies. A second issue, which is constantly discussed in the euro area but also in other countries, centres on what the relationship between an independent central bank and other policy-makers should be in order to ensure a consistent overall economic policy. This issue relates                                                  2  See B. J. Eichengreen (2007): "The Breakup of the Euro Area", NBER Working Paper No. 13393. See also B. J. Eichengreen (2008): "Sui Generis EMU", NBER Working Paper No. 13740, on the unique features of EMU compared with past monetary unions. 3  See ECB (2007): Review of the international role of the euro, June, available at www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2007/html/pr070625.en.html. 
4 BIS Review 31/2008 to a number of areas and policies. In Europe the problem tends to become more complicated because some policies, such as fiscal and structural policies, are conducted at the national level while others, such as trade or antitrust policy, are conducted at the European Union level, not that of the euro area alone.  The euro area has in many respects a very strong policy framework, often underestimated. The relationship between monetary and budgetary policy is quite similar to that of most countries with an independent central bank, where there is no ex ante coordination between policies. There is an exchange of information, in particular on the state of the economy, but no trade-offs. This is the case in most industrial countries. On exchange rate policy I believe that, as I have argued elsewhere, the euro area arrangements are good, as they involve both the finance ministries and the central bank.4 In most other countries the central bank, which has the technical expertise over financial markets and is in charge of interest rate policy, is not involved or tends to get involved too late in the process, which may make things more complicated and risk undermining the credibility of any statement or action.  In the area of external representation, too, some clarity has been achieved as to who is responsible for representing the euro area, at least within the G7 and other groupings. Some confusion still remains in fora such as the G20, where it is the EU rather than the euro area that participates. In the IMF there is still no consolidation of the euro area members within one seat, something which to my mind will have to take place sooner or later.  On financial stability, the situation of the euro area is quite unusual, as the ECB has no direct responsibility for banking supervision. The situation is also varies within Eurosystem: in some countries the central bank has direct responsibility for supervising the domestic system, while in others this responsibility is given to another institution. The recent turmoil has shown the importance of keeping central banks closely involved with issues related to the proper functioning of financial markets. Furthermore, the increasing integration of the EU financial market requires close cooperation between supervisors, from a more harmonised implementation of regulation to an effective exchange of information on markets and institutions, and the creation an efficient crisis resolution framework. Work on these issues is ongoing in Europe and will need to be further strengthened.  To conclude, as a last issue for discussion, we have in the euro area, as well as in other countries, a major challenge involving all policy-makers. It is to explain and help our citizens adapt to globalisation. Globalisation has produced many positive effects on our societies but is quite challenging for some social groups. In particular, the recent increases in food and energy prices are biting into the purchasing power of households, especially those at the lower end of the income distribution. These effects come on top of others that have developed over the years, which have squeezed the income of those employed in sectors with low value added.  I do not want to enter now into the debate of what is the best way forward. I will just mention that in Europe we have a further difficulty, i.e. that the euro has been introduced at the same time as globalisation has accelerated its effects. This has led some to confuse the effects of globalisation with those associated with the introduction of the euro. For instance, perceived inflation is in some countries higher than measured inflation, and some attribute this effect to the euro, even though over six years have passed since the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins.                                                   4  See L. Bini Smaghi (2007): “The euro as an international currency: implications for exchange rate policy”, remarks at the conference “50 years after the Treaty of Rome: strengthening the economic leg of EMU”, Rome, 2-3 July 2007. 
BIS Review 31/2008 5 Overall, euro area citizens have had to go through a series of adjustments in the last few years, which might have created a sense of confusion. This requires greater unity among policy-makers in the euro area, and less blaming of Europe and the euro – as has been the case in the past – in order to help our citizens adjust and recover confidence in the new environment.  The irony for somebody like me who travels frequently around the world is to notice that the benefits of the euro tend to be much more appreciated outside than within the euro area!

BIS Review 31/2008 1 John Gieve: Sovereign wealth funds and global imbalances Speech by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, to the Sovereign Wealth Management Conference, London, 14 March 2008. *  *  * Introduction Much of the debate on sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) has focused on political questions: do they reintroduce the failings of public ownership into market economies by the back door, will SWFs use their ownership rights to pursue political ends, and will resistance to foreign ownership lead to a new wave of protectionism. I want to concentrate today on some economic issues: why have they become so prominent recently, how does that relate to imbalances in the world economy, how are they affecting financial markets and what are the policy implications of their growth.  Background But first let me set out some of the background. There is no off the shelf definition of an SWF. What I have in mind is a government investment vehicle that manages foreign assets with a higher risk tolerance and higher expected returns than for central bank foreign currency reserves.1 The size of such funds is hard to measure, but may be in the $2-3 trillion range. Origins of SWFs Investments by SWFs are one type of capital flow between countries so they have always been closely related to global imbalances in trade. When countries run surpluses on their current account, they generate equal and opposite net capital outflows of one sort or another and those capital flows produce an investment income.  That has been the story of the UK economy over the last 150 years. We ran continuous surpluses in the 50 years before the first world war (Chart 1) and built up a large stock of foreign assets. Partly as a result of that, we benefited from a surplus on our investment account for most of the period since the 1870s.  There are two key differences between that period of the UK’s investment abroad and the situation today. 100 years ago the developed countries were investing in emerging markets (at the time in the Americas and Australia) which had abundant land and natural resources but scarce capital and so the returns were high. Currently, capital is flowing “uphill” from emerging to mature economies. Secondly, the investors before were mainly in the private sector and were seeking out the best returns on capital. Today the investors are mainly EME central banks and governments and the build up of foreign assets reflects their policy choices.                                                   1  There is some fuzziness at the edges of this definition. Central bank reserves in some countries, which traditionally have been invested mainly in liquid and safe instruments, are increasingly being switched into riskier assets. Also, in some countries, state-owned banks and companies invest in foreign assets where some of the policy issues are the same as for sovereign wealth funds. 
2 BIS Review 31/2008 Modern sovereign wealth funds are not new, in fact the first – the Kuwait Investment Office – was set up here in London in February 1953 – just as Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were setting out to climb Everest.2 And the number of funds has been increasing since then like the traffic on the slopes of Everest.  The next wave were set up by other oil producers after the price increases in the 70s and 80s for persuasive reasons (Chart 2). First oil is a non-renewable resource so it can make sense for governments to spread the benefits of this endowment across generations by investing part of today’s income in assets that will provide an income tomorrow. That would be so even if the path of oil prices was predictable but in fact it is not. That uncertainty about future income provides a second case for saving today. In the late 1970s, some oil exporters increased spending to match higher incomes and faced a painful adjustment when prices fell back again. Third, even if the rise in income was permanent there would be a case for phasing the growth of domestic spending and investment to prevent supply bottlenecks leading to inflation.  Recent growth of SWFs Since the millennium at least 10 new SWFs have been set up and there are reports of plans for more for example in Brazil, Japan and India. This reflects the remarkable shift of emerging-market economies from debtors to creditors. Ten years ago – at the time of the Asian crisis – emerging markets as a whole were running a current account deficit. Since then they have been running progressively bigger current account surpluses reaching an estimated $685 billion last year (1.3 % of world GDP).3 The counterpart to this is that developed countries as a group have been running progressively bigger current account deficits not just in the United States but also in a number of other developed countries including the UK.4 Of course there are some notable exceptions in each group: Canada, Japan and Germany for example are still creditors while many countries in central and eastern Europe and Africa are running large deficits. But maps 1 and 2 show how much the pattern has changed in the last 10 years. Most of South America and South East Asia have swung from deficit to surplus. Perhaps as important, the scale of the differences has grown with more countries running surpluses or deficits of over 5% of GDP. Oil and other commodity inflation is part of the story, of course, but that does not account for the large current surpluses in most of East Asia. Here strong manufacturing growth resulting from higher labour productivity has not been matched by higher domestic spending so savings have grown ahead of even dramatic investment growth. A deliberate policy of fostering export industrial growth has slowed the rise of exchange rates that would reduce these imbalances. As a result the build-up in EME foreign assets have been held mainly as central bank reserves especially in Asian countries (Chart 3). In total the foreign assets now held by EME central banks and governments is about $7 trillion dollars, which compares with only $60 billion gross foreign assets held by the UK government. Many emerging economies concluded after the Asian crisis a decade ago that they needed bigger liquid reserves in traditional government debt to defend themselves against volatility in financial markets even when that carried the likelihood of a negative return (taking account of expected exchange                                                  2  The Kuwait Investment Office is the in-house investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Authority (formerly known as the Kuwait Investment Board) and was established by Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah on 23 February 1953.  Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the summit on 29 May 1953. 3   These figures include the NICs. Excluding NICs the estimated surplus is $596 billion (1.1%). 4  Latest data show that current account deficits were 5% of GDP or above not only in the United States but also in Spain, Greece, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand, UK and Iceland. 
BIS Review 31/2008 3 rate movements). But when the reserves outstripped the levels needed for that purpose, it was natural to look to increase the returns on investment by widening the range of investments.5  And in the next few years, these current account surpluses are likely to remain high and the build up of foreign assets by governments in oil exporting and Asian countries is likely to continue. According to the IMF’s forecasts, the combined current account surplus of China and oil-exporting countries will be around $800 billion over the next 3 years. And the IMF estimates that sovereign wealth fund assets could grow to $6-10 trillion within the next 5 years.  The impact of SWFs on financial markets These are huge numbers and SWFs have become prominent and important players in many financial markets. But we should not exaggerate their impact on the global financial system. In aggregate, their assets under management are currently only less than one-twentieth of those held by private sector participants such as pension, insurance and mutual funds as well as hedge funds and private equity (Chart 4). And they account for about 2% of the total size of equity and bond markets globally. Even in five years time – and on some of the fastest growth projections – assets under management by sovereign wealth funds are projected to reach only about 6% of global financial assets.6 Moreover, though they have more assets under management than hedge funds they have smaller investments since they are not leveraged.7  It is not difficult to identify positive effects on the world’s capital markets. Sovereign wealth funds have long investment horizons and generally have no commercial liabilities. Therefore, in periods of market stress they are likely to face less pressure than most private investors to reduce the size or increase the liquidity of their investments. They are well placed to play a contrarian role and help to stabilise markets by investing in times of stress. For example, when the global equity market fell sharply between 2000 and 2002, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund was a large buyer of global equities. And a number of sovereign wealth funds have played an important and welcome stabilising role during the current turmoil by providing around $40 billion of new capital since November to some of the world’s biggest commercial and investment banks (Table 1).8  Taking a broader view, the switch of some reserves from government debt into SWFs which invest in a wider range of instruments should help to improve the allocation of resources if these investments are based on commercial criteria. Investing in equities may also help to reinforce and bring to the surface the common interest that EMEs and the advanced economies have in the good performance of the companies involved and the markets they operate in. It may thus help to integrate EMEs into the global financial system and encourage them to participate more in global policy making.   From a parochial point of view, the prospective increase in demand for equities relative to bonds could have a positive impact on London and sterling. Whereas the value of the UK                                                  5  Foreign reserves held by EME central banks as a whole are about 60% (close to $3 trillion) higher than needed for conventional precautionary reasons to cover short-term external debt.  6  Morgan Stanley, "Sovereign Wealth Funds and Bond and Equity Prices", 31 May 2007. 7  That said, the assets held by sovereign wealth funds are highly concentrated, with around 70% of total assets held by the five largest funds. So the largest sovereign wealth funds could have an impact on some markets especially smaller ones such as other EMEs. 8  Also, a number of central banks from countries with large current account deficits have been willing throughout the current liquidity crisis to lend to international banks, including UK ones, at longer, three-to-twelve month, maturities. 
4 BIS Review 31/2008 market for public debt securities is only 3.3% of the global market, UK equities account for 7½% of the value of global equities. The rapid growth in sovereign wealth funds is also a fillip for London as a leading international financial centre.  SWFs and transparency The main doubts concern their objectives and how far their investments will be driven only by financial returns. Public sector owners might have other objectives including national political interests, such as, accessing military technology, controlling strategic resources or markets, and influencing public opinion.9 There are often complaints that sovereign wealth funds lack transparency. Decoded, this is a request for reassurance about their investment policies.  I am certainly not going to argue against more transparency (except in the very special case of the market operations of central banks). More openness from SWFs may help to alleviate concerns in recipient countries – and thus reduce protectionist pressures. And it may improve the dissemination of information to market participants and to their own citizens. I know many SWFs are working with the IMF to produce a voluntary code of conduct that is based on best practices for the governance and transparency of sovereign wealth funds. For example, it would be helpful if all sovereign wealth funds were transparent about their overall strategies, objectives and broad investment guidelines. Norway’s Government Pension Fund is a good example in this respect.  But there should be a level playing field applied to all investors. The case for greater transparency applies to other investors too. SWFs may take some comfort that they are not being singled out and that there are equally powerful pressures for transparency on hedge funds and private equity investors. In this respect, two recent initiatives are particularly welcome. First, a report under the chairmanship of Sir Andrew Large – my predecessor as Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank – on voluntary standards, including on disclosure, for hedge funds. And, second, a report by Sir David Walker – a former Executive Director of the Bank – on guidelines for disclosure and transparency by private equity funds.10  And transparency should not be one sided among countries. I know SWFs themselves are often keen for more transparency from recipient countries on whether and how far they are welcome and the rules of engagement. The UK in recent years has been unusually open to foreign investors and foreign ownership both in comparison to our past and in comparison to most other developed (and emerging) countries today. We have relied on regulation of infrastructure industries and on competition law to prevent the abuse of market power and most of our utilities, much of the financial sector, as well as an increasing number of our leading football clubs have come into foreign ownership. In its latest survey of international direct investment trends, the OECD ranked the UK as having one of the least restrictive regulatory environment for foreign direct investment across all OECD member countries (Chart 5). And the UK has welcomed a number of SWFs to London as a base for international operations.                                                   9  Note though that this distinction between foreign public and private sector owners is not cut and dried. Foreign private sector purchases of football teams or newspapers do not always seem to be driven by the profit motive. 10  Hedge Fund Working Group (2008), "Hedge Fund Standards: Final Report" and Walker Working Group (2007), "Guidelines for Disclosure and Transparency in Private Equity". The Large Report recommends a set of best practice standards for hedge funds in terms of disclosure, valuation, risk, governance and shareholder conduct. The Walker Report recommends a set of guidelines for disclosure and transparency by private equity funds, including the publication of regular information on their financing, ownership and prospects.  
BIS Review 31/2008 5 Sovereign wealth funds and global imbalances However, the emphasis on transparency and the politics of SWFs risks missing a bigger policy issue: the recent rapid growth in SWFs reflects large and persistent global imbalances which are a continuing threat to the stability of the world financial system and the global economy.  Global imbalances and financial crises While there are many examples of countries which have run deficits for many years such as Australia and New Zealand, history also shows how painful the eventual adjustment can be. There are many examples in which capital flight has resulted in a huge fall in GDP growth and broader financial crises – for example in Latin America in the early 1980s, in the Nordic countries in the early 1990s and the east Asian economies a decade ago – which, in turn, weakened global GDP growth or global financial institutions.  Countries with large deficits are vulnerable to a rapid reversal of capital flows. If investors are no longer willing to finance the deficit, domestic spending will need to be cut relative to output through a combination of reducing spending and switching production to the tradable sector. A recent IMF study reviewed 42 episodes of large reductions in current account deficits in developed countries over the past 40 years. In a quarter of the cases, which were mainly countries with limited real exchange rate depreciation, annual GDP growth fell by 3½ percentage points on average.11  There are dangers too for surplus countries. Large foreign exchange inflows are not easy to sterilise. They tend to contribute to asset price bubbles and higher inflation which itself can undermine economic and financial stability. The effect of such inflows into China and oil-exporting countries have been compounded recently by their exchange rates being pegged or managed against the falling dollar. This has contributed not just to the build up of reserves and SWFs but also to the build up of inflationary pressures within these countries.  No one would blame EMEs for the current turmoil in Western financial markets. It has been generated at home by the widespread mispricing of financial assets; this has been most obvious among the assets based on the US housing market but it is not confined to that sector. However the way that the boom developed did owe a great deal to global imbalances.  The “savings glut”, to quote Ben Bernanke12, that developed in the oil exporting countries and China contributed to the fall in real long-term interest rates.13 In the UK, for example, real long-term interest rates, measured by the difference between the nominal 10-year government bond yield and the annual rate of inflation, fell from around 3.9% in 1997 to 1.6% in 2005. A similar pattern was also evident in the US (Chart 6). In particular, interest rates on safe assets fell since the build up in foreign assets were invested mainly in government bonds.14 That both discouraged saving and boosted asset prices. In order to maintain their traditional returns, the private sector sought higher yielding strategies and were too ready to                                                  11  IMF (2007) ‘Exchange rates and the adjustment of external imbalances’ IMF WEO April, Chapter 3. 12  Bernanke, B (2007) "Global Imbalances: Recent Developments and Prospects", speech delivered for the Bundesbank Lecture, Berlin, and Bernanke, B (2005) "The Global Savings Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit", speech delivered for the Sandridge Lecture at the Virginia Association of Economists. 13  A fall in desired investment (investment ‘strike’) in some countries also contributed to the decline in global real interest rates. For example, investment-GDP ratios fell sharply in the Newly Industrialised Countries in the wake of the east Asian crisis a decade ago. 14 For example FE Warnock and VC Warnock (2006) (‘International Capital Flows and US interest rates’, NBER Working Paper, 12560) estimate that foreign official flows reduced US 10-year Treasury nominal yields by about 100 basis points lower than otherwise in the year to June 2005. 
6 BIS Review 31/2008 believe that these could be attained through new products without running bigger risks. We are now dealing with the consequences of that mistake. Global imbalances – where to from here Looking forward, the unwinding of global imbalances requires some combination of a slowdown in the growth of domestic demand in deficit countries and an increase in domestic demand in surplus countries. If the slowdown is not to dominate, we need to see a shift in relative prices to rebalance demand – that is a gradual real exchange rate depreciation of deficit countries against surplus ones. The rise of SWFs may play a part in this dynamic. Their emergence is a sign that surplus countries may be less willing in future to accept such low yielding assets. That should put pressure on exchange rates to adjust and contribute to a reduction in global imbalances. So while SWFs may be a product of global imbalances, they may also play a part in the adjustment.  There are signs that in the United States, at least, imbalances are beginning to adjust. The US current account deficit now looks past its peak and the marked fall in the dollar – about 25% in real traded-weighted terms – since its peak in early 2002 should help in the adjustment. However, the decline in US relative demand is coming about mainly through slower domestic demand growth at home rather than faster demand growth abroad while the dollar has fallen less against currencies with the largest current account surpluses (Chart 7). There is a risk, therefore, that the fall in the US current deficit will not be matched by a fall of surpluses in high surplus countries but a rise in deficits in other deficit countries. The imbalances could be transferred not reduced. So it is important that the current large gap between savings and investment in the Far East and oil exporting countries narrows. In the near term, the ability to increase spending will be constrained by the recent increase in inflationary pressures in these countries. But more exchange rate flexibility should be helpful on both fronts. And over the medium-term, in oil exporting countries, government spending is likely to increase further in response to past increases in incomes since part of the rise in the oil price looks to be permanent. This gives oil exporters the opportunity to spend more on diversifying production in their economies. It is encouraging also that in China the government has plans to increase its own expenditure on the infrastructure, encourage higher spending by households through speeding up financial sector reform and improving the safety net as well as allowing more flexibility than in the past in the exchange rate. Conclusion Given the growth of the foreign currency reserves in many EMEs, the emergence of SWFs making long term investments on financial criteria in a wider range of instruments is a positive development. Some increase in the transparency both of the strategy and objectives of the funds and of recipient countries’ approach to inward investment should help dispel concerns and ensure they are a force for greater global financial integration rather than a prompt for a new wave of financial protectionism. SWF’s recent investments in global financial institutions have been helpful in easing the current financial market turmoil. And the fact that they, and their central banks, are looking for higher returns and greater asset diversification should be beneficial both to the EMEs and to the recipient countries since it should improve the efficiency of global asset allocation.  But that positive story should not conceal that the growth of SWFs is also a result of persistent global imbalances in trade. These imbalances have helped create vulnerabilities in financial markets and in the wider economy. Our current experience is one more illustration of how painful the unwinding of such imbalances can be.

BIS Review 31/2008 1 Ben S Bernanke: Fostering sustainable homeownership Speech of Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition Annual Meeting, Washington DC, 14 March 2008. *      *      * This audience, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, is certainly aware that mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates have increased substantially over the past year and a half. This increase reflects significantly, though not exclusively, a sharp deterioration in the performance of subprime mortgages, particularly those with adjustable-rate features. At the end of last year, more than one in five of the roughly 3.6 million outstanding subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) were seriously delinquent, meaning they were either in foreclosure or ninety days or more past due.1 That rate is about four times higher than it was in mid-2005. Lenders initiated roughly 1-1/2 million foreclosures last year, up from an average of 950,000 in the preceding two years. More than one-half of the foreclosure starts in 2007 were on subprime mortgages. Behind these disturbing statistics are families facing personal and financial hardship and neighborhoods that may be destabilized by clusters of foreclosures. These realities challenge us to find ways to prevent unnecessary foreclosures. And, looking toward the future, they challenge us to ensure a regulatory environment that promotes responsible lending and sustainable homeownership.  I would like to briefly discuss how we arrived at where we are today. Then I would like to share with you what the Federal Reserve is doing to reduce foreclosures, to protect aspiring homeowners from unfair and deceptive practices, and to equip them to choose wisely from among the often confusing array of mortgage options. In particular, I would like to highlight the new regulations we have proposed under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). Origins of the subprime mortgage turmoil Over the past quarter century, advances in information technology, the development of credit-scoring techniques, and the emergence of a large secondary market, among other factors, have significantly increased access to mortgage credit. From 1994 to 2006, subprime lending increased from an estimated $35 billion, or 4.5 percent of all one-to-four family mortgage originations, to $600 billion, or 20 percent of originations (Inside Mortgage Finance, 2007). Responsible subprime lending expanded credit to borrowers with imperfect or limited credit histories. More renters became homeowners than would have otherwise. Though few subprime mortgages are being written today, I believe responsible subprime lending has been helpful, and at some point will be again, in fostering sustainable homeownership. However, far too much of the lending in recent years was neither responsible nor prudent. The terms of some subprime mortgages permitted homebuyers and investors to purchase properties beyond their means, often with little or no equity. In addition, abusive, unfair, or deceptive lending practices led some borrowers into mortgages that they would not have chosen knowingly.                                                   1  Based on servicer data from First American LoanPerformance. 
2 BIS Review 31/2008 The current crisis has many roots. The drop in home prices in many once-hot markets is among the most significant. In a recent survey, nearly 30 percent of homeowners reported that their houses decreased in value over the past year.2 The decline in home equity makes it more difficult for struggling homeowners to refinance and reduces the financial incentive of stressed borrowers to remain in their homes. Mortgage performance data show a strong correlation between adverse house price changes and subsequent increases in mortgage delinquency and foreclosure (Avery, Brevoort, and Canner, 2007; Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen, 2007). Investors who purchased homes in the hope of price appreciation seem particularly likely to walk away from "underwater" mortgages. Indeed, the role of investors in the housing market has increased markedly over time. According to data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending to non-owner-occupants has risen from about 5 percent of the home-purchase loans in the mid-1990s to about 17 percent of all purchases in 2005 and 2006 (Avery, Brevoort, and Canner, 2007). Mortgage delinquencies are also tied to local economic conditions; notably, several midwestern states struggling with job losses and slow income growth have seen increased delinquencies. The deterioration in underwriting standards that appears to have begun in late 2005 is another important factor underlying the current crisis. A large share of subprime loans that were originated during this time featured high combined loan-to-value ratios and, in some cases, layers of additional risk factors, such as a lack of full documentation or the acceptance of very high debt-to-income ratios. In 2006, for example, the HMDA data suggest that nearly 40 percent of higher-priced home-purchase loans involved a piggy-back loan or second mortgage.3 Indeed, many defaults are occurring within the first few months of origination, well before payment resets occur on subprime ARM products.  Much of the weakening in underwriting standards appears to have happened outside of institutions regulated by the federal banking agencies. The HMDA data for 2006 show that more than 45 percent of high-cost first mortgages were originated by independent mortgage companies, which are institutions that are not regulated by the federal banking agencies and that sell almost all of the mortgages they originate. In this instance, this originate-to-distribute model appears to have contributed to the breakdown in underwriting standards, as lenders often found themselves able to pass on the credit risk without much resistance from the ultimate investors. For a number of years, rapid increases in house prices effectively insulated lenders and investors from the effects of weaker underwriting, providing false comfort.  Another concern is the substantial number of borrowers with subprime ARMs whose interest rates are scheduled to reset upward--about 1.5 million in 2008.4 The problem posed by resets is serious, but it may be mitigated somewhat by lower short-term interest rates and by the efforts of servicers, including those working with the Hope Now Alliance, to find solutions for borrowers facing resets, including interest-rate freezes (Hope Now Alliance Servicers, 2008). In addition, the FHASecure plan, which the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced late last summer, offers qualified borrowers who are delinquent because of an interest rate reset and who have some equity in the home the opportunity to refinance into an FHA-insured mortgage. Recently, the Congress and Administration temporarily increased the maximum loan value eligible for FHA insurance, which will allow more borrowers access to this program.                                                  2  Analysis based on Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers data provided to the Federal Reserve Board.  3  The Federal Reserve Board staff estimates are based on 2006 HMDA data.

BIS Review 31/2008 3 The current high rate of delinquencies and foreclosures is not confined to the subprime market. In 2007, about 45 percent of foreclosures were on prime, near-prime, or government-backed mortgages. Across market segments, delinquencies are rising fastest on the more-complex loans originated over the past few years. In part, that trend seems to be due to the fact that such loans were made to borrowers in weaker financial condition. In some cases, borrowers may not have fully understood the details of their loans, including the potential for large payment increases. Federal Reserve responses Effective responses need to build on an informed understanding of this complex picture. Thus, as these problems in housing emerged and deepened, the Federal Reserve System engaged with a wide array of market participants--including lenders, community groups, servicers, consumer advocates, public officials, and other regulators--to properly diagnose the problems and work toward sustainable solutions. The Federal Reserve System alone, of course, cannot resolve all of the problems in the marketplace, but we have responded thus far through our regulatory, supervisory, research, and community affairs functions. Regulation and supervision As part of a periodic review of our regulations under HOEPA, the Federal Reserve Board in 2006 began a systematic look at changes in the mortgage industry. Four public hearings held around the country confirmed evidence that we were gathering from other sources that the mortgage market was undergoing the significant changes with which we are all now familiar. Our concerns led us in 2006 and 2007 to issue, along with other federal and state regulators, a series of guidances to the institutions we supervise that covered nontraditional mortgage loans, subprime lending, and servicing practices. Those were good steps, but we also recognized that many of the problems we were beginning to see were a result of actions by companies and individuals not subject to our supervisory oversight. Thus, we conducted an additional HOEPA hearing, focusing on four specific areas: assessment of repayment ability; low- and no-documentation lending; escrowing for taxes and insurance; and prepayment penalties. As a result of a careful review of available data and information, we proposed new rules under our HOEPA authority in December, banning practices that we found to be unfair or deceptive. Significantly, bans on such unfair or deceptive acts and practices would apply to the entire mortgage industry, not just to institutions directly regulated by the Board.  Our goal was to produce clear and comprehensive rules to protect consumers from unfair practices while maintaining the viability of a market for responsible mortgage lending. The rules would apply stricter regulations to higher-priced mortgage loans, which we have defined broadly so as to cover substantially all of the subprime market.5 The regulations would be enforceable by state and federal supervisory and enforcement agencies as well as by consumers themselves, who could recover statutory damages for violations above and beyond actual damages. The proposed rules cover a range of practices. First, the rules would prohibit a lender from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higher-priced loans that the borrower cannot reasonably be expected to repay from income or from assets other than the house. Of course, appropriate attention to the borrower's ability to repay is a fundamental feature of good underwriting.                                                   5  Under the proposal, a "higher-priced mortgage loan" would have an annual percentage rate that exceeds the yield on comparable Treasury securities by 3 percentage points or more for first-lien loans or 5 percentage points or more for subordinate-lien loans. 
4 BIS Review 31/2008 Second, we found that the prevalence of "stated-income" lending led to many borrowers receiving mortgages that they could not afford. Consequently, we would require lenders to verify the income or assets they rely on to make credit decisions for higher-priced loans--standard industry practice, in fact, for most lending until quite recently. Third, our proposal would require higher-priced loans to have an escrow account for real-estate taxes and hazard insurance. This rule would help ensure that borrowers can afford their payments and avoid the cases in which borrowers, especially first-time borrowers, did not understand that the monthly principal and interest payment was not the only financial obligation associated with homeownership. Escrowing has become standard practice in the prime market, and our proposal would make it standard practice for this part of the market, as well.  Fourth, the proposed rules would ban prepayment penalties in situations in which the borrower may be especially vulnerable. For example, prepayment penalties would be prohibited where the borrower's debt-to-income ratio exceeds 50 percent and, when permitted, would be required to expire at least sixty days before a scheduled increase in the loan payment. The rule would also ban prepayment penalties that could enable a "loan flipping" scheme, in which a lender or its affiliate refinances the lender's own loan at adverse terms for the borrower. In seeking information and opinion about these four issues, the Board determined that additional problems needed to be addressed as well, and for all loans, not just higher-priced loans. Among the practices addressed by our proposal is the use of yield spread premiums (YSPs).6 Many consumers use mortgage brokers to guide them through a complex process and shop for the best deal. Unfortunately, consumers may believe that the broker has a responsibility to get them that best deal, which is not necessarily the case. In fact, the design of YSPs may provide the broker a financial incentive to offer a loan with a higher rate. Consumers who do not understand this point may not shop to their best advantage. Therefore, we would prohibit a lender, for both prime and subprime loans, from paying a broker an amount greater than the consumer agrees to in advance. Brokers would also have to disclose their potential conflict of interest. The combination of stricter regulation and better disclosure will not solve all the problems. We do believe, however, that this proposal will give consumers much better information and raise their awareness of brokers' potential conflict of interest while reducing a broker's incentive to steer a consumer to a higher rate. To protect consumers and promote competition, our proposal would also ban seven specific advertising practices deemed unfair or deceptive. Under our rules, for example, mortgage originators would not be allowed to advertise a mortgage as having a "fixed" rate unless the advertisement also states clearly how long the rate or payment is fixed, and they could not advertise loans in one language but have important consumer disclosures in another. The proposal would also require that consumers receive loan-specific Truth in Lending Act disclosures early in the application process, when they can use the information to shop more effectively. The proposal also addresses certain practices in loan servicing that can cause problems for consumers, such as delays in posting payments to a consumer's account, and it acts to prohibit coercion of appraisers by lenders or brokers. We believe these proposed rules will help protect mortgage borrowers from unfair and deceptive practices. At the same time, we did not want to create rules that were so open-ended or costly to administer that responsible lenders would pull out of the subprime market. So, our proposal is designed to protect consumers without shutting off access to responsible                                                  6  A YSP is the present dollar value of the difference between the lowest interest rate the wholesale lenders would have accepted on a particular transaction and the interest rate the broker actually obtained for the lender.  This dollar amount is usually paid to the mortgage broker.  It may also be applied to other loan-related costs, but the Board's proposal concerns only the amount paid to the broker.  
BIS Review 31/2008 5 credit. We anticipate vigorous discussion through the public comment process that ends on April 8, and we will, as always, carefully consider this input before issuing final rules. In addition to regulations, strong uniform oversight of different types of mortgage lenders is critical to avoiding future problems. Regulatory oversight of mortgage lending has become more challenging as the breadth and depth of this market has grown over the past decade. Other changes, such as the increased role of nonbank mortgage lenders, have added complexity.  To achieve more uniformly effective supervision, the Federal Reserve, together with other federal and state agencies, launched a pilot program last summer to conduct reviews of selected nondepository lenders with significant subprime mortgage operations. These reviews will evaluate the companies' underwriting standards as well as senior management oversight of compliance with state and federal consumer protection regulations and laws. We will take corrective or enforcement action as warranted. We plan to use this joint project as a vehicle for strengthening cooperation and coordination among federal and state agencies.  Research and community affairs The Federal Reserve is addressing the foreclosure crisis in capacities other than that of a regulator, leveraging our strengths in research and data analysis, our regional presence, and the many contacts we have developed with local community groups, lenders, policymakers, and other stakeholders in this issue. Community affairs officers at the Board and the twelve Reserve Banks work with Federal Reserve research economists to anticipate and, where possible, mitigate foreclosure problems. They share detailed reports and information that help community organizations, nonprofits, state regulators, and others identify regions and neighborhoods most vulnerable to foreclosure and respond accordingly. For instance, NeighborWorks America recently used the Board's analyses to help identify geographic areas and neighborhoods in most critical need of $130 million in emergency funds provided by the Congress to increase mortgage counselor capacity. Solid analysis of available information is critical to crafting appropriate policy remedies, and the Federal Reserve has invested considerable resources into such studies. For example, a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston working paper has analyzed the factors that predict foreclosure, finding a particularly important role for declining house prices (Gerardi, Shapiro, and Willen, 2007). The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is conducting a five-year study of pre-purchase homeownership counseling. That study will provide important information on the benefits of counseling services in fostering sustainable homeownership and help us understand the long-term effects of financial-management skills on the credit worthiness of low- and moderate-income homebuyers. In addition to this ongoing research, the Federal Reserve is supporting efforts to reach troubled borrowers and to raise awareness in communities about ways to prevent foreclosures. Since July, the community affairs offices across the Federal Reserve System have sponsored or cosponsored more than fifty events related to foreclosures, reaching more than 4,000 attendees including lenders, counselors, community development specialists, and policymakers.  There is also work to be done in mitigating the impact of unavoidable foreclosures on consumers and communities. Families who cannot sustain homeownership will need to find new places to live, highlighting the critical need for an adequate supply of affordable rental housing. Consumers going through foreclosure typically will see their credit scores drop, raising longer-term questions about their ability to rebound financially and perhaps pursue a more sustainable home purchase at some later point. High numbers of foreclosed homes in some communities also raise challenges, and perhaps opportunities. Because vacant homes, in particular, impose real costs on neighborhood and communities, forward-looking strategies to keep these homes occupied are important (Apgar and Duda, 2005). Some efforts are underway to prevent vacancies, as well as return vacant properties to active use; 
6 BIS Review 31/2008 some of these efforts may also help preserve the supply of affordable housing in areas that have experienced shortages.7 The Federal Reserve has recently undertaken a joint effort with NeighborWorks America to help communities develop strategies for neighborhood stabilization. Conclusion It is clear that rising home foreclosures and delinquencies significantly challenge many consumers and communities, and I hope I have conveyed today that the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to fully employing our authority, expertise, and resources to help alleviate their distress. We will continue to collaborate at the national, regional, and local levels with other stakeholders in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to help to avoid preventable foreclosures and to address the consequences of the foreclosures that occur. In the longer term, through our regulations and oversight, we seek to promote responsible and sustainable lending that will allow more Americans to achieve their goal of homeownership.

For example, the Neighborhood Housing Services Redevelopment Corporation in Chicago has acquired hundreds of abandoned properties from such sources as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the City of Chicago, bank foreclosures (that is, real estate owned), and private owners. The properties are then rehabilitated and sold to owner-occupants.  In highly depressed housing markets, the worst-quality units are often demolished to mitigate safety hazards and reduce supply.  For example, in Flint, Michigan, the Genesee County Land Bank acquires vacant properties through tax liens (see www.thelandbank.org). 
Stefan Ingves: Can the authorities manage crises in the financial system? Speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Swedish Economics Association, Stockholm, 13 March 2008. *      *      * I’m sure that no one here has failed to notice the fact that there has periodically been turmoil in the financial markets since last summer. It is scarcely remarkable or unusual that the financial markets experience upswings and downswings. And there are almost always some countries in the world experiencing problems in their financial sector. We have become used to this being a fact of life.  But this time there appears to be much greater nervousness than we have seen in a long time. Central banks have also followed developments with great interest. For instance, the ECB, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have taken a number of well-publicised measures. So why all the commotion this time?  Well, this is one of the subjects of my speech today. Financial stability is the Riksbank's other task in addition to monetary policy. Apart from being a red-hot topic of discussion, it is also an area to which I have devoted many years of work. Today I want to talk about the regulations for managing financial institutions in distress and the challenges we face. But let me first reason a little about financial crises on the basis of the current turbulence and the crisis Sweden experienced at the beginning of the 1990s. The problems began in the subprime market As you all know, the recent credit concern began with problems on the US mortgage market. This applies in particular to the area offering so-called subprime loans. These are loans to mortgage customers with lower credit ratings – often households without a documented credit history and with a lower income than the average household. These loans doubled between 1996 and 2006, although they still comprise a relatively small part of the US credit market. The problems began to affect many borrowers back in 2005 in connection with the rise in interest rates.  When loans were renewed at new, higher interest rates the loan costs for these borrowers rose substantially. And when property prices fell in many areas, there was no scope to mortgage the house so householders could borrow their way out of their problems. This was otherwise a common – albeit dubious – strategy during the years of rising property prices. Many borrowers could no longer make the interest and mortgage payments on their loans. This led in turn to substantial credit losses for many mortgage institutions. But the loan losses did not merely affect the banks and mortgage institutions that had originally issued the loans. As you all know, the problems came to have a much wider spread. And the problems spread as the risks were sold on The reason why the problems spread is the extensive securitisation of mortgages. This special form of financial engineering has made it possible for lenders to sell credit risk together with the right to the payment flows from the loans to prospective investors around the world. What this means, basically, is that a number of loans are combined and put into a an investment vehicle created especially for this purpose, which is in turn financed by issuing securities, what are known as mortgage-backed securities. In principle, this is a way of making illiquid assets liquid.  BIS Review 30/2008 1 
This has become increasingly common among banks and other credit institutions around the world. One can say that they have thus increasingly moved away from the traditional role as monitor of credit risk. Instead they have to a greater degree originated loans, where the inherent credit risks have immediately been distributed to investors in the financial markets willing to take risks. Their business strategy has changed from focusing on long-term customer relations to repackaging and selling. Having said this, securitisation is not necessarily a bad thing in itself.  What has been new and something of a problem this time has been the way in which the securitised loans have been repackaged and sold through several stages. They have created so-called structured credit risk products, which have often included a large portion of subprime loans. The variety of these has been impressive. Often one product has been included as a component in another product, which in turn has been repackaged and included as a component in a new product. One can equate this to Russian dolls: a large one that contains a smaller one, which in turn contains an even smaller one, and so on. This has been a means of creating assets that suit investors with differing risk appetites, particularly assets with a high return and high risk level. A complicated structure emerged But there has been substantial variation among the special vehicles used by banks and other credit institutions for their securitisation. I do not intend to describe in detail all of these conduits and SIVs and suchlike. But what they have in common is that they invest in high-yield assets and long durations, often structured credit-risk products with a subprime content. They have been financed, at least partially, by issuing certificates in the fixed income market for short durations, what are known as asset-backed commercial papers. The special vehicles have thus to a greater or lesser degree been dependent on the liquidity in the market for these securities for their financing. Even if these special vehicles are in principle independent from the banks, it is common that the banks supply some form of liquidity guarantee. In other words, if a special vehicle for some reason is unable to issue new certificates when the old ones fall due, the bank guarantees the ability to pay, wholly or partly. Such guarantees need not only consist of formal obligations. They may also be of a purely informal nature. This is because the bank may be disinclined to abandon its special vehicle if only to protect its name and reputation. Whatever the case, it means that the financing problems that affect the special vehicles can easily lead back into the bank. What one has regarded as true sale may in reality not always have been so. Credit ratings attracted investors but were used wrongly As you realise, the result has been an extremely complicated structure. Many asset classes have arisen, each with their own unique conditions and idiosyncrasies in pricing. This has in turn made it difficult to assess the different products.  Then they can instead obtain help from the credit rating agencies. With the aid of the credit rating the agencies have issued, investors have been persuaded to invest in the products. Credit ratings are excellent aids that measure the probability of a failure or an expected loss. But they do not take into account how the risks covary and are otherwise distributed.  Unfortunately, many investors appear to have disregarded these limitations. In addition, all of the repackaging, special middlemen and more or less visible guarantees have made it difficult to gain insight into where the risks are. In particular the geographical spread appears to have been greater than in earlier episodes of financial turbulence.  2 BIS Review 30/2008 
Uncertainty increased and liquidity disappeared  When the problems in the subprime market began to show here and there, this caused great uncertainty. It was quite simply impossible to know who was actually left with the direct or indirect exposures to the subprime loans. This led to liquidity waning in parts of the interbank market. It therefore became more difficult and more expensive for the banks to refinance themselves. When many banks experienced problems, a number of central banks chose to take measures to increase liquidity in the interbank market.  The unease in the credit markets has continued during the winter and spring. Many large and established banks have been gradually forced to write down the value of their subprime-related assets. This has led to some major financial groups requiring new capital. At the same time, there has been increased uncertainty over international economic activity. This has in turn contributed to major fluctuations on the world’s stock markets.  Over the past week the unease has increased again. This has contributed to rising interest rates on the interbank market in, for instance, the United States and the United Kingdom. With the free capital movement this of course also affects Swedish interbank rates. But higher interest rates in the interbank market do not by definition mean that the banks will experience liquidity problems. The Swedish banks have had good liquidity throughout the entire period of turmoil. They have not been exposed to subprime-related securities to any great extent. Their solidity was and remains good and their loan losses are at present very small. Nevertheless, the Swedish banks have not been able to entirely escape the effects of these events. There are similarities between today’s financial turmoil and the Swedish bank crisis The current financial turmoil and the Swedish bank crisis actually have a number of common denominators. Harvard professor Kenneth Rogoff together with Carmen Reinhart of Maryland University has pointed to a number of similarities between the US mortgage turmoil and a number of earlier financial crises, including the Swedish bank crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. Some common denominators for the period prior to the outbreak of the crisis include a rapid increase in property and share prices, the fact that the current account deficit was large and growing and that economic growth had declined from an earlier high level. One important difference is that the exchange rate regime has not played a prominent role in the US case.  Too low risk premiums and abstruse risks But it is also possible to find more specific parallels to the Swedish bank crisis. In both cases lending has increased rapidly at the same time as the banks have underestimated and therefore not taken sufficient payment for the credit risks. In Sweden this was linked to the banks – after decades of credit regulation – lacking a developed strategy for managing and pricing credit risk. When deregulation came in the mid-1980s they were quite simply unused to loan losses. But such tendencies could also be seen prior to the recent market turmoil. For a long time, risk premiums for credit risk-related securities were remarkably low. The uncertainty has led to an increase. But, there are also other parallels. This includes in particular the arrangements that made the banks’ real risk-taking more abstruse. The banks’ formal and informal promises of loans to special investment vehicles meant that the problems quickly bounced back into the banks' balance sheets.  In the Swedish bank crisis one can say that the finance companies in some respects played a corresponding role to the special vehicle. It was the finance companies that primarily financed the expansion in the construction and property markets. The finance companies largely financed themselves in the short term by issuing so-called commercial papers in the BIS Review 30/2008 3 
fixed income market. When the property market folded, it was a finance company, Nyckeln, which in September 1990 was the first to throw in the towel when it could not renew its financing. Other finance companies then followed suit.  Many of the finance companies were owned by the banks. And the banks were tied by both formal and informal commitments. The losses therefore soon returned to the bank system. In 1991 it became apparent that the banks had substantial problem loans through their exposures to the property branch both directly and indirectly through the finance companies they supported. The bank crisis had become a reality. Perhaps you begin to see a pattern now? The structures were a side-effect of the desire to avoid regulation It is also interesting that the abstruse structures, which led to the current financial turmoil and the bank crisis in the 1990s, were in both cases partly due to so-called regulatory arbitrage. The most recent wave of securitisation of the banks’ credit portfolios was partly propelled by deficiencies in the capital adequacy rules. Through securitisation the banks could easily avoid a lot of expensive capital adequacy. Since 2004 a new capital adequacy regime, Basel II, has applied. This is more finely meshed and does not allow the same possibilities to avoid capital adequacy through securitisation. However, it has not yet been implemented in all countries, such as the United States, for instance. The Swedish finance companies were in their day the result of regulatory arbitrage. Prior to the abolition of credit regulation in Sweden, the finance companies were often used as a means for the banks to get round the credit restrictions. This “grey” credit market was once substantial and an important source of additional income for the banks. Around 25 years ago I myself wrote quite a lot about this.  Credit insurances existed then as now One can also observe another similarity, namely the occurrence of so-called credit insurances. A company that sold credit insurances to the Swedish banks in the 1980s and 1990s was Svenska Kredit. Many banks bought insurances against losses from their loans to property companies from this company. When the property market crashed, Svenska Kredit was unable to meet all of its obligations and consequently went bankrupt. This in turn fuelled the problems for the banks.  There are parallels between the Swedish credit insurance companies of that time and the current so-called monolines. These are large insurance companies which are specialised in insuring various types of bond loan. Those who have bought the companies’ insurances have traditionally been municipalities, federal states and other bond issuers with poorer credit ratings. The insurance has meant that the bond loans have received better credit ratings and it has been possible to sell them at better rates. In July 2007 the outstanding volume of bonds insured by monolines amounted to a value of USD 3,300 billion. In recent years these monolines have increasingly been used to insure securities issues with a subprime content. This has meant that they have also begun to experience problems. This risks in turn having repercussions for the securities they have insured and ultimately for those who have invested in them.  Of course, there are also some essential differences between the most recent financial turbulence and the Swedish bank crisis. This applies to both the nature and the scope of the crisis. But, as you will note, there are many and striking similarities in the way people have acted. Or as Voltaire is supposed to have said "While history may never repeat itself – man always does!” 4 BIS Review 30/2008 
Financial crises arise as a result of imbalances in the balance sheet So why do financial crises arise? The root of most financial crises can quite simply be found in the imbalance between assets and financing. The simplest way to illustrate this is to look at a stylised bank’s balance sheet. On the asset side there is lending to companies and households. These are assets that cannot be realised quickly without a substantial discount. In other words, they are illiquid. The bank’s financing on the other hand largely consists of deposits from the general public and short-term borrowing on the interbank and securities markets. Their financing is thus very liquid.  In normal circumstances this is not a problem, as we do not expect all depositors and other lenders to withdraw their money or their financing at the same time. But at the same time this liquidity transformation makes the bank sensitive to its financiers' confidence in its ability to meet its obligations. Suspicions that the bank has financial problems could very quickly lead to a bank run.  There have been many bank runs in the past. Stockholms Banco, which was founded by Johan Palmstruch in 1656, was hit by a bank run in the 1660s when the depositors lost confidence in the notes issued by the bank. The bank was taken over by the estates of the realm, and is the precursor to the Riksbank which was founded in 1668. There were countless bank runs in the United States at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s. Argentina and Indonesia were hit at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s. And as recently as September 2007 the British building society Northern Rock suffered a bank run. I shall return to this shortly. It is clear that even the most recent financial turmoil is a question of an imbalance between assets and liabilities, although the assets and liabilities have come to look rather different than in the fictitious example. Essentially this is a question of the same thing, namely lending at long durations that is funded in short durations. The awareness of this inherent instability and the difficulty in seeing where the risks lie meant that there was sometimes too little liquidity in parts of the money market. What is new is that banks around the world have become much more dependent on the securities markets for managing risks and financing themselves. In 2007 we had concrete evidence of how sensitive the banks have become to liquidity shocks in these markets. Problems in the securities markets have almost never before returned to the bank systems with such force.  The importance of financial stability When Northern Rock suffered problems, the British authorities took a number of exceptional measures. For instance, the Bank of England granted the building society emergency liquidity assistance. And HM Treasury abandoned the limits of its existing deposit guarantee, extending them to cover all deposits in Northern Rock without limitation.  The question that many people are probably asking is why so much effort was made for one individual financial institution. Public measures of this type could hardly be appropriate if it had been a question of an ordinary engineering company or retail chain that was in financial straits. It is due to two factors. Firstly, it concerns the special role played by the banks and the bank system as a whole in the economy. Secondly, it concerns the special contagion risks in the financial system. In a central bank context, these are usually called systemic risks.  Banks and other intermediaries in the credit market who receive deposits from the general public play a central role in the financial system. They contribute, for instance, to facilitating the mediation of capital by acting as intermediaries between depositors and borrowers.  They also create the conditions for more efficient mediation of payments in the economy. The banks’ deposit accounts are of central importance for the use of payment cards, credit cards and credit transfers. Many banks also participate in the system for the settlement of BIS Review 30/2008 5 
large-value payments supplied by the central bank. The banks and their account systems are therefore a vital part of the payment system. So if anyone asks why the banks are special, I could reply in the same way as John Dillinger, designated by the FBI in the 1930s as public enemy number one, when asked why he robbed banks: “Because that’s where the money is.” At the same time, problems that arise in one bank can easily spread to other banks. This spread can occur in different ways. Firstly, there can be a direct spread, through the exposures the banks have to one another in the payment systems and in connection with foreign exchange and securities trading. Severe chain effects can arise if the customers of a bank suffering problems have their means of payment tied up in the bank. This makes it difficult to make payments to other households and companies. It can lead to liquidity problems that can in turn give rise to loan losses and payment problems for these customers’ banks.  Secondly, the banks are often exposed to the same sorts of risk. This increases the probability that, for instance, a macroeconomic shock may affect more than one bank. The spread of problems between banks can thus also arise as an indirect effect, through expectations that other banks may suffer similar problems to the one first affects, or via more well-founded suspicions of the banks' exposures to one another. The contagion risks mean that problems in one bank can easily lead to problems for the entire bank system. The costs to society of a crisis affecting the entire bank system can be substantial. It is, of course, difficult to calculate these costs. Some surveys have indicated that an average production loss resulting from a bank crisis could be around 15-20 per cent of GDP. According to some calculations, the collapse of the Swedish bank market cost around 5 per cent of GDP in terms of a loss in output.  Seen from society’s point of view, the individual agents’ incentives are not sufficient to take protective measures against crises that affect the financial system as a whole. The shareholders can never lose more capital than they have put in and individual depositors find it difficult to monitor a bank with widespread operations. There are, to use economic terminology, considerable negative externalities. In addition to the consumer protection aspects, this is a decisive motive for having a financial safety net in the form of special regulation, supervision and a deposit guarantee. It is also the reason why central banks have the possibility to provide liquidity support in the form of emergency liquidity assistance. Such emergency liquidity assistance shall in principle only be granted if the institution in question has temporary liquidity problems, but is essentially robust and if there are systemic contagion risks.  It was exactly this risk of domino effects in the rest of the financial system that meant that Northern Rock, which can hardly be said to be of critical significance to the bank system, became the object of a number of measures taken by the British authorities. It was probably similar considerations that motivated the measures taken in Germany to save IKB and Sachsen Landesbank.  Now one has seen that it was not so easy for the British authorities to manage the problems in Northern Rock. The existing regulations and arrangements did not prove particularly effective. Despite the measures taken, they did not manage to avoid a bank run. This has led to the authorities in Great Britain drawing up, in an impressively short time, proposals for a number of improvements in the regulatory framework for managing institutions in distress. In February the British finance minister announced that they had decided to nationalise Northern Rock, as there was otherwise a risk that the cost to the taxpayers would be too high.  6 BIS Review 30/2008 
The regulations for managing institutions in distress are inadequate  As partially responsible for the stability of the financial system, I ask myself, how are things in Sweden? Do we have the regulatory framework required to manage possible future problems? Unfortunately, the answer to that question must probably be no, at least at present. During the Swedish bank crisis at the beginning of the 1990s a number of extraordinary measures were taken. These included issuing the bank deposit guarantee. This was a general declaration that the banks’ creditors would be protected. In addition, a special crisis management authority was established, the Swedish Bank Support Authority. In connection with this, a number of provisions of a compulsory nature were introduced to prevent the possibility of the state being placed in a blackmail situation. For instance, an act was introduced that meant in principle that the Swedish Bank Support Authority could make decisions in the bank through a state compulsory purchase of the shares if the bank’s capital adequacy fell below two per cent.  But these temporary provisions, like the general bank guarantee, ceased to apply in 1996. The Bank Support Authority was transformed into the Deposit Guarantee Board, which was given the task of managing the deposit guarantee and investor protection.  Since then it is in principle only the general regulations for competition and liquidation and the system for the deposit guarantee that are available for managing institutions with problems. Unfortunately it is not particularly appropriate – if even possible – to apply the general competition regulations to banks. The regulations on competition and liquidity are primarily to protect the interests of the creditors. They are not particularly well-adapted to take into account society’s interest in maintaining the stability of the financial system. The primary task of a receiver in a bankruptcy is to safeguard the interests of the creditors. He or she has neither the authority nor can be expected to have the skills required to take the measures needed to safeguard the stability of the financial system.  Problems which threaten stability require immediate action. Bankruptcies usually take years to resolve. Some elements of the general bankruptcy procedure, such as freezing balance sheets, may in some cases be directly harmful if applied to a systemically-important institution. For example, the banks’ central role in the payment system means that one cannot merely stop payments in one or more of the major banks, as this could have devastating consequences for the financial system. During the bank crisis no banks were declared bankrupt. The lack of specially-adapted regulations for winding up problem institutions with the capacity to take into account society’s need for financial stability was emphasised by the Banking Law Committee. This was a commission of enquiry appointed in 1995 in the wake of the bank crisis to look into the needs for modernised legislation for banks. The Committee also presented a proposal for a new system to manage banks in distress, called public administration. This proposal has now been under investigation, as it is called, by the Government Offices since the year 2000.  Custodia was a reminder of the shortcomings Since then we have received new indications of the shortcomings in the regulations. The course of events at credit institution Custodia in 2006 indicated worrying difficulties in managing even a relatively small and insignificant problem institution. We are therefore in no way better equipped than the United Kingdom to manage problem institutions and this applies with regard to both small and large institutions.  Fortunately, Custodia was a small company and the problems occurred in a situation where there was relative calm on the financial markets. The stability of the financial system was thus definitely never threatened. But it is regrettable that we still have not managed to create BIS Review 30/2008 7 
an adequate regulatory framework in this field, more than fifteen years after our own bank crisis.  In countries where they have slightly more experience of bank failures, such as the United States and Canada, they have learn that special institutions and arrangements are required to manage institutions that are experiencing financial problems. One of the most important lessons is that the authorities must be able to intervene as quickly as possible when a bank faces problems. There are several reasons for this. The first is to put pressure on the management and owners of the bank to rectify the situation and hopefully to prevent the situation deteriorating further. The so-called Savings and Loans crisis in the United States in the 1980s become more costly when the authorities failed to take action in time. This meant that in the United States at the beginning of the 1990s they introduced a system with so-called prompt corrective action. This means that the authorities quite simply are obliged by law to intervene at certain specified thresholds. In my opinion it is desirable that Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) should also have a large toolbox of measures that can be taken at an early stage. It should be possible to intensify these measures gradually as problems worsen. Of course, it is not desirable that the only possibility is to withdraw the license of an institution whose capital adequacy falls below the eight per cent level. In Sweden, there is every reason to look more closely into the obligations and powers of authority of Finansinspektionen. Another motive for the authorities to act quickly is to be able to quickly pay the deposit guarantee. To be able to make the necessary preparations for this, the authorities therefore need to have access to and control over relevant data files at an early stage when an institution gets into difficulties. This has been a problem in earlier cases of compensation from the Swedish deposit guarantee.  If the financial system is threatened, the authorities must also be able to temporarily take control over the bank to maintain vital functions. The banks’ central role in the payment system means that payment defaults by one bank can have substantial domino effects. The consequences for the rest of the financial system may then be difficult to survey.  With regard to institutions lacking a long-term survival capacity, it is of course important that they are wound up as quickly and smoothly as possible. There must be several different alternative methods for winding up banks to make it possible to choose the model that is best suited and entails the least cost to society. Of course, it would be best if one could get another bank to take over this institution’s activities. But the possibility to carve up the business and sell it in parts could in some cases prove more profitable. In certain cases a reconstruction of the bank may be the most appropriate solution. If it were to take too long to find a buyer, it might be necessary for the state to take over the bank temporarily. This was what was ultimately necessary in the case of Northern Rock. There is a risk in similar situations that the state could be exposed to blackmail. To minimise the costs to taxpayers, it is therefore necessary in my opinion that the state has sufficient strength to negotiate with existing and presumptive shareholders. For instance, there must be legal possibilities for the state to redeem the shares at a price corresponding to the value of the bank if there are no state aid measures. It is also particularly important to avoid situations where a bank ends up in a no man’s land regarding ownership. An essential condition for a well-functioning system is that one can attain a balance between all of the interested parties who come forward when a bank is in distress. The various interests include society’s interest in financial stability and the depositors’ interest in good consumer protection. But there are also the creditors’ interest in good protection and fair treatment, the taxpayers’ and the fee-paying institutions’ interest in the cost of the deposit guarantee system being as low as possible. In addition to this are the owners’ interest in their legal rights and not least society’s interest in the administration of justice functioning in the field of economic crime.  8 BIS Review 30/2008 
All of these interests, and probably more, are entirely legitimate and must of course be taken care of in the legislation. But they must be classified according to their relative significance to society. Otherwise it will not be possible to distribute the roles between the different authorities in the best way when managing problem institutions. There is also a risk of wasting valuable time on managing conflicts between different interested parties instead of managing the institution’s problems. In other words, it is necessary to have a bird’s eye view when drawing up regulations. The regulations must be formulated to give the state the right tools  I know that the Ministry of Finance is currently working hard on a proposal for public administration of banks in distress. The design of the deposit guarantee and Finansinspektionen’s powers of authority are also being reviewed. We eagerly await these proposals. Even if the work is carried out on parallel tracks, it is important that the final result is coherent. Otherwise it could be difficult to manage a future crisis in the financial system. It is also important that the proposals are not toothless. Running a bank is not a right, rather it entails considerable responsibility towards both society as a whole and the customers who have entrusted their savings to the bank. Bank owners are already protected through the financial safety net and isolated against risks in a completely different way to those who own ordinary companies. It would therefore be unfortunate if the result was merely a proposal that entailed the state taking over the management of a problem institution, fixing it up and then handing it back to the owners in a new, improved version.  My hope is that the government will dare to take the overall approach required when working on these issues. I hope in particular that they will take note of the events in the United Kingdom and the initiatives that have come about as a result of the problems with Northern Rock. It is important that the state has the necessary tools. If the current EU legislation in various ways puts a spoke in the wheel, then the joint regulations also need to be reviewed.  The internationalisation of the financial sector requires greater cross-border cooperation  The authorities’ crisis preparedness and legal and institutional arrangements for crisis management will thus be less of a purely national affair. The financial sector will be increasingly internationalised, if not globalised. The banks’ activities are becoming more cross-border in nature.  The four largest Swedish banks currently have more than half of their total assets abroad, mainly in the other Nordic countries, but also in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states. An almost equally large share of their total operating profits originates abroad. For the Nordea group this share is no less than three quarters.  In recent years there have also been some much-publicised cross-border acquisitions among several large European banks. There are currently around 50 banks in Europe with substantial operations in several EU countries. There are a number of interacting reasons behind this. The capital adequacy rules have been harmonised, the opportunities to expand in small and mature domestic markets are slight and the economies of scale have increased as a result of, for instance, IT costs accounting for a larger share of the banks’ total costs.  When the banks operate across national borders competition increases. This benefits both companies and households, as financing costs fall and the supply of financial services increases. These are efficiency gains which are ultimately beneficial for economic growth. But at the same time the risk of a bank crisis spreading across national borders increases. This also increases the risk of serious problems arising in several countries at the same time. This makes high demands of crisis management. The exchange of information and the decision making must be coordinated between different authorities. I know from my own BIS Review 30/2008 9 
experience that this can be difficult to achieve in just one country. The differences between the different authorities’ aims, perspectives and methods of working can be substantial. In a cross-border crisis it would also be necessary to coordinate the authorities in several different countries. It is not difficult to imagine that this could be very complicated. Apart from involving more authorities, a number of legal and practical complications arise. This can sorely test the coordination of the exchange of information and the decision making. The Swedish bank’s substantial activities abroad have therefore meant that the Riksbank has entered into a number of agreements on cooperation in the event of financial crises with the central banks in the other Nordic countries and in the Baltic states. There is now also an overall agreement on crisis management at EU level – a Memorandum of Understanding, MoU. This covers central banks, supervisory authorities and finance ministries in all of the member states. Agreements of this nature are valuable because they create orderly forms for cooperation. They create necessary contact networks and not least a common parlance, which can be of great importance when managing a crisis. But these MoUs also have shortcomings. They are often worded in a vague and general manner and are not usually legally binding; more a declaration of intent.  But the most serious deficiency is that they do not take into account the conflicts between national interests which may arise in a crisis situation. These should be added to all of the other conflicts which may arise between different interested parties and authorities with different objectives. Conflicts between national interests can be particularly prominent if the socioeconomic costs of a crisis in a cross-border institution are unevenly or unreasonably distributed between different countries. This could in some situations affect the willingness to contribute constructively to an overall solution of the crisis. There is an evident risk that the crisis management can be prolonged by political negotiating games. When the stakes are high, there is a risk that many countries will choose to play their cards close to their chest as long as possible. In the worst case scenario, this could lead to crisis measures not being taken in time, which could have devastating results for all those involved.  In September 2007 a Nordic-Baltic crisis exercise was organised around a financial crisis scenario. Taking part in this exercise were the central banks, financial supervisory authorities and finance ministries of all of the five Nordic countries and the central banks of the Baltic states. Without going into any details, I can reveal that the exercise brought to light many deficiencies in coordination – both between authorities within individual countries and across national boundaries. In particular, it showed that measures taken unilaterally by the authorities in one country can easily have disastrous consequences for financial stability in other countries. It also further emphasises the importance of continuing to develop the cooperation and ensuring that national regulations do not form an obstacle to cross-border crisis management.  In a crisis it is essential that the authorities in different countries understand one another’s assessments of the situation and preferable that they can reach a common view. This makes demands for common criteria and joint terminology.  It must also be possible to coordinate various measures across borders, such as emergency liquidity assistance and payments of deposit guarantee funds. And it must be possible to distribute the socioeconomic burdens in the wake of a cross-border crisis in a reasonable and preferably fairly predictable manner. Otherwise there is a risk that conflicts between national interests will make the management of a crisis more difficult and prolonged.  Another aspect which has come to the fore in the recent financial turmoil is the banks’ increased dependence on liquidity in the securities markets for their risk management and financing. Central banks around the world need to examine whether they have the necessary tools to manage coming liquidity crises. The question of when and how liquidity support can be given and how such a decision should be communicated without having a stigmatising effect that counteracts its purpose may require new ways of thinking. 10 BIS Review 30/2008 
Better regulations and increased cross-border cooperation are necessary Let me in conclusion observe that the financial turmoil currently prevailing bears a number of clear parallels to many other financial crises – not least the Swedish bank crisis of the 1990s. The bank crisis was in many ways the wake-up call that made the Riksbank and other authorities realise the serious consequences that a lack of stability in the financial system can have. It led to the Riksbank developing an analysis capacity in the field of financial stability. Ten years ago the Riksbank published the first of its now regular Financial Stability Reports. I can warmly recommend that you read them. The insights from the bank crisis have also led to the Riksbank strengthening its crisis organisation and developing forms for cooperation between authorities with regard to managing financial crises. But one important element is missing, namely an effective and coherent regulatory framework for managing institutions in distress. In my opinion, one should have at least some fundamental requirements for such a system.  Firstly, it should ensure the quickest, most resolute action possible from Finansinspektionen when a financial institution suffers problems.  Secondly, it should be designed so that it is possible to quickly and easily pay the deposit guarantee.  Thirdly, it should give the state sufficient negotiating power towards existing and presumptive shareholders to prevent taxpayers having to bear the cost when a financial institution has been mismanaged. Without well-functioning arrangements and appropriate legislation already in place it may be very difficult to manage future problems in the Swedish financial system.  And it is not sufficient to merely patch up the gaps in the domestic regulatory framework. The real challenges lie in managing cross-border crises. This is becoming increasingly important, particularly in the light of the banks’ increasing international operations. It entails challenges that we must tackle jointly on an international level. The regulations must be developed at European level, at least. All of these are difficult issues. One does not need to look far beyond narrow authority objectives and short-sighted national interests to realise that new regulatory frameworks and arrangements for cooperation are required if we are to be able to manage future financial crises. But this appears to be an insight that not everyone reaches at the same time. The picture appears to be most clear to the countries that have come furthest in the question of the integration of the financial sector across national boundaries and which themselves have experience of financial crises. It appears to take other countries longer to realise what new demands arise from the changes in the financial landscape. To achieve this it is necessary to surmount ingrained opinions and other internal resistance. I hope that it will not require a financial crisis of catastrophic proportions before the political maturity and willingness to go further can be achieved on all fronts, both nationally and within the EU. As John F Kennedy said, “the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.” When it starts to drizzle it is high time to speed up. With these words I conclude my talk here at the Swedish Economics Association. It has as always been a great pleasure to be able to share my thoughts with this prominent assembly of economists. I will happily answer any questions you may have now. BIS Review 30/2008 11 
Philipp Hildebrand: Globalisation and current developments in the financial markets Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Swiss Institute of International Studies, Zurich, 13 March 2008. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * Fundamentally, globalisation is not a new phenomenon, and yet the world has changed dramatically in the past twenty years. This is also evident in financial markets, where, since August 2007, a local event like the correction in the US residential property market has rapidly developed into a global event. We are now experiencing the first truly major crisis of financial globalisation.  The longer the crisis lasts, the harder it will be – but also the more important – to keep in mind the advantages of financial globalisation and preserve them in the long run. There is a need for regulatory correction, and such a need will remain in the future. The existing system of regulation and supervision should be further improved. The regulation of liquidity and equity, in particular, needs to be fine-tuned, strengthened and adjusted to the latest developments in financial markets. However, it is possible that more will be needed than just the fine-tuning of regulations. The buffers in the financial system have to be strengthened. In simple terms, what is ultimately required is that international banks strengthen their capital backing. At the same time, bigger liquidity cushions are needed. In addition, the authorities should look into the possibility of supplementing the complex regulations with simpler and more robust indicators such as, for instance, more effective concentration limits and an upper limit for the indebtedness ratio.

Paul Jenkins: How trade and impediments to internal trade affect the Canadian economy Opening statement by Mr Paul Jenkins, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, Ottawa, 12 March 2008.  *      *      * Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to appear before this committee. With me is John Murray, a deputy governor at the Bank of Canada and member of the Bank's Governing Council. Let me start by saying that the issue of internal trade barriers is critically important, and I'm very pleased, Mr. Chairman, that your committee is examining it. We have reviewed previous submissions to this committee, and you will see that our focus will be slightly different. Rather than address the details of any given restrictions to internal trade, I'd like to focus on how trade and impediments to internal trade affect the overall performance of the Canadian economy. In these remarks, I'd like to address two important issues from that perspective: the need for flexibility in adjusting to economic change, and the need for economic policies that promote flexibility in markets for goods, services, capital, and labour. Economic flexibility refers to the ability of an economy to adjust to changing circumstances. Changes in economic conditions often relate to movements in relative prices, which in turn send important signals to markets. A flexible economy is one that adjusts to these signals and returns to its production potential as quickly, and with as little cost, as possible. Over the past decade or so, economic expansion in Canada and around the world has been robust, despite a series of major shocks. These shocks included: - the 1997-98 financial crisis in Asia, which spread to Russia and Latin America  - the worldwide collapse of the high-tech bubble - the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States - SARS and BSE - intensified competition from China and India - and, since 2003, a sharp increase in commodity prices and an associated sharp increase in the external value of our currency. More recently, of course, we have been faced with the fallout of credit market turbulence associated with problems in the American subprime-mortgage market and the increased use of structured financial products. It's important to note that all of these shocks were international in origin and/or in dimension. Many of these shocks – notably, the Asian crisis and the recent sharp run-up in commodity prices – involved large movements in relative prices, that is, in the prices of energy and non-energy commodities, as well as large movements in the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar. And these movements have in turn triggered important shifts in economic activity, as well as reallocations of production resources across sectors and regions of the country.  All of this underscores the fact that we live in an era of rapid change, and we operate in a global environment that is constantly shifting. Uncertainty, risks, and shocks are constant features of the economic landscape. For Canada, it is particularly important that we recognize this reality, given how open our economy is to international trade and capital flows. The best approach to dealing with risks and sudden developments is to constantly ask ourselves what steps we can take to make our economy and domestic markets more flexible, BIS Review 30/2008 1 
and thus better able to adapt to changing circumstances. And we need to recognize that this is a shared responsibility among firms, workers, and policy makers. Firms and their workers need to be able to respond quickly to technological advances and to shocks that require changes in the way they conduct business, the kinds of goods and services they produce, and the markets they choose to develop. A well-functioning market-based economy that sends clear relative price signals is critical in this context.  At the same time, policy-makers need to be wary of barriers to adjustment, such as labour regulations that inhibit the movement of workers from one type of job, or from one sector or region, to another. To enhance flexibility, to raise the growth potential of the economy, and to increase its resilience to shocks, we need policies that encourage structural reforms. For Canada, structural reform has a broad context, with priorities across a number of jurisdictions. The financial system, with its vital role in supporting a healthy modern economy, has been and will continue to be one priority. An efficient and sound financial system enhances overall economic flexibility by helping to redirect capital and resources to the most productive uses, in a cost-effective way, following a shock.  Removing internal barriers to the free movement of goods, services, and labour is another priority. These barriers are rightly attracting attention in Canada as differences in regional economic performance and shortages of skilled labour are becoming more pronounced, and as demographic challenges intensify.  A number of initiatives to remove internal barriers have been undertaken over the years, but with mixed and generally modest results. The Red Seal Program was introduced more than 45 years ago to help standardize and recognize workers' trade qualifications. The Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT), signed by First Ministers in 1994, aimed to reduce barriers to the movement of goods, services, investment, and labour. One very important recent example is the Trade, Investment and Labour Mobility Agreement (TILMA) reached in April 2006 between British Columbia and Alberta to strengthen enforcement and dispute resolution and to harmonize labour credentials and business regulations and standards by early 2009.  Considerably more needs to be done to enhance the flexibility and functioning of our internal markets from coast to coast. Business regulations and standards, including those of the financial sector, need to be harmonized across Canada. Dispute resolution and enforcement under the AIT need to be strengthened. And to make our labour markets more flexible, trades and professional designations should be recognized and fully transferable across the country. A significant step forward would be for others to adopt the British Columbia-Alberta accord. The Bank of Canada also has an important role to play in helping the economy to adjust to economic change. The Bank's monetary policy aims at keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable, which in turn helps Canadian businesses to read price signals more clearly, respond to relative price movements more promptly, and allocate production resources more efficiently.  I'll conclude by saying that uncertainty, risks, and shocks will be as much a part of tomorrow's economic picture as they have been in the past. We all have a stake in Canada's economic well-being, and we all have a role to play in improving our flexibility and adaptability. From that perspective alone, this committee's study of issues related to internal barriers to trade is timely and important. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. John and I would be happy to respond to your questions and comments. 2 BIS Review 30/2008 
Anselmo L S Teng: Macao’s financial sector – exhibiting steady development Speech by Mr Anselmo L S Teng, Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Macao, at the 2008 AMCM Spring Cocktail Reception, Macao, 11 March 2008. *      *      * The Honourable Secretary for Economy and Finance, Mr. Francis Tam, The Honourable Director of the Economic Affairs Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government in the MSAR, Mr. Zhou Zhikui,  The Honourable Chairman of the Macau Association of Banks, Mr. Ye Yixin, The Honourable President of the Macau Insurers’ Association, Mr. Si Chi Hok, The Honourable President of the Macau Insurance Agents and Brokers Association, Mr. Tou Kam Seng, The Honourable President of the Federation of Macau Professional Insurance Intermediaries, Mr. Frank Ip, The Honourable President of the Macau Financial Markets Association, Mr. Chan Kam Chun, The Honourable President of the Association of Macau Financial Employees, Mr. Ng Chi Peng, Distinguished guests, friends of media, dear colleagues, Good afternoon, First of all allow me to give a warm welcome on behalf of the Monetary Authority of Macao (AMCM), to Mr. Francis Tam, Mr. Zhou Zhikui and the honoured guests who attend this cocktail reception. At the same time, I would like to express my gratitude for all the help and support you have rendered to AMCM in the past year. Only those who have survived the harsh winter appreciate the warmth of spring. After a severe winter which can happen only once in half a century, we gather gaily today when flowers bloom in the mellow March air. We look back and forward to celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Rat. 2007 is an eventful year. Global economic growth has slowed down due to the reverberations arising from the subprime crisis originated in the US. At the same time, financial risk which has hidden under years of economic prosperity starts to take its toll. There is the bank run of a financial institution in the UK, heavy losses have been incurred by giant multi-national financial groups. All these fiascos have created shock and uncertainties in international financial markets. However, despite all these turmoils in the international financial environment, Macao continues to enjoy a burgeoning economy. Financial risk is under proper control while the financial sector exhibits steady development. We can attribute all these successes to the endeavour of the MSAR Government and all sectors of our community, the prosperous services industry and the locomotive effect of large scale infrastructural investments. It goes without saying that we benefit much from the strong support and continued economic growth of our Motherland. In the past year, under the leadership of the MSAR Government, AMCM candidly fulfilled its duties. Via its persistent, risk based prudential supervision, AMCM laid a solid foundation based on which the Macao financial sector achieved steady development. Thanks to the strong economy, the financial sector of Macao has scored flying colours again. We can witness that the financial markets have become more steady and active, the number of financial institutions is on the rise accompanied by more ramified network, financial operation BIS Review 29/2008 1 
continues to expand, continued innovation is found in financial products, quality and sophistication of service is being enhanced, asset quality continues to improve while risk management is being strengthened.  As at the end of 2007, the number of banks in Macao stood at 28, with total assets of MOP328.1 billion which was an increase of 20% year-on-year. Deposits were valued at MOP268.2 billion and total loans stood at MOP108.6 billion which exhibited annual increase of 16.3% and 42.2% respectively. Loan deposit ratio stood at 40.5%, operational profit amounted to MOP4.146 billion while non-performing loans ratio dropped to 0.6%. Capital adequacy ratio stood at a robust level of 14.35%. Moreover, although the number of institutions remained the same, business volume of non-bank financial institutions including currency exchange, remittance and securities exhibited hefty increase by 43.6%, 47.3% and 221.1% respectively. Simultaneously, our insurance sector scored excellent results. There were 24 insurance institutions operating in Macao in 2007. Total annual insurance premiums amounted to MOP3.22 billion which was an increase of 29.8% year-on-year. Among which, life insurance premium was MOP2.25 billion while property insurance accounted for MOP970 million. In addition, there was a marked development in private pension fund business. As at the end of 2007, there were 35 registered retirement funds in which 432 retirement plans participated involving 78,859 employees which was an increase of 23.7% year-on-year and accounted for 28.17% of the working population. Assets under management were valued at MOP3.7 billion, an increase of 32% year-on-year. In handling the foreign exchange reserves and the MSAR reserve fund, we have consistently adopted a prudent and stable investment principle. In 2007, we achieved reasonable results in managing and growing the reserves. Foreign exchange reserve stood at MOP106.3 billion as at the end of 2007 which was an increase of 45.4% year-on-year. At the same time the MSAR reserve fund was valued at MOP12.24 billion, an annual growth of 5.34%.  Financial supervision is the major responsibility of AMCM. In accordance with the principles issued by relevant authoritative international organizations, we incessantly apply our prudent supervision to financial institutions to ensure healthy and stable development of our financial markets and financial institutions. In the past year, we emphasized on anti-money laundering (AML) and risk management. In AML aspect, we have continuously since the early 1990’s been revising our original AML structure in accordance with the ever changing development of international standard and change in local environment. Our efforts are sixfold. First, we adopted the recommendations of the mutual evaluation of APG/OGBS by formulating and implementing a practicable action plan. We then reinforced liaison with relevant organizations, especially the Financial Intelligence Office and relevant associations in the financial sector to establish a mechanism for regular communication. Third, we reviewed the execution of relevant guidelines by seeking the opinions of market participants. We are now revising existing guidelines by also taking into consideration the recommendations of the 2006 APG/OGBS mutual evaluation and discoveries of our supervision. Fourth, we rolled out comprehensive training for the industry, which included industry wide seminars, exchange indeas relating to discoveries in on-site inspections, symposium on money laundering/financing terrorism trend and case study. Fifth, we reinforced AML/CFT propaganda. Via public media or other channels such as open exhibitions, advertisements, and leaflets, we attempted to enhance public knowledge and cooperation in our AML/CFT efforts. Last, we accepted technical assistance from the IMF in perfecting the procedures and practicable arrangements relating to AML on-site inspection. In the realm of risk management, AMCM adopts a risk-based approach in accordance with international standard and practice in its daily supervisory work. On the premise, we continued to supervise all authorized institutions by conducting on-site inspections, off-site surveillances and prudential meetings. In 2007, AMCM issued “Guideline on Management of Country 2 BIS Review 29/2008 
Risks” and “Determination of Market Risk Adjusted Capital Adequacy Ratio” to be adopted by financial institutions which will no doubt enhance the stability of our financial system. In the domain of insurance supervision, we emphasized on the revision and perfection of related legislations. At the same time we strengthened our inspection efforts, bashed illegal insurance activities. In perfecting related legislations, we revised “Mandatory Automobile Civil Liability Insurance” and “Mandatory Labour Civil Liability Insurance”. Simultaneously, we enhanced inspection of AML measures implemented by insurance institutions. In 2007, AMCM carried out on-site inspections on insurance institutions operating in Macao, accentuating our efforts in regulating the operation of our insurance market.  We strive to maintain a stable exchange rate. In 2007, China achieved record high trade surplus. There was a hefty increase in exchange reserves. The Yuan continued to appreciate against US Dollar which gave rise to depreciation of the Pataca against the Yuan. It fueled the pressure on inflation in Macao. Against such a backdrop, AMCM adhered to rules of currency board and link rate, maintained the relative stability of the Pataca, which facilitated stable operation of the Macao economy.  AMCM promotes actively cross border financial cooperation. In 2007, as usual, AMCM participated in activities relating to financial cooperation with the Mainland, our neighbouring regions, countries and international organizations and encouraged the financial industry of Macao to communicate and cooperate with overseas entities. For instance, we promoted closer cooperation between our financial sector and Portuguese speaking countries and actively participated in meetings with relevant international and regional organizations. We hosted related international activities and successfully hosted the OGBS 2007 annual general meeting. We advocated and deepened financial cooperation between Macao and Guangdong as well as between Macao and Shenzhen. We reinforced cooperation with various financial regulatory bodies with a view to effectively bashing illegal financial activities through execution of cross border supervision. We actively encouraged the enlargement of RMB business in Macao, promoted further development of RMB business, propagate the circulation of Pataca on the Mainland, reinforced cross border settlement and cooperation in financial infrastructure and opened up the clearing system for Hong Kong Dollar cheques. In retrospect, we are proud to say that 2007 was again a fruitful year for the Macao financial sector. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Monetary Authority of Macao, to express our heartfelt gratitude for the continued guidance and support from Mr. Francis Tam; for the care and support from Mr. Zhou Zhikui; and sincere thanks to the practitioners of our financial sector for their hard work in the past year. I would also like to congratulate you on the results achieved by you ladies and gentlemen in the past year. At the same time, I would also like to thank the colleagues of AMCM for their hard work. There are new challenges ahead at the beginning of the year. There is a shadow hanging over the global economy right at the start. The US subprime crisis appears to be deteriorating which adds uncertainty to the international financial markets. Financial risk has increased. Against such an international economic and financial backdrop, it is possible that Macao will be adversely affected to a certain degree. It is likely that the Macao economy will experience a slow down after rapid growth. Therefore, financial institutions should put risk mitigation as their primary objective this year. With the support of the MSAR Government and market participants, AMCM will continue to enhance and strengthen risk management based on the concept of risk-based supervision to ensure the stability and development of our financial industry. Simultaneously, we shall strive to maintain the opening up, diversification and internationalization of our financial sector to create a healthy financial environment conducive to the sustainable prosperity of Macao. Last but not the least, I sincerely wish you success and good health. Thank you. BIS Review 29/2008 3 
Caleb M Fundanga: Financing for gender equality Opening remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the official launch of the Financial Institutions exhibition in commemoration of International Women’s Day, Lusaka, 5 March 2008. *      *      * • The Honourable Minister for Gender and Women in Development • The Country Coordinator of the United Nations System • The Permanent Secretary, Gender in Development Division • The Director, Environmental Council of Zambia • Chief Executives of Financial Service Providers • Heads of Non Governmental Organisations • Invited Guests • Ladies and Gentlemen I am honoured this morning to address you at the launch of this important Financial Sector Exhibition by financial service providers, in commemoration of the International Women’s Day for 2008, under the theme “Financing for Gender Equality”. The purpose of this exhibition is for financial service providers to showcase how they are contributing to financing for gender equality. It also provides an opportunity for the various institutions to market financial products that can be accessed by women. A further objective is the sensitization of the financial service providers and indeed the public at large to the need for gender mainstreaming in access to finance. International Women’s Day began with the declaration of International Year for Women in 1975. Since then, many countries world-wide celebrate International Women’s Day to recognize the achievements of women without regard to national, ethnic, cultural, economic or political divisions. International Women’s Day is an occasion to look back on past struggles and accomplishments but even more importantly a time to look ahead to untapped potential and opportunities that await future generations of women. In Zambia today we recognize the strides that have been made by women in national development and we look ahead at the challenges that are before us as we strive to achieve our goal of gender equality. In this regard, Zambia is a signatory to many international instruments and Conventions seeking to empower women. These include the United nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the SADC Declaration on Gender and Development. This declaration calls for the equal representation of women and men in the decision making structures of member states at all levels, and also for the achievement of at least 30 per cent target of women in political and decision-making structures. I must concede here, Ladies and Gentlemen, that although we have made significant strides as a country in women representation; we are yet to meet the target of 30 per cent. I still believe that this target is not impossible to attain. With concerted effort we can achieve and even exceed it because this country has scores of women with untapped potential. This exhibition gives us an opportunity to identify this potential and encourage our women to stand up, and be counted and contribute to the development of this country. In this regard, the Bank of Zambia and the financial service providers under its regulation and supervision are pleased to be part of the celebrations for International Women’s Day 2008 Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, our country has made great economic strides in the past few years. We have had positive economic growth averaging 5% in the last five years. The macroeconomic environment has stabilised with the achievement of single digit inflation as well as reduced interest rates. In addition we have seen increased investments in the mining and other productive sectors. This improved environment presents great opportunities BIS Review 29/2008 1 
for our country for both men and women. As you all know, women have from time immemorial taken centre stage in the running of small and medium enterprises ranging from agriculture, mining, and tourism, to manufacturing as well as cross border trading. All these economic activities need financing in order to grow and contribute to our country’s Gross Domestic Product. Ladies and Gentlemen, this brings me to the theme of International Women’s day for this year and that is “Financing for Gender Equality”. At the international level, commitments have been made on financing for gender equality and the empowerment of women by governments all over the world. A large number of governments have taken initiatives to integrate gender perspectives into their national budgets in order to reflect the differentiated needs of women and men. At a national level, Zambia is committed to financing for gender equality. The theme for the 2008 national budget is “unlocking resources for economic empowerment and wealth creation”. I believe the economic empowerment is for both men and women. Furthermore, in order to achieve our vision to be a prosperous middle income country by 2030, both women and men must be empowered equally. Women must not be left behind in the drive to this vision. I recognize the creation of the Ministry of Gender and Women in Development, as a deliberate effort by the Government to ensure that the needs of women are addressed. Let me also take this opportunity to appreciate the efforts by our cooperating partners in the financing of activities promoting gender equality. This is evident by the number of non governmental organizations looking at women’s issues, some of whom are represented here today. Ladies and Gentlemen, when we talk about financing, we must focus on the institutions through which most of this financing is channeled namely, financial service providers, most of whom are participating in this exhibition. No matter what kind of financing, be it government, donor or private financing, it is channeled through our financial institutions. As earlier stated, the main reason this exhibition is being held is to showcase how our financial institutions are contributing to financing for gender equality. I also hope that the exhibition will encourage increased access to financial services by not only women but also men from all walks of life. Ladies and Gentlemen, the 2005 Finscope Survey undertaken by Finmark Trust confirmed that levels of access to financial services in Zambia are extremely low. Fewer than 15% of adult Zambians are reported to have had access to commercial banks. Of the 15%, the majority were men. Therefore more needs to be done to enable women have increased access to financial services. This is why one of the strategic objectives of the Bank of Zambia in its 2008-2011 Strategic Plan is to promote financial inclusion. The more financial services are extended to ordinary citizens and small business enterprises, the more there will be a greater proportion of women amongst those receiving these services. We should note that it is women who have special needs in terms of access to financial services. In small businesses, such as small scale farming and market trading, it is very important to have a safe place to save money, maintain working capital and also access loan facilities. Ladies and Gentlemen, as we discuss financing for gender equality, there are fundamental questions we need to ask ourselves such as: • Are services available from a financial service provider more to the advantage of men, rather than women? • Are men’s interests served more than women’s? • Do financial service providers enable women to overcome discrimination against them in their economic life? I believe these questions will be answered positively by the institutions present here. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am happy to inform you that among the products on exhibition here, we have Finance Building Society marketing loans without collateral. This is a very welcome 2 BIS Review 29/2008 
development as one of the challenges to women accessing finance is the requirement for collateral which most do not have. We also have the United Nations country office with all their respective agencies participating in this exhibition to show case how they are supporting women in this country. We appreciate your collaboration with us in this exhibition. The Environmental Council of Zambia has also joined with the financial institutions to increase our awareness on environmental issues and thus promote sustainable development. Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe the next two days will be very informative and rewarding. We have 10 commercial banks, 2 building societies and over 10 microfinance institutions exhibiting their products. I understand that tomorrow, these institutions will be recognizing some of their most loyal and exemplary customers and for this I commend them. I am sure that not only women but men will find this exhibition beneficial and I wish you a productive and informative two days. Thank you. BIS Review 29/2008 3 
Randall S Kroszner: The importance of fundamentals in risk management Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the American Bankers Association Spring Summit Meeting, Washington DC, 11 March 2008. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * It is a pleasure to be addressing the new American Bankers Association, which has arisen from the successful merger of America's Community Bankers and the ABA. Your association truly represents the full range of banks in the United States. The focus of my remarks today – the importance of fundamentals in risk management – should still resonate with all of you, whether you are part of a large global bank or a smaller community bank. Unfortunately, recent market events have shown us that banking institutions still face some risk management challenges, including a need to refocus on some key fundamentals. The good news, however, is that we also have many examples of sound risk management practices during the recent disruptions.  Risk management challenges  Getting the fundamentals right – and being ever vigilant about their consistent application and execution – forms the basis of any sound risk management system. I am not trying to imply that implementing risk management fundamentals is easy; that is, just because something is fundamental does not mean that it comes naturally. In fact, there are a number of risk management challenges inherent in banking that require careful identification and attention. One of the most basic risk management challenges relates to concentration of risks. From the beginnings of banking, bankers always have had to be cautious to guard against, as the old adage says, "putting all their eggs in one basket." For example, Renaissance bankers learned the lesson – some of them the hard way – that they did better by lending not just to a few merchants active in one trade, but to a range of merchants active in a variety of trades. As risk management techniques grew over the centuries, bankers became more adept at identifying, measuring, and managing risk concentrations, but that does not mean the original problem presented by concentrations – that losses could occur all at the same time – has vanished. Indeed, some bankers occasionally forget that this challenge still exists, usually with unfavorable consequences. It is also important to note that concentrations in banking include not just basic lending, but also holding securities, trading complex instruments, providing liquidity facilities, engaging in off-balance sheet transactions, and conducting other financial activities. As banks have extended their range of activities and involvement in new markets, they must be particularly mindful of potential for concentrations of risk to arise for a number of reasons. First, any new activity will be less familiar and involve less data and experience for evaluating risk compared with long-standing activities or markets. Second, risk concentrations can be hidden during normal times and may only manifest themselves during times of stress when activities or instruments that might in normal times have little or negative correlation suddenly become correlated, such as with a market-wide increase in the demand for liquidity as we have seen recently. In other words, bankers may have far more eggs jostling around in the same basket, and each of those eggs may be more fragile than originally thought. BIS Review 29/2008 1 
Understanding the linkage between risk concentrations and capital is especially important, since the concentration of risk of a given portfolio markedly affects the amount of capital that should be held against it. Heavy concentrations can produce so-called fat tails in a loss distribution, meaning that considerably higher capital levels are required to support the risk taken. If one underestimates the amount of capital needed to be held against risk concentrations and/or the extent of the concentrations themselves, then a banker would realize that the initial level of capital was not sufficient and that remedial actions would need to be taken. Naturally, both large and small banks can continue to be successful and profitable by having some lending or other types of concentrations, but they need to be aware of the risks involved and have the proper risk management and capital to support those concentrations. Risk management fundamentals I would now like to elaborate on three key risk management fundamentals and their relationship to concentrations of risk in banking: Governance and risk control; risk identification and measurement; and liquidity risk management. In doing so, I will highlight some important findings from a report released last week by a group of supervisory agencies from France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, known as the Senior Supervisors Group or SSG.1 The report, "Observations on Risk Management Practices during the Recent Market Turbulence," provides a summary and analysis of a joint survey and review, initiated last autumn, of risk management practices to understand how different approaches fared during the recent financial stress. Although the analysis covered a group of the largest banking and securities firms, the lessons learned actually have relevance for all financial institutions of all sizes and scope – even those that have thus far not suffered from recent financial turbulence. I will also discuss a few other examples of supervisory activities, such as our recent guidance on commercial real estate concentrations, from which we have learned valuable lessons. Governance and controls I will start with perhaps one of the most fundamental aspects of risk management at banking organizations – in fact, at any organization: governance and controls. The SSG report highlighted solid senior management oversight and engagement as a key factor that differentiated performance during recent events. Clearly, senior management must take on a very active and involved role in risk management. Although this may seem somewhat obvious, a few recent cases demonstrate, unfortunately, that senior management may not always exercise proper oversight and may not have been as engaged as would have been wise. As supervisors, governance and controls is a key feature we look at in assessing risk management at an institution. Clearly, senior managers also need to ensure that they have proper understanding of the risks assumed by their firm, but this does not always happen. For example, we have seen some evidence that information was kept in silos within firms and not adequately distributed both vertically and horizontally within certain firms. This segregation prevented senior managers from developing an enterprise-wide perspective on risks to the whole entity. It meant that managers were not fully aware of the extent to which the risks of the different activities undertaken by the firm could, first, become correlated in times of stress and, second, result in high concentrations of risk exposures. To be quite specific, in particular cases, senior management was not fully aware of the firm's latent concentrations to U.S. subprime mortgages, because they did not realize that in addition to the subprime mortgages                                                  1  The report is available at: http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/banking/2008/rp080306.html. 2 BIS Review 29/2008 
on their books, they had exposure through off-balance sheet vehicles holding mortgages, through claims on counterparties exposed to subprime, and through certain complex securities. Adequate distribution of information allows for an enterprise-wide perspective on risk. Information must percolate up to senior management, but top executives must, in turn, disseminate their views and analysis back down through the business lines. Effective risk management remains sturdy and durable only if supported by strong and independent risk functions that produce unbiased information. Empowering independent risk managers results in clear, dispassionate thinking about the entire firm's risk profile, with no favoritism toward any business unit. Senior managers should encourage risk managers to dig deep to uncover not only risks within each business unit, but also risk concentrations that can arise from the set of activities undertaken by the firm as a whole as well as latent risks – such as hidden risk concentrations that can arise from correlation of risk in times of stress. Such risk management assessments should lead risk managers to point out cases in which certain business lines are assuming too much risk.  In other words, it is good to have a few people within the institution who – to paraphrase a former Federal Reserve Chairman – know when to take away the punch bowl. Being the party pooper, however, can be very difficult in any organization, and that is why it is crucial for the risk manager to be known as an independent voice who is influential with top management and for top executives, of large or small firms, to set the appropriate "tone at the top" with respect to the importance of independent and unbiased risk evaluation. As I discussed in detail at a speech before the Global Association of Risk Professionals a couple of weeks ago, any successful organization needs to develop appropriate mechanisms to ensure adherence to, and sustainability of, its risk management.2 Incentive structures are a key mechanism for this purpose. Appropriate incentives reward good behavior and penalize inappropriate behavior. Of course, incentives work best when they are known well in advance, that is, when they serve as ex ante signals of what should and should not be done. Naturally, in very large organizations it is difficult for senior management to monitor each individual, so incentives need to be consistent, permeate even the lowest levels of the organization, and remind each individual that his or her risk-taking affects the whole enterprise.  Limits and controls can be useful tools for creating the right incentives and sending appropriate signals, but they of course need to be tailored individually to each firm. Problems can arise when incentives are not properly structured and appropriate "risk discipline" is not exercised – for example, when limits and controls are not set or, if they are set, when adherence to them is not monitored or enforced. Such controls provide incentives for business-line leaders to assume only the risks that the firm can absorb because they penalize those who try to take on excessive risk or inadequate mitigation in the name of maximizing short-term profit. This is just as true at large international firms as it is at community banks. Risk identification and measurement The second fundamental of sound risk management relates to risk identification and measurement. Timely and accurate information is the lifeblood of sound risk management. A good risk-management structure must encompass risks across the entire firm, gathering and processing information on an enterprise-wide basis in real time. In short, you cannot manage your risks if you do not know what they are.                                                  2  Randall S. Kroszner, 2008, "Improving Risk Management in Light of Recent Market Events," speech delivered at the Global Association of Risk Management Professionals Annual Risk Convention, New York, February 25. BIS Review 29/2008 3 
Aggregating information across a large, diversified financial institution is not easy and should be done with appropriate care and with adequate resources for checking timeliness and veracity. The SSG report, for example, noted that some firms could not easily integrate market and counterparty risk positions across risks types, making it difficult for their executives to identify concentrations across the entire firm. Aggregating information about risk exposures and the concentration of risks may not be as challenging at smaller institutions, but checking the timeliness and veracity of the data is important at institutions of all sizes. In other words, risk managers should live by the adage "Trust but verify," being careful not to rely on assessments or data from others without conducting proper due diligence. It is also worth noting that financial institutions should gather a wide range of relevant information before they see market troubles brewing. In other words, scrambling for information once turbulence sets in is not good practice. Understanding a firm's true risk exposures requires examining not just risks on the balance sheet, but also off-balance-sheet risks that are sometimes more difficult to identify and often not so easy to quantify. Latent risks from certain complex products and certain risky activities should be properly recognized, because they can manifest themselves when market turbulence sets in. As the SSG report indicates, some firms had a poor understanding of the risks inherent in certain complex products or failed to recognize that certain activities contained latent risks that could be manifest in unexpected concentrations of risk exposures when market turbulence arose. For example, we witnessed some lapses in credit risk identification and measurement when, as I noted, certain institutions underestimated the actual credit risk of subprime mortgages and the secondary or tertiary effects brought on by disruptions in subprime markets for their broader set of activities. Stress testing and scenario analysis are of paramount importance, since they can reveal potential concentrations of risk that may not be apparent from using information gleaned from normal times. The SSG report emphasizes this point, but the U.S. banking agencies have also highlighted its importance for smaller- and medium-sized institutions, for example in the guidance on commercial real estate (CRE) concentrations we issued at the end of 2006. After on-the-ground supervisors reported seeing increases in CRE concentrations at many institutions across the country, supervisors examined historical data on risks associated with CRE concentrations to provide the basis for developing supervisory guidance. That guidance counseled banking organizations with high CRE exposures relative to capital to engage in stress testing to evaluate behavior of those exposures and the impact on capital in adverse circumstances. Some financial institutions already employ stress tests, but they should re-check their robustness in light of recent events. For example, banking organizations might benefit from expanding tests to include a wider set of variables to stress and to consider shocks they might have considered much less probable one or two years ago. Banks should also remember that past experience is not always predictive of future events, meaning that they should be somewhat creative in designing potential shocks. In CRE, for example, banks should move beyond considering single-name risk and include scenarios involving broader risks to the CRE sector and how such risk may be correlated in times of stress with other parts of the portfolio.  In addition, a number of risk-measurement and risk-quantification challenges relate to valuation practices, particularly with new products. Firms should have greater motivation for applying proper valuation practices as part of good risk management.3 At the center of these practices is the ability to make appropriate judgments about the quality of information being                                                  3  Randall S. Kroszner, 2007, "Innovation, Information, and Regulation in Financial Markets," speech delivered at the Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum, Philadelphia, November 30. 4 BIS Review 29/2008 
used for valuations. The process usually starts with an initial experimentation phase in which market participants learn a great deal about the product's expected performance and risk characteristics, preferably under different market conditions. Conducting due diligence about new products can be costly and take time, but it is usually worth it. Unfortunately, in some recent cases new products were developed very quickly and not properly "road-tested." In observing the valuation challenges, the "Trust but verify" adage has equal application. Market participants must ensure that they do not make valuation decisions based solely on excessive reliance of external ratings or evaluations, but that they also undertake their own assessment. And I would suggest that the value of independent due diligence on the part of market participants is especially high for newer and more-complex products. Encouragingly, we have examples of some firms recognizing the potential risks of broad market disruptions, for example, if there were dramatic and unexpected price movements, or if market illiquidity set in. Those firms faring better typically use a number of tools to assess risk positions that draw on differing underlying assumptions. Such tools provide management with more information and different perspectives on its potential risk exposures. In the best cases, the tools are flexible enough to allow perspectives on risk to change as business conditions change. For example, they can help identify when risk concentrations are changing as a result of market movements or changes in counterparty positions. Liquidity risk management Now I wish to consider the third fundamental. Liquidity risk management. Banks, of course, have been managing expected liquidity demands since the beginning of banking itself.4 Because of its central role in the business of banking, liquidity risk requires rigorous and effective management. Naturally, financial institutions both large and small must pay careful attention to liquidity risks, even if they manifest themselves in different ways. Regarding recent events, a number of financial firms were surprised by the extent of market disruptions and were forced to take funding actions not anticipated in their contingency funding plans, including some decisions to support affiliates that were based on reputational concerns rather than contractual obligations. At the same time, some institutions were able to avoid more serious problems from these events by aligning treasury functions more closely with risk-management processes and incorporating information from all businesses into global liquidity planning, including actual and contingent liquidity risk. They also made attempts to embed market liquidity premia or apply market liquidity haircuts in pricing models and valuations.  Recent events have shown that during times of systemwide stress, liquidity shocks can become correlated so that the same factors that can lead to liquidity problems for the bank's assets or off-balance sheet vehicles can simultaneously put pressure on banks' own funding liquidity. Again, we see the trouble that risk concentrations can cause if an institution has not tried to identify them in advance and take steps to mitigate their effects. As with other risk areas, supervisors suggest extensive use of firm-wide stress testing to ensure the incorporation of low-probability but potentially severe liquidity events that may have the potential to converge. Smaller banks, as well as large, global banks, should conduct liquidity stress tests to evaluate what could happen to liquidity positions in times of stress. We have also noticed the potential for liquidity risk to have an impact on capital adequacy. As you are well aware, several large global banks ended up having to deal with so-called unplanned asset expansions arising from a variety of liquidity stresses related to the asset side of the balance sheet. In a few cases, these unexpected increases in the balance sheet created some pressures on capital ratios, even if the level of capital remained stable.                                                  4  Randall S. Kroszner (2008), "Liquidity-Risk Management in the Business of Banking," speech delivered at the Institute of International Bankers, Washington, DC, March 3. BIS Review 29/2008 5 
Although bank liquidity management and capital management may be conceptually distinct, recent events illustrate in practice how liquidity management and capital management are intimately related, particularly in times of financial stress. Since risk concentrations have the potential to manifest themselves during times of stress and at that time adversely affect capital positions, it is particularly important that firms assess how liquidity events could place pressure on capital levels. In a nutshell: liquidity problems always have the potential to affect bank balance sheets and, in doing so, bank capital adequacy. Conclusion One of the most basic lessons of banking is that lending concentrations must be carefully identified, monitored, and managed. As I noted at the outset, the current financial market turbulence underscores the importance of getting the fundamentals of sound risk management right and being ever vigilant about their consistent application, execution, and improvement in light of new data and experiences. I have highlighted the importance of three fundamentals – governance and risk control; risk identification and measurement; and liquidity risk management – and the SSG report provides evidence that those institutions taking care to get these fundamentals right generally performed better during recent events than other institutions. Concentrations of risk can pose challenges to financial institutions, and top managers must be aware of their potential and have a risk management system in place ready to deal with them. This is true not only for large global players but also for small-and medium-sized banks, as my discussion of the CRE concentration guidance emphasized. As supervisors, we strive to achieve the appropriate balance, recognizing that supervision and regulation has costs and benefits that need to be weighed against one another. For instance, we need to be careful that lending is conducted on a prudent basis, and at the same time, take care not to stifle the provision of credit when it is done properly. Before concluding, I would like to mention a topic in supervision and regulation that I have not yet touched upon in these remarks, namely, credit cards. As you know, the Federal Reserve has proposed new rules under Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act, regarding open-end credit to require new, more informative, and consumer-tested disclosures by credit card issuers and expects to propose new rules for credit cards under the Federal Reserve's unfair and deceptive acts and practices authority. To help us better assess the current state of the credit card market and possible challenges in credit card markets for consumers and others involved in those markets, I have invited key credit card market participants – card issuers and processors, consumer advocates, counseling agencies, and other regulatory agencies – to participate in a forum hosted by the Federal Reserve Board on April 8. The forum will allow us to collect additional information about relevant industry trends and to identify areas that may warrant action or further study. 6 BIS Review 29/2008 
Frederic S Mishkin: Comfort zones, shmumfort zones Speech by Mr Frederic S Mishkin, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Sandridge Lecture of the Virginia Association of Economists and the H Parker Willis Lecture of Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia, 27 March 2008. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * It's a genuine pleasure to address the Virginia Association of Economists here at Washington and Lee University on an important issue in monetary policy. Some of you may be wondering about the meaning of my speech title – "Comfort Zones, Shmumfort Zones." Well, putting the "shm" before a word is a way to cast a bit of skepticism on it. Thus, if your friend tells you that you are "fancy, shmancy," then you might be overdressed for the occasion. And if you exclaim, "Email, shmemail!" then you've just found your inbox overloaded. Of course, there's also a significant distinction between the expressions "shlemiel" and "shlimazel," but that's more-advanced material that I will defer until another speech.  Although this speech has a somewhat humorous title, my remarks will address a serious and important topic, namely, how central banks promote the stability of prices and economic activity and how this policy framework is communicated to the public. More specifically, I will consider whether central banks should describe price stability in terms of a desired range of inflation outcomes – often referred to as a "comfort zone" for inflation – or in terms of a specific numerical value at which the inflation rate is expected to settle down over some reasonable time horizon.  After a brief review of the academic literature regarding the level of inflation that best promotes longer-run economic growth and employment, I will discuss several conceptual issues regarding the pitfalls of comfort zones and the benefits of specifying a point objective for inflation. Finally, I will move from theory to practice and consider the experiences of other major industrial countries.  As usual, my remarks reflect only my own views and are not intended to reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or of anyone else associated with the Federal Reserve System.1What is the optimal level of the inflation rate? Research in monetary economics usually specifies monetary policy objectives in terms of stabilizing both inflation and economic activity.2 Those two goals are related: Maintaining price stability promotes stronger economic activity in the long run. What do we mean by price stability? A widely cited definition is that the inflation rate is sufficiently low so that households and businesses do not need to take inflation into account                                                  1  I'd like to thank Etienne Gagnon, Steven Kamin, Linda Kole, Andrew Levin, and David Lopez-Salido for helpful comments and assistance with this speech. 2  Indeed, this specification of monetary policy objectives is exactly what is suggested by the dual mandate that the Congress has given to the Federal Reserve to promote both price stability and maximum employment (Mishkin, 2007a, 2008). BIS Review 35/2008 1 
in making everyday decisions.3 Broadly speaking, I believe this definition of price stability is a reasonable one, and in practice, central banks around the world have chosen average levels of inflation between 0 and 3 percent as consistent with this criterion. However, this range can be narrowed a bit further by considering the implications of economic theory and empirical evidence about the average inflation rate that produces the best economic outcomes. In particular, the literature on the optimal inflation rate not only bolsters the case for low inflation but also highlights the risks of maintaining an excessively low inflation rate. The case for low inflation All economists agree that hyperinflations, such as the one in Germany in the 1920s, are particularly damaging due to the resulting distortion of economic incentives and the waste of valuable resources. Even rates of inflation far short of hyperinflation appear detrimental to economic performance, as evidenced by the double-digit inflation rates of the 1970s. And over the past decade or so, central bankers and academic economists have reached a remarkable degree of consensus about the desirability of low and stable inflation – and as you know, arriving at a consensus is quite rare for economists.  The average rate of inflation distorts the efficient allocation of resources through three main channels. First, because some firms face costs in changing their prices, a rise in the general price level tends to generate undesirable movements in relative prices, thereby leading to an inefficient allocation of resources. This relative price dispersion increases with inflation, and the desirability of minimizing these relative price distortions provides a key rationale for price stability.4  Second, inflation is an implicit tax on capital. In an imperfectly indexed tax system, inflation seriously distorts saving and investment because investment income is taxed on the basis of its nominal rather than inflation-adjusted or real value. In those circumstances, price stability may considerably improve the efficiency of the economy.5 Third, a higher average inflation rate tends to generate distortions by raising the cost of holding currency and other non-interest-bearing assets.6  Can inflation be too low? While the benefits of low inflation are now widely recognized, somewhat less attention has been given to the pitfalls of maintaining inflation rates very close to zero, so I will now discuss                                                  3  For example, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan (2002) stated that "price stability is best thought of as an environment in which inflation is so low and stable over time that it does not materially enter into the decisions of households and firms." 4  Over the past couple of decades, an extensive literature has analyzed the benefits of low average inflation in a so-called New Keynesian framework. These studies generally start from a neoclassical model and incorporate two key features: monopolistic competition and costly price adjustment. Refer, for instance, to Goodfriend and King (1997) and Woodford (2003). 5  Interestingly, the larger the burden coming from the interaction of inflation and the capital income tax, the more government tax revenues will fall when inflation is reduced. Feldstein (1997, 1999) provides a quantitative assessment of the benefits of price stability based on the interaction of inflation and the tax system, showing that a lower average inflation rate stimulates investment by reducing the effective tax on capital income. 6  Because real money balances bear no interest, the opportunity cost of holding them is the nominal rate of interest. Higher inflation then leads to higher nominal interest rates, and hence lowers real balances, which causes a welfare loss because the social cost of producing real balances has remained substantially unaffected. In the absence of other frictions in the economy, inflation is viewed in this class of models as a tax on real balances (Bailey, 1956; Friedman 1969). However, the costs from higher holdings of real money balances has arguably become much less relevant as our economy has become more financially sophisticated. Households hold only modest amounts of cash, so these "shoe leather" costs are likely to be fairly trivial. 2 BIS Review 35/2008 
this issue in somewhat greater detail. Specifically, if the average inflation rate is too low, then the economy faces a greater risk that a given adverse shock could distort labor markets, induce debt deflation, or cause monetary policy to become constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. These risks imply that undershooting a zero inflation objective is potentially more costly than overshooting that objective by the same amount, and that setting the inflation objective at a rate a bit above zero provides some insurance against these risks.  Downward nominal wage rigidities. Inflation at rates close to zero might create nonnegligible costs to the economy because firms may be relatively reluctant to cut nominal wages.7 Sticky nominal wages can prevent labor markets from reaching the optimal equilibrium. However, empirical evidence from Switzerland and Japan indicates that in an environment of deflation or very low inflation, downward nominal wage rigidities become less prevalent.8Debt deflation. Keeping the average inflation rate close to zero increases the likelihood that the economy will experience occasional episodes of deflation. Deflation can be particularly dangerous for an advanced economy, in which debt contracts often have long maturities. As described by Irving Fisher (1933), an episode of deflation can lead to "debt deflation," that is, a substantial rise in the real indebtedness of households and firms, because the nominal values of debt obligations are largely predetermined whereas the nominal values of household income and business revenue are falling together with the general price level.9 Indeed, the deterioration of the balance sheets of households and firms can result in financial turmoil that contributes to further deflation and greater macroeconomic instability.  The zero lower bound. With a very low average inflation rate, monetary policy is also more likely to encounter circumstances in which short-term interest rates are constrained by the so-called zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.10 Specifically, investors will never choose to lend money at a negative nominal interest rate because they always have the option of simply holding cash at a zero interest rate; thus, nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero.  A number of researchers in the Federal Reserve System and elsewhere have analyzed the implications of the zero lower bound in estimated dynamic rational expectations models.11 If the economy faces a large contractionary shock, the optimal monetary policy response is to                                                  7  Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (2000). The main idea can be described as follows: During periods of low productivity growth and no inflation, firms that need to cut their relative wages can do so only by cutting money wages. In the presence of downward nominal wage rigidities, firms will keep relative wages too high and employment too low. Hence, very low rates of inflation might prevent real wages from adjusting downward in response to declining labor demand in certain industries or regions, thereby leading to increased unemployment and hindering the re-allocation of labor from declining sectors to expanding sectors. Research by staff at the Federal Reserve Board has found evidence that downward nominal wage rigidities exist in the United States (Estevao and Wilson, 1998; Lebow, Saks, and Wilson, 2003). However, the evidence for the mechanism through which low inflation raises the natural rate of unemployment is not at all clear cut. Inflation not only can "grease" the labor market and thus allow downward shifts in real wages in response to a decline in demand along, but it can also put friction in the system ("sand") by increasing the noise in relative real wages (Groshen and Schweitzer, 1999). The noise reduces the information content of nominal wages and hence the efficiency of the process by which workers are allocated across occupations and industries. 8  See Kuroda and Yamamoto (2003) for analysis of the Japanese experience, Fehr and Goette (2005) for analysis of the Swiss experience, and Kim and Ruge-Murcia (2007) for macroeconometric analysis of the implications of downward nominal wage rigidity for the United States. 9  The fact that the deflation is anticipated does not completely rule out a negative effect on balance sheets: If the debt is sufficiently long-lived, there still is some redistribution from debtors to creditors. 10  Although these considerations are important for the design of monetary policy, a central bank can make use of other policy tools if the policy rate does become constrained by the zero lower bound (Bernanke, 2002). 11  See Reifschneider and Williams (2000), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003, 2004), Coenen, Orphanides, and Wieland (2004), Wolman (2005), and the citations therein.

push the short-term nominal interest rate below the level of expected inflation, thereby reducing real interest rates enough to mitigate the impact of the shock. But if the central bank has an inflation objective very close to zero, the zero lower bound can prevent the full implementation of this policy response, and hence the economy will tend to exhibit greater volatility of economic activity and inflation. In contrast, given shocks like those seen over the past several decades, an average inflation rate higher than about 1 percent substantially reduces the frequency with which the economy hits the zero lower bound. An inflation objective of about 2 percent implies that monetary policy is rarely constrained by the zero lower bound and thereby minimizes the adverse consequences for macroeconomic stability. Why comfort zones? These considerations provide the foundations for a broad consensus among academic economists and monetary policymakers around the world that the optimal inflation rate is in the range of about 1 to 3 percent; that is, an average inflation rate outside this range would be detrimental to longer-run health of the economy. In light of that consensus, it might seem natural to specify price stability in terms of a range of acceptable outcomes for inflation. Indeed, several present and past FOMC participants have used the term "comfort zone" and specified a 1 to 2 percent range, thereby providing valuable information regarding their views about what levels of inflation are consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.12The analytical case for a point objective Nevertheless, while a "comfort zone" approach may seem appealing, analytical considerations reveal some disadvantages of that approach as well as some significant benefits of specifying and maintaining a point objective for inflation. The pitfalls of comfort zones In particular, I would like to highlight three specific pitfalls associated with the "comfort zone" approach. Confusion about objectives. First, when the price stability objective is formulated in terms of an acceptable range of inflation outcomes, the policy implications may be difficult to interpret. For example, if the comfort zone spans a range from 1 to 2 percent, does that mean that policymakers are equally comfortable with inflation rates of 1.1 percent and 1.9 percent? Furthermore, confusion about inflation objectives might make it harder for a committee of policymakers to decide on the appropriate course of monetary policy. When one member advocates a more accommodative policy stance than other members, it may not be clear whether that reflects a more negative outlook for the economy or a greater willingness to allow inflation to settle in or near the top of the comfort zone. Thus, the comfort zone approach might lead to greater confusion in policy deliberations and hence produce a less effective decisionmaking process. Perverse expectations dynamics. Second, framing price stability in terms of a comfort zone could lead to perverse expectations dynamics and thereby generate larger fluctuations in economic activity, especially if policymakers maintain a neutral stance regardless of where the inflation rate falls within the comfort zone.                                                   12  The term "comfort zone" appeared in the headline of a September 2002 New York Times interview with former Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer (Stevenson, 2002) and has subsequently been used by Federal Reserve officials on numerous occasions, including prominent speeches by Bernanke (2005) and Yellen (2006). 4 BIS Review 35/2008 
For instance, a negative shock to aggregate demand that brought inflation near the bottom end of the range might cause long-run expected inflation to fall, which would raise the real interest rate if the nominal interest rate remained unchanged. This rise in the real interest rate would exert a further drag that could exacerbate the adverse impact of the original negative shock on the economy. Similarly, a positive shock to aggregate demand that raised inflation to the upper end of the range might cause a rise in expected inflation and thus a decline in the real interest rate, which would provide further stimulus to the economy. The result would then be more pronounced swings in economic activity. Nonlinearities and macroeconomic stability. Third, if a central bank places a high degree of emphasis on the boundaries of the comfort zone, then these threshold effects imply nonlinearities in the conduct of monetary policy that are likely to produce less desirable economic outcomes (Orphanides and Wieland, 2000). For example, the stance of policy would remain roughly neutral in response to a shock that leaves inflation just below the upper end of the comfort zone, whereas a slightly larger shock that pushes inflation just above that boundary would cause an abrupt shift to a contractionary policy stance. Such a "stop-start" approach is likely to cause greater uncertainty in financial markets and would also tend to generate greater volatility of the macroeconomy. The benefits of maintaining a point objective In contrast to the various pitfalls associated with comfort zones, there are a number of significant benefits to maintaining a point objective for inflation. Clarity in communication. First, as I have emphasized in several previous speeches, communication plays a crucial role in the success of monetary policy (Mishkin, 2007b and 2007c). And in this regard, it seems virtually self-evident that communicating about a single numerical value for the inflation objective is more straightforward than communicating about an interval or range of numbers. Of course, regardless of whether the central bank has a point objective or a comfort zone, it is inevitable that the inflation rate will fluctuate in response to various shocks; that's why it is also crucial for policymakers to communicate clearly about the outlook for the macroeconomy and about the central bank's strategy for promoting the stability of prices and economic activity.  Anchoring inflation expectations. An explicit point objective anchors inflation expectations more effectively than a comfort zone. If the comfort zone is considered to be a zone of indifference, then the inflation rate might well exhibit highly persistent fluctuations inside the zone, perhaps even looking like a random walk within that range. In that case, if inflation drifts up to the top of the comfort zone, then the private sector could take the view that inflation might remain at that rate for an extended period of time, especially if policymakers are not taking any action to bring inflation back toward the midpoint of the range. Thus, the comfort zone might then generate somewhat larger fluctuations in longer-run inflation expectations, which would in turn tend to contribute to wider fluctuations in actual inflation. In contrast, with a transparent and credible point objective, longer-run inflation expectations will be firmly anchored at that rate. The insurance motive. Even if policymakers are relatively indifferent about the level of inflation within a comfort zone, research on the optimal design of monetary policy indicates that they shouldn't be: The central bank should actively seek to bring inflation back to the midpoint of its comfort zone, thereby minimizing the probability that inflation wanders outside the boundaries of that zone. In effect, the optimal policy strategy takes into account the benefits of insurance, and hence the midpoint of the zone becomes the point objective for inflation (Mishkin and Westelius, 2006). BIS Review 35/2008 5 
The empirical case for a point objective Now let's turn to the international experience.13 As shown in table 1, a number of major industrial economies have adopted explicit inflation objectives In 1990, the newly independent Reserve Bank of New Zealand became the first central bank to establish such an objective. Many governments have followed in New Zealand's footsteps, and the inflation objectives have been variously expressed in the form of a point, a range with a preferred midpoint, or a comfort zone (that is, a range of indifference). In some cases, the inflation objective was adopted in part as a way to lock in the benefits of recent disinflation and to prevent the return of adverse inflation outcomes. New Zealand, whose inflation performance in the 1970s and 1980s was the worst among the industrialized economies, is arguably one such example. In other instances, inflation had already been kept low and stable for some time, and the adoption of an explicit inflation objective followed from extensive research and debate on issues such as the benefits of low and stable inflation, the presence of biases in the measurement of inflation, and the importance of central bank communications. Although the mix of reasons and circumstances that led to the adoption of an explicit inflation objective varies across economies, there is a remarkable degree of similarity in the characteristics of these policy frameworks, from which three broad conclusions can be drawn. First, there is a fairly general consensus among central banks throughout the world that the average inflation rate should be somewhere between about 1 percent and 3 percent. Second, point objectives have proven more effective than ranges in anchoring inflation expectations. Third, when the inflation objective is formulated in terms of a range, the implied degree of nonlinearity in the central bank's policy actions can be alleviated by placing increased emphasis on the midpoint of the range.  New Zealand The monetary policy objective of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is to "keep future CPI inflation outcomes between 1 and 3 per cent on average over the medium term." The narrowness of this range may seem surprising, especially given the historical volatility of inflation in New Zealand. After all, New Zealand is a small open economy with a large commodity-producing sector, and as a result the economy is particularly subject to external shocks that can have a relatively large impact on consumer prices. In this context, the use of a narrow comfort zone would increase the odds that inflation would fall outside the band at certain times. Some observers have argued that such outcomes may undermine the public's trust in the central bank's ability to deliver inflation outcomes in line with its stated objective, and hence that the inflation band should be widened.14 Nevertheless, a wider band would hinder the anchoring of inflation expectations, which is pivotal to the successful pursuit of an explicit inflation objective. As the previous discussion has illustrated, expressing an inflation objective in terms of a range makes it more difficult for a central bank to anchor inflation expectations, especially in the absence of any explicit emphasis on the midpoint. A related issue is that the boundaries of the range may be seen as "hard edges," that is, inflation outcomes inside the range may be seen as qualitatively different from those outside the range. The nonlinear policy reactions implied by this approach can lead to greater variations in interest rates, exchange rates, and output. The international experience indicates that even when inflation bands with hard                                                  13  This section focuses on the major industrial economies. Mishkin (2000) considers the experiences of a number of emerging market economies that have adopted explicit inflation objectives. 14  Bernanke and others (1999) countered this line of reasoning by noting that "missing an entire range may be perceived by the public as more serious failure of policy than missing a point, or even a narrow band, (which happens almost inevitably), leading to a possible loss of credibility." 6 BIS Review 35/2008 
edges have been introduced, subsequent changes in the central bank's policy framework and communications have tended to soften the edges of the inflation band. The experience of New Zealand is particularly instructive in this regard. The Reserve Bank Act requires that price stability be defined in a specific and public contract, negotiated between the Minister of Finance and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Under the act, the Governor of the Reserve Bank is personally accountable for keeping inflation in line with the stated objective. (Indeed, the Governor could be fired for failing to do so.) Since 1990, price stability has been defined in terms of a band for the inflation rate. Over the following decade, the Reserve Bank treated this band as having hard edges, both in its conduct of policy and in its communications with the public; indeed, the boundaries of the inflation band were occasionally referred to as "electric fences" (Sherwin, 1999). However, it became increasingly evident that the Reserve Bank's vigorous attempts to keep inflation within the band tended to generate destabilizing fluctuations in nominal interest rates and undesirable outcomes for the broader macroeconomy.  Given the dissatisfaction with that approach, the Reserve Bank's mandate was refined significantly in 1997, namely, in seeking to keep inflation within the band, the Reserve Bank should avoid "unnecessary instability" in output, interest rates, and the exchange rate (Sherwin, 1999). This refinement allowed the Reserve Bank to lengthen the time horizon for achieving the inflation goal, thereby reducing the need to respond to transitory price fluctuations and providing greater flexibility in promoting the goal of macroeconomic stability. And since the edges of the inflation band have been softened, the Reserve Bank has placed greater emphasis on the policy actions needed to bring inflation toward the midpoint of the band over the forecast horizon.15United Kingdom The desire to anchor inflation expectations more firmly led the United Kingdom to move from a range to a point objective for inflation. Three weeks after the United Kingdom departed from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in the fall of 1992, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an inflation objective of 1 to 4 percent, which was to be achieved by the middle of 1997. The use of a range for the inflation objective was interpreted by many as a way of limiting the extent of discretionary policy and of acknowledging the extent of imperfect control over inflation (Bernanke and others, 1999, p. 154). The initial target range of 1 to 4 percent was often perceived as a range of indifference, which implied that inflation just outside the range would be viewed as qualitatively different from inflation just inside the range. As a consequence, inflation tended to stay near the upper border of the range.  Dissatisfaction with that outcome motivated the subsequent decision in mid-1997 to move to a framework with an explicit point objective of 2-1/2 percent, with deviations in either direction treated symmetrically. This modification of the policy framework was well received by financial markets and the general public, and surveys of households and professional forecasters indicated that inflation expectations converged fairly quickly to the Bank of England's point objective.16                                                   15  Since the early 1990s, the Reserve Bank of Australia's objective has been to keep the average inflation rate within a range of 2 percent to 3 percent; thus, when the edges of New Zealand's official inflation band were softened, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand described the move as a transition in the direction of an Australian-style "thick point" (Sherwin, 1999). 16  From 1992 through 2003, the Bank of England's inflation objective was defined in terms of the retail price index excluding mortgage interest (RPIX). In October 2003, the U.K. government announced that the official inflation objective would henceforth be defined in terms of the consumer price index (CPI) and that the target would be set at 2 percent, a choice reflecting the fact that the recent average for CPI inflation had been about 1/2 percentage point lower than that of RPIX inflation. BIS Review 35/2008 7 
The euro area and Canada The importance of anchoring expectations helps explain why other central banks that initially adopted an inflation objective stated in terms of a range – even a narrow one – increasingly emphasized a single value in their communications or have replaced the range with a point objective. For example, in May 2003 the European Central Bank (ECB) clarified that in implementing its mandate of price stability, monetary policy would be aimed at maintaining inflation "below, but close to, 2 percent in the medium term" (European Central Bank, 2003). That clarification was welcomed by market participants and likely made it easier for the ECB to anchor inflation expectations.  As a final example, consider the evolution of the monetary policy framework in Canada. In the late 1990s, this framework was well described as a range with relatively hard edges because statements by Bank of Canada officials had consistently indicated that the boundaries of the target zone (which ranged from 1 to 3 percent) were to be taken more seriously than the midpoint (Bernanke and others, 1999). Over the past decade, however, the conduct of monetary policy has evolved in the direction of placing greater emphasis on the midpoint, while the range has been used mainly as a communication device rather than as an objective in itself.  Conclusion I have argued today that the science of monetary policy provides a strong rationale for framing the inflation goal in terms of a specific point objective rather than as a range or comfort zone.17 First of all, I've argued inflation should be low but not too low. Second, I've provided a brief review of lessons from economic theory that can inform policymakers in their choice of inflation objectives. Third, I've outlined what we can learn from the practical experiences of other industrial economies; indeed, in recent years, a number of foreign central banks have moved toward emphasizing the midpoint of an inflation range or have provided a specific point objective for inflation.  Finally, you may have noticed that I haven't said much about the United States in this speech. Nevertheless, the issues that I've discussed today have potentially important implications for the ongoing process of refining the Federal Reserve's policy framework and of enhancing our communications. Indeed, as Chairman Bernanke has recently indicated, our communication strategy is "a work in progress," and the Federal Reserve "will continue to look for ways to improve the accountability and public understanding of U.S. monetary policymaking" (Bernanke, 2007). And I certainly hope that my remarks will be helpful in contributing to the continuation of that process.                                                  17  Further discussion regarding the scientific approach to monetary policy is in Mishkin (2007b). 8 BIS Review 35/2008

Amando M Tetangco, Jr: RCBC – banking on emerging corporates Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas), at RCBC’s (Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation) re-launching of its program for Small and Medium Enterprises, Makati City, 26 March 2008. *      *      * Ambassador Yuchengco, Chairman Dee, President Tan, other officers and staff of RCBC, special guests, good evening.  In many countries, including the Philippines, small and medium enterprises constitute the backbone of the economy. As such, initiatives that provide meaningful support to SMEs represent welcome news indeed. It is in this context that I view RCBC’s re-launch of its SME Lending Program.  Through the years, consolidated lending of the banking sector to SMEs has shown considerable growth.  In 1991, the year Republic Act No. 6977 or the Magna Carta for Small Enterprises took effect, credit to SMEs amounted to P17 billion. By December 2007, or 16 years later, total loans extended to SMEs have reached P352 billion. This is roughly 21 times more than the 1991 total.  We at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas acknowledge the banking sector’s commitment to support SMEs. As a whole, the banking sector has consistently exceeded the mandatory credit allocation for SMEs under the Magna Carta for Small Enterprises.  Although this law lapsed in August last year, Congress has already ratified the bill extending and enhancing the SME law. We expect this to be signed into law in the very near future. In the meantime, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas encourages banks to continue supporting SMEs.  It is in this light, that we commend RCBC for taking a leadership role in promoting and allocating resources for its SME lending Program. As one of the major banks in our country, RCBC is bound to influence others to take a similar stance.  To me, support for SMEs translates directly to a vote of confidence for our people and our country.  Recognized as the biggest employers in our country, SMEs account for about 80% of employment generation. If, therefore, we are able to keep the SME sector on a consistent growth track, we would be able to accomplish broad-based and sustained growth for our country.  Equally important, we would have a strong domestic economy that is less vulnerable to global economic shocks.  Ladies and gentlemen. Last year our economy posted the best GDP growth in 31 year. One of the reasons for this is strong investor confidence in our country, as a viable emerging economy. This was coupled with the 2.8 average inflation rate in 2007, which was the lowest in 21 years. Other indicators likewise exhibited stronger economic positions such as the country’s balance of payments, which posted a record surplus of USD 8.6 billion in 2007 and our all-time high level of international reserves. As for the banking sector, it remains fundamentally sound with the average capital level well above the minimum regulatory requirement and the NPL ratio that is now almost back to the 1997 pre-crisis level of around 4.0 percent.  BIS Review 35/2008 1 
The RCBC group in particular, has shown marked improvement in performance as it posted a net income for the year ended 2007 which was 50 percent better than the previous year’s level. Further, we take the Bank’s recent issuance of P7 billion worth of Unsecured Subordinated Debt as a sign of bank’s commitment to further strengthen its capital base as it assumes new risk exposures. RCBC’s SME Lending Program is anchored on the theme “Banking on Emerging Corporates.” This signals the belief and confidence of RCBC’s leadership in the future of SMEs to become growth drivers of the Philippine economy. I believe you are on the right track.  I hope this will steer the tempo of competition in the banking industry as it opens diversification of possible sources of income for banks.  Indeed, the challenge of setting a footprint on SME lending is a milestone RCBC and other banks should take, as its contribution in providing a strong foundation for sustained and broad-based economic growth for our country.  Again, my congratulations to RCBC. Mabuhay! 2 BIS Review 35/2008 
Randall S Kroszner: Protecting homeowners and sustaining homeownership Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals Legislative Conference 2008, Washington DC, 27 March 2008. *      *      * The mortgage market has long been a source of strength in the U.S. economy, but it is facing significant challenges, especially in the subprime segment that serves consumers who have shorter or weaker credit records. As of January 2008, the most recent month for which data are available, about 24 percent of subprime adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) were ninety or more days delinquent, twice the level one year earlier.1 Roughly 190,000 foreclosures were started on these mortgages in the fourth quarter, up 11 percent from the previous quarter.2 The significance of the problems with subprime loan performance is evident in the unusually high rate of defaults within a few months of loan origination, known as early payment defaults. In January 2008, nearly 9 percent of subprime ARMs originated in the previous six months were already ninety or more days delinquent, twice the rate of the year before and nearly four times the rate two years earlier.3  These problems have many causes, but the role of abusive lending practices is of particular concern. Such practices have led many people into homeownership that they cannot sustain, and have had adverse effects on their neighbors and communities as defaults and foreclosures can lead to declines in the values of surrounding properties. Practices that have hurt consumers have also undermined the confidence of investors and contributed to a virtual shutdown of the subprime market with consequences for other segments of the mortgage market. As a result, it is difficult for many borrowers, especially in the subprime space, to obtain home loans. The implications of diminished access to mortgage credit are of particular concern to the audience today, given that the subprime market was the source of home purchase loans extended to many in the Hispanic community.  These events have highlighted the shared interest of mortgage borrowers, their communities, lenders, and investors in protecting borrowers from abusive practices and preserving their choices. Abusive loans that strip their equity or cause them to lose their homes must not be tolerated. Protecting borrowers with responsible underwriting standards also protects the integrity and proper functioning of the mortgage market by increasing investor confidence Effective consumer protection produces a complementary benefit for consumers by making more capital available to meet their needs. Similarly, systematic efforts to keep borrowers who may have trouble meeting their loan obligations in their homes on a sustainable basis, by providing more certainty to the market, can have the complementary benefit of ensuring the flow of capital for potential borrowers. With these principles in mind, I will discuss current initiatives to mitigate foreclosures. Then I will spend most of my time discussing the Board's recent initiative in proposing new regulations that apply to all mortgage lenders, not just federally supervised banks, that are designed to prevent abuse, unfairness, and deception in residential mortgage lending. The expansive scope of this proposal is essential to ensure that consumer protections convey                                                  1  Board staff calculation based on data from First American LoanPerformance. 2  Board staff calculation based on data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. 3  Board staff calculation based on data from First American LoanPerformance.

across the mortgage market, regardless of whether a borrower receives a loan from a bank, an independent mortgage company, or through a mortgage broker. Preventing unnecessary foreclosures Given the high cost of foreclosures to lenders and investors and the disruption and distress that foreclosure can cause to consumers, their families, and their communities, it is in everyone's interest to avoid foreclosures whenever other viable options exist. With large numbers of borrowers facing potential repayment problems, it is in the interest of borrowers and investors alike for the industry to develop prudent loan modification programs and other assistance to help borrowers on a systematic and sustainable basis.  As you know, there are various initiatives underway to help borrowers struggling with their mortgages. NeighborWorks America and the Homeownership Preservation Foundation offer financial counseling services through the Homeowners HOPE hotline. The Hope Now Alliance, a broad-based coalition of government sponsored enterprises, industry trade associations, counseling agencies, and mortgage servicers, is making efforts to find ways to help borrowers through loan modification plans. The Federal Housing Administration has established the FHASecure plan to provide qualified borrowers who are delinquent because of an interest rate reset and who have some equity in the home the opportunity to refinance into an FHA-insured mortgage.  I have been an active proponent of such streamlined systematic approaches to reduce transactions costs and to help mitigate foreclosure risk, and I strongly encourage market participants to adopt and to implement these fast-track modification proposals as quickly as possible. I applaud these efforts but also recognize that much more must be done. Challenges remain, for example, with respect to ongoing constraints on servicing capacity to expedite work outs. Servicers must undertake the investment to overcome the capacity challenges and provide transparent and timely measures of the results. The Federal Reserve has been working with financial institutions and community groups around the country to address the challenges posed by problem loans. For instance, we have been providing community coalitions, counseling agencies, fellow regulators, and others with detailed analyses identifying neighborhoods at high risk of foreclosures. By understanding those areas with concentrations of subprime mortgages, delinquencies, and foreclosures, community leaders can better target their scarce resources to borrowers in need of counseling and other interventions that may help forestall foreclosure. Communities are also working to find ways to address the challenges that foreclosed homes can present, such as decreased home values and vacant properties that can deteriorate from neglect. Toward this end, the Federal Reserve has recently engaged in a partnership with NeighborWorks America to help identify strategies to help stabilize neighborhoods.  It is essential that organizations with access to at-risk homeowners, particularly those who may have additional challenges, such as language barriers, engage in foreclosure prevention initiatives to help keep families in their homes and stabilize communities. The Federal Reserve has worked to support consumers by providing them with the information they need to understand and shop for banking products, as well as to file a complaint against a bank. Many of these consumer education brochures are available in Spanish.  Importantly, we have just launched a Spanish-language version of the Federal Reserve Consumer Help Center to help better meet the needs of Spanish-speaking consumers. We have seen a dramatic increase in the number of consumers contacting us since we launched this centralized call center and website in November 2007, and now we have the capability to 2 BIS Review 34/2008 
reach even greater numbers by providing information and assistance to Spanish-speaking consumers at 888-851-1920.4  The Board's proposal I will now focus on the Board's recent proposal for stricter regulations prohibiting abusive and deceptive practices in the mortgage market under authority of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). This proposal is intended to protect consumers and to preserve consumer choice by targeting protections to borrowers who face the most risk. We have also sought to ensure that these standards are clear for lenders to reduce unintended consequences for consumers. Though clear, the standards are intended to be not overly prescriptive, so as to preserve access to responsible credit while amply protecting consumers. Our proposal is also comprehensive, covering most mortgage loans with certain protections and the entire subprime market with certain more specific regulations. While comprehensive, the proposal would focus protections where the risks are greatest and preserve consumers' access to responsible credit. Our effort to produce robust, clear, and comprehensive rules was based on a rigorous analysis of available qualitative and quantitative data. We have put this proposal out for public comment until April 8 and eagerly seek suggestions to be able to craft the best possible final rule. Comprehensive scope Let me say more about the comprehensive scope of this proposal. It would apply stricter regulations to higher-priced mortgage loans, which we have defined broadly, and it covers all types of mortgage lenders, unlike guidance that only applies to federally insured banks. We were particularly interested in ensuring that protections remain strong over time as loan products and lending practices change. Our analysis of the data suggested that the troubles in the mortgage market generally arise not from a single practice in isolation, but instead from the complex ways that risk factors and underwriting practices can affect each other, sometimes called "risk layering." Therefore, we have proposed using a loan's annual percentage rate, or APR, to determine whether the loan is covered by stricter regulations.5 Because the APR is closely correlated to risk, the proposed protections would cover loans with higher risks rather than single out particular risk factors or underwriting practices. With the APR thresholds we have proposed, we expect that the new protections would cover the entire subprime mortgage market and the riskier end of the "near prime" market, the latter also known as the "alt-A" market. Covering part of the alt-A market would anticipate possible actions by lenders to avoid restrictions on subprime loans priced near the threshold. It would also address real risks to consumers in the alt-A segment. This segment grew very rapidly, and it layered risks, such as undocumented income, on top of other risks, such as nontraditional loan structures allowing borrowers to defer paying principal and interest. However, we have heard from commenters who have expressed concern that in the current market environment, the proposed trigger could cover the market too broadly, and we will carefully consider the issues they raise and other possible approaches to achieve our objective.                                                   4  Federal Reserve Consumer Help can be accessed online at www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov/index_sp.cfm. 5  Under the proposal, a "higher-priced mortgage loan" would have an APR that exceeds the yield on comparable Treasury securities by three or more percentage points for first-lien loans, or five or more percentage points for subordinate-lien loans. BIS Review 34/2008 3 
Our public hearings and our analysis identified problems not just in higher-priced loans, but also in the broader mortgage market. Thus, our proposal addresses unfair or deceptive practices for the vast majority of mortgage loans secured by a consumer's primary home. Areas targeted this broadly include broker steering, appraisal coercion, unwarranted servicing fees, and deceptive advertising. I'll touch on broker steering toward the end of my remarks. Robust approach to affordability Extending credit that borrowers can afford to repay is a fundamental pillar of responsible lending. Across the whole range of higher-priced mortgage loans, our proposal offers three rules that, working in combination, would help ensure that borrowers can afford their payments. First, is a requirement that a lender maintain responsible underwriting practices that genuinely assess borrowers' ability to repay. This general requirement would be complemented by a specific requirement to verify the income and assets of the borrower that are relied upon in making the loan. A third rule would require lenders to escrow property taxes and homeowners insurance to help borrowers meet these obligations. This robust approach to affordability would help ensure that the subprime market promotes sustainable homeownership. Just as important, it would also help protect consumers from abusive refinancings that strip equity. Clear lending standards have the further advantages of increasing investor confidence in the mortgage market and helping to revive the flow of credit to consumers with shorter or weaker credit records. Assessment of repayment ability Now I want to discuss the major elements of our proposed regulations for higher-priced loans in a little more depth, starting with the requirement to assess repayment ability. The regulations would prohibit a lender from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higher-priced loans based on the value of the borrower's house rather than on the borrower's ability to repay from income, or from assets other than the house. This prohibition is intentionally broad to capture all risks to loan performance and the different ways that these risks can be layered. Moreover, the proposal avoids prescribing quantitative underwriting requirements. For example, the proposal would prohibit a pattern or practice of disregarding the ratio of applicants' income to their debt, but it does not prescribe a maximum ratio because the appropriate number depends heavily on other risk factors, which vary from loan to loan. At the same time, the proposal does offer specifics. For example, it would create a presumption that a lender had violated the regulations if it engaged in a pattern or practice of failing to underwrite at the fully-indexed rate.6  Our proposed regulations would be more robust and comprehensive than the subprime guidance the agencies issued last year. The regulations would apply to all mortgage lenders, including independent mortgage companies. Moreover, the regulations would be legally enforceable by supervisory and enforcement agencies. Just as important, the regulations, unlike the guidance, would be legally enforceable by consumers who could recover statutory and actual damages for violations. The proposed requirement to assess repayment ability is intended to protect consumers from abusive practices while maintaining their access to responsible credit. We recognize that                                                  6  On an adjustable-rate mortgage, the fully-indexed rate is the sum of the value of the applicable index as of loan origination and the margin specified in the loan agreement. For example, a typical 2/28 mortgage issued in 2006 might have a fully-indexed rate of 11.37. This assumes that the mortgage was linked to the six-month LIBOR, that LIBOR was at its 2006 average value of 5.37 percent, and that the mortgage had a margin of six percentage points. 4 BIS Review 34/2008 
satisfying both objectives at the same time is a challenge. The proposed rule's potential for consumer actions, coupled with its careful avoidance of prescribing quantitative underwriting thresholds, could raise compliance and litigation risk. In turn, this could raise the cost of credit for higher-risk borrowers or limit the availability of responsible credit. That is why we have proposed prohibiting a "pattern or practice" of disregarding repayment ability rather than attaching a risk of legal liability to every individual loan that does not perform. Some commentators have argued that the pattern or practice requirement creates a higher standard of proof that can make it more difficult and costly for consumers to pursue litigation. We have specifically sought comment on this provision and look forward to perspectives offered by the industry and consumer groups. Income verification When we looked closely at why so many borrowers had mortgages that they struggled to repay so soon after taking out the loan, the prevalence of "stated-income" lending was a clear culprit. Substantial anecdotal evidence indicates that failing to verify income invited fraud. Moreover, when we looked at the loan-level data we saw a clear correlation between "low-doc" or "no-doc" lending and performance problems, particularly early payment defaults. That is why we have proposed to complement a broad requirement to assess repayment ability with a specific requirement to verify the income or assets a lender relies on to make a credit decision. We recognize that stated-income lending may have a proper place when not layered on top of too many other risks. Therefore, we would target the verification requirement to higher-priced loans, including the higher-priced end of the alt-A market, where the risks of stated-income lending could be layered on top of too many other risks.  The proposal identifies standard documents that would be acceptable, such as W-2 forms. It also allows, however, any third party documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of income. Some consumers may have access to only nonstandard documents and others, such as self-employed entrepreneurs, may have some difficulty documenting their income. This rule is meant to preserve consumer choice by allowing the market to identify credible nontraditional documentation of consumer income – for example, check-cashing receipts. To help ensure that the proposal preserves access to credit for the full range of consumers, we have sought public comment on this issue. Escrows for taxes and insurance Another part of our proposal for higher-priced loans – a requirement to escrow taxes and insurance – would also help ensure that borrowers can afford their payments. Escrowing has become standard practice in the prime market, and the case for making it standard in the subprime market, too, appears compelling. Consumers with shorter or weaker credit histories may be less likely to appreciate the sizable burden that taxes and insurance can add to the cost of homeownership, or more vulnerable to being misled by payment quotes that leave out these amounts. Moreover, when we looked at the data, we saw in the unusually high level of early payment defaults possible evidence that the lack of escrows hurt consumers who did not have experience paying property tax and insurance bills. We have proposed to address the problem with a requirement to escrow taxes and insurance on higher-priced loans, accompanied by a limited allowance for opt-out. We wanted the regulations to prevent irresponsible efforts to encourage borrowers to opt out. So the rule would not permit opt-out at the closing table, but instead would require that twelve months pass before a consumer may opt out. The twelve-month waiting period would also apply if a consumer refinanced into another high-cost loan, reducing the likelihood that consumers would refinance solely to decrease monthly payments by eliminating escrowing of taxes and insurance. In this respect the proposal is intended to preserve consumer choice while protecting consumers from unaffordable mortgage obligations.  BIS Review 34/2008 5 
Prepayment penalties  Having discussed the rules that would promote affordability, I want to say a word about our proposed rule on prepayment penalties. These penalties can take a toll on consumers who have riskier loans, and many consumers may not even be aware their loans have a penalty. Accordingly, we have proposed a ban on prepayment penalties in circumstances of a high degree of risk to the consumer, and we are also addressing transparency concerns. The proposed rule would ban prepayment penalties where they are most likely to prevent a consumer from refinancing a loan that has a particularly burdensome payment. Specifically, a penalty would be prohibited where the borrower's debt-to-income ratio exceeds 50 percent, and a penalty would have to expire before a loan's payment could increase. The rule would also ban prepayment penalties where they are more likely to be part of a "loan flipping" scheme – specifically, where a lender or its affiliate refinances the lender's own loan. Banning penalties altogether could cause all borrowers, including those who do not prepay, to bear the full cost of investors' prepayment risk, which could raise questions of fairness, and it could reduce consumer choice. We recognize there are differing views on this and look forward to gaining those perspectives through the comment process. Steering I have so far discussed the elements of our proposal that would seek to ensure that underwriting practices and loan terms on higher-priced loans do not present unwarranted risks to consumers. There is another potential source of risk to consumers that I want to address that is related to "steering" – the risk that when they use the services of a mortgage broker, they do not appreciate the extent to which the broker's interests may diverge from the consumer's interests because of "yield spread premiums."7The growth of the market for brokerage services has no doubt increased competition in the market for mortgage loans, to the benefit of consumers. Moreover, the yield spread premium, a payment from a lender to a broker based on the loan's interest rate, is sometimes the best way for a consumer to fund the cost of a broker's services. However, when a lender pays a broker for a loan that has a higher rate, that payment can create a conflict of interest between the broker and the consumer. This conflict is problematic if the consumer does not know it exists or assumes, incorrectly, that the broker is obligated to put the consumer's interests first. In such cases, the consumer cannot protect his or her own interests, and competition for loans and for brokerage services does not work effectively. Therefore, we have proposed to prohibit a lender, for both prime and subprime loans, from paying a broker any more than the consumer had expressly agreed that the broker would receive. This agreement must be executed up-front, before the consumer has submitted an application and become invested in closing the deal. The combination of stricter regulation and better disclosure that we are proposing should help reduce a broker's incentive to steer a consumer to a higher rate, empower consumers to shop and negotiate among brokers, and preserve consumers' option to use the services of a broker. Better and earlier information for consumers Lastly, to protect consumers and promote competition, our proposed regulation would prohibit misleading mortgage advertising and require that consumers receive loan-specific                                                  7  A "yield spread premium" is the present dollar value of the difference between the lowest interest rate the wholesale lender would have accepted on a particular transaction and the interest rate the broker actually obtained for the lender. This dollar amount is usually paid to the mortgage broker. It may also be applied to other loan-related costs, but the Board’s proposal concerns only the amount paid to the broker. 6 BIS Review 34/2008 
disclosures early in the application process, when they can use the information to shop more effectively. We recognize, however, that we face a challenge in ensuring that disclosures for mortgage loans remain effective. We have begun a comprehensive program of rigorous consumer testing of potential improvements to current disclosures. Conclusion There are more elements of our comprehensive proposal that I do not have time today to discuss, such as a prohibition against coercing appraisers and restrictions on unwarranted servicing fees. We anticipate vigorous public comment on this proposal, and once we have carefully considered all the input we receive, we will move expeditiously to a final rule. As I noted at the outset, effective consumer protection can help to restore confidence in the mortgage markets and help to preserve the flow of capital to consumers who wish to purchase a home. It is not too early to emphasize that the effectiveness of the final rule will depend critically on effective enforcement. The Federal Reserve will do its part to ensure compliance among the institutions it supervises. We also have been instrumental in launching a pilot project with other federal and state agencies to conduct consumer compliance reviews of non-depository lenders and other industry participants. I am sure we will be aided in these efforts by a new system for registering and tracking mortgage brokers recently launched by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. While we work to build effective consumer protections and enforcement regimes for future consumers, we will also continue our efforts, and encourage the initiatives many others are undertaking, to limit unnecessary foreclosures for consumers who are hurting now.

Rundheersing Bheenick: Local currency bond trading and risk management Opening address by Mr Rundheersing Bheenick, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the Workshop on Local Currency Bond Trading and Risk Management, organized by the Financial Markets Association of Mauritius, Balaclava, 24 March 2008. *      *      * It is a great pleasure for me to address you this morning at the opening of this Workshop. I consider the theme which you have chosen “Local Currency Bond Trading and Risk Management” quite topical at this juncture of the development of our domestic financial market. I salute the initiative of the Financial Markets Association and I would also like to add my own welcome to our resource person, Dr Graeme West. I understand that this is the third workshop organized by the Association after those held in 2003 and 2006 which focused on Treasury and Risk Management, and Derivatives, respectively. Do I detect a slight increase in frequency here? Does this reflect the quickening pace at which things are happening in the financial sector these days? Be that as it may, such workshops help to enhance the skills of participants and enable them to keep up with the continuous innovations that characterize the changing financial landscape. Skilled professionals and technicians are at the root of all innovations. A well-functioning bond market will help to create more growth and stability, not only in Mauritius, but also in the region.  As we all know, a deep and liquid bond market is a key component of a thriving financial centre. An efficient and mature bond market contributes directly to macroeconomic and financial stability. It constitutes an alternative source of funding which can help the corporate sector to reduce over-reliance on short-term foreign currency loans. Currently, in the absence of a properly functioning local bond market, issuers who qualify for bond financing must have recourse to international financial markets to finance their local projects and have to bear the attendant exchange rate risk. Local currency bonds can thus help to protect such issuers from foreign currency shocks. The improved financial intermediation resulting from an active bond market also brings such microeconomic benefits as efficiency gains and diversification of tools for both borrowers and savers.  Let me reaffirm that, as a trusted partner in economic development, the Bank of Mauritius is committed to promoting the development and efficiency of all markets, whether the foreign exchange market or the domestic money market and we keep a watchful eye on the stock market and other asset markets. We see a need to add greater depth to the market. Central banks and governments share the responsibility to facilitate and promote the development of local bond markets, remove market friction and unnecessary restrictions, and provide an environment that is conducive to both supply and demand, that is to both the issuers and investors. Bond market development has been targeted by the central bank over the past years through various initiatives. This included the establishment of an appropriate market infrastructure that facilitates cost-effective and secure trading, and a transparent price discovery process. With regard to secondary market development, you all know that we set a Secondary Market Cell within the Bank in 1994. We established a Primary Dealer System in 2002. Treasury Bills have been listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius since 2003. We have re-introduced sales of Treasury Bills and Treasury Notes at the counters of the Bank of Mauritius last July.  The deepening of local currency bond market across a range of maturities will encourage increased participation by institutional investors. We have started issuing medium – to long – term bonds on a more regular basis to develop a benchmark yield curve for Government BIS Review 34/2008 1 
securities across the whole spectrum. This will facilitate the development of a corporate bond market. In 2007, the European Investment Bank, with the State Bank of Mauritius and West LB from South Africa as lead managers issued Synthetic Mauritian Rupee debt in the international market. We are now considering a proposal from the World Bank for the Government to allow them to issue Mauritian rupee denominated or linked bonds  In the end, however, there is only so much that the authorities can – or should – do. Whilst these initiatives add up to the necessary conditions for market development, they are unlikely to prove sufficient on their own. However good the infrastructure may be, it is for the players themselves, that is the issuers, investors and the financial intermediaries to eventually determine the shape and size of the market. It is also of paramount importance that market players adopt a participative approach for the development of the money market, as the existence of trading limits are impeding the development of these markets. Allow me now to dwell a little on the challenges that a small country like Mauritius is currently facing in the conduct of monetary policy. Today, the Bank of Mauritius finds itself confronted with the important challenge of reducing the rate of inflation, which stood at 9.0 percent at the end of February 2008, and preserving the competitiveness of the export-oriented sectors. And we must meet this challenge against a backdrop of unprecedented capital inflows which are driving up the exchange rate of the rupee.  With globalization, a small open economy receiving such large capital inflows faces the daunting task of managing these external flows to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability. Interventions by the central bank to purchase large amounts of foreign exchange from the market have an expansionary impact on the domestic money supply and pose severe challenges for the conduct of monetary policy.  Since mid-December 2007 the Bank has purchased a total amount equivalent to US Dollars 193 million from the domestic foreign exchange market. To sterilize the excess liquidity stemming from these capital inflows, the Bank has to issue central bank paper as we now have a separation of debt management from monetary management. This entails the issue of a huge amount of Bank of Mauritius Bills for monetary policy purposes, which has a potentially adverse impact on the central bank’s balance sheet. The Central bank, as regulator, has a different role and a slightly different perspective compared to commercial banks, Our mandate is price stability, financial stability and the promotion of economic development. In the pursuit of these objectives, profitability becomes a secondary issue and at times like the present, we have to dip into our reserves to meet the costs. When balance sheet considerations conflict with other public interest, there is no doubt in my mind which way the Central Bank should lean.  We must explicitly recognize that there are costs for the central bank in running monetary policy. That is why the central bank is required to strengthen its balance sheet in order to manage the shocks impacting on the economy. The central bank’s capital and reserves have to be strong enough to be able to sustain repeated intervention in the money market. Given the uncertainty surrounding the nature of capital inflows, it would also be prudent for the central bank in a small open economy to build up reserves as a cushion against a possible reversal of capital flows.  Presently, we have Treasury and Bank of Mauritius Bills with maturities of 91 days up to 364 days. Treasury notes with maturities of 2, 3 and 4 years and bonds with maturities ranging from 5 years to 29 years are issued on a regular basis. Lately we have introduced a 14 day Special Deposit facility. We feel that there is a gap between the 14 day Special Deposit Facility and the 91 day bill and in order to close the gap and manage the persistent excess liquidity in the system, the Bank is contemplating the issue of Central Bank papers with maturities of 1 and 2 months.  Let me say a word about exchange rate, a subject of much interest right now. As a matter of policy, the Bank allows the free play of market forces to determine the exchange value of the rupee. Our intervention in the domestic foreign exchange market is not aimed at offsetting 2 BIS Review 34/2008 
market forces, or at targeting any specific exchange rate. Our only objective is to smooth out unwarranted volatility in the rupee exchange rate and improve the functioning of the market.  In a brief interview that I gave to the “Business Standard” newspaper in India last week, I said that even if our economy was suffering from a deluge of foreign exchange inflows, most of the foreign exchange operations were confined to the spot market. This is why we want to encourage the development of a vibrant futures and forward market that will help in creating an active foreign exchange market and introduce newer instruments for exporters and entrepreneurs to hedge and trade in the financial services sector.  As regards the issue of risk management, it is a correct practice these days to use derivatives to hedge against unwanted volatilities. Derivatives can bring substantial benefits to the commercial community, in facilitating hedging and business planning. Such instruments enable financial institutions to offer a progressively wider range of services and achieve greater efficiency in the intermediation process.  Unfortunately, this is one area where Mauritius is lagging behind. The market for derivatives has not picked up significantly compared to other emerging market economies. I strongly believe that the domestic financial market is mature enough to engage in derivatives trading under proper regulation. The Bank is now considering the necessary measures that need to be implemented to stimulate the development of this market. I know that. In many quarters, derivatives have a murky reputation. We do not believe that derivatives necessarily lead to market manipulation, which would be bad for a small market like ours. Rather, we see derivatives as enhancing the efficiency of financial markets and this is why we are determined to put in place in the near future the necessary building blocks for its rapid development.  We are conscious that derivatives involve multiple extra policy responsibilities for the Bank. Derivatives and derivatives-trading have the potential to bring disaster if not properly supervised. Therefore one of the areas that the Bank will concentrate upon therefore is to ensure that risks are properly identified, and managed, and that downside risks which might threaten systemic stability are avoided.  As we move into these new pastures designed to deepen the financial market and broaden the range of financial products and instruments, we feel that it is also the right time to encourage Rating Agencies to start operations in Mauritius. In any case this move will also be beneficial to the sector as we move on to implementation of Basle II. The Bank has already stated its intention to sell data held by the Mauritius Credit Information Bureau to accredited Rating Agencies. All these concerted initiatives will certainly take us in the direction of developing the local bond market. We also welcome the recent initiative taken by the Mauritius Bankers Association to kick-start discussions relating to the netting of financial contracts and applicable law of securities, based on the Model developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).We hope to move rapidly in this direction at the level of the legislative support required.  The Bank is once again pleased to associate itself with events such as the present one. My predecessor, Governor Basant Roi initiated this arrangement with your Association and I am happy to follow. We believe that it is part of our role to develop the skills of our treasurers and we try to achieve this through our participation in events such as this one. Finally, I would like once again to commend this initiative of the Financial Markets Association to organize this workshop and I am sure that participants will make the most of it.  I now have the pleasure to declare this Workshop open. I hope you will find it instructive and rewarding. Thank you. BIS Review 34/2008 3 
Glenn Stevens: Recent financial developments Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to Smart Capital 2008: The Euromoney Australian, Financial Markets Innovation Congress, Sydney, 27 March 2008. *      *      * Welcome to Sydney. It is a pleasure to be here to make some remarks at the opening of your conference. The opportunity this forum provides to exchange ideas and participate in vigorous discussions is undoubtedly valuable, not least at this particular juncture.  The past nine months have certainly been a very challenging time in international financial markets. We have seen a significant reappraisal of certain categories of risk and considerable financial turbulence in key international markets. Economic prospects in the United States, in particular, have taken a significant turn for the worse. The extent of disengagement in some core markets, which hitherto had been thought to be extremely liquid and reliable, has been quite unsettling. The fact that your conference has a focus on innovation is apt as well. It will not have gone unnoticed that difficulties associated with some particular innovations of the past decade have been prominent in the recent period. It has been remarked by others that the complexity of some new instruments meant that they were not well enough understood by investors, and perhaps even by those promoting them.1 Complexity is also the enemy of liquidity, which proved to be much less reliable than had been assumed. Perhaps future innovations will need to take account of the difficulty people inevitably have in grappling with complexity, and the dangers of illiquidity. In the end, though, human nature, with its propensity initially to underestimate risk in good times, then to over react when risk materialises, is probably a permanent feature of the landscape. I will organise my remarks today under three headings: How did we get here? Where are we now? And what policy issues arise for future consideration? I should be clear that my remarks are principally about global events. They are not directed towards the Australian financial system in particular. The local financial community has certainly been affected by the global turmoil but, on the whole, as the Reserve Bank’s Financial Stability Review being released later this morning sets out, is weathering the storm well. Profitability remains very strong and capital sound. There is very little direct exposure to the US sub prime problems, but the main reason for the resilience is many years of robust economic growth, sound regulatory foundations and prudent risk management. The Reserve Bank has been carefully monitoring access to funding, including offshore funding. We judge it to have been more than adequate, even if more expensive, though, of course, we will continue to watch the situation closely. But the centre of recent developments has been offshore, so my remarks today are about the global scene, not the Australian one, unless specifically noted. Background to the present international situation: how did we get here? Although the headlines of the past year have been dominated by stories about the sub prime loans in the US mortgage market, in fact the genesis of the problems was much earlier. For                                                  1  This observation has been made by many in the past year, including the Bank of England Governor, Mervyn King (http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2008/speech333.pdf and http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2007/speech324.pdf) and Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke (http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/Bernanke20070515a.htm). BIS Review 34/2008 1 
much of the preceding decade, international capital markets were characterised by the search for yield. An excess of saving over investment in Asia was a feature, resulting partly from the reaction to the late 1990s crisis and the determination to avoid a repeat of it. The rapid growth of Chinese incomes and the lag between that trend and a corresponding rise in consumption was also a factor. These trends, associated as they were with a surplus of internationally tradeable goods and services, carried a degree of disinflationary impact for the rest of the world, which made strong growth in demand and low inflation easier to combine. They also lowered the marginal cost of financial capital in global markets. Somewhat later, oil rich nations also provided funds to the global economy and spurred on this search for yield, since mounting revenues from higher oil prices were invested rather than spent by governments that were now more fiscally conservative. In the major developed countries, interest rates at the short end were also lower than normal for a long period after the mild 2001 recession in some of the G7 countries, as monetary policies sought to manage the particular circumstances each country faced. This was associated with an unusually stable period for macroeconomic conditions. The “great moderation” in volatility of output and prices had been under way in the United States since the mid 1980s but it became more obvious in many other economies in the 1990s and 2000s. In my mind, there is little doubt that this lowered perceptions of risk, and indeed it is a fact that default rates on corporate debt, even sub investment grade debt, were unusually low through the past decade. They remain low even on the latest data, up to end 2007, though they will presumably rise somewhat over the next couple of years.  In this environment, the search for yield continued. This saw end investors consciously begin to accept more risk in order to find the returns they were seeking. Additionally, the easy availability of credit and benign macroeconomic environment led to an increase in the use of leverage to increase returns further. It also provided the demand side backdrop for the development of new instruments. The innovative financial community obliged and provided ever more sophisticated ways of achieving the returns desired by investors. The innate complexity and, in some cases, opacity of these instruments made their properties hard to assess. With this reduced transparency, it was easy for investors to underestimate the risks that they were taking on. Observable compensation for risk declined over time, as evidenced by various market spreads, non price terms of loans and so on. This was something about which numerous prudential supervisors, central banks and private bankers commented on over some years. Eventually, something was going to occur that would trigger a reappraisal of risk. It is remarkable that this took so long. Over several years, we had a string of events that could have, and in other times surely would have, triggered a reassessment: prominent credit rating downgrades of some major US corporations to sub investment grade status; a default on foreign debt by Argentina, followed by rather rancorous negotiations over restructuring; political instability in several countries; a very large rise in the price of oil; significant tightening of US monetary policy up to 2006; the list goes on. Through all this, financial sentiment barely missed a beat. Then, in early 2007, the escalating losses on the 2006 vintage of US sub prime mortgages first started to come to light. It took some months for those losses to show up in certain hedge funds, structured investment vehicles and so on. But by July and August 2007, enough had emerged for there to be a marked change in sentiment. There is no need to give a detailed treatment here of subsequent events: they are well known, so it is enough to observe the broad outlines. As the scope of potential losses became clearer, the business models of some of the entities that were exposed came under pressure, particularly those which were reliant on short term wholesale funding and/or securitisation. Markets for asset backed commercial paper stopped the flow of new funding, and for a time were very reluctant to roll over existing funding for entities that were seen to have sub prime exposure. Much of the resulting funding pressure came back to the balance 2 BIS Review 34/2008 
sheets of the major international banks and investment banks that had initially sponsored these entities. Essentially, they took the responsibility for funding sub prime assets. At the same time, these and other institutions found that a number of other markets had also become difficult to operate in. This saw them unable to shift loans originated from their balance sheets, even though these loans were unrelated to the US sub prime mortgage market – for example, loans associated with merger and acquisition activity. In this climate of uncertainty over both credit exposures and funding needs, funding liquidity pressures became acute on occasion during the second half of 2007. Short term market yields became much less closely connected to the overnight rates that central banks typically control. Central banks responded by expanding the scope and scale of their routine market operations, adding additional liquidity, accepting a wider range of assets in their operations and expanding the maturity of their lending facilities. There were also some internationally coordinated actions to provide foreign currency funding under swaps between some of the major central banks. Practices have continued to evolve.  The current international situation: where are we now? Over the recent period, disclosures of losses associated with various credit products have continued. Financial institutions and investors have continued to be wary of what credit losses may yet be unearthed. Institutions have generally made strong efforts to disclose exposures appropriately, but there are major difficulties in valuing the relevant assets, not least because some markets have effectively ceased to operate – so no price can be observed. It appears that some very high quality assets are valued at prices that embody extremely pessimistic assumptions about returns. Key segments of credit markets remain in difficulty. There have been few, if any, issues of mortgage backed securities in recent months, though the commercial paper markets have at least stopped contracting. It appears that the most highly rated corporate names can still access capital markets, but many corporates are approaching their banks for funding. Business credit provided by the banking system has accelerated in the United States over the period since mid 2007. This process of reintermediation is a very necessary one, if the flow of credit to the major economies is not to be seriously disrupted. For the time being, and perhaps for some time ahead, the financial intermediaries need to fill some of the gap that the capital markets have suddenly left. With this comes, of course, the need for those intermediaries to have adequate funding themselves – one obvious reason for the pressure on term funding costs. They will also need sufficient capital to take on the risks inherent in the lending, since capital markets apparently no longer wish to accept those risks. This is, in fact, a key element of the whole situation: more capital needed to be carried by the big international banks to support the risks they were taking, and that capital has to be found now. In addition, the risk capital that was available from markets is no longer there to the same extent. The intermediaries have found substantial capital over recent months. By curtailing share repurchases and reducing dividends, several intermediaries have generated some of the necessary capital internally. More crucial has been the fresh capital raised though selling stakes in their businesses to individuals, institutions and governments.2 These deals, however, have been costly, leading to a significant dilution of the interests of their existing shareholders. Irrespective of this, with both these sources of capital, intermediaries have been able to maintain, and in some cases increase, their capital ratios – even when they                                                  2  Sovereign wealth funds have been particularly active in providing this fresh capital. They have reportedly provided at least half of the capital injected into these intermediaries in recent times, and acquired stakes in Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and UBS. BIS Review 34/2008 3 
have reported significant losses. With this being the case, they have also, at least so far, been able to step in to fill the gap in corporate funding. In addition to reintermediation and the pursuit of new capital, we are seeing a significant process of de leveraging. Entities with high leverage and/or complex structures have come under significant pressure in recent months as share markets question their resilience, and lenders seek a reduction in risk. We have seen some notable cases of this in Australia, but they are merely a reflection of what is going on in the major markets of the world. Private equity firms, hedge funds and so on, all find the environment much less accommodating than was the case a year ago. This process of balance sheet contraction has been an additional further factor disrupting markets of late, as asset sales have to be absorbed under already skittish conditions. In the meantime, real savings are still flowing into pension funds, insurance companies and other institutional investment vehicles. This is genuine capital, seeking a productive use. But these investors appear to be taking a more cautious approach to risk, given the short term uncertainty over asset valuations. It is a fair bet that they have higher positions in cash – overnight or very short term highly rated securities – than would normally be the case. This is placed largely in banking systems, so the major intermediaries are, I expect, generally flush with very short term liabilities, even though longer term funding remains difficult. This means that these intermediaries may be undertaking more maturity transformation than they would ordinarily find comfortable. Increasingly, there are good quality assets at prices that would, in normal times, be very attractive. At some point, investors who are currently on the side lines will need to summon enough confidence to take up the opportunities for profitable exposure to risk. It is impossible to say when this will occur, but we can perhaps outline what the pre conditions are. Investors will want a reasonable level of confidence that the bulk of the losses in the most important institutions have been accounted for and disclosed, that remaining “excess” leverage has been essentially sorted out, and that any remaining downside risks to asset quality stemming from slowing growth in the major countries are manageable and within the set of normal parameter variation that their portfolios can cope with.  Where to from here? Issues for policy makers This financial instability presents a difficult set of challenges for policy makers around the world. First, central banks have the obligation to maintain liquidity at the core of the system. In the face of repeated system wide surges in the demand for liquidity, they have accommodated that demand. They have also been prepared to lend at longer terms than usual, and deal with a broader range of counterparties in order to foster a little more confidence in the availability of funding beyond the very short term. The Federal Reserve has also facilitated the absorption of Bear Stearns by a stronger competitor, by being prepared to use assets from its own balance sheet in a collateral swap. This is, however, not a “bail out” – the shareholders and managers of Bear Stearns have lost a great deal of money, but the system will be stabilised. Turning to the Australian setting for a moment, in the Reserve Bank’s case, we have been prepared to increase the total amount of liquidity substantially, as required. We have widened the range of eligible collateral for repurchase agreements (we already had a pretty wide range of counterparties prior to last August). We have also been prepared to enter into repurchase agreements for six months and longer on occasion, given the pressure on market funding rates at that horizon. Even with that, however, the relationship between the cash rate (or, more correctly, the expected future cash rate) and rates on high quality private paper at a three to six month term is much looser at present than it has tended to be over recent years. This means that the cost to banks of raising funds in the market has moved independently of the overnight rate. The presumption that their lending rates would and should move only in line with the cash rate, which had arisen in an earlier period when all these rates were much 4 BIS Review 34/2008 
more closely related, has not been a realistic one in the recent environment. Of course, in setting the cash rate, the Reserve Bank has taken account of these shifting relationships, just as it does shifts in other relationships in the monetary transmission mechanism. Returning now to the global scene, central banks are continually assessing the potential impact on economic activity and inflation from these events, as they evaluate monetary policy settings. In the United States, the Federal Reserve has responded to evident weakness in economic activity, and the risks posed by the possibility of a significant disruption to credit provision, by lowering overnight rates quickly. Elsewhere, policy makers are trying to assess the potential spillovers. The weak US economy and depreciating US dollar will have some impact via reduced trade in goods and services. But that channel is less important than the possibility of financial contagion from a set of forces not confined to the United States but affecting international capital and money markets generally. What complicates matters is that policy makers have to consider that possibility at a time when they are also confronted with a troubling level of inflation in a number of cases. Longer term, a number of issues arise that are the subject of intense work in the central banking and supervisory community. Arrangements for the provision of liquidity by central banks have been changing in response to the events of the past eight months, but it is likely that there will be continued discussion about whether further refinements might be sensible. These will include how to make arrangements sufficiently flexible and adaptive, including across borders, which may be needed given the globalised nature of markets. The discussion will also need to pay due regard to the potential for other consequences of changes to practice in this area, including the possibility that private entities become so confident that liquidity risk has effectively been removed that they end up taking more risk of other types. That could leave both themselves and their central banks in an awkward position at some point down the track. So in parallel with ongoing development of liquidity arrangements by central banks, there will need to be a focus in the supervisory community and the banks themselves on liquidity management. Conclusion International financial events over the past nine months have been a source of considerable instability. Risk that was always in the economic environment has belatedly been recognised. The ensuing process of assessing and disclosing losses, finding new capital and de leveraging has been very difficult. Matters have not been helped by the opacity and complexity of some of the financial instruments involved, and the associated problems in valuing them. For market participants and policy makers alike, this environment has been challenging indeed. Those of you in the markets are dealing with heightened volatility and uncertainty. Policy makers, meanwhile, are working hard to stabilise the present international situation. In some countries, especially the US, that involves being prepared to take measures quite aggressively, in an effort to avert a cumulative spiral of declining asset values and deteriorating creditworthiness feeding back on itself and doing great damage to the economy. In other countries, where financial strains are also occurring though not always to the same extent, it has thus far involved significant changes to liquidity management, while balancing the financial risks against other macroeconomic risks in an effort to foster long run stability. In all countries, though, policy makers are also keeping an eye out for the potential low probability, but high cost, downside events that could emerge. It looks as though the environment will remain quite challenging for us all for a while but the strength of the Australian financial system is, for Australia, a good basis for meeting the challenge.

Tarisa Watanagase: Japan-Thailand – partnership in prosperity Dinner talk by Dr Tarisa Watanagase, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, Bangkok, 25 March 2008. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Japanese Chamber of Commerce for the invitation to speak before you tonight. It has been a year since I gave a talk at a similar function held by the Chamber. I remember we had a lively exchange of ideas then, and I am glad you keep in touch.  With long presence in Thailand, the Japanese Chamber has played an active role in promoting common understanding between Thai government agencies and the Japanese business community here. Japan-Thailand economic relationship is both special in breadth and depth. Even a casual observer cannot fail to notice this prosperous partnership. Trade between our nations has doubled in value over the past 5 years; that’s roughly 14 per cent increase per year. On the investment front, Japan’s annual direct investment in Thailand has been steady at close to 3 billion US dollars over the past few years, considerable uncertainties notwithstanding. Japanese financial service providers are lively participants in the Thai financial system.  Ladies and gentlemen,  Much has happened since we last met. The story of financial disruption is playing out in the US and reverberating across the world. Oil prices have increased by more than 50 per cent. Businesses and governments are looking for best response strategies to ensure smooth expansion of their enterprises and the economy in general. Tonight, I would like to focus on 3 related and timely subjects. I will begin with my view on the outlook of the Thai economy and the risks surrounding its prospects. Then, I would like to outline what I think is necessary for monetary and exchange rate policy going forward. And lastly, I would like to talk about how we can foster private investment and what Japanese businesses can do, in your role as investors and employers, to help make Thailand an even better place to invest.  Ladies and gentlemen, As you well know, the Thai economy had to weather through a host of challenges over the past 2 years. To my mind, and from the view of the Monetary Policy Committee, domestic political uncertainty, high and rising energy prices and sharp US dollar decline were at the top of our concern. Indeed, political uncertainty, coupled with rising retail oil prices, took a toll on private sector confidence and consumers’ purchasing power. These negative developments dented domestic demand during the first 9 months of 2007.  The fall of the US dollar, while widely anticipated, had been a major risk that could disrupt Thailand’s robust export activities. In fact, the risk was even greater after the extent of the US financial crisis became clearer during the second half of 2007. The US sub-prime mortgage market, while small compared to the entire global financial system, could deliver a large impact on the back of US housing concerns, credit crunch and global liquidity squeeze. It made for a bad prognosis especially as last year’s growth momentum relied heavily on net exports.  When all is said and done, however, the Thai economy managed to grow at the rate of 5.7 per cent for the fourth quarter and 4.8 per cent for the whole year. Government pump-priming contributed to this favorable growth outcome. But most importantly, it turned out that net exports contributed to almost 60 per cent of the overall GDP growth. Indeed, exports grew at a remarkable rate of 18 per cent in US dollar terms in 2007. The robust expansion was due BIS Review 33/2008 1 
to the ability of exporters to adjust through quality improvement and search of new markets. But exceptional export performance was due no less to healthy global growth, which translated into strong trading partners’ demand. Another factor that contributed to the success of exports was our ability to preserve overall price competitiveness in the face of sharp dollar decline. I will come back to this point in a few minutes.  I would like to turn briefly now to economic stability. Monetary policy has been accommodative to growth since the beginning of 2007 with an aim to shore up domestic demand while keeping inflation in check. The outcome on this front is quite favorable, as headline and core inflation were well contained at 2.3 and 1.1 percent, respectively, by end-2007. Despite the unusual global situation, the Thai financial markets also remained resilient through 2007 with only moderate fluctuations. And while credit and deposit grew slowly, profitability of banks and financial institutions remained at a satisfactory level. Overall NPLs in the banking system remained moderate, as low income households’ ability to service debt started to decline mostly on account of slow income expansion. Ladies and gentlemen, These growth and stability outcomes under significant downside risks paint a picture of a resilient economy.  As far as the outlook for the Thai economy in 2008 is concerned, I would like to address first the growth momentum and then talk about the risks and uncertainties confronting the economy this year.  Preliminary data indicate that private consumption and investment are firming up after recovering during the fourth quarter last year. This is good news, as private consumption and investment constitute almost 70 per cent of total demand. Clearer political landscape post-election and continued spending by the government has helped revive private demand. Reflecting that, we have started to see strong pickup in imports in January. February data also confirmed the strength of imports. Moreover, plans for further fiscal stimulus as well as accelerated budget disbursement should ensure that domestic demand revival is firmly in place.  On the external side, even though export growth in January is especially robust at 33 per cent, the likelihood of seeing a repeat of spectacular export performance is slimmer this year, as global growth is projected to slow down considerably. In fact, export growth in February has already decelerated to 16 percent. Going forward, the risk factors that can weigh on the ability of the Thai economy to expand will likely come from the US recession and high oil and commodity prices.  In an increasingly integrated world, the slowdown in US demand can impact on Thailand’s export prospects. Despite the Fed’s aggressive interest rate cuts and innovative measures to forestall the rise in mortgage interest rates, substantial downside risk remains. Most US watchers agree that the US economy may not be able to avoid a recession; indeed, employment, house price and business confidence data all point to a possibility that it is already in a recession. It’s only a matter of how deep and how long this process will last. But while the US economy weakens substantially with worsening prospects, global price pressure is not letting off. Crude oil prices continue to rise as world oil demand strengthens in the face of limited global production capacity. In this tight demand-supply situation, adverse geopolitical events, unfavorable weather condition or further dollar slide can spike up oil prices. This phenomenon is not new. In fact, continued demand pressure coupled with supply constraint and other uncertainties have led countries to find substitutes to fossil fuel. So far they have found them in bio-fuels, which in turn put pressure on agriculture commodity prices.  Signs of mounting cost-push pressure from oil and commodity prices can be observed in the recent acceleration of domestic headline inflation, which rose above 5 per cent in February. 2 BIS Review 33/2008 
Such increase, if continued, can pose risk to the incipient recovery in private consumption as it lowers households’ purchasing power. Rising production and construction costs can also dampen business profit, especially in the face of tight control on final goods prices. Dampened prospects for profits in turn may lead to delays of planned investment. While this downside risk is substantial, there is also an upside. Higher commodity prices strengthen farm income, which tends to benefit a large section of the Thai workforce.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  The risks to global growth and global inflation have both increased in the near-term. At this point, we cannot be sure how the slowdown of global growth will affect global inflation this year. And even though, from an asset price perspective, there is a positive probability for a correction in oil and commodity prices going forward, we cannot be certain that such correction will be substantial enough to bring the inflation risk down.  One thing is more or less certain, however: Global financial interconnectedness almost all but ensures that we should expect higher financial volatility in the near term, as market players alternate between yield-seeking and risk-aversion investment strategies. The Bank of Thailand is closely monitoring the situation and assessing the impact on Thailand’s financial and economic stability.  Given the pickup in domestic growth momentum and various risks the Thai economy is likely to confront, the Monetary Policy Committee expected Thailand’s GDP to expand by 4.5-6 per cent this year while inflation excluding raw food and energy should remain within target of 0-3.5 per cent for the next 8 quarters. In the face of rising food and energy prices, headline inflation is expected to hover between 2.8-4 per cent in 2008, but is expected to come down next year. I want to note however that the Monetary Policy Committee’s new forecast will be given in April along with the latest Inflation Report.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I have talked at length about the economic outlook and risks going forward. What then is the appropriate course for monetary and exchange rate policy that I think can help cushion the economy along the bumpy road ahead?  Monetary policy is aimed to ensure price stability so that the economy can continue to expand at its full potential. The definition of price stability that the Monetary Policy Committee uses is in alignment with that of the public; that is, we want to see low and stable inflation over time. At the moment, when our policy interest rate is the lowest in the region, monetary policy continues to be supportive of domestic demand growth. In the periods ahead, the challenge to monetary policy is likely to come from increased price pressure.  With regard to our exchange rate policy, the Bank of Thailand has used the managed floating approach for some time now. Our principle is to let the exchange rate reflect the fundamentals of the economy relative to our trading partners and competitors.  In the short run, international price competitiveness depends on 2 things: 1. the appreciation of the Thai baht vis-à-vis a basket of currencies of our trading partners and competitors; and 2. the increase in production cost of a Thai company relative to that of our trading partners and competitors. For example, given the same appreciation path of two competing currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar, if production cost of a Thai company rises beyond that of its foreign competitors, then it loses price competitiveness. Generally, production cost rises with inflation. And so, keeping inflation low helps to lower relative cost increase for Thai exporters and boosts their price competitiveness. The exchange rate that the Bank of Thailand manages is that which represents price competitiveness; it is called the real effective exchange rate.  Let me give you a specific example: It is well known that even though the baht has gained against the US dollar, it has been appreciating in line with regional currencies. From the beginning of 2007 to early March 2008, the real effective exchange rate of China has BIS Review 33/2008 3 
appreciated by roughly 8 per cent while India has gained by 5.4 per cent. During the same period, the Thai baht real effective exchange rate has appreciated by only 1.8 per cent. So taking into account higher inflation in China and India, an average Thailand-based exporter has not lost price competitiveness against those based in these two countries.  Viewed in this light, the export boom should not come as a big surprise.  Ladies and Gentlemen, To gain the most from exchange rate flexibility, the Bank of Thailand has always sought to limit the volatility of the Thai baht-US dollar exchange rate. We do this because businesses use US dollar as invoice currency. To this end, the baht has been the least volatile currency in the region over the past year. Going forward, we will continue to take care of the short-term volatility when we deem it to be too disruptive to export or import price-setting. Over the next 12 months, as the global financial environment becomes even more volatile, it is likely that a few regional currencies will become more flexible. Those of you who follow the foreign exchange market regularly should know that markets are beginning to take different views about regional currencies after the US dollar has lost sufficient ground. No one knows for sure which way a currency will move, but with increasing likelihood we will see more 2-way movements in regional currencies. So the key message here to all parties concerned is that they should not assume a one-way movement in any currency over the next 12 months. Instead, they should make it a normal practice to hedge against undesirable outcomes.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Monetary and exchange rate policy can at best help safeguard economic stability and smooth out short-term fluctuations and bumps here and there. Price competitiveness may be important, but it is only one side of the story. The other side of competitiveness is product improvement and efficient production techniques. Japanese companies are no stranger to this dimension of competitiveness. After the Plaza Accord in the mid-1980s, when the yen gained roughly 50 per cent in one year against the US dollar, Japanese businesses found ways to improve. Those that succeeded became more resourceful as a result.  For the Thai economy to compete and grow robustly into the 21st century, we need to foster investment in infrastructure, physical and institutional, as well as in human resource. This is the only way to improve our productivity while enabling the majority of the Thai people to share the gains from economic growth and global integration.  What’s especially important to continued prosperity is the clarity and the implementation of planned public investment over the next 5 years. These plans, as they are, will address the entire spectrum of infrastructure deficiency our economy faces. The public sector’s commitment to invest heavily where it matters most should help boost business sentiment and with it private investment, an important growth engine that had been held back over the past few years. Moreover, the modernization of public transportation, housing and water resource management, as well as health and education spending should translate into better private sector return from cost reduction and productivity increase. Better outlook for returns should enhance the charm of Thailand as an investment destination.  We also need to focus on service as well as manufacturing sectors. In fact, the service sector is larger than manufacturing in employment terms. The Bank of Thailand can help in this endeavor by continuing to strengthen our financial infrastructure. Aside from broadening people’s access to financial services, we also aim to promote competition in the financial sector. Competition, while being mindful of the risks involved, will enhance efficiency as well as knowledge building and transfer. With good prudential supervision in the background, the pressure of competition will help ensure that our financial institutions can perform well in the globally competitiveness environment. To this end, better accounting standard, for example, the adoption of IAS 39, is expected to strengthen financial sector’s resiliency to adverse shocks and will bring forward better investment climate.  4 BIS Review 33/2008 
Going hand in hand with modern infrastructure has to be skilled human resource. Studies on labor market condition and my dialogues with entrepreneurs, Thai and foreign, have confirmed that labor quality shortage is the key problem here as well as everywhere else in the world. To be sure, formal schooling is an important source of skill and quality development, but experience in the workplace contributes no less. In Thailand, there is an acute problem of skill mismatch; that is, skills produced through formal schooling are found to be different from those which firms find useful.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Japan’s direct investment here has contributed to skill improvement for Thai businesses and workforce, mostly through learning by doing, training and other knowledge transfers. But beyond that, to reduce mismatch in demand and production of skills, Japanese firms can play a direct and beneficial role. The solution is to break down the barrier between work and school early on. Firms can get involved in training vocational students while potential workers can get a glimpse of what’s really needed out there in the real world. If done well, I think it gives incentive for firms to invest in training these students because it gives them the opportunity to identify and select the best workers before they enter the workforce. To the students, there are potential gains as an incentive as well. With the opportunity to be trained by the best and getting to know its corporate culture first-hand, student trainees are more likely to compete for limited hires by improving their performance. This sort of apprenticeship program has long been practiced in Germany, and has been shown to reduce skill mismatch in the workplace as well as improve firms’ profitability. Practiced here, it could also reinforce mutual understanding between Thai workers and the ways Japanese firms do business. That said, human capital development takes vast and continuous effort over a long period of time. In the near term, I think your experience from adjusting to the yen’s sharp appreciation should be particularly helpful to your local partners. Japanese companies are capable of lending a helping hand to your local suppliers as they try to upgrade their productive efficiency. That would help smooth their adjustment process during these rough and tumble times.  Ladies and gentlemen,  I hope I have contributed to your understanding of the economic conditions and outlook for Thailand. The Thai economy has shown that it is resilient to adverse shocks. I am confident that our fundamentals are strong. Public investment in basic infrastructure and the Bank of Thailand’s commitment to maintain economic and financial stability should translate into moderate long-term cost of investment financing.  With the awareness of what’s in store for us and the right macroeconomic policy mix going forward, we should see the economy expand favorably and in a sustainable fashion. I need not mention how crucial it is to both Thailand and Japan in ensuring that our trade and investment partnership prosper in the years to come. Thank you for your attention.

Shamshad Akhtar: Corporate governance for banks Speech by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the IBP Convocation, Lahore, 13 March 2008. *      *      * This morning I propose to share with you my thoughts on the topical issue of “Corporate Governance for Banks”. Corporate governance revolves around the basic principles of fairness, transparency and accountability. Contrary to the perception of many, good governance is not a new phenomenon – the concept of well governed companies has been there ever since formal businesses took over the barter trading system. “Corporate Governance” received fresh impetus and widespread recognition during the 1990s with launching of the Cadbury Report in the UK and prognosis of East Asian Crisis of the late 1990s and a series of corporate scandals in West including the Enron Scandals. Together the loss of investor confidence and economy generated by the corporate failures brought to forefront the significance of corporate governance. Global and regional debates and initiatives have helped promote greater fairness, transparency and accountability, though there remains scope for still better understanding of its dimensions and effective implementation.  Corporate governance is critical to improving economic efficiency and growth. It serves as a deterrent to mismanagement and infuses discipline in the decision making process of boards of directors. Adherence to the principles of good corporate governance serves to foster investor confidence and attract domestic as well as foreign investors. Companies operating on the principles of good corporate governance are able to attract investment. A study conducted by McKinsey quarterly indicated that investors would be willing to pay as much as 30 percent more for shares in companies having effective corporate governance. A number of surveys of investors in Europe and the US support the same findings and show that investors eventually reduce their investments in a company that practices poor governance.  Why corporate governance matters for banks? The need for corporate governance in Pakistan is unmistakable. The country has steadily responded to the corporate governance challenges and progress in the banking sector is particularly impressive. Before we consider the corporate governance reforms for banks and the outstanding agenda, let us first explore why corporate governance matters for the banking system!  Most importantly, the financial system in Pakistan continues to be predominantly bank-based, with bank assets to GDP ratio of 58.8 percent for 2007. Good corporate governance for banks, therefore, becomes critical in ensuring solvency and stability of the financial system as effectively governed banks are more efficient and prudent in directing their resources. Secondly, banks are highly-leveraged: they lend money borrowed from depositors and must therefore be accountable to these depositors. The corporate governance framework should, therefore, ensure aligning the interests of the management with equity and debt holders. The corporate governance of banks is intricately tied to the corporate governance of firms with former enforcing discipline through proper due diligence of conduct of corporate and their financial, while proper governance at corporate level help in safeguarding bank’s interests. Thirdly, ownership and group structure of banks in Pakistan is highly varied. The banking sector comprises of foreign-controlled, family-owned and some state-owned banks, with each type of ownership structure posing its peculiar governance challenges. Moreover, some banks operate as part of industrial/commercial groups while a large number of them have BIS Review 33/2008 1 
exposure to the non-bank financial sector through ownership and control. In such a scenario, transparency and fairness in banks’ lending and investment decisions, particularly those concerning group companies, becomes a crucial requirement.  Finally, banks need to adopt good governance practices and customer service standards in order to build public confidence in credibility of their operations. Banks operate in a highly vulnerable environment where bonafide or perceived impression of malpractices in a bank’s dealings could trigger a run on its deposits. Role of SBP  SBP has been on the forefront in promoting good corporate governance in the country. Primarily as the regulator and supervisor of banks and DFIs, SBP has a crucial role in steering corporate governance reforms in the banking sector. In this regard, SBP has implemented a comprehensive corporate governance regime for banks, which is driven by a robust legal and regulatory framework, risk-based supervision and over-arching banking sector reforms, notably, privatization, liberalization and consolidation of banks.  The major thrust of legal and regulatory requirements is to strengthen the functioning of the Boards of directors of banks. In setting out the responsibilities of the Board, SBP requires directors to focus on policy making and general direction, oversight and supervision of the business of the bank. The directors are expected to meet frequently, set up Board committees for audit, risk management, recruitment and compensation, and attend training programs to help them discharge their role as a director.  In a recent move, SBP has separated the positions of chairman and CEO of banks and made it mandatory on banks to appoint on the Board at least 25% independent directors and not more than two executive directors. SBP has also strengthened the fit and proper criteria and approves appointment of directors and CEO of banks in line with the criteria. Banks must also follow the fit and proper criteria in appointing key executives although such appointments do not require SBP approval. Recognizing the centrality of proper risk management in corporate governance framework, SBP has issued guidelines on risk management, internal controls, IT security and business continuity planning. Detailed instructions are available in the policy framework for banks. Risk management framework is laid out in the regulatory requirements that check banks’ exposure to group companies and other related parties, restrict exposure to single borrower, borrowing group or sector, as well as limit banks’ investments in equity market. Key requirements in this regard are:  (i) Shareholding by a bank/DFI in other companies has been restricted to 30 percent of the other company’s paid up capital or 30 percent of the paid up capital and reserves of the acquiring bank/DFI, whichever is lower. (Section 23 (2) of BCO) (ii) Banks/DFIs have been restricted from taking unsecured exposures on their directors, major shareholders, CEO, their families and firms or companies in which such persons have interest. In case a secured exposure is to be taken, it shall require prior approval of the Board of directors, excluding the director concerned, and the facility shall be extended by the bank at prevailing terms and conditions, on an arm’s length basis.  (iii) Standard limits at 30 percent and 50 percent (including 20 percent and 35 percent for fund based exposure) of bank’s/DFIs’ equity apply on single and group exposures, respectively. Furthermore, contingent liabilities of a bank/DFI should not exceed 10 times its equity. Likewise, clean lending to single persons is limited to Rs. 0.5 million while aggregate exposure against all clean facilities should not exceed the equity of any bank/DFI. SBP has also specified that banks’/DFIs’ exposure to a 2 BIS Review 33/2008 
company cannot exceed 10 times of borrowing entity’s equity and the borrower’s current ratio cannot be lower than 1:1.  (iv) Banks/DFIs should not invest in shares of any company/scrip in excess of 5 percent of their equity. Banks/DFIs will require prior approval from SBP in order to purchase shares of a company in excess of 5 percent of their paid-up capital or 10 percent of the capital of the investee company, whichever is lower. Furthermore, aggregate investments of banks in shares should not exceed 20 percent of their equity. Any shares acquired in excess of 5% limit due to underwriting commitments must be off loaded within a period of three months.  (v) Banks/DFIs may also take exposure in future contracts to the extent of 10 percent of their equity on aggregate basis. In this connection, the 10 percent exposure limit for future contracts will include both positions taken in futures buying and selling.  To strengthen further risk management framework, SBP like other countries is steering the implementation of Basel-II in a phased manner. Initially banks are required to adopt the Standardized Approach for credit risk and the Basic Indicator/ Standardized Approach for operational risk from 1st January 2008. Subsequently, once they have improved their in house systems, they would have the option to switch over to more advanced approaches from 1st January 2010 subject to the adequacy of capacities and capabilities and its due diligence by SBP.  As a further step to strengthen governance of banks, they are required to undergo credit rating annually. The rating must be announced publicly and disclosed in the financial statements of the bank.  SBP also requires banks to appoint auditors from a panel of pre-approved auditors maintained by it. The objective is to ensure credibility of audited financial statements of banks. In the area of monitoring and supervision, SBP has implemented a comprehensive framework, which is underpinned by regular on-site inspections of banks and DFIs under the regulatory ambit of SBP. Banks are inspected in accordance with a pre-approved annual inspection plan, following the CAMELS-S1 approach. SBP has also developed a comprehensive surveillance mechanism – the Institutional Risk Assessment Framework (IRAF) – to capture the host of risks facing individual banks based on the information gathered from on-site inspections, off-site supervision, market intelligence and self-assessment by banks. The objective is to obtain a composite rating for each bank for effective and proactive supervision by SBP. Finally, SBP is endeavoring to further strengthen its own governance processes in consultation with its Board of directors. An adequate and appropriate governance framework is crucial for the optimal functioning of any enterprise, but more so for a central bank because of its objectives of maintaining price stability and ensuring financial stability along with its crucial contribution to the overall economic policy framework. Furthermore, a vibrant and effective regulator is able to carry forward the corporate governance reform process more rigorously. SBP is fully cognizant of the need to implement good governance practices in its own functioning and has empowered its Board of directors to provide oversight and direction of affairs and business of SBP. In order to modernize SBP’s operational strategies and strengthen its governance, the organization has been successfully restructured in 2006, followed by adoption of market-driven compensation packages for its employees in 2007. The focus of the SBP management has been on improving risk management and internal                                                  1  CAMELS-S covers capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity in addition to systems and controls of banks. BIS Review 33/2008 3 
controls systems within the organization as well as enhancing transparency in its communications on policy and financial sector issues. SBP is also working towards developing adequate policy framework for consumer protection and has set up a Consumer Protection Department to safeguard consumer interests. Impact of corporate governance reforms Pursuant to multiple reforms initiated for the purpose, there has been a visible improvement in the corporate governance practices of banks. The fundamental change is in the effectiveness of the board. The implementation of Fit and Proper criteria has ensured that board members are well equipped to carry out their responsibilities. The criteria is also a measure to exclude unscrupulous individuals from the highly responsible position of a board member, In terms of performance, the Boards of directors now meet more frequently, focusing largely on strategic objectives and management oversight. The scope of the Board’s policy making function has enhanced to cover a broad range of areas, such as systems and control, risk management, human resources, credit, investments, etc.  Professional management is appointed to carry on the banks’ operations. Furthermore, internal control system has been strengthened in banks through setting up of audit committees and internal audit functions. Compliance officers are now appointed to manage banks’ compliance to the policy framework and laws and regulations, including the AML requirements.  The frequency of financial reporting has improved through circulation of quarterly accounts. Financial reporting standards are at par with international best practices while credibility of financial information has received a boost through rotation of auditors after every five years. Enhanced disclosure has positive implications which go beyond just accounting statements of the banking entity. It is a mechanism for the market to assess the quality of assets, and earnings, and expose any hidden risk, for example those arising from associates, subsidiaries, related parties lending etc.  These improvements have been reflected in international assessments of corporate governance framework in Pakistan. The ROSC-CG assessment of Pakistan in June 2005 acknowledges that “Reform to improve corporate governance has been significant, including the introduction of a Code of Corporate Governance and increased vigilance by regulators.” The ROSC-CG assessment further notes that “The SBP has also been instrumental in improving corporate governance in the banking system, by requiring banks and DFIs to adopt the Code, and by assessing compliance with other relevant aspects of prudential regulation specifically applicable to banks/DFIs.” Similarly the World Bank’s 2007 report on Doing Business in South Asia recognizes that “Pakistan provides relatively strong protections for minority shareholders against the misuse of corporate assets”. It ranks 19th worldwide on protecting investors.  Outstanding corporate governance reform agenda  While considerable progress has been achieved in enhancing corporate governance practices of banks, SBP is geared towards filling in the remaining gaps.  In this regard, foremost is the need to develop a suitable cadre of professional directors who are knowledgeable of banks’ affairs as well as independent of their management and majority shareholders. Allied to this is the need to clarify and strengthen directors’ fiduciary duties to act in the interests of the bank and all of its stakeholders. It is also essential for banks to provide sufficient time and information to directors to prepare for Board meetings, structure Board meetings so as to allow ample time for discussion and establish appropriate criteria for assessing and improving performance of directors, including independent 4 BIS Review 33/2008 
directors. To raise awareness on these and related aspects, SBP is working towards issuing comprehensive corporate governance guidelines for banks.  As earlier discussed, Pakistan’s corporate and financial sectors present corporate governance issues peculiar to complex ownership and group structures. By conducting operations through a complex network of subsidiaries, controlling shareholders often acquire control of operations and/or cash flows disproportionate to their equity stake in individual companies. The key issues that arise as a result include: (i) inequitable treatment of stakeholders; (ii) dominance of controlling shareholder-directors over Board proceedings; (iii) lack of independence of the Board from the management; and (iv) channeling of bank resources to the benefit of group concerns.  In order to address such corporate governance issues, there is a need for group supervision by the regulators. As regard the banking supervision, SBP is working towards introduction of consolidated supervision whereby it will not be monitoring banks as a stand-alone entity but rather as part of the entire banking group. This will help to evaluate the strength of the entire group and to mitigate risks arising from group companies. A significant component of consolidated supervision will be review of group structures and detailed examination of related party transactions.  I would also like to share with you that SBP has recently launched a survey of banks to assess their corporate governance practices. The survey will help to identify areas for reform in the regulatory framework as well as its implementation by banks. The survey results will be a key input in further improving the corporate governance framework for banks.  Conclusion Good corporate governance is essential in establishing an attractive investment climate characterized by competitive companies and efficient financial markets. It is imperative that Pakistan’s banking sector develops and implements good governance practices, in order to provide impetus to economic growth. In the realm of a rapidly globalizing world – characterized by liberalization of markets, relatively free-er trade, sophistication of financial products and instruments, and growing awareness among consumers – Pakistan is ripe with lucrative opportunities for foreign and local investors alike. I would also like to mention that no amount of regulatory intervention can fully institutionalize corporate governance unless Boards and senior management of banks appreciate the value addition of corporate governance to their productivity and competitiveness. In this context, banks should strive to build a reputation for honest and fair dealing while interacting with their internal as well as external stakeholders. Ethics, transparency and the competition for reputation, which are the cornerstone of good corporate governance, would invariably be the distinguishing features of banks that emerge ahead in an increasingly competitive market.

Mohamed S Fofana: Benefits of microfinance in Sierra Leone Speech by Mr Mohamed S Fofana, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sierra Leone, at the Official Opening Ceremony of the ProCredit Bank (SL) Limited, Freetown, 1 February 2008. *      *      * Madam Chairperson  Ministers of Government  Members of the Diplomatic Corps  Members of the Board of Directors,  Senior Management and Staff of the ProCredit Bank (SL) Limited  Heads of Banks and other Financial Institutions  Colleagues from the Fourth Estate  Distinguished Ladies & Gentlemen:  I am happy to be here this afternoon to address this distinguished audience on the official opening ceremony of the ProCredit Bank (SL) Limited. The Bank of Sierra Leone issued a licence to ProCredit Bank (SL) Limited to conduct banking business in Sierra Leone on 1st August, 2007, and the bank opened its doors on 3 August 2007.  Its activities, since that time, have been largely focused on microfinance promotion; taking deposits from and giving credits to small businesses. This is an important mile-stone in Sierra Leone’s poverty reduction drive, which is consistent with Government’s desire to make the microfinance sub sector of the financial industry viable and responsive to the needs of the vast majority of Sierra Leoneans.  Madam Chair, Distinguished Guests, the benefits of microfinance are numerous and well documented, especially as they relate to a country’s effort in reducing poverty. I cannot go through all such benefits this afternoon. I will however attempt to highlight a few.  Credit to small business will enhance the ability of poor households to increase incomes, build assets and reduce their vulnerability in times of economic stress. With better access to micro credit services on a continuing basis, the poor, particularly women, become more active partners and more importantly, pro-active partners, in the development process.  Madam Chair, though micro credit has been used in various forms in the recent past to address the needs of the most vulnerable in post-conflict Sierra Leone, the providers of the micro credit have had an uncoordinated framework with each implementing its own scheme. This sometimes created an unnecessary duplication and waste in the use of scarce resources.  Thus, in October 2003, Sierra Leone adopted a national micro finance policy which provides the fundamental framework and direction for stakeholders operating in the microfinance industry.  Recognizing the importance of micro finance in reducing poverty, and in anticipation of the growing demand for micro credit products, ProCredit Bank (SL) Limited decided to increase its outreach depth to a greater number of small businesses in and around Freetown. Only five months after the commencement of operations at its head office, the bank requested and was given permission to open a branch in Kissy on 14th December, 2007. And we are delighted to note that another branch will soon be opened in Lumley – the West end of Freetown. The challenge after Lumley is for ProCredit to extend its activities in other areas of the country, which may be more deserving for their services.  By our estimates so far, ProCredit has already made some mark in the domestic Banking Industry and is poised to do more. As at end January, 2008, the bank’s credit portfolio amounted to about Le8.0 billion; this was disbursed to 1,440 customers. Deposit base during the same period stood at about Le3.0 billion, with an impressive record of 5,600 deposit BIS Review 33/2008 1 
accounts. What is important here is that many of these customers are first-time account holders who might have found it difficult to open accounts with the traditional commercial banks. Loan recovery has also recorded a formidable and impressive rate. We therefore commend the management and staff for this ground-breaking performance.  Microfinance activities now include products such as micro credit, micro insurance, mobile banking, etc, which are designed to increase the product portfolio and provide customers with a variety of products that are easily accessible. We believe that with the increased efforts to further institutionalise microfinance activities in the country, we will soon see a wider variety of microfinance products for small scale producers.  Madam Chair, I believe this is a befitting occasion to discuss what we, at the Bank of Sierra Leone, are doing to foster an efficient, sound and stable financial sector, including microfinance. The Bank of Sierra Leone, in collaboration with MITAF, is drafting guidelines for the regulation and supervision of deposit-taking Microfinance Institutions. Development in this area is far advanced. The Bank of Sierra Leone has also recognised the need to bring the legal framework for regulating the banking sector consistent with international best practice. Hence, in consultations with our International partners, (ADB, IMF, World Bank, etc), the Bank of Sierra Leone is undertaking a comprehensive review of the Banking Act 2000, and the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2005 in order to align them with international best practices and to address some of the weaknesses which have been identified while implementing them. We anticipate that once these legislations have been amended, the legal framework will provide a conducive environment for a more robust banking sector.  Going forward, the Bank of Sierra Leone plans to draft operating guidelines for other specialised institutions, including Merchant and Agricultural banks, in order to broaden the financial landscape in the economy.  Traditional Commercial banks, on the other hand, should endeavour to increase product innovation and diversification. The real challenge for all of us is how to enhance savings mobilisation and effectively channel such savings to their most productive use.  Madam Chair, Distinguished Guests, let me conclude my remarks with a serious appeal to the entire banking industry for the better packaging of banking products for our clients. This, I believe will enhance our service delivery, which in turn, will enable us offer more affordable banking services. Providing affordable banking services has the potential of drawing a larger number of Sierra Leoneans to the formal financial system, resulting in an expanded banking clientele. This also has the potential of reducing delivery cost for the banks; hence the potential to increase profit maximization for both banks and their clients.  Finally, let me thank the Board of Directors and Management of ProCredit Bank for inviting me to this occasion. I wish you every success in your operations as you compete to make your presence felt in the industry. I would also like to covey appreciation from the Governor, who is unavoidable absent on this occasion.  I thank you all for your attention.  2 BIS Review 33/2008 
Ardian Fullani: Electronic data transmission enhancements in Albania Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the launch of the electronic data transmission project which relates to the execution of primary market auctions of the Government securities, Tirana, 13 March 2008. *      *      * Dear participants, The Bank of Albania, the Ministry of Finance and the REUTERS have successfully finalized today after a year of close cooperation the electronic data transmission project, which relates to the execution of primary market auctions for the sale of the Albanian Government securities. This project minimizes the time from the submission of commercial banks’ requests to participate in the auction until the announcement of the results to the market players. Otherwise said, the physical delivery of documentation is coming to an end. The Bank of Albania as the auction agent and the Ministry of Finance as the securities issuer have considered the more developed countries’ standards. These two institutions have had a collaborative endeavour to be close to the market by establishing a partner relationship in order to meet the mutual demands.  However the achievement of success cannot be understood without the information technology support. In this respect the REUTERS has played a key role. The auction process goes through the following phases.  First phase: Commercial banks’ bids are made electronically, not physically. This way of data transmission avoids the manual entry of bids, reduces the time for their entry, increases the safety and accuracy of entries by providing at end-process the minimization of operational risk and the required time to process the information.  Second phase: Following the preliminary processing of data sent by the participants in the primary market the Ministry of Finance may be provided with the data electronically as well. The provision of electronic data reduces the time required for the Ministry of Finance to be informed of through the physically sent documents.  Third phase: After the decision is taken the Ministry of Finance may transmit this decision electronically, contributing further to the reduction of time in informing the market related with the auction result. The entire process described in these three phases required about 5 to 6 hours but upon the implementation of this project it will be reduced to 1 hour.  Fourth phase: The Bank of Albania transmits this result to commercial banks through the REUTERS. At the moment the commercial banks are the main market participants. The transmission of this information in a shorter time allows commercial banks to administer their free funds more efficiently.  The enhancement of this efficiency is a step further in establishing the preconditions for developing the money market and the securities market. Dear participants, In conclusion I would like to underline that this project provides to the market an important infrastructural element. Starting from today, the securities market will speak in the language of electronics. However, the Bank of Albania will introduce in April a full package of improvements which will focus on the development of the financial market and stability. BIS Review 32/2008 1

Shamshad Akhtar: Pakistan – economic sustainability Speech by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the JP Morgan – Pakistan Corporate Access Forum, Dubai, 5 March 2008. *      *      * Pakistan has withstood series of endogenous events, including political uncertainty as a lead up to election, and the unprecedented exogenous shocks that have ranged from financial markets turmoil to climbing global commodity prices. On domestic political front, with elections now over the country is well on its way to a smooth transition gearing for a fully democratic system. Leading parties’ efforts to cement a coalition augurs well for confidence building; smooth functioning of legislature and their inbuilt accountability, while ensuring representation of public voice in steering the formulation and implementation of the future economic agenda. Ruling and opposition parties will need to rise above personal agenda to ensure sustainability of democracy. After a period of benign global economic environment, world economic outlook since August 2007 has been adversely impacted by subprime mortgage meltdown and its ripple effects on financial markets. Advanced countries are facing slowdown in economic activity. To mitigate the ensuing recessionary pressures, easing of monetary policy by the United States are to compound the already high inflationary pressures emerging from the exceptional rise in the global commodity prices, in particular of products such as oil, gold and wheat. Thus far Pakistan, like other Asian economies, remained immune to these shocks. Economic and financial markets remained calm in Pakistan as they had limited exposure to the US subprime market and other related products. With financial market turmoil deepening, the slowdown in economic growth and consequent reduced demand of advanced countries triggered greater uncertainty and induced vulnerabilities in international equity markets. These developments have begun to cast shadow, impacting emerging economies equity markets softening their growth prospects, albeit they remain set to grow strongly and.  Pakistan, like other emerging markets, faces a key question regarding sustainability of its economic achievements. Abstracting from political debates, there is widespread confidence that Pakistan has achieved a significant economic turnaround. While short terms challenges and stresses have magnified, I propose to provide perspectives that the turnaround achieved is sustainable provided it is urgently backed by a well designed macroeconomic stabilization package and deeper structural reforms. In my presentation I make the case that Pakistan has strong economic growth potential given the country’s inherent dynamics. Second, restoring macroeconomic sustainability, despite disruption in FY08 trends, has to be on top of economic agenda and is feasible given scope for domestic resource mobilization and improved debt management. Third, there is need to deepen investment incentives and climate have to improve. Finally, Pakistan is and has to build momentum to diversify agriculture, industry as well as export base, and develop infrastructure. Implementation of this agenda will augur well for country’s long term economic growth prospects while offering wide range of investment opportunities that make Pakistan an attractive destination.  Economic performance and potential Pakistan average economic growth rate was 6.3% for fiscal years (FY) FY03-07: during these 5 years economic growth was above 7% in two years and 9% in FY04-05 confirming rise in trend growth rate and capturing well the real economic potential. In productive sectors growth has been broad-based but accompanied by underlying structural shifts. Services sector has been the most buoyant and constitute over 53% of the overall GDP, with BIS Review 32/2008 1 
agricultural sector’s share declining from 25.9% in FY00 to 20.9% in FY07 and industrial sector’s contribution rising from 23% to 27% over this period. Rising domestic consumption demand has been the main driver of growth; accompanying rise, albeit somewhat slow, in investment rate. After averaging around 18.6% over the FY03-06, investment rate grew to 23% in FY07 – reflecting a 4.4% percentage point growth in investment/GDP ratio in one year. This was expected to be boosted further by significant growth in public investment in FY08, though given fiscal exigencies a part of this may not be realized.  Pakistan’s rich and large landscape offers a sizeable domestic market that is likely to double, reaching a population base of 230 million by 2030. Being at the crossroads of South Asia, Central Asia and West Asia with close proximity, both by air and sea, to the Gulf region makes Pakistan a promising regional hub and market for nurturing intra and inter-regional trade and investment. Recognizing these considerations, Multinational Corporations several years back set up businesses here. As confidence in Pakistan’s economy grew, there has been a significant growth in foreign capital inflows, cumulatively estimated to be around $13.5 billion (including global deposit receipts flows) over the last five years. The telecom sector, the major recipient of foreign investment close to $4.6 billion, is under private ownership and management; among other achievement the number of mobile subscribers is now over 80 million. Similarly, close to half of banking assets are now under foreign ownership as close to $2.7 billion foreign equity was injected in the sector and oil and gas sector has attracted $1.4 billion. Pakistan is now a well tested destination for foreigners. Corporate and banking companies’ returns have been high and investors, be domestic or foreign, are being well compensated for whatever risk premium they attach to Pakistan.  Restore macroeconomic stability; despite the disruption caused by 2007 events Economic growth of Pakistan has benefited from macroeconomic stability. Containing macroeconomic imbalances helped generate (i) external current account surpluses in two of the preceding five fiscal years while (ii) fiscal deficit was below 4% in three of the five preceding fiscal years supported by surplus or zero primary balances (reflecting an effort to balance current revenues with current expenditures).  Pakistan however now faces renewed economic vulnerabilities. Among others, compulsion to subsidize food, oil products and power & gas tariffs by preventing full pass through of international price hikes and to raise public investment to address infrastructural and skills gaps, essential to maintain growth path, have together disrupted progress in fiscal containment. Corrective policy actions, taken in the last few weeks, including rise in petroleum products, electricity and gas prices and cuts in development expenditures will at best ease marginally fiscal strains.  Notwithstanding, the growing aggregate demand pressures in face of rising per capita income, six-fold increase in remittance, set to reach $6.5 billion for FY08, and exceptional rise in private credit, high import growth of petroleum products and capital, intermediate and raw material goods have compounded these vulnerabilities. Underlying demand pressure and threefold increase in import oil bill coupled with slow down in export growth has also widened external current account deficit.  Keeping strong vigilance on the economy, the central bank took a lead in containing the aggregate demand pressures. Incrementally, monetary policy was tightened through three rounds of raising the SBP policy rate (by 300bp) since April 2005 to 10.5%, raising the reserve ratio, and improving liquidity management through open market operations. Monetary policy in Pakistan has benefited from the independence and strong accountability of the central bank as well as from the central bank’s conscious efforts to ensure transparency in public communications of monetary policy stance and perspective on the economy. Monetary policy has managed to keep inflationary pressures in check by 2 BIS Review 32/2008 
managing to lower core inflation; slippages in inflation target were inevitable given the uptrend in the global commodity prices as well as structural complexities and inefficiencies of wholesale and retail markets.  Global and domestic cyclical events will undoubtedly pose frequent challenges for small and open economies, like Pakistan. Recognizing this, the new Government will need to strengthen the Medium-Term Macroeconomic Stabilization Program and front load it, while accelerating the implementation of structural reforms to realign deficits to sustainable levels. Keeping this in perspective, the Government’s broader economy strategy for the next few years will need to include: i. Increasing domestic resource mobilization to raise revenue/GDP ratio by at least 5 percentage points of GDP. This is possible given the scope for enlargement of tax base: the existing tax regime collects almost 68% of taxes from manufacturing and corporate sector, while agriculture and services sectors (aside from banks) are exempt and segments of economy are outside tax net; ii. Nation-wide campaign to raise saving levels through continued efforts to raising awareness and deepening financial markets;  iii. Restricting large proportion of new resource mobilization for public investment, while prioritizing the recurrent expenditures through a major overhauling of the Government machinery; iv. Restoring the momentum of privatization of state-owned enterprises, which has been one of the most successful in Asia. The Government has sold off cumulatively almost $7 billion of assets over FY00-FY08 and there are around 61 state entities in the pipeline; v. Providing more autonomy to public sector organizations, with effective leadership and management, to improve their operational and financial efficiencies accompanied by a program to strengthen their balance sheets which should allow them to graduate from budgetary allocations to seeking funding from the market; and vi. Raising private investment/GDP from 23% to at least 28% which involves significant tapping additional resources both from domestic and international financial markets. Although this is an ambitious macroeconomic framework, but launching and adhering to it is attainable and critical. To position itself, Pakistan plans to further enhance its policy framework and tap its economic potential by mobilizing additional foreign capital that is likely to be attracted as the country offers lucrative investment opportunities across all sectors. Deepening of liberal incentive and investment regime will help economic sustainability Broad based deregulation and liberalization of investment and pricing regime, Pakistan attracted cumulatively $13.5 billion investment across all strategic sectors. This has been facilitated by easing entry of domestic private sector and foreign equity with flexibility to fully own businesses. Long standing liberal and partial capital account convertibility allows individuals, firms or companies to freely undertake all international transactions through the interbank market. Aside from allowing 100% foreign equity, there are no bars on repatriation of capital, profits, royalty etc. Exchange rate stability has been supported by prudent exchange rate management. Recapitalization and restructuring/privatization and induction of professional management, banking sector has been the most dynamic sector. Liberal entry requirements and huge market potential given the current low financial penetration ratio have encouraged entry of global players. Foreign investors are allowed to hold up to 49% of the foreign equity in the banking sector, while banks with global Tier-1 capital is US$ 5 billion or more or institutions BIS Review 32/2008 3 
from the regional cooperation organizations (ECO) can hold up to 100% foreign equity in a banking institution in Pakistan. Companies acquired have to over the years be incorporated as wholly owned subsidiary or opening a branch in Pakistan. Even in those cases where foreign equity up to 49% is permissible, a higher percentage of foreign equity ownership is allowed by SBP on a case-to-case basis depending on the strength of the incoming institution.  Companies have further benefited from access to private credit which grew at an average rate of 25.5% for FY03-07. This growth has been supported by structural changes in banking sector which is largely private sector run. Over the last five years, profitability of banking sector has surged reaching $1.70 billion in 2007, return on equity growing to 20.0% by Sept 07 and net NPLs ratio reducing to 2.3%. Capital market has benefited from the growth in stock market capitalization from $7.51 billion to $65.9 billion by the end-2007 and rise in P/E ratios have attracted foreign portfolio investment.  To promote competition and efficiency corporate tax rate has been lowered and trade has been liberalized. Average tariffs are 7.6% and tariffs on import of plant, machinery & equipment for industrial sector has been reduced to 5% and for agriculture sector to zero percent while 50% Initial Depreciation Allowance is allowed. Nontariff barriers have been removed. Pakistan has Free Trade Agreements with the People’s Republic of China, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Iran and Mauritius; negotiations are underway with Singapore and the Gulf Cooperation Council to be concluded in 2008, and preferential trade arrangements are also underway with Afghanistan, Bosnia, Bangladesh, Canada, Russian Federation, Serbia, Syria, Switzerland, Laos, Thailand, Indonesia etc.  Future prospects for economic sustainability depends on building momentum of structural reforms – I will however dwell on the most strategic elements here.  Agriculture and food self sufficiency With global commodity prices on the rise and alternate uses of corn and other products as bio-fuels in vogue, enhancement of crop productivity and area under cultivation will be critical for stabilizing food prices and curbing recourse to imports that have induced fresh external vulnerabilities. Given also the country’s rich and diverse landscape, Pakistan has good potential to serve the GCC and Middle East at large and exploit export potential of its agro-based sector. Renewed efforts will need to be launched by the Government to improve yields of major crops by intensifying research and extension, application of right type of seed and other inputs and mechanization.  Comparative advantage in agriculture gives an edge in the development of agro-based industry, value-addition chains and processing and packaging of products and offer huge potential for growth and investment. Besides increasing value-addition, the Government has promoted private sector involvement; except for setting procurement price for wheat – to maintain strategic reserves – market-based pricing mechanism prevails for all agriculture produce. Efforts are underway for transmission of pricing signals to farmers (e.g. through introduction of a commodity futures market), development of crop insurance (particularly to encourage the raising of new cash crops such as oilseeds) and improvement in transportation and storage infrastructure. The proximity to the rich Middle East states, which are widely dependent on import of vegetable products, provides a strong market for agriculture-based products. The ancillary requirements to boost agricultural products exports also require massive investment in mass storage and transportation activities. Industrial and export growth and diversification Manufacturing sector has been growing at 8.4% and its share rose from 14.7% in FY00 to 19.1% by FY07. To realize its growth targets, industrial sector’s share in GDP has to rise to 4 BIS Review 32/2008 
30% and must be export led. The corner stone of industrial growth and diversification strategy is to set in place programs to: • Move up the value added chain in all key industries by developing capacities, skills and attracting strategic partnerships and technology; • Exploitation of mineral and other strategic resources of the economy; • Modernization, enhancement and design innovation in the textile industry. Scale enhancement could be achieved through foreign investment and joint venture/merger and acquisition. This would enable the textile industry, currently accounting for one-fourth of Pakistan’s output and 69% of exports, to withstand aggressive regional competition; and  • Developing backward and forward linkages of large scale industry with small and medium industry that will help in improving productivity and competitiveness. Export growth has been quite impressive, more than doubling to $18 billion over FY01-07. Export Plan for 2006-20131 envisages a rise in export/GDP ratio from around 13% to 15% to generate almost $40-45 billion of export revenues. The principal thrust of this strategy will be to promote export diversification to reduce industry and exports vulnerability to textile sector. Substantial exploration is underway to exploit Pakistan’s potential to promote:  • Agriculture exports efforts are underway to promote growth of minor crops and noncrop sector particularly dairy sector where Pakistan is now the world’s fifth largest producer. Aside from developing innovative guidelines for credit flows to the sector, efforts are underway to improve agriculture marketing, grading and quality; establishment of agriculture export processing zones with public-private partnership; encouragement of livestock development through cross breeding, artificial insemination and embryo transfer technology. Also, there is scope for expanding inland fish farms and developing in public: private partnership fish harbors etc.  • Pakistan, being the fourth largest cotton producer in the world after China, India and US, has strong raw material and experience-edge in textiles. To augment capacities, industry invested $5.5 billion over the FY99-FY05. There is further scope for a three to fourfold increase in spindle and looms capacity and to diversify product (knitwear, bed ware and ready-made garments) and market base and improve quality and design. • In view of the relocation of industry and changing production and subcontracting networks/hubs and alliances as newly industrialized economies move out of labor intensive industries, Pakistan has an opportunity to serve as an alternate production center for electronic, electrical, and engineering industry. • Pakistan has made some inroads into the medium and high-end technology products such as electronic goods and this area could be explored further. • Mineral is another sector where Pakistan has large potential given its copper, high quality granite and marble and gem reserves. • Finally, information technology (IT) and other services sectors which constitute 55% of GDP have a role to play in enhancing exports and can be nurtured by promoting venture capital and private equity funds and enhancing the skill base of population in this area.                                                       1  Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission: Export Plan – Pakistan Inc. 2007.

Infrastructure To enhance the competitiveness of Pakistan’s industry and exports, it is however critical to bridge infrastructure gaps. The Government has developed a broad based strategy and short, medium and long term plan for energy sector. Pakistan has good domestic reserves of oil, gas and other fuels and hydro potential. The investment requirements and opportunities arising from a well designed and integrated energy security plan that offers an Asian Energy Corridor are enormous. Potential within this corridor exists for mega projects that involve development, sharing and trading of energy resources between the largest producers of oil and gas in the Central Asian Republic and Middle East to the deficit countries including China, India and Pakistan.  To ensure energy security and sustainability, Pakistan’s energy plan recognizes the growth in domestic demand for energy that has to be catered by exploitation and development of balanced energy mix with maximum reliance on indigenous and environment-friendly resources, besides tapping the regional resources. Recognizing this, Pakistan plans to  i. Optimize energy mix between hydel: thermal from existing levels of 28:72 to 39:61 in the years ahead by exploiting all key sites with substantial hydel generation potential – this program will help in fuel substitution and energy efficiency resulting in savings of oil imports;  ii. Enhance exploration and development of gas reserves. Gas supplies are to be supplemented by exploiting cross border energy transaction through Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline, Turkmenistan and Qatar-Pakistan pipelines and import possibility of LNG;  iii. Unleash coal potential given the large measured reserves estimated to 3,300 million tons with substantially large inferred reserves. Major deposits are in Sindh province in Thar though other pockets also are showing promising signs; and  iv. Exploit renewable energy resources.  Investment requirements for key infrastructure programs were estimated to be in the range of $39 billion for 2005-2010. Over the long term, investment requirements will be staggering as, by some estimates, the aggregate power generation requirements alone will be around 143,310 MW during 2005-2030. Since 1994, generation has been largely in private sector and WAPDA – the largest utility company of Pakistan – has been unbundled by spinning off the regional distribution companies which are to be privatized. Given fiscal constraints, Pakistan has scope for limited public investments so bulk of the new development projects is to be available for private investment. The Private Power Infrastructure Board has floated 45 projects of 12 GW in pipeline, involving cost of close to $11 billion.  Independent Power Producers (IPP) are generating 6005 MW, with remaining 13,083 MW MW generated by WAPDA and KESC. IPP have made significant progress (excluding Hubco outside Power Sector Policy framework) though 66% of the total capital requirements were met from official debt sources. Drawing from the lesson learnt of past power sector policy, the 2002 Power Sector Policy set prices based on cost structure of the project as determined by the regulator. Pricing policy allow pass through of items such as the fuel price, interest rate and exchange rate. Pakistan needs $1 billion per year for new dams and related infrastructure, and $5 billion per year for transport infrastructure etc. In road sector, the Medium Term Development Program includes plans to improve 14000 km of existing road and construct 7000 km of new road. Pakistan has managed to promote public-private partnership for a highway project on BOT basis for Lahore-Faisalabad 4 lane divided express way on 25 year concession agreement. The National Trade Corridor is one of the strategic integrated projects that aims to develop trade route from ports in south of Pakistan to northwest towards Afghanistan and Central Asian Republics and will carry 500 million tons of freight up the north-south route and another 50 million tons of international freight. Aside from expansion of two ports in Karachi 6 BIS Review 32/2008 
city, commissioning of Gawadar port, awarded to Port of Singapore for management and operation. Located at the mouth of the Persian Gulf and outside the Straits of Hormuz, this port will serve as a regional hub for energy transportation.  The Government has now developed a policy and legal framework for the Public Private Partnership (PPP) which will be supported by the Infrastructure Project Financing Facility (financed by the Government and Multilateral Development Banks). A Project Development Fund will help identify, prepare and procure PPP projects to support economically viable projects, mobilize private capital resources and float the corporate and infrastructure bonds. To support delivery of basic services, public funding will complement and replace user fee to the extent feasible to facilitate viability gap funding along with a supportive risk management framework.  Improving productivity Pakistan is structuring a number of initiatives to allow for enhancement in total factor productivity growth which has been key driver of East Asian economic growth. Besides encouraging higher enrollment accompanied by improvement in standards in each of the education tier, investments are being made to (i) enhance vocational and technical education which thus far only caters for requirements of one percent of 15-23 years age cohort; (ii) open six foreign sponsored Universities to augment supply and quality of higher education in the country; and (iii) enhance SME and industry entrepreneurial skills. Supplementary efforts are underway to develop strong integrated linkages between technology and R&D needs of industrial sector and science and technical education. Conclusion Pakistan has great potential, both in terms of its natural and human resource, and has developed fairly good forward looking development agenda and plans. A major breakthrough in industrial and export diversification depends, among others, critically on reinvigorating agriculture sector and ensuring adequate availability of infrastructure to meet the growing economic requirements. Given huge domestic demand and high returns in virtually every sector, there has been a strong interest in Pakistan’s economy as illustrated by the strong foreign investment that has come from both GCC and West. The region given its diversity and richness of resources – with Gulf countries accounting for large proportion of world’s oil and gas proven reserves and now holding sizeable world foreign exchange reserves – along with Pakistan’s large agriculture and growing industrial base, domestic market, skilled labor force which, if effectively, exploited offers opportunities for deepening collaboration and cooperation for mutual advantage. The new Government given its strong political backing has the opportunity to restore macroeconomic stability disrupted in last couple of years which should help restore investor confidence and allow country to attract non-debt creating flows critical for development of industry and infrastructure sectors and to ease the balance of payments situation.

Mohamed S Fofana: Bank of Sierra Leone Charity Trust Fund Keynote address by Mr Mohamed S Fofana, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sierra Leone, at the Scholarship Award Ceremony of the Bank of Sierra Leone Charity Trust Fund, Freetown, 25 January 2008.  *      *      * Mr Chairman  Members of the Board of Trustees of the Bank of Sierra Leone Charity Trust Fund  Board of Directors and Management of the Bank of Sierra Leone  Officials of the Ministry of Education  Heads of Commercial Banks and other Financial Institutions  Members of the Fourth Estate  Distinguished Guests, including the Awardees  Students and pupils  It is my honour and privilege to warmly welcome you all to the Scholarship Award Ceremony of the Bank of Sierra Leone Charity Trust Fund.  The idea of a Charity Trust Fund was conceived by the Bank of Sierra Leone in the wake of the devastation caused by the decade old civil conflict in every sector of our society, the education sector, being key. We were convinced that the future for a better Sierra Leone and a decisive turnaround in the state of the economy, lie largely in education taking its rightful place in the development plan.  As the nation’s Central Bank, we have a pivotal role to play in the development aspirations of the country. That is why as a corporate body, we have recognised our responsibility in the discharge of our duties to honour our corporate social responsibility.  We are therefore doing all in our power to compliment the efforts of the Government and other well meaning partners to help foster economic and social development. To this end, our corporate social responsibility is focused on providing a stimulus that will help promote excellence in every aspect of our development, but more so in EDUCATION.  By supporting the education sector, our aim is to achieve the following:  • contribute towards the development of the human resource base required to drive economic activities in the country.  In this regard, our objective is to open doors leading to abounding opportunities for future generations in our own small way.  We hope that by providing for those who have the ability to achieve academic excellence but cannot do so for lack of financial support, we can help restore the academic prowess for which Sierra Leone was known in the continent.  We would therefore assure everyone, not only those in secondary schools, but also institutions and individuals who have the talent and the commitment to demonstrate outstanding performance, that you will get our attention and support, if you are deserving.  Mr Chairman, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is only recently that the Bank of Sierra Leone has taken up the responsibility of helping in the pursuit of excellence especially in education, as a vehicle of development in Sierra Leone. The successes we have scored so far in this area will not have been possible without the support and contribution we have received from the Board of Trustees of this Charity. On behalf of the Board of Directors, Management and Staff of the Bank of Sierra Leone, I will like to thank them for their dedication and hard work.  Within a short period of time the Board of Trustees comprising six members have worked tirelessly and assiduously to actualise the objectives of the Bank, and in the process attract BIS Review 32/2008 1 
the attention and admiration of the public. As a result, the Charity has started receiving contributions from individual members of the International Community.  I therefore want to take the opportunity to single out the laudable gesture of Mr Paul Wilson and Mr Glyn Williams of De La Rue in England who in their personal capacities donated generously towards the Trust. As recent as this morning, the Trust has received contribution from Mrs Sheila Lee, mother of Mr Tom Lee. Their initiative is worthy of commendation. I therefore wish to thank them profusely through Mr Tom Lee who also is a member of the De La Rue family and who has been an effective Ambassador of the Trust, for their humanitarian gesture. This I believe should serve as an inspiration for our local collaborators to follow suit.  Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, at this point I particularly want to recognise the contributions of Dr S B Nicol-Cole who was the first Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and who only took leave of us last year. His contributions during the very critical teething period for the Trust was truly valued and we want to thank him for his services and wish him well in all his future endeavours.  Let me also recognise the pioneering efforts of Dr J D Rogers, erstwhile Governor of the Bank, who recently retired from the services of the Bank of Sierra Leone. I want to assure him that his efforts in this area will not go in vein.  In that same vein, I want also to congratulate Prof. Aiah A Gbakima, the new Chairman of the Board of Trustees, who was elected Chairman by his colleague members of the Board, after acting in the capacity for one year. I have no doubt that with Professor Gbakima’s drive and commitment, the Charity will continue to grow from strength to strength.  I will be remiss in my duty, if I did not recognise also our development partners who have made valuable contributions towards realising the Trust’ Aims and Objectives.  On behalf of the Board, Management and Staff of the Bank of Sierra Leone, I wish to register our profound appreciation for their collaborative efforts and financial support towards the Charity. It is worthy at this point to mention our partners that have been supportive of our efforts as follows:  • De La Rue of the United Kingdom  • Sierra Leone Commercial Bank  • Standard Chartered Bank  • Rokel Commercial Bank  • Union Trust Bank  • Guaranty Trust Bank  • International Commercial Bank  • First International Bank  • Trustee in the name of Mr Tom Lee,  • and finally Pobjoy of the U.K. Our thanks and appreciation go to all of them and we appeal that they continue to support the Charity on a sustainable basis.  Let me however emphasise that there are daunting challenges ahead of us and if we are to progress as a nation we should have the capacity to provide trained and skilled manpower on a sustainable basis. I should therefore like to appeal to our development partners that have not yet come on board, to do so, so that together we can build a better Sierra Leone, one that can compete in the global market.  2 BIS Review 32/2008 
To the awardees, I extend to you hearty congratulations on behalf of the Board of Directors, Management and Staff of the Bank of Sierra Leone. You have been chosen out of many as a result of your outstanding performance. You therefore have a great responsibility to maintain those standards and even surpass them in the cause of your study. You should be the flag bearers of Excellence and a source of inspiration to your colleagues.  In addition to congratulating you the awardees, I want to congratulate the parents and schools that have contributed to the excellent results which qualified our awardees for the awards today. I speak especially about the parents of Ms. Rashidatu Caulker and Mr. Bobson Sesay and the Annie Walsh Memorial Secondary School, and the St. Augustine Secondary School Lungi, the proud producers of our awardees.  To all the students present here this afternoon, , we implore you to have confidence in your abilities, and know that what Rashidatu and Bobson have achieved today you can also achieve. Please note that the Bank of Sierra Leone Charity Trust Fund was established to support any of you who can demonstrate proven ability.  Let this therefore be a challenge to all of you to excel in your studies. Who knows, you might one day be a proud beneficiary!!  Mr Chairman, Distinguished Ladies, Gentlemen and students, let me assure you that the Bank of Sierra Leone has a long term commitment to providing support, especially in building capacity nation-wide through education.  Be assured that we will continue to uphold the objectives and tenets of the Bank of Sierra Leone Charity Trust Fund on a sustainable basis. All we ask for is your continued support.  I thank you for your attention. BIS Review 32/2008 3 
BIS Review 31/2008 1 Jürgen Stark: Structural reforms in Europe Bullet points by Mr Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, for a speech delivered at the OECD-IMF Conference on Structural Reforms in Europe, Paris, 17 March 2008. *   *   * • It is well established that the lack of structural reforms is the main factor behind the relatively disappointing economic performance of some euro area countries over the last few decades. Despite the acceleration in economic growth of the last three years, the gap in GDP per capita between the euro area and the United States remains substantial, reflecting lower levels of both productivity and labour utilisation. Overcoming these constraints to growth is essential in the current environment, where the European economy is facing a number of important challenges, including rapid technological change, accelerating globalisation and ageing populations.  • The EMU is a catalyst for structural reforms in Europe. Within the monetary union, regional monetary and exchange rate policies are no longer viable options. Flexible and integrated labour and product markets are therefore a prerequisite for the smooth functioning of the euro area, including countries’ ability to absorb shocks and fully benefit from EMU. This is why a price-stability orientated monetary environment in principle provides more, not fewer, incentives for national governments to implement structural reforms.  • The performance of the euro area policy framework, however, has been mixed. On the one hand, the first nine years of EMU have been characterised by low and stable inflation and firmly anchored inflation expectations, vindicating the monetary policy framework laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. On the other hand, the overall achievements of economic policies over the last nine years have been rather disappointing. Progress with structural reforms still falls short of expectations, fiscal policies in some countries conflicted with the rules of the fiscal framework, eventually leading to an adjustment of the rules rather than of policies, and also wage policies have often not taken sufficient account of the requirements of the new situation of a single currency. • The institutional framework of the EMU provides European policy-makers with the tools to successfully address the challenges ahead. The Maastricht Treaty established a clear allocation of responsibilities to different policy areas, reflecting the fact that assigning policy instruments primarily to one single policy objective and making individual policy-makers responsible for one single policy instrument ensures a high level of effectiveness and accountability.  • The single monetary policy was given the task of maintaining price stability in the euro area and was assigned to the ECB as an independent, supranational institution. Economic policy deals with the other economic objectives. Responsibility for the various areas of economic policy has largely remained with the Member States, since these policies are best carried out at the national level in order to ensure that they are appropriately tailored to the specific characteristics and needs of the individual countries. • More specifically: o structural policies in the Member States are supposed to seek to create flexible and efficient structures in product and labour markets with a view to fostering the growth potential of euro area economies and improving the adjustment mechanisms in EMU;  o fiscal policies are supposed to ensure the sustainability of public finances, effectively limiting government deficit and debt ratios, thereby also ensuring that automatic fiscal stabilisers work effectively as an adjustment mechanism in the currency union; and 
2 BIS Review 31/2008 o wage policies should be compatible with trend developments in productivity in order to foster full employment and should take into account the overriding importance of wage flexibility as an equilibrating adjustment mechanism in the EMU. • Within the Lisbon strategy, as refocused and reaffirmed by the European Council in 2005, Member States aim to gear national policies towards micro-economic flexibility and macro-economic stability. This would strengthen the capability of the euro area economy to swiftly re-allocate economic resources in view of exogenous economic shocks and improve its long-term growth prospects. The Lisbon Strategy and the peer surveillance of its implementation at the national level have raised the awareness among governments in European countries that structural reforms are decisive for remaining competitive in an increasingly global economic environment and to fully realising the economic potential of the EMU.  • Significant progress in reforming labour market policies – especially in the areas of pension schemes, early retirement and part-time work – has been achieved over the last ten years in some European countries, contributing to the significant rise in the euro area employment rate, accompanied by a decline in the aggregate unemployment rate from 10.6% in 1996 to 7.2% most recently. The latest number is the lowest on record since the early 1980s, but should not give rise to complacency.  • These encouraging developments show that past labour market reforms, immigration and wage moderation have helped to overcome some of the constraints on growth stemming from rigid and over-regulated labour markets. Despite this progress, we are still a long way from having exhausted the potential for further increases in participation rates and employment. The unemployment rate is still unacceptably high and the employment rates, especially among young, female and older workers, remain low by international standards. These features appear to be consistent with an “insider-outsider” characterisation of the European labour market, where structural impediments, triggered by the legal and regulatory environment, high taxes on labour and rigidities associated with wage regulations may prevent those groups “at the margins” from actively participating in the labour market. • In addition, in those European countries and regions where competitiveness has been lost in the past or the unemployment rate remains too high, it is essential that wage increases do not fully exhaust productivity gains in order to provide incentives for firms to create additional jobs. In this respect, flexible wage setting, resulting in particular in sufficient wage differentiation, is crucial in order to strengthen or at least maintain competitiveness and improve employment opportunities, in particular for less-skilled workers.  • Furthermore, many studies point to the potential that competition has to increase employment and to boost productivity trends by improving production efficiency and by enhancing the incentive to invest and innovate1. In the European Union, significant progress has been made in strengthening competition and increasing economic integration over the last two decades. The single market has already brought sizable benefits for the European economy.2 However, much remains to be done, in particular in some market services sectors. The extension and deepening of the internal market remains a priority as regards further financial market integration, the pursuit of effective                                                  1  See the ECB Occasional Paper Series No 44 “Competition, productivity and prices in the euro area services sector”, by the Task Force of the Monetary Policy Committee of the ESCB, April 2006. 2  The European Commission recently estimated that the single market has brought about an increase of 2.75 million extra jobs and an extra increase in welfare of €518 per head in 2006, corresponding to a 2.15% increase of the EU’s GDP over the period 1992-2006 (See European Commission, “The single market: review of achievements”, November 2007). 
BIS Review 31/2008 3 competition in the energy market, and the implementation of the Services Directive. The growing role of services3 in modern economies suggests that improvements in European living standards are likely to depend on a high degree of competition and on productivity improvements in the services sector.  • Let me now focus more specifically on financial integration, which is of key importance for the ECB. The process of European financial integration is gradually taking place and considerable progress has already been made. The degree of integration, however, varies across market segments, and integration is generally more advanced in those market segments which are closer to the single monetary policy. While the euro area banking markets for wholesale and capital market-related activities show clear signs of increasing integration since the introduction of the euro, the retail banking segment has remained more fragmented, leaving European consumers unable to take full advantage of the benefits of the EMU and the Single Market.4 • While there has been progress in the implementation of structural reforms in Europe, the catalyst role of EMU in improving Europe’s growth potential has not yet been fully exhausted. The lacklustre performance in many euro area countries is rooted not in deficiencies in the current institutional framework, but rather in some national governments’ lack of willingness to implement structural reforms. The reasons why politically motivated governments tend not to implement sufficient structural reforms are by now well known. Structural reforms typically have positive, long-term effects, which can be difficult to ascertain in advance, but often negative short-term effects that are relatively more visible to voters.  • It has sometimes been argued that some macroeconomic stimulus from aggregate demand policies might help foster the implementation of structural reform packages by offsetting potential short-term costs of reforms. This idea that there could be a trade-off between structural reforms and macroeconomic accommodation is disputable, notably in the EMU. Such accommodation could be provided either by monetary policy or fiscal policy, which I will now discuss in turn. • In the EMU monetary policy is not the appropriate tool for mitigating the potential short-term costs of structural reforms or for providing incentives for reforms at the national levels. First, reform needs differ across euro area countries and the single monetary policy is by its very nature unable to mitigate the potentially different short-term country-specific costs of reforms. Second, there are well-known and overwhelming implementation problems of ex ante coordination between policy makers with different objectives. This typically gives rise to incentive distortions for the policy actors involved. An immediate consequence of any attempt to seek closer coordination with the ECB would be a blurring of responsibilities, which would lead to every institution being made responsible for everything, which in the end would mean that, amid confusion, no institution was responsible for anything, and no successful reform implemented. • Price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to structural reforms in Europe. By improving the quality of relative price signals, our price stability-orientated monetary policy makes it easier for policy makers and European citizens to identify the areas in which structural reforms are most needed. Beyond safeguarding price stability,                                                  3  Today, the services sector accounts for 70% of GDP, 68% of employment and 96% of the new jobs created, but only 20% of intra-EU trade. This discrepancy reflects not only the fact that services often have an intrinsically local character, but also the many barriers and obstacles still hindering the free movement of services within the European Union. 4  See P. Hartmann, F. Heider, E. Papaioannou and M. Lo Duca (2007), “The role of financial markets and innovation in productivity and growth in Europe”, ECB Occasional Paper Series, September, as well as ECB (2007) “Financial integration in Europe”, Frankfurt a.M: ECB. 
4 BIS Review 31/2008 there is nothing monetary policy can do to foster the growth and employment potential of our economies. The only modest contribution a central bank can make to structural reforms is to assess their impact, and communicate in a balanced manner and through different channels and fora its views on the expected effects of reforms to the public, thereby helping to build a constituency supporting reform packages. • As to fiscal policy, let me first stress that I have doubts on the possibility to make a deficit limit contingent on the implementation of structural reforms by national governments. The inherent difficulty of assessing the short-term costs of structural reforms in real time creates significant moral hazard problems, with governments having an incentive to overestimate the costs of reforms they are implementing to mask additional spending or shortfalls in consolidation efforts unrelated to reforms. Having said that, it is clear that the recent reform of the Stability and Growth Pact allows fiscal policy to mitigate the possible short-term cost of structural reforms, if these are clearly specified and can be quantified. It is, however, crucial that fiscal authorities create the necessary room for manoeuvre regarding their possible support for the implementation of reforms beforehand. Otherwise, there is a risk of significant policy mistakes, with reforms eventually leading to persistent increases in deficit and debt ratios.

BIS Review 31/2008 1 Rundheersing Bheenick: How does a small open economy faced with unprecedented capital flows conduct monetary policy? Talk delivered by Mr Rundheersing Bheenick, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai, 14 March 2008. *      *      * It is a great honour and privilege for me to be invited by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India to address this distinguished audience at the seat of this august institution this morning. Allow me to place on record my deep appreciation for the invitation extended to me by Governor Reddy. I had the immense pleasure of welcoming him to Mauritius in December last when he delivered a Memorial Lecture as part of the 40th Anniversary Celebrations of the Bank of Mauritius. India and Mauritius have enjoyed a very special relationship spanning over several centuries and cutting across vast swathes of human endeavour in the economic, social, cultural, linguistic and political fields. I cannot think of anything that symbolises this more eloquently than the plain simple fact that our currency - like its more famous cousin issued by your institution - also goes under the name of “Rupee”. But then a central banker would say that, wouldn’t he? The theme of my talk today is: “How Does A Small Open Economy Faced With Unprecedented Capital Flows Conduct Monetary Policy?” I believe this subject, or at least some aspects of it, will be of interest to both the Bank of Mauritius and the Reserve Bank of India in the context of current economic developments in our two countries against the backdrop of the international economic environment confronting all of us.. The structure of my talk today will be as follows: In the first part, I begin with a thumb-nail sketch of the Mauritian economy to provide some context. In the second part of my presentation, I focus on some of the important financial and economic reforms that Mauritius is now embarked upon. The third part addresses some of the challenges emerging from globalization for a small country. Finally, I touch upon the monetary policy challenges stemming from unprecedented capital flows for a small open economy. This is a subject which is exercising my mind considerably, causing sleepless nights and swallowing in large gulps the reserves at my disposal as Governor of the Bank of Mauritius. You will discover that I have more questions than answers. Part I: General background on the Mauritian economy As most of you are no doubt aware, Mauritius is a small island economy in the South–West Indian Ocean. It has been independent since 12 March 1968 and became a Republic in 1992. A couple of days ago, we celebrated our 40th Anniversary as an independent nation. In spite of several handicaps like limited natural resources, remoteness from major markets, a small domestic market and vulnerability to cyclones and man-made external shocks alike, Mauritius has achieved one of the highest per capita GDP in Africa. In 1968, Mauritius was, by all measures, a poor country with per capita income of less than US$200. Prospects were so gloomy that Nobel-prize-winning economist James Meade, who headed an Economic Commission sent by the British colonial administration in the aftermath of one of the most devastating cyclones in the country’s recorded history, recommended emigration as a key part of the solution to the island’s problems. One of the first World Bank missions to visit the country, led by Jean Baneth, opined “… this country exudes an air of hopelessness.” Another Nobel prize-winner, V.S Naipaul, titled an analytical piece on Mauritius “The Overcrowded Barracoon.” And a French writer followed suit with a book entitled “Maurice – Quelle Independence?” 
2 BIS Review 31/2008 It will take me too long to take you down the road we have travelled over the last four decades. I have been part of the journey, occasionally as an observer, but mostly as a doer, a mover or “agent provocateur.” Suffice it to say that the prophets of doom and gloom have been proved utterly wrong, that the Malthusian nightmare has been exorcised, that Mauritius is now the poster boy of the IMF and the World Bank when it comes to successful economic development in Africa. By 2007, for a population of nearly 1.3 million, per capita GDP has increased to nearly US$6,000. Real GDP has grown, on average, by about 5 per cent per annum over the last two decades. For 2008, real GDP growth is estimated at 6 per cent, up from 5.6 per cent in 2007. This has been one of the most remarkable policy-driven economic transformations in modern history. The Bank of Mauritius has played a key role in this economic transformation. The modalities of conducting monetary policy in Mauritius have evolved from strong reliance on controls and directives to more market-based mechanisms. The 1970’s were turbulent years for the conduct of monetary policy: external price shocks, together with expansionary domestic policies, led to an acceleration of inflation to an all-time record of 42% in 1979. I played a key role in devising, marketing and implementing appropriate adjustment policies as part of IMF- and World-Bank-supported stabilization and structural adjustment programmes. Macroeconomic stability was regained in the early 1980’s and maintained successfully thereafter. The monetary authorities pursued sound monetary and exchange rate policies, which contributed to foster an environment favourable to sustained growth. The Bank has, since its establishment in 1967, given prominence to the objectives of diversifying the economy and fostering growth and employment through supportive actions. Freshly liberated from the tight corset of the Currency Board system - and here, let me add for those of you who do not know it, the Currency Board of Mauritius is the very first one of its kind on record, just as Mauritius is also the first known customer for the noted banknote printing company Thomas De La Rue - it was natural for the Bank of Mauritius to strike out in new directions. An expansionary policy was followed by keeping interest rates low and providing concessional credit to what were called “priority sectors”. Concessional credit was provided to industrial enterprises, which were being supported to promote growth, diversification and employment. Export Processing Zone companies and manufacturing companies were the targeted beneficiaries, along with the sugar sector which then constituted the backbone of the economy. As part of our colonial heritage, the Mauritian rupee was pegged to the Pound Sterling until 1976, when we gave up the link in the face of continued depreciation of the British currency. We then achieved a world first by pegging our rupee to the IMF’s Special Drawing Right, which turned out to be an unmitigated disaster. In 1983, after a period of political and economic turmoil, accompanied - if not caused - by currency devaluation, we moved from a fixed to a managed exchange rate regime. Over the next few years, exchange rate policy was aimed at protecting competitiveness, and the real effective exchange rate steadily depreciated until 1987. As the net international reserves situation improved and became more comfortable, policy aimed more at achieving a stable real effective exchange rate. Exchange controls which were the bread and butter of the Bank of Mauritius at its creation were gradually liberalized. In September 1993, Mauritius accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF and all current account transactions were liberalized. Within a year we fully liberalized the capital account. An interbank foreign exchange market was established with a greater role assigned to market forces in the determination of the exchange value of the Mauritian rupee. The long and the short of it is that Mauritius, which at independence was a monocrop economy depending entirely on sugar, has over the intervening years diversified successfully by adding such new pillars of economic activity as export manufacturing (mainly textiles), tourism and financial services. Information and Communication Technology and the seafood hub are two emerging sectors of the economy with very promising prospects for the future.  
BIS Review 31/2008 3 Part II: Financial and economic reforms Today, Mauritius can boast of having a sound and dynamic financial system. The banking industry is highly profitable, underpinned as it is by a sound regulatory framework and a supportive monetary policy geared to macroeconomic stability. The entry of new banks, and the expansion of the local and regional branch network of existing banks, has combined to instil a new dynamism in the industry. We are in the final stages of rolling out Islamic banking and financial services which, we believe, represent a new window of global business opportunity for Mauritius. Since April 2007, a new era of monetary policy-making has also dawned at the Central Bank with the establishment of an independent Monetary Policy Committee, which comprises members from outside the country. Let me add some comments on how, in the wake of the continued development and increasing sophistication of the banking industry, the Bank of Mauritius has relentlessly pursued its efforts to strengthen its supervisory arm. The regulatory framework was reinforced with the promulgation of the Banking Act 2004 and the Bank of Mauritius Act 2004. From a regulatory perspective, the change in the licensing regime stemming from the Banking Act 2004 has also contributed to the new dynamism which characterises the banking sector. This legislation provided for the integration of domestic and offshore banking business and eliminated the previous distinction between Category 1 “domestic” and Category 2 “offshore” banks. Offshore banks had been generally perceived as being less regulated and more prone to money-laundering and other illegal activities. The new legislation served to dissipate such misapprehensions regarding the regulation of offshore banks and has enhanced the image of our financial sector. Under the single banking licence approach, banks are free to undertake the whole range of banking business. According to the “Guideline on Segmental Reporting under a Single Banking Licence Regime,” issued by the Central Bank and which became effective in July 2005, banking business in the country is divided into two categories, Segment A and Segment B. Segment B activities encompass banking business conducted essentially with non-residents and Global-Business-Licence-holders. Segment B is thus essentially directed to the provision of international financial services generating “foreign source income,” which is taxed under a special preferential regime. All other banking business is classified under Segment A. This favourable tax treatment of foreign source income has acted as a catalyst in the expansion of the regional and international banking business of banks. The unification of the banking licence has subjected banks to increased competition in both Segments of their activity. The challenge for banks which are now operating under the same single regime, is to be innovative in order to be able to tap specific and niche markets, both locally and overseas.  To give you a better picture of the monetary challenges confronting a small open economy like Mauritius, I believe it would be useful if I dwell a little on the new framework for the conduct of monetary policy that was introduced by the Bank in December 2006, that is just a few weeks before I joined. Under this new framework, the Bank established a “corridor” that would effectively provide a ceiling and a floor for overnight interbank interest rates. Effective 18 December 2006, when this framework was introduced, the Repo Rate was set at 8.50 per cent. In order to manage the overnight interbank interest rate in an effective manner, the Bank stated that it would supply, or absorb, liquidity against collateral at its discretion and in whatever volume was required to hold the overnight interbank interest rates close to the Repo Rate. The Bank initially established a “corridor” that was symmetrical around the Repo Rate. Thus, the Bank was expected to lend money to banks at the ceiling of the “corridor” which was set at 50 basis points above the Repo Rate. In a similar manner, the Bank was expected to absorb excess funds at the floor of the “corridor” which was set at 50 basis points below the Repo Rate. The ceiling and the floor of the “corridor” were expected to move in the same direction, and with the same magnitude, as the changes in the Repo Rate. Currently, the Repo Rate stands at 9.00 per cent.  
4 BIS Review 31/2008 The experience so far with the new monetary policy framework has been a mixed one. While banks’ deposit and lending interest rates have generally moved in tandem with changes in the key Repo Rate, market interest rates at the short-end of the yield curve have tended to move away from the key Repo Rate. This has been particularly evident since last November. This phenomenon has been caused by the excess liquidity on the interbank money market and partly by the sizeable reduction in the primary issues of bills mainly by the Government relative to maturing bills. The Central Bank’s absence in the reverse repurchase market reflected our concern not to mop up any “hot money” or money just transiting through Segment B activities – which I detailed earlier. We attempted to address systemic excess liquidity by introducing a Special Deposit Facility whereby banks were invited to place special deposits with the Central bank for a period of 14 days at a rate of 125 basis points below the key Repo Rate.  The “disconnect” between the key Repo Rate and short-term market interest rates is a source of concern to us. The Bank is contemplating a widening of the corridor as the ± 50 basis points might be too narrow for a small open economy like ours which is vulnerable to shocks and subject to volatility in international capital markets. We are also currently debating internally whether the corridor should be “symmetric” or “asymmetric.” Moreover, there are issues relating to “discretionary” as opposed to “automatic” conduct of repurchase operations by the Bank which need to be addressed. These technical issues have been taken up with the recent IMF Article IV Mission that visited Mauritius during the last two weeks. Obviously, we are looking for a solution that fits more comfortably with the Mauritian situation, characterized as it is by a highly-concentrated banking structure.  Let me also make a point about our legal mandate. In terms of the Bank of Mauritius Act 2004, the primary object of the Bank is to maintain price stability and to promote orderly and balanced economic development. In this respect, real sector issues are duly weighed up in our monetary policy decision-making process. As part of our other objectives, we must also ensure the stability and soundness of the financial system in Mauritius. The process of fiscal adjustment in Mauritius has been set in a medium-term framework. Corrective measures to address fiscal imbalances and restore fiscal discipline have been initiated. The budget deficit, as a percentage of GDP at market prices, declined from 5.3 per cent in Financial Year 2005-06 to an estimated 4.3 per cent in FY 2006-07. For the current financial year, it is estimated at 3.8 per cent. I should perhaps also mention here that there is a separation of debt management from monetary management. Government Securities are issued only for purposes of financing the Government’s borrowing requirement whereas Bank of Mauritius Bills are issued for purposes of monetary management. The policy of issuing central bank bills to mop up any excess liquidity thrown up by incoming foreign exchange flows has a direct relevance to the main theme of this talk. Faced as it is today with the triple shocks stemming from the erosion of trade preferences in the sugar and textile sectors and the surge in oil prices on the international market, Mauritius has no choice but to embark on bold structural reforms. This is precisely what we are doing. Efforts at fiscal consolidation with a view to maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability, the achievement of a stable macroeconomic environment and the maintenance of social consensus are some of the key ingredients for ensuring the success of these economic reforms. The achievement of higher job-creating growth remains a central policy challenge for Mauritius now and in the years ahead. To make any significant dent in the unemployment rate, standing at around 8.8 per cent, Mauritius needs to move to a higher growth path of at least 7 to 8 per cent per annum. In developing new growth poles, we must take care to consolidate the existing pillars of the economy, a consideration not without implications for the conduct of monetary policy.  The erosion of trade preferences for its main exports, coupled with the challenges stemming from globalization, make it imperative for Mauritius to raise productivity and become globally competitive. As the country shifts progressively toward a service-dominated and knowledge-
BIS Review 31/2008 5 based economy, labour-market flexibility has become vital. The central wage-setting framework that characterized the labour market since before independence allowed for little wage moderation, did not favour wage differentiation across sectors and enterprises, and focused more on job preservation than on job creation. The recent establishment of the National Pay Council, which aims at broadening practices in wage agreements to reflect better sector- and firm-specific conditions, represents a breakthrough in labour market reform. It will enable us to link wage growth to productivity gains. This, together with the implementation of the proposed changes in labour regulations, will give the much needed flexibility in the labour market.  As regards the external accounts, the deficit on the current account represented 8.1 per cent in FY 2006-07, compared to 5.2 per cent of GDP in FY 2005-06. This deterioration reflected mostly the worsening merchandise account deficit which was itself due largely to the purchase of two aircraft. This was however offset to some extent by the combined surpluses on the services, income and current transfers accounts. If we exclude the purchase of aircraft, the current account deficit for FY 2006-07 represented 5.0 per cent of GDP, or a slight improvement on the preceding year. For the current fiscal year, the current account deficit, including the purchase of aircraft, is estimated at 4.8 per cent.  Policy must now reckon with some evolving fundamentals emanating from the external sector, particularly in the capital and financial account of the balance of payments. The fundamentals of the balance of payments are no longer determined by the trade balance alone. The overall balance of payments posted a surplus of Rs 6.6 billion in FY 2006-07 and a surplus of Rs 13.5 billion in calendar year 2007, as against a deficit of Rs 4.6 billion in calendar year 2006. Gross total tourist earnings amounted to Rs 40.7 billion in calendar year 2007, up from Rs 31.9 billion in 2006. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is estimated to have reached an unprecedented peak of Rs 11 billion in 2007, up from Rs 7.2 billion in 2006.  FDI is growing rapidly in response to reform efforts, and there are good prospects for attracting still more significant FDI flows to Mauritius in the medium term on account of the numerous mega projects in both the public and private sectors. These relate mainly to the tourism Integrated Resort Scheme projects, a Chinese integrated industrial project, and some real estate development projects. Coping with these unprecedented capital inflows remains a major challenge for the conduct of monetary policy for the Bank of Mauritius. Today, the Bank of Mauritius finds itself confronted with the important challenge of reducing the rate of inflation, which stood at 9.0 percent at the end of February 2008, and preserving the competitiveness of the export-oriented sectors, given the tendency for the capital inflows to generate pressures for exchange rate appreciation of the rupee. There is a tendency in some quarters to think of exchange rate adjustment as an easy solution to the type of problems that we are currently facing. Unfortunately, currency appreciation or depreciation cannot be a panacea for our economic ills. We should not forget that both appreciation or depreciation of a currency are at best a mixed blessing. While appreciation may help us to contain inflation, it may also lead to a loss of international competitiveness. Similarly, a depreciation of the currency, while being beneficial to the export-oriented sectors, would also have potential inflationary consequences for the rest of the population and for the wider economy. In terms of macroeconomic policies, there is a policy trade-off between the extent of exchange rate adjustment and the inflation rate. The way forward for a small open economy like Mauritius is for it to aim to become more competitive through the achievement of real productivity gains. Long-term competitiveness depends not on exchange rate changes but on productivity growth. Short-term exchange rate accommodation can only serve to postpone the need to address the real issues relating to productivity improvement and good management.  Mauritius has a managed floating exchange rate regime with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate. As a matter of policy, the Bank has allowed the free play of market forces to determine the exchange rate. Intervention by the Bank of Mauritius in the domestic interbank 
6 BIS Review 31/2008 foreign exchange market aims at smoothing out volatility in the rupee exchange rate and improving the functioning of the market. It is not aimed at offsetting market forces or at targeting any specific exchange rate as the Bank does not have any exchange rate target. The policy approach used by the Bank of Mauritius in the face of incoming capital inflows has also been validated by the recent Article IV Mission of the IMF. The conduct of monetary policy has to be freed from sectoral considerations. It is not the role of the Central Bank to support a particular sector at the expense of other sectors. Policy should aim at promoting the general interest of the country and that is what we have been trying to do. Part III: Challenges emerging from globalization After these remarks relating to the specific context of Mauritius, what can we say about the implications of globalization for the conduct of monetary policy in this kind of situation?  But, more generally, some of us are beginning to wonder whether globalization should lead to a reassessment of central banks’ primary objective of price stability. Especially now, in the light of the recent actions by the US Federal Reserve which seems to be more concerned about staving off recession and kick-starting the economy. Should we revisit the entire framework of economic and monetary analyses in central banks? How do we react to a range of variables that have now assumed greater importance in global markets? Has globalization altered the way monetary policy influences inflation and output? In other words, has it affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy? Not that we knew much about this in the first place, as some people would have you believe! Should monetary policy react directly to exchange rate movements or should it only focus on inflation and real GDP? It is often asserted that the more we integrate global markets, the more we have to sit back and let markets work. Can central bankers in small open economies faced with unprecedented capital flows afford to do just that? How interventionist should a central bank be under such circumstances? How resilient are our monetary policy frameworks? Do we need more sophisticated economic and monetary models to address the monetary policy challenges stemming from globalization? With globalization, small open economies receiving unprecedented capital flows face the daunting task of managing these external flows in order to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability. Monetary management has to contend with the vicissitudes of capital flows and the increased volatility in exchange rates. While the distinction between short-term and long-term capital flows may be conceptually clear, from an operational viewpoint, there are severe problems in distinguishing between the two. At any given time, some of the inflows could be of an enduring nature whereas others could be temporary and, hence, reversible. In the face of such uncertainty in determining the temporary or permanent nature of inflows, is it justified to blame your central banker if, out of prudence, he assumes that the flows are temporary until their permanent nature can be established? There are some underlying similarities in the challenges faced by India and Mauritius in the face of capital inflows. There is also, however, a very significant difference in that. India does not have full convertibility of the capital and financial account of the balance of payments. This difference translates into some additional leeway for the Reserve Bank of India in managing capital flows. Mauritius with its open capital and financial account, since the abolition of all capital controls in July 1994, does not have some of the tools which RBI has at its disposal. Introducing capital controls under any guise is certainly not an option for us.   
BIS Review 31/2008 7 Part IV: Challenges for monetary policy What, then, are the challenges faced by a small open economy in the conduct of monetary policy when confronted by unprecedented capital flows? As I said in my opening remarks, this is a question which has been troubling me ever since I took the helm of the Bank of Mauritius one year ago. As most of you are no doubt aware, in economics, simultaneously targeting an exchange rate and maintaining an independent monetary policy, with an open capital account, is considered an impossible trinity. This famous trilemma follows from the Mundell-Fleming model, which states that countries cannot simultaneously fix their exchange rate, have an open capital account, and pursue an independent monetary policy. Only two of these three objectives are mutually consistent. Even with a fully floating exchange rate, it has become more difficult for a small open economy facing unprecedented capital flows to run an independent monetary policy. And, boy, don’t I know it!  Governor Reddy, in his recent address last week, in Paris at the International Symposium of the Banque de France on “Globalization, Inflation and Monetary Policy”, underlined the simultaneous challenges, from several angles, to the conduct of monetary policy arising from recent financial market turbulence, the growing importance of global factors relating to abrupt and large policy shifts in monetary policy measures of the major economies, and the unprecedented inflationary pressures due to food and energy prices. I fully endorse Governor’s Reddy’s view that these developments certainly warrant significant and innovative ways of cooperation among central bankers.  Interventions by the Central Bank to purchase large amounts of foreign exchange from the market have an expansionary impact on the domestic money supply and pose challenges for the conduct of monetary policy. Just to illustrate the point I am trying to make, only yesterday we at the Bank of Mauritius had to intervene to purchase Rs 1.8 billion of foreign currency in dollars and Euros from the domestic forex market to prevent this market from seizing up altogether as major players reached their foreign currency exposure limits. This was a new record, improving on the previous record for a single transaction of Rs 1.6 billion which we conducted just before Christmas 2007 when we purchased Euros 40.5 million from the market. I suspect the present record will not stand for long either. To appreciate the relative enormity of these transactions, remember that the Bank’s capital base is currently Rs 1 billion and our general reserves stand at Rs 23.5 billion. To sterilize the excess liquidity stemming from these capital inflows, the Central Bank has to issue Government or Central Bank securities. In the case of Mauritius, where we now have a separation of debt management from monetary management, this entails the issue of a huge amount of Bank of Mauritius Bills for monetary policy purposes, with a potentially adverse impact on the Central Bank’s balance sheet and its profit and loss account. It is instructive to recall here that in the recent past, more precisely in FY 2003-04, the Bank of Mauritius incurred a loss accruing largely from its monetary operations at a time when its returns on its foreign exchange reserves were also at a very low point, with rates on the US dollar hovering around 1 per cent.  With the current apprehension of an imminent recession in the United States and the aggressive easing of interest rates by the US Federal Reserve, conducting such levels of monetary operations to sterilise the projected volume of capital inflows would, in all likelihood, move the Central Bank into negative territory. Such an outcome becomes a near certainty given the significant interest rate differential that exists between the yields on Central Bank securities, currently around 8.0 per cent, and placements in US dollars which stand at around 3.0 per cent. Globalization has indeed complicated the task of monetary management .With globalized capital markets, a small open economy, faced with such unprecedented capital flows, must grapple with a potentially very serious challenge of keeping inflation under control, if it is to prevent exchange rate appreciation from undermining external competitiveness. There are 
8 BIS Review 31/2008 clearly costs for the Central Bank in running monetary policy that have to be explicitly recognized. I believe that the instruments and operating procedures of monetary policy have also to be constantly refined to meet the challenges that arise from unprecedented capital inflows.  Moreover, central banks are required to strengthen their balance sheets in order to manage the shocks impacting on the economy. A central bank’s capital and reserves have to be strong enough to be able to sustain repeated intervention in the money market. Given the uncertainty surrounding the nature of capital inflows, it would also be prudent for the central bank in small open economies to build up reserves as a cushion against a possible change in investor sentiment, leading to a sudden stop syndrome and the even mare dreaded reversal of capital flows. In these circumstances, should the Governor sound the alarm bell and seek help from the Minister of Finance? To offset the strong impulse on aggregate demand from the large capital flows, isn’t a hefty dose of fiscal consolidation just what the doctor ordered? Or will the Governor be accused of being a spoilsport in such good and buoyant times?  To sum up then, I would say that central bankers are indeed living in very interesting times. It is taken for granted that they are a smart bunch. But being smart is no longer enough. We must also be lucky. I have tried to demonstrate that, at the present juncture, the conduct of monetary policy is nothing short of a gargantuan task for the lilliputian economy that Mauritius is.  To meet some of the emerging and unprecedented challenges of the financial sector, the Bank of Mauritius, which as I said earlier celebrated its 40th anniversary last year, is pursuing with renewed vigour and determination the exciting journey of modernization. We have enlisted the support of the Reserve Bank of India in the area of bank supervision, thus renewing with a tradition going back to the early years of our existence when RBI officers helped to establish the Bank of Mauritius. We are now engaged in a major restructuring of our internal organisation with the help of resource persons from Bank Negara Malaysia. The structure is now flatter, with the creation of Divisions within the Bank that are responsible for particular focused areas of activity. The Bank has adopted an open and transparent staffing strategy, with the promotion of fifty-five existing staff and recruitment of twenty-three additional staff from outside the Bank. To appreciate how fundamental is this transformation, just remember that our total staff strength adds up to only 250 persons. We are enhancing our skills and knowledge base to add value to the organisation and contribute directly towards the attainment of our organisational goals. 
BIS Review 31/2008 1 Jean-Pierre Roth: Swiss outlook and global developments Summary of a speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Icon Roadshow Euro 2008, Frankfurt am Main, 17 March 2008. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * The Swiss economy looks back on a number of successful years during which it was a very active participant in the growth of the world economy. The export sector rapidly expanded its presence in the new markets, thereby making an important contribution to this development.  What was remarkable was that the increased foreign activities were not detrimental to Switzerland as a production location. On the contrary, the Swiss location benefited overall. Reforms aimed at strengthening and opening up Switzerland as a business location have also made a substantial contribution to economic prosperity in recent years.  The turbulence on the financial markets that erupted in mid-2007 is unlikely to leave the Swiss economy unscathed. The export sector, including the banks, will be affected by the slowdown in the international economy. An additional factor is the substantial rise in the value of the Swiss franc over the past few months against the euro and the US dollar. However, we are already in a position to learn quite a bit from the financial market turmoil. First, because financial markets are so highly integrated, central banks need to cooperate closely in order to master the problems. Second, incentive schemes in banks that have given particular priority to rewards for risky behaviour should be changed, and the instruments for measuring risks need to be reassessed. The way in which the Swiss National Bank steers the Swiss franc money market, however, has proved its worth, with the three-month Libor being successfully held inside the target range. In this way, the real economy has been protected from the upheaval on the interbank market. 
Mark Carney: Addressing financial market turbulence Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Toronto Board of Trade, Toronto, 13 March 2008. *      *      * Since last summer, many of us here today have been preoccupied with the ongoing dislocations in financial markets. What began in securities linked to U.S. subprime mortgages has spread to a broad range of structured assets, conventional credit markets, and, to a lesser extent, equities. As a consequence, some of the world's largest financial institutions have recorded substantial losses, the cost of borrowing has increased, and the availability of credit has decreased. More than seven months on, the end is not yet in sight, although it is safe to say that we have reached the end of the beginning of this turmoil. This is not because the dislocations in markets have eased; in fact, strains in financial markets have intensified recently, but rather because we are entering a new phase where policy-makers and market participants have a better understanding of both the shortcomings in the current financial system and what needs to be done – by both groups – to address them.  This response is important for all economies. Even though most of the practices that contributed to the crisis took place beyond our borders, and our financial institutions are in comparatively robust health, Canada is not isolated from global events. Some of our institutions have suffered losses, and our economy is beginning to feel the effects of the deterioration in global financial conditions. Moreover, going forward, national markets will be judged by new standards of liquidity, transparency, and the greater integrity that comes from properly aligned incentives. Our institutions will have to compete in that environment. In my remarks today, I would like to discuss briefly three of the factors behind the market turbulence and then outline corresponding priorities for the official sector and market participants. This list is far from exhaustive, but I chose these three because they are among the most important, and because efforts are now under way – in both the public and private sectors – to address them. Causes of the turbulence Recent events represent an overdue repricing of risk; the direction of which was predicted by many and desired by some.1 However, the speed and virulence of the repricing has illustrated the adage "Be careful what you wish for." While the repricing was triggered by significantly higher-than-expected defaults in U.S. subprime mortgages, we should all recognize that the trigger could have come from a wide range of sources. The social and economic costs of the events in the subprime market are concentrated in the United States, while the financial costs are both widely dispersed and – relative to the scale of the system – readily absorbable. In short, as painful as they are to those affected, subprime losses have been important primarily because they have revealed deeper flaws in the financial system. While a number of underlying causes can be identified, I will concentrate on three in particular. The first relates to liquidity. In recent years, market participants were overly confident that liquid markets would continually provide an outlet for new products and represent an ongoing source of funding liquidity for financial institutions. Ample market liquidity had its origins in benign macroeconomic conditions, low and relatively stable long-term interest rates, financial                                                  1  Indeed, central banks had been discussing the possibility of a repricing of risk for some time. See "Developments and Trends," Financial System Review (Ottawa: Bank of Canada, June 2004): 4-5. BIS Review 30/2008 1 
innovation, and the broadening list of financial market participants. Ultimately sowing the seeds of its own demise, market liquidity fed a supreme confidence in the ability to sell holdings at prices that matched mark-to-model valuations.  This overconfidence encouraged the rapid growth of the "originate-to-distribute" credit model. In this model, the borrower often became separated from the end investor by several transactions, as credit risk was repackaged, tiered, securitized, and distributed. Many originators and distributors felt confident that long-term credit risk had been transformed into short-term "warehouse" risk prior to distribution and that distribution itself was irrevocable. Others knew that they had not fully eliminated these risks, but felt they could get out in time. Such confidence was misplaced. Risk had not disappeared, it had merely been redistributed, and that distribution was often not final. The current market disruptions represent, in part, the painful process of finding out where that risk ultimately lies.  Liquidity was also the Achilles heel of many asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) programs and structured investment vehicles. In many such vehicles, medium-term, illiquid, hard-to-value assets were funded by short-term money market securities at yields only marginally higher than those offered by the most liquid, transparent, risk-free securities. As confidence that this paper could be rolled over faltered, there was indiscriminate selling of structured assets. In markets where backstop liquidity was judged not to be automatic, such as the ABCP currently involved in the Montreal Accord, noteholders could no longer redeem their paper.2 In markets where backstop liquidity was robust, investors could exit and, as a result, ABCP came back on the balance sheets of financial institutions, which in turn raised concerns about the scale of their exposure. From a medium-term perspective, the disappearance of segments of ABCP markets around the world will have important implications for the viability of many securitized products, since ABCP represented an important funding source for the most senior tranches of securitized credit structures. The second cause of current market disruptions has been the lack of transparency and inadequate disclosure that characterizes many highly structured financial products. These shortcomings were ignored when times were good to the extent that many investors did not actually understand the characteristics of the securities that they owned. Market participants were often less surprised by the deterioration in subprime market fundamentals than by the marked-to-market losses of subprime collateralized debt obligation (CDO) securities, given the defaults in the underlying mortgages. This surprise, in turn, has prompted a broad re-evaluation of structured products and, in some cases, indiscriminate selling. Even months later, the opacity of these structured products has made them harder to value, thus dramatically reducing secondary market liquidity. Poor disclosure of many securitized products continues to make it difficult for new investors to enter the market confidently and purchase securities despite distressed prices and the presence of still-substantial global liquidity. Indeed, as I will discuss in a moment, the high cost of default protection in many markets – such as that for corporate bonds – implies a pessimism about actual default probabilities that appears excessive.3  At the same time, widespread uncertainty about the distribution of losses has fed concerns over counterparty risk. With the assumption that risk had been irrevocably transferred found wanting, market participants became uncertain about the true financial situations of their counterparties, and have sometimes been reluctant to lend, even at very short horizons. The                                                  2  The Bank of Canada raised this concern in P. Toovey and J. Kiff, "Developments and Issues in the Canadian Market for Asset-Backed Commercial Paper," Financial System Review (Ottawa: Bank of Canada, June 2003): 43-49. 3  For example, in recent weeks, the default rates implied by the levels of the ITRAAX crossover index have reached almost twice the cumulative default rate experienced by comparably rated companies during the last two recessions. 2 BIS Review 30/2008 
resulting "reckless prudence" has, on occasion, created very unusual conditions in interbank markets and intensified the already sharp reduction in market liquidity. Inadequate transparency was also a factor behind the breakdown of trust in credit-rating agencies, which has amplified the stresses in financial markets. This breakdown occurred for several reasons. First, the default and ratings transition probabilities of structured products have not always been consistent with those of corporate and sovereign ratings. Moreover, recent events have brought into focus some potential conflicts of interest in the ratings business.4 The fall from grace of the rating agencies has had a significant impact because rating agencies had grown more powerful than anyone intended. Indeed, many investors seem to have performed little or no in-house credit analysis of their investments; in other words, they substituted a subscription to a ratings publication for analysis and due diligence. The third and final cause that I will mention was a series of misaligned incentives. It has been belatedly recognized that the severing of the long-term relationship between the originator and the borrower has contributed to the decline in credit quality. Historically, the original lenders (or originators of a credit) would be meticulous with their documentation and careful with their due diligence, because they knew that they would likely retain the exposure to risk of default until the loan matured. However, as originators became increasingly confident that they could sell off the loan, documentation and credit standards declined to the now-infamous extreme of "Low doc/NINJA" (no income, job or assets) loans to U.S. subprime borrowers. Performance has deteriorated accordingly: for example, default rates for U.S. subprime mortgage loans made in 2006 have already reached almost 8 per cent less than two years after origination, a rate 2.5 times the comparable figure for similar loans made in 2004.5  There also appear to have been a number of problems with incentive alignment in several global financial institutions. These include mismatches between the timing of trader compensation and the realization of profits from their trades, an insufficient recognition and compensation of risk-management professionals, and provision of funding at risk-free rates to trading desks that placed risky bets. All of these factors encouraged excessive risk taking.  Finally, it appears possible that the incentives provided by a series of regulations may have encouraged crowded trades. The so-called "cliff risk" created by the mandated use of ratings is one example. A paradox of the current turbulence is that a desire to shelter in the perceived safety of AAA-rated assets led to a dangerous explosion in the supply of synthetically created AAA-rated assets. Since many of these assets were financed by excessive leverage and many participants were constrained by mandates to sell on downgrades, the rush to the exits has proven extremely destabilizing. Next steps for policy-makers Before addressing specific responses in detail, I would like to make a couple of general points. The first is that, while the need to restore well-functioning markets is of paramount importance, the official sector can afford to take some time to ensure that the actions they take are appropriate. This is because many of the market practices that contributed to the dislocations have stopped. At present, many financial institutions are, at best, assuming limited access to market-based liquidity and, in the extreme, hoarding liquidity. It is an understatement to say that credit exposure is once again receiving active scrutiny. The                                                  4  For a full discussion, see M.

demand for complex, opaque securities has dried up. With institutional memory longer than a few months, even in the financial sector, there is no need to rush to judgment or to impose hastily conceived measures. The other point is that market participants have every reason to learn the lessons of these events and to change their behaviour as required. As I will discuss in a moment, there are some encouraging signs in this regard. That said, recent events have revealed serious and widespread shortcomings that, if not addressed promptly, completely, and credibly, will demand a more activist response on the part of regulators. The ultimate response will likely be a combination of improved private sector standards and more effective regulation. With those general points in mind, I would like to describe the current responses to the three factors I just mentioned.  First, in terms of liquidity, in many countries the official sector has been working to strengthen and modernize their liquidity arrangements where necessary. Since August, many central banks have provided liquidity to keep the financial system functioning, while not favouring any one market. In the case of the Bank of Canada, our provision of liquidity through standard operations has been effective in keeping the overnight interest rate close to our target. However, as in other countries, liquidity further out the maturity spectrum has been more problematic. While liquidity in term money markets in Canada is currently better than it was in December and better than that now experienced in other jurisdictions, it has not yet returned to historical norms. There are a number of ways in which the Bank of Canada is seeking to improve its ability to provide liquidity to the system. First, the Bank has indicated that we plan to expand the list of collateral that we will accept in our Standing Liquidity Facility. Last week, we issued a consultation paper on our plans to take some types of ABCP as collateral by 31 March. We also plan to accept U.S. Treasuries as collateral by the middle of the year. Second, we are examining the types of term purchase and resale facilities that we should make available in times of financial instability or market failure. These facilities could be similar to the term purchase and resale agreements (or PRAs) that the Bank conducted in December and will be conducting again over the next few weeks. In both of these cases, announcements of these term PRAs were made as part of coordinated actions taken by major central banks to address liquidity pressures in funding markets. The G-10 central banks will continue to work together and will take appropriate steps to address these liquidity pressures. Finally, in its recent budget, the Federal government announced proposals to amend the Bank of Canada Act in order to modernize our authorities to support the stability of the financial system. In parallel with these initiatives, liquidity management at financial institutions must also be improved. Reinvigorated institutional memory has reminded a broad range of institutions of the importance of liquidity management and credit discipline. It is worth noting that, a year ago, the Institute of International Finance published a thoughtful document that outlined potential vulnerabilities in the management of liquidity risk at financial institutions and suggested best practices in the private and official sectors.6 However, as with so much in life, implementation is everything. Regulators are now developing new guidelines and increasing their focus on liquidity management to redress these shortcomings. The second priority area for action is the need for improvements in both transparency and disclosure practices. Such improvements would help to reduce the information asymmetries that impede the smooth functioning of markets.  Globally, there is an urgent need for credible, timely disclosure. Recent reports from Canadian financial institutions have met this requirement. However, information alone is                                                  6  Institute of International Finance, Principles of Liquidity Risk Management (Washington: Institute of International Finance, 2007). 4 BIS Review 30/2008 
insufficient; investors also need to know how to interpret it. The combination of the relative novelty of fair value accounting and extremely volatile markets has made this interpretation more difficult. Some have questioned the utility of requiring mark-to-market valuations of all assets and liabilities on a corporate balance sheet.7 The point can be made that, in the current circumstances, existing accounting rules provide a degree of precision that is not warranted.  By reflecting market moves, fair value accounting certainly increases the volatility of reported earnings. Whether it contributes pro-cyclically to market volatility depends on the behaviour of management. Management's incentive to realize mark-to-market losses depends not only on their expectations of future market moves but also, importantly, on the extent to which investors reward them for capping downside risk or penalize them for higher book leverage caused by unrealized losses. This depends, in part, on investors' interpretation of existing rules. Investors should keep several factors in mind. First, in volatile markets, reported earnings will be volatile. Second, investors should distinguish between realized and unrealized losses. Third, securities may be marked-to-market using imperfect proxies, such as thinly traded derivative indices. As a consequence, investors should be wary of assigning unwarranted precision to such valuations. Fourth, for many complex securities, valuation might be better expressed as a range of outcomes. Since current accounting rules do not permit this, investors must use their judgment to construct valuation distributions. Institutions should provide the information necessary to facilitate such judgments.  From a medium-term perspective, the Financial Stability Forum is looking at accounting and valuation procedures for financial derivative instruments, particularly those for complex, narrowly traded products that become difficult to price in times of stress. More generally, authorities around the world are promoting prompt and full disclosure by financial institutions of losses and valuations of structured products, and are seeking to improve the understanding and disclosure of institutions' exposure to off-balance-sheet vehicles. Loss recognition by major financial institutions is proceeding much more rapidly than during previous periods of financial turmoil. This will ultimately speed the recovery process, provided that investors realize that the rules of the game have changed. Losses that would have been hidden in reserves in the past are now quickly, and sometimes imprecisely, in the open. Some of these losses will be revised later; thus, reported earnings may be more volatile than realized final results. What can authorities do themselves to encourage greater transparency in structured products? First, as announced last week, the Bank's high disclosure standards for the ABCP that it will accept as collateral in its Standing Liquidity Facility may encourage market participants to raise their own standards. In the end, it will be their decision. While issuers and arrangers have every incentive to improve the transparency of structured products, ultimately, disclosure guidelines are set – or not – by regulators. One lesson from the ABCP situation may be that blanket disclosure exemptions were too broad. At the same time, however, authorities should resist the temptation to bring forward overly prescriptive regulations. Rather, they should consider greater application of principles-based regulation. There is no point in regulators trying to anticipate every new product or to restrain their development. There is a point in encouraging issuers to ensure the adequacy of their disclosure within a principles-based framework and to bear the consequences if it is subsequently found wanting.  As I commented earlier, the evolving role of rating agencies relates closely to issues of disclosure and transparency. Authorities are examining the role of credit-rating agencies in                                                  7  For example, see B. Connolly, "Accounting for Depression."

evaluating structured products and the impact of the mandated use of ratings due to investment guidelines or regulation. Going forward, securities regulators will want to see agency incentives aligned more closely with those of investors, and will ensure that agencies are quicker and more thorough in reviewing past ratings. Other regulators must also take responsibility for looking at the extent to which the mandated use of ratings has encouraged credit outsourcing, led to pro-cyclical price movements, and encouraged discontinuous crowded trades. Since rating agencies rely on their reputations, they have powerful incentives to sharpen their practices, improve the information content of their ratings for complex financial instruments, ensure that all material facts are disclosed in a concise and timely manner, and address inherent conflicts of interest in the ratings process. Recent announcements by rating agencies in this regard are encouraging.  I should again stress that investors must not rely exclusively on changes in the rating methodologies of the agencies to repair deficiencies in their own risk-management practices. In a mark-to-market world, with leveraged, collateralized positions, investors need to make their own judgments about the creditworthiness, liquidity, and price volatility of the securities they own.  The third priority area for action concerns the proper alignment of incentives. The market dislocations have revealed some examples of serious principal-agent problems, most notably, within the originate-to-distribute model. For securitization markets to function well, the incentives of originators should be aligned with those of end investors. Indeed, originators and distributors are finding it difficult to sell products where they do not face first loss or otherwise retain exposure through reputational risk. I have little doubt that, over time, originators and distributors will adjust. Incentive alignment is a necessary but not sufficient condition to revive many structured-product markets. It will need to be accompanied by greater standardization, improved transparency, and the development of an appropriate investor base. Another example of misaligned incentives can be seen in the risk-management practices and remuneration structures of financial institutions globally.8 Many financial institutions have pay structures that reward short-term results and encourage potentially excessive risk taking. Investors should take the lead in demanding compensation structures that are more aligned with their interests. Others have suggested that the regulators themselves should make these determinations. While I think regulation of compensation within private institutions is entirely inappropriate, I do think that regulators need to consider carefully the incentive impact of compensation arrangements as they assess the robustness of risk-management and internal control systems. Regulation also creates incentives. The Financial Stability Forum is reviewing the basic supervisory principles of prudential oversight and the possibility that the incentives created by accounting standards and bank capital regulation are contributing to pro-cyclicality in the financial system.9  Conclusion Let me conclude with some comments on the role of monetary policy. At a time of great uncertainty, it is more important than ever that monetary policy act as a stabilizing force. This underscores the importance of keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable. This means that                                                  8  M.

the Bank will continue to watch developments in the real economy for their impact on inflation. Developments in the financial sector will be important from a monetary policy perspective only to the extent that they are expected to influence developments in the real economy and, therefore, inflation. I do not mean to downplay the current financial turbulence – it has clearly begun to affect the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, ours as well. At the Bank of Canada, we will continue to monitor these effects, while aiming neither to favour particular market segments nor to insulate market participants from the consequences of their decisions. Those consequences will continue to reveal themselves in the weeks and months ahead. This will remain a difficult process. However, the responses that I have just outlined will help the market translate uncertainty into risk, and encourage the appropriate repricing of risk so that markets can ultimately return to more normal functioning. However, this will not mean a full return to the status quo ante. While risk will still be distributed, securitization will be increasingly transparent and standardized, and perhaps eventually exchange traded. First loss will likely remain, to some degree, with the originator. Liquidity and balance sheet strength will be more highly valued. Volatility will be less restrained by overconfidence. In short, we will see a world in which financial institutions with sound credit judgment, effective risk management, and patient capital can prosper; a world in which capital is allocated more efficiently; a world that rewards the traditional attributes of Canadian financial institutions. I feel very positive about Canada's medium-term prospects in such a world. BIS Review 30/2008 7 
Irma Rosenberg: Current monetary policy – a difficult balancing act  Speech by Ms Irma Rosenberg, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Nordea, Stockholm, 11 March 2008. *      *      * At the monetary policy meeting on 12 February the Riksbank decided to raise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.25 per cent. I entered a reservation against the decision and considered that the repo rate should be left unchanged. However, it was far from a clear stance. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to explain my reasoning more clearly and the considerations monetary policy has to take into account. I will also comment on some of the statistics received since the monetary policy meeting. In this context it feels natural to briefly comment on some of the criticism we have received, namely that the Riksbank has been altogether too silent about how we view economic developments. It is possible that during the autumn, at the beginning of the financial turmoil, we underestimated the need for the Executive Board members to comment on the developments we see around us. It is also possible that we more generally underestimated the need, even in less turbulent times, to discuss our latest assessment and to relate it to the new statistics received since the most recent monetary policy meeting. All this, that is, our published forecasts and new outcomes, is public information and this link can be made by all those who follow our work. However, for the sake of clarity, I also intend to now run through some of the important information that has been received since the monetary policy meeting on 12 February. However, I will not be saying anything about what the new information means to future interest rate developments. This is something that we Executive Board members will have to decide at our next monetary policy meeting. The material for the February decision In the Monetary Policy Report published in February an account is given of the way in which the majority of the Executive Board view the prospects for inflation and development of the real economy in Sweden and abroad during the coming years. The monetary policy considerations are also shown and the assessments are based on the forecast for the repo rate described in the report. The main scenario of the report forecasts continued high cost pressures in the Swedish economy and weaker economic growth both abroad and in Sweden, albeit still good. It can be added that the forecast had changed only marginally since the December Monetary Policy Update.  Growth in the United States and the euro area is expected to be considerably lower than last year and also lower than the trend development. Even in the world as a whole growth is expected to slow but remain good since emerging markets such as China and India are expected to continue to grow at a rapid rate. In the main scenario the recovery in the United States and the euro area is expected to begin during the second half of this year and next year growth will largely be back at the trend level. Growth in Sweden is expected to be approximately the same this year as last year, but in reality this is a weakening if one takes into account the larger number of working days this year.  Inflation in Sweden rose rapidly in the autumn and, measured by both the CPI and the CPIX, is expected to exceed the inflation target during a large part of the forecast period. The uncertainty over future economic developments is still considerable, however, and to highlight this a number of alternative scenarios are described in the Monetary Policy Report. One of these involves greater financial turmoil and that growth abroad will slow down more sharply. In this scenario growth in the US economy will fall more than in the main scenario, at the same time as the borrowing costs for households and companies in the whole world will BIS Review 30/2008 1 
be higher. This leads to a general dampening of demand and to lower GDP growth and inflation both abroad and in Sweden.  But, as we have written in previous reports, there is also a risk that inflation will be higher than in the main scenario if wage developments are stronger and productivity weaker than expected. In addition, the risk has grown that prices abroad may increase at a faster rate than in the main scenario, which would have an impact on inflation in Sweden also. My international outlook in February We must look at the overall picture when we make our monetary policy decisions. The forecast in the report should be seen as an average forecast, which is always surrounded by a substantial uncertainty interval. In this case it was unusually difficult to have an idea of the probabilities for the different outcomes. Even though the present situation has certain similarities with some previous episodes, the differences outweigh the similarities and there is, therefore, little previous experience to learn from. Prior to the monetary policy meeting in February I felt, and still do feel, more concern over international developments than is reflected in the main scenario of the Monetary Policy Report. My view of international developments did not differ greatly from that of the main scenario in the short-term perspective. However, I was concerned that the financial crisis would be both deeper and more protracted than was forecast.  The financial market turmoil continued up to the monetary policy meeting. The problems in the interbank market appeared to have been alleviated to some extent, although interbank rates were still higher than normal and risk premiums in the credit market continued to be high. The turmoil continued to be great and the financial crisis expressed itself in other ways.  It will probably take a long time to gain a general view of the extent to which international banks and other financial institutions will be forced to write-down losses. One relatively late consequence of the crisis was the problem for the so-called monolines, that is, insurance companies that insure bond loans. Many of them risked being downgraded by the credit rating agencies and this has since been the case for several of them. As I saw it, these problems could lead to a substantial credit crunch. Developments on the world’s stock markets were another clear expression of the financial turmoil. Since the international stock market fall began last summer, and up until the February monetary policy meeting, prices on the largest stock exchanges had fallen by between 15 and 30 per cent. Just since the beginning of the year prices had fallen by 10-15 per cent. It is difficult to predict how the existing turmoil on the financial markets will affect developments around the world and in the Swedish economy. The financial sector in Sweden is outside of the worst crisis area since it has small direct exposures to the most problematic areas of the securities markets, but my assessment was that the Swedish economy would be affected by a continued crisis with abnormally high interest rates and elements of credit rationing.  The problems in the US housing market also continued. According to real estate statistics, house prices had fallen in all regions. As long as the adjustment continues, there is a risk that the problems in the subprime market will be aggravated and the financial turmoil will intensify. It is difficult to assess how the financial turmoil and the problems in the housing market affect the real economy. Growth in the United States weakened substantially during the final quarter of last year and the fall in housing investments made a significantly negative contribution. Nonetheless, household consumption was maintained relatively well during the fourth quarter. The question is how resistant household consumption, which corresponds to approximately 70 per cent of GDP, will be given the shocks facing the US economy. The fact that house and share prices are falling means that household wealth is declining, which 2 BIS Review 30/2008 
could have a negative impact on demand. The upturn in oil and food prices also means that households’ purchasing power is being undermined. These negative effects have been counteracted to some extent by the Federal Reserve’s cutting the policy rate and by various fiscal policy measures. The forecast in the main scenario of the Monetary Policy Report entails fairly weak growth in the US economy over the coming quarters. Nevertheless, I considered there to be an evident risk that the problems would be more prolonged than was forecast in the main scenario of the Report. Growth in the euro area was also more subdued in the fourth quarter last year. The outcome had not been published at the time of the monetary policy meeting, but it was largely as expected. Households in the euro area appear to have been very restrictive with their consumption expenditure. Retail trade turnover fell at the end of last year and it is also possible to discern from survey data that household confidence has declined. As in the United States, more prolonged problems in the financial markets can lead to developments being weaker than in the main scenario. My view in February of developments in Sweden Inflation has gradually risen in Sweden in recent years. On average, measured in terms of the CPI, inflation was 2.2 per cent last year, which is close to the inflation target. The upswing in inflation was partly due to resource utilisation in the economy having increased and cost pressures having risen. Hourly wages increased more rapidly than before at the same time as productivity growth slackened considerably. Inflation has been very low for several years, but in 2007 rising cost pressures were a factor that contributed to inflation reaching the target. Underlying inflation, measured in terms of the CPIX, was however 1.2 per cent as an average for 2007.  During the autumn of last year inflation rose very quickly and, measured in terms of the CPI, reached 3.5 per cent in December. Underlying inflation, measured in terms of the CPIX, rose to 2 per cent in December. The rapid upturn in inflation last autumn was largely due to rising energy and food prices, a reflection of the fact that prices rose rapidly on the world market. At the monetary policy meeting I pointed out that it is not possible to immediately counteract such rapid price impulses from abroad with monetary policy. Quite simply, it must be allowed to take some time. In the Monetary Policy Report the rapid price increases are to some extent assessed to be of a temporary nature. If world market prices do not continue to rise at the same rapid pace in future, inflation will fall back again. This is also what is forecast in the main scenario of the Report. However, to some extent, it also concerns the effects on inflation which risk becoming more permanent and which may need to be counteracted with monetary policy. When inflation rises and is above the target, as CPI inflation now is, it is important that it is not allowed to become entrenched and become permanently high. The risk of this increases if inflation expectations rise, and that is exactly what has occurred. Inflation expectations have risen not just one year ahead, but even two and five years ahead, which is troublesome.  The monetary policy decision The upturn in inflation and in inflation expectations in the slightly longer term were also factors that indicated the interest rate should be raised at the monetary policy meeting in February. The forecast in the main scenario of the Monetary Policy Report means that growth will slacken but will still remain good during the forecast period. I personally was slightly more concerned about the problems in the financial markets and the risk of weaker developments abroad, which would of course also affect developments in Sweden. BIS Review 30/2008 3 
As the minutes of the meeting show I was, on the other hand, not quite as concerned about cost pressures as before. Wages did not appear to be rising as quickly as the Riksbank assumed shortly after the new agreements were met last year. The wage forecasts were also adjusted downwards in the Monetary Policy Report. In addition, my opinion was that the slowdown in productivity growth last year was more comprehensible when the publication of National Account statistics for the third quarter showed that output growth had clearly slowed down as early on as at the beginning of 2007. Growth in the number of hours worked did not slacken as output growth. This is the normal pattern when growth slackens in that the labour market typically lags behind somewhat in the economic cycle. I therefore assessed that weaker productivity growth indicates that companies will be more restrictive in recruiting labour rather than that we will see rapid price increases in the future. When I weighed together the great uncertainty about developments in the financial markets and the risk for a weaker development abroad with the Swedish economic outlook and the risk of inflation in Sweden remaining high, my conclusion was that the interest rate should be left unchanged. I would like to emphasise that it should not be regarded as though I wished to attach less weight to the inflation target. It was and is more a question of how much time it will take to bring inflation back on target. I also pointed out that the Riksbank has raised the interest rate in a number of stages since January 2006 and that these increases have not yet had a full impact on the economy. What has happened since the monetary policy meeting? So far my assessment is that outcome data and indicators in the euro area are largely in line with the assessment in the main scenario of the Monetary Policy Report. My opinion is also that the indications of weak US growth at the beginning of this year and the continued problems on the housing and property markets are in line with the assessment in the main scenario. In the short-term perspective the assessment does not differ from my own. I am however more concerned that it will take longer before the recovery gathers pace. Swedish GDP growth during the fourth quarter last year was somewhat stronger than expected in the Monetary Policy Report. Employment, measured as the number of hours worked, increased at an unexpectedly high rate and productivity growth last year was weaker than expected in the Report.  The National Institute of Economic Research’s business tendency survey for February shows a clear slowdown in economic activity in the business sector as a whole. The business tendency survey suggests that employment has continued to increase, but at a slower rate. Companies have adjusted their recruitment plans downwards ahead of the coming months. In contrast, the purchasing managers index displays a more positive view in February. The total index rose somewhat and during several months fluctuated around the level of 55, which is close to the average since 2001. However, at the same time, the survey shows that growth in employment has slackened and that companies have become less optimistic about output growth in the future. In January inflation in Sweden was somewhat lower compared with the forecast in the Monetary Policy Report. However, this was largely connected with the fact that the weights in the CPI basket, as at the end of each year, had changed. The effects of this change were unusually large this time. This could be interpreted as though consumers, to a greater extent than normal, have replaced goods and services that increased rapidly in price in their consumption. The so-called substitution effect was then greater than the Riksbank and most other analysts had assumed.  All in all, activity in the Swedish economy during the final quarter last year appears to have been slightly higher than we expected in February. Productivity on the other hand showed weaker development than in the assessment in the Report. Survey data clearly suggests 4 BIS Review 30/2008 
however that a slowdown is occurring in most parts of the business sector and that the increase in the demand for labour is on the point of slowing.  The turmoil has once again increased in the financial markets around the world. This suggests that these are complicated processes that can be protracted. The so-called TED spreads, which is the spread between interbank rates and T-bill rates, have risen once more, above all in the United States but even in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Credit spreads are still high. In recent days the spreads on the mortgage market in Sweden have increased. This is linked to the unrest on the mortgage markets in a few other European countries. Credit insurance premiums have risen recently both in the United States and Europe. New reports about losses related to the US subprime sector are being received. Share prices in Europe and the United States have fluctuated somewhat, but are at present somewhat lower than at the time of the monetary policy meeting. The krona has strengthened somewhat, especially against the US dollar. Conclusion As I mentioned initially, I have in this speech referred to some of the new information received and compared it with the forecasts made in connection with the February Monetary Policy Report. It is important to point out that a lot of important new statistics will be received prior to the next monetary policy meeting in April, and it is not until then that an overall assessment can be made of the monetary policy consequences.  When I look at what has happened since out monetary policy meeting on 12 February I think that events so far support the general outline given in the Monetary Policy Report. Neither does the difference between my own assessment and the main scenario apply to developments in so short a term as a month or two. My slightly more pessimistic view applies to what the consequences might be of the turmoil in the financial markets. It is a question of the risk of a weaker development abroad and the consequences this may have on developments in the real economy and inflation in the Swedish economy. My assessment in February was that, given the considerable prevailing uncertainty, we should wait before raising the repo rate. At the same time, it is important to emphasise that all we Executive Board members, regardless of our stance at the most recent meeting, look seriously upon both the risk of aggravated financial turmoil and weaker development abroad as well as the risk of inflation in Sweden becoming entrenched at a high level. It is not easy to weigh these risks against each other and I therefore believe that it was not so remarkable that we Executive Board members reached slightly different conclusions in our deliberations at the meeting in February.

Glenn Stevens: Monetary policy and inflation – how does it work? Remarks by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Australian Treasury Seminar Series, Canberra, 11 March 2008. *      *      * When I was originally approached to speak to this audience, I was asked to give a Reserve Bank perspective on the economy. That was a fairly general brief. Given the current state of affairs, it makes sense to fulfil it by talking specifically about inflation and monetary policy.  There is extensive commentary around at the moment about “blunt” instruments, concerns over the effect of rising interest rates on particular indebted sections of the community and the appeal in various quarters for some other way of dealing with inflation. Hence, it seems a sensible moment to re visit just how monetary policy works. It is also important to have a realistic assessment of the extent to which other instruments are available to help in the job that monetary policy is charged with. But before tackling either of those issues, there is a prior set of questions that have to be addressed, about what is actually happening to inflation. Unless we are clear about that, then the subsequent discussion about monetary policy’s role in controlling it is not well based. If there is not actually an inflation problem, then presumably monetary policy should proceed differently than it would if there is, in fact, a problem. So the plan of these remarks is as follows. First, I will address the questions about what is happening to inflation and why. Then I will turn to questions of what monetary policy can do about it, and what other instruments can do. In both instances, the way I propose to do this is to recount some of the questions that we have seen raised in various places. In some cases, these are reasonable questions. But there are reasonable answers, and I would like to offer them. Finally, I would like to step back from this approach focused on the particular details of the current situation to give some broader historical perspective. It is important to keep that perspective in mind, not just to be clear how big the challenge is, but also to be clear how well the economy has done, so far at least, in meeting it. Arguments about inflation  One argument which has been around is that there isn’t much inflation. On the face of it, this is not an unreasonable starting point. The latest CPI headline rate is, after all, only 3 per cent. If that is as high as it gets and it comes down at some point before long, then presumably there is not that much of a problem. It would, in fact, be quite consistent with the inflation targeting framework we have been operating on for well over a decade now. The average inflation rate over a run of years would still be “two point something”. Unfortunately, the situation at present is not quite as benign as that. The headline figure owes quite a bit to the unusually low result in the March quarter of 2007, which was affected by some unusual and temporary effects. When we get the March 2008 figures towards the end of April, we will most likely find that the rise over the four quarters is more like 4 per cent. That result itself will have various temporary factors affecting it, so it is not necessarily an immediate guide to how concerned we should be. To get a better feel for the component of inflation that is likely to be more persistent, we look at various measures of underlying inflation. As you know, there is more than one way of doing this, and in my judgement it is not sensible to be doctrinaire about any one underlying measure. But what is clear is that these series have all picked up, with the exact extent varying by measure. Overall, the Reserve Bank, in its February 2008 Statement on Monetary Policy, put the pace of underlying inflation over the past year at about 3½ per cent. That is no disaster as a BIS Review 30/2008 1 
temporary phenomenon either, but monetary policy has to be set with a view to winding that increase back within a reasonable period.  Now I need to be clear about the status of these underlying measures. The target for monetary policy is set in terms of the Consumer Price Index. The objective is to achieve an average rate of CPI inflation of between 2 and 3 per cent. The “on average” specification is used precisely because the CPI is sometimes affected over short periods by factors that will not be there in a year or two’s time, when the effects of any monetary policy changes will still be coming through. For policy to chase those short term fluctuations would risk making the economy less, rather than more, stable. So we need to look ahead to where the CPI is likely to be in future, as well as where it is now. For that purpose, we employ analytical devices to help us detect what the ongoing trend in inflation is likely to be, and this is where the underlying measures are useful. They are not, themselves, the target variable. But a policy that targets future CPI inflation, using underlying inflation as an analytical tool and/or as a predictor of the headline CPI, would probably look very similar to one that was targeting underlying inflation per se. So, in this sense, if one is trying to assess what economists would call the Bank’s “reaction function” using particular price series, underlying measures would probably be more helpful than the headline rate.  Another argument we hear is that inflation is higher, but that is due to a few things on the supply side that we cannot help, and that cannot be influenced by monetary policy. There are some prices that historically have been subject to large but temporary supply disturbances. Agricultural produce is a classic example – with droughts, floods or other phenomena sometimes having significant, and even large, impacts. But these effects should be expected to be only temporary – when weather conditions change, prices should revert back to trend. So there is no need for monetary policy to respond to them, and the various underlying measures help us to abstract from their effects in the short term. When Cyclone Larry devastated the banana crop in early 2006, the effect was to help push the CPI inflation rate up to 4 per cent. That impact has now been reversed. Contrary to what was asserted in some quarters, monetary policy did not respond to this event at the time, nor has it since. There are certainly some food prices that have been pushed up because of the recent drought (though others have been pushed down). It is less clear, however, that some of the other unusually large price movements currently affecting the CPI can be passed off as temporary supply disturbances. Global oil prices have certainly risen sharply, but not because the supply of oil has been reduced. In fact, the supply of oil has never been higher. The biggest reason for the rise in the price of oil (measured in US dollars) has been the rise of demand. Of course it is not Australian demand (though that has risen), but demand in Asia, and especially in China, that accounts for much of the rise in global demand. So the rise in energy prices is not “our fault”, so to speak, but nor is it temporary. Higher Chinese demand is not going to go away. So we have to adjust to higher energy prices. People have also pointed out the prominent increases in rents in the CPI as a special factor, and it is certainly true that rents are rising quickly. The reason that is happening is pretty clear too: there is strong demand for that type of accommodation, and rents as a yield to the supplier have been unusually low. Hence, rents are bound to rise.  Interestingly, this shows the lengthy and rather complex connection between asset price changes and consumer price inflation. A key factor behind rental yields being very low was that the price of residential property rose so strongly – far faster than rents – in the earlier part of this decade, and has stayed high in most places in the country. While capital gains were occurring, it mattered little to many investors that rents as a running yield were low. But this was not sustainable. Once capital gains slowed, the low rental yield mattered a great deal. Low yields also prompted more demand for rental accommodation than otherwise. That combination was bound to lead to an adjustment in rents, unless property prices actually declined to restore the yield. Since, in most locations, they did not, an adjustment something like the one we now see became very likely. It seems likely to continue for a while yet, until 2 BIS Review 30/2008 
either rental yields regain more attractive levels or some other factor raises the effective return for investors.  Suppose, though, that we did take out some of the “special factors” that people nominate. Let’s, for the sake of argument, remove from the CPI rents and petrol, as well as the calculation of deposits and loan facilities. If we do that, the rate of inflation of the remaining items over the year to December 2007 is 2.1 per cent. No problem, right? Well, not exactly. To assess the trend in inflation objectively, you cannot just take out items that rise in price, which is why we typically use underlying measures, which trim both extreme rises and falls. Suppose for the current purpose, then, that we also remove fresh fruit, as a very volatile item and one that happens to have held down the CPI over the past year, due to the unwinding of the great banana episode of 2005/06. Let’s also remove the effects of the child care rebate changes, treated as a price fall in the CPI, but which we know is a one-time effect and which reduced the CPI by 0.2 per cent.  If we do all that, we get a rate of inflation of 3.0 per cent over the year to December 2007. A little elementary figuring and a look at the quarterly profile, moreover, will tell you that, when this calculation is done for the year to March 2008, the answer is likely to be higher again. This is not all that far from what the statistical underlying measures, which dampen the effects of large rises and falls in a more systematic way, are telling us the trend inflation rate is now.  So, unfortunately, it will not do to say that just a few items explain it all away. What is really going on is that price rises across a pretty wide range of items have picked up. About two thirds of the items in the CPI by weight have risen at more than 2½ per cent over the past year. Normally, we experience about half the price rises at that pace (which you would expect if average inflation is 2½ per cent). In essence, to explain away the rise in inflation we have seen, the list of special factors to which we have to appeal is growing rather long. At the same time, there is no question that aggregate demand in the Australian economy rose strongly through 2007, and indeed in recent years generally, at a pace well above the economy’s likely growth of potential supply. Nor is there much serious argument against the proposition that usage of capacity in the economy is very high – business surveys uniformly tell us that, as does the measured level of real GDP relative to trend, and the low unemployment rate and high level of vacancies. Firms have struggled to find the additional workers to expand their activities – that is what they tell us. In short, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that there has been genuine pressure on prices, caused not just by temporary supply shortfalls in a few areas, even though there have been some of those, but also by persistent strength in demand. The next argument that I want to address is that wages have not picked up. Some people object to our message on inflation, including references we have made to labour costs, because they seem to think that we are somehow “blaming” wage earners for inflation. We are not saying that. This episode has not been caused by some exogenous “break out” in wages. Until recently, it was, in fact, possible to say that wages growth had been remarkably steady at an aggregate level in the face of a very tight labour market, with relative wages across industries and regions doing what one would expect given the shocks hitting the economy. At one stage, I described this as a textbook case of adjustment1, in a labour market made much more flexible by a long sequence of reforms. Private sector wages growth may be picking up a little now, and businesses we talk to say that they are having to                                                  1  See Official Committee Hansard of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, 17 August 2007, Gold Coast.

find ways to raise compensation, and in ways that may not immediately be evident in the official data. But we have certainly not claimed that labour costs are leading the way. It seems to me that if labour costs are starting to accelerate, this is mainly a symptom of inflation pressure in a very strong economy. Inflation problems do not have to start with wages. Sometimes in Australia in the past they have started that way, but it should not be assumed that it will be that way on every occasion. On the other hand, should people come to expect that inflation will be higher for a long time, and wage claims and price setting start to reflect that, we will have more trouble getting inflation down again. One of the most important jobs of monetary policy is to condition expectations. To achieve that, people have to believe we will do what is required to control inflation over time.  The final argument I want to tackle is that the inflation target is too low. This view accepts that inflation has increased, and that it is not just a few factors that are responsible, but argues that 3-4 per cent inflation is acceptable, and that it is unrealistic to expect to return to the 2-3 per cent standard.  I do not think that the 2-3 per cent average inflation target is too ambitious. We have achieved it for the past 15 years, and we achieved average outcomes of that order for long periods in the 20th century. If we accept that the target could slide up to 3-4 per cent, to match actual inflation, how long would it be before we were debating 4-5 per cent as a goal? If the analysis of the economy that we have set out is correct – that overall demand has been growing faster than can be sustained – it would not be long. Ongoing demand growth above sustainable rates would not mean steady inflation at a higher level, it would mean a continuing increase in inflation. If that is the situation, then demand has to be curtailed to stabilise inflation at any level. Revising the target higher would provide only very temporary respite from the measures needed to control inflation, unless we were prepared to revise it higher every year.  Furthermore, the argument that we could accept a higher trend inflation rate ignores how much the structure of the economy has adapted – in good ways – to “two point something” inflation. The structure of nominal interest rates, to name just one thing, has been predicated on that being the medium term anchor. If that anchor were allowed to drag, higher average interest rates in the future would be the result. This is a result amply demonstrated in history: the surest way to higher average interest rates is to accept higher inflation. To put it simply, if the community wants sustainably low interest rates, we should choose a low inflation target, not a high one. So accepting a rise in trend inflation because of the short term moderation in demand growth needed to contain a pick up in prices would be a very short sighted policy. It would very likely condemn us to a repeat of the problems of the late 1960s and 1970s, when we mistakenly thought we could live with a bit more inflation, and all the attendant difficulty we had in the 1980s in fixing the inflation problem, all over again. It is far better to resist rising inflation now.  Arguments about monetary policy  I turn now to arguments about monetary policy and inflation. The first one that I want to address is the assertion that monetary policy, in adjusting interest rates, is ineffective in controlling prices, because it is failing to restrain demand. More than once I have seen people state that the rises in interest rates seemed not to make much difference. But if it were really true that the sequence of adjustments that took place to raise the cash rate from its low of 4.25 per cent in 2001 to 7.25 per cent today made no difference to the economy or inflation, it would follow that we could reduce the cash rate by 300 basis points tomorrow and nothing would change. If we put it like that, surely not many people could seriously believe that the changes to interest rates have made no difference. 4 BIS Review 30/2008 
More realistically, people might think that it is the changes in rates that matter, more than the level, and that the changes were too small. In this view, interest rate changes should perhaps have been bigger, so as to give more of a “shock” to behaviour on each occasion (though they should presumably also have been less frequent – otherwise the level of rates we would have reached would have been much higher). I suppose it is possible that a different sequence of changes, including some bigger ones, would have changed behaviour in the economy. We cannot know because that alternative scenario cannot be run, but as everyone knows, the Board has on occasion in the recent past considered larger movements. So the idea of larger changes is not absurd. Yet it is hardly as though interest rate changes were so small that no one noticed. There are few issues reported at more length than interest rates; no one could say they were unaware of what was happening. Beginning with the March 2005 rate change, moreover, the extent of coverage in the media has been far more intense than it had been prior to then, and far more intense than is the case in other comparable countries. We could debate the reasons for that, but they do not matter for present purposes. On every one of those occasions, there was no shortage of dramatic media coverage, and no shortage of predictions of serious consequences for indebted households, the economy and so on. If we were looking for announcement effects, surely they should have been at work through this period. My own view is that monetary policy is most effective when actions are seen to be consistent with the factual evidence available on the economy, a sensible assessment about future risks, and a framework that has a clear medium term objective for policy. Apart from that, we have to accept that the likely effect of any one move of 25 or even 50 basis points is, while uncertain, probably only modest. It is the combination of changes, and more particularly the level reached, that will do most of the work. A second version of the “ineffectiveness” argument holds that (1) the price rises are coming from factors beyond the control of any Australian policy, and particularly from abroad, from which it follows that (2) monetary policy cannot do anything about them. For some people, it follows that it is therefore (3) futile, and unnecessarily disruptive, to try. I have already addressed the question of whether all the price rises can be put down to a few special factors, obviously not under our control. The fact is that the price rises are broader than that. But even if all the initial impetus for higher prices comes from events abroad, we still have to decide how we will respond to that shock. In the case of energy prices, while the world price of oil in US dollars certainly is completely outside our control, it is the Australian dollar price of oil that actually matters for the Australian motorist. That price is lower at present than it might have been, because of the rise in the exchange rate. Insofar as interest rates have a bearing on the exchange rate, they can affect petrol prices, indirectly, and have done so. Looking across the economy more generally, we can all see that the main external event of recent years is the rise in the terms of trade, which is obviously completely exogenous as far as Australia is concerned. But higher resource prices generate additional income, which then affects demand for goods and services at home. That is expansionary, and puts pressure on prices for non traded goods and services. Even though monetary policy cannot stop the initial shock – of course we cannot stop the Chinese demand for resources – we can, and should, seek to condition the economy’s subsequent response to that shock, rather than simply letting domestic overheating go unchecked. Tighter policy will dampen domestic demand and contain the pick up in non traded prices as well as raising the exchange rate, which makes imports cheaper, exports less competitive and fosters a move of productive resources into the parts of the economy where more production is needed. That is an appropriate form of adjustment to such a shock, particularly if the shock is likely to be fairly persistent.  BIS Review 30/2008 5 
So even when events beyond our control occur to put pressure on prices, we should still respond, and that response can be quite effective. Another line of argument takes quite a different tack. It argues not that monetary policy is ineffective, but in fact that it makes the problem worse by actually raising prices. The logic here is that interest payments are a cost to business activity, and that raising this cost will simply result in businesses passing it on. It is obviously true that interest is a cost, and for a business to stay solvent it has to cover that along with its other costs in its selling price. But when interest rates rise, can business just pass this cost on without losing sales? It might be possible initially, but since higher interest rates do eventually slow demand, it will get more difficult to raise prices in due course. So when some people say that higher rates will just push up prices, I think the answer is that it is the strength of demand that allows that, and the rise in interest rates will, in time, dampen demand. All the historical evidence is that monetary policy is quite effective in that regard.  I turn now to other arguments, not that monetary policy is ineffective, but that it is not terribly precise. One common expression is that it is a blunt instrument. People rarely define what they mean by that term, but I think they have in mind two things. First, if inflation is rising because particular prices are moving a lot, monetary policy cannot focus precisely on exactly those particular prices, or those particular features of economic behaviour causing the price rises. It is a general, rather than specific, instrument in that sense. Second, I think that when people say “blunt”, they mean “unfair” – particularly that when interest rates rise, this affects households who owe money on a home loan. (Presumably the same argument would mean that it is equally unfair to savers to put interest rates down when the economy is weak.) As I noted before, it is not actually true that the recent rise in inflation is confined to just a few items. To that extent, the use of a general instrument would seem quite appropriate. But there are also a couple of other quite important points to make in regard to the “blunt instrument” critique.  The first is that the transmission channels for monetary policy are much wider than just the impacts on households with home loans. Most businesses have debts, too.2 Floating rate debt costs more for them to service as interest rates rise, which presumably causes some of them to reconsider some things they might have been doing or planning. So the “cash flow” channel of monetary policy affects business. Monetary policy also affects what economists would call inter temporal decision making. Incentives to save, as opposed to consume, alter. It is commonly observed that many Australians save rather little, but the household saving rate has in fact risen noticeably in recent years, largely unnoticed by conventional opinion. I do not claim that the increase is mainly due to rising interest rates, but I do not think we should assume that these incentives do not matter. Despite Australia’s extensive use of foreign saving to build up our economy, the bulk of our productive investment is financed via domestic saving of one form or another. Changes in interest rates affect asset values over time, through effects on discount rates, expected earnings growth and so on. These feed through into behaviour in several dimensions – via the cost of capital to firms, wealth effects and so on. Through complex channels, monetary policy can sometimes also affect the non price terms of credit, particularly if it manages to affect expectations about future growth, creditworthiness and risk appetite. Then there is the exchange rate, as I have already mentioned. Numerous factors affect exchange rates, and the relationships are hard to pin down. However, interest rate                                                  2  About 35 per cent of households owe money on their home. If we include debts of all kind, closer to 70 per cent of households carry debt of some kind, though many of these other debts are relatively small. 6 BIS Review 30/2008 
differentials between countries do matter to exchange rates, along with expectations about how those differentials may change (a function of growth expectations), factors affecting trade positions (such as commodity prices in our case), investor risk preferences and so on. I have already discussed the case of petrol, but there is surely little doubt that the prices of tradable goods and services generally are lower today than they would have been if the exchange rate had been at its long run average level. This is the case even with much more muted short term pass through of exchange rate changes than we used to have. In other words, changes in the exchange rate alter the terms at which the rest of the world supplies goods and services to Australia in a way that is stabilising for prices.  All these are channels for monetary policy’s effects. They operate at different speeds, and to differing extents in different episodes – but they are all there, and I would say that they are all working at present. The transmission of monetary policy is not just about home loan rates, as important a channel as that is. Secondly, to say monetary policy is a blunt instrument begs the question: where are the sharp instruments? It is not obvious that there are all that many. People mention supply side reforms of various kinds and unquestionably these have been extremely important over the years. To the extent that more can be done, that is all to the good for Australians’ standard of living. But they are long term. It is hard to deploy them in a hurry. And many of them are very general – “blunt” even – rather than specific. Many people will appeal, perhaps not unreasonably, to the possibility of using fiscal policy to counter inflation pressure. For some time now, fiscal policy has not been actively deployed to manage the business cycle. The focus has mainly been on achieving and then maintaining a structurally sound, long run fiscal position and, subject to that, making tax and spending decisions aimed at various other objectives that governments have. This does not preclude allowing the budget’s “automatic stabilisers” to operate over the cycle (though it might be observed that, with an elongated upswing like the one we have been having, it is getting more difficult to decide what should be thought of as a temporary rise in revenue and what can be assumed to be permanent). It strikes me that in the popular discussion about fiscal policy, many participants talk past each other because they are looking at different time dimensions. It is not unreasonable to say that if the budget is perpetually in surplus, there is no debt to speak of and no other looming large unfunded liability, taxes should probably, over some long run horizon, be lower. This, it seems to me, is the economic case for structural reductions in taxes, which some observers articulate. Others argue that such reductions should be delayed, for cyclical reasons, given that demand needs to slow to contain inflation. So there is a structural case for taxes to fall, and a cyclical case for them not to. It is no doubt difficult for any government to reconcile these two, equally valid, points of view, the more so if the same tension persists for a number of consecutive years.  Leaving that aside, let us give some thought to just how effective an instrument budgetary policy is likely to be. If inflationary pressures were just due to specific, narrow issues (which, as is clear above, I doubt), precise targeting of the sources of inflationary pressure via tax and spending measures could nonetheless be exceedingly difficult at a technical level, let alone politically. If it is accepted, on the other hand, that inflation is sufficiently general that overall demand has to slow, the amount of slowing has to be the same regardless of whether it comes via monetary policy or fiscal policy. It would be somewhat differently distributed across sectors and regions, as the impact of interest rate and exchange rate effects obviously would not overlap exactly with the tax or spending measures that would occur in their place. I would hazard a guess, though, that a good many people who are today paying higher interest rates would instead pay higher taxes in a world where fiscal policy was used more actively to manage the business cycle. We are unlikely, I submit, to witness a situation where income BIS Review 30/2008 7 
taxes are raised only for those without home loans, or only for those living in Western Australia and Queensland, or those working in the mining sector.  Then there are the time lags in implementing fiscal measures. The Budget occurs once a year, and has a very long and gruelling process in the lead up. I am not expecting to be stampeded by people in this room wishing to do that more often. The economy could conceivably look rather different in mid May when the Budget occurs than it did when the budget processes began, and different again by the time the measures actually take effect. Monetary policy has its full effects with a long lag, but we at least get to reconsider each month, and if need be we can reverse direction quickly. Don’t get me wrong. I am not arguing that fiscal policy does not matter to the cyclical outcomes, or that fiscal policy should not be made with an eye to the cycle as well as to the structural position. To the extent it can be, of course that is welcome. I am not here to offer any particular suggestion on what fiscal policy should do at present. I am simply saying that the task of fine tuning fiscal policy for stabilisation purposes, if that were thought desirable, is unlikely to be any more straightforward than that of using monetary policy. Fiscal policy, in its own way and for its own reasons, is also likely to prove a fairly blunt instrument. Inevitably, even with fiscal policy ideally calibrated for the conjunctural position, monetary policy would still have a lot of work to do managing inflation.  Broader perspective The above remarks address some reservations about the conduct of monetary policy that I have seen of late. Some of these reservations are understandable, but there are reasonable responses to them. It should also be observed that it is not the first time we have seen most of these arguments: they tend to recur each time we reach the top end of the inflation cycle and monetary policy has to control it. Having said all that, it is important to keep some perspective about the situation in which we find ourselves. We have been living through one of the largest transformations in the structure of the global economy, as far as Australia is concerned, for a century. The rise in the terms of trade over the past five years is the biggest such event since the Korean War boom in the early 1950s. But while the Korean War event was a temporary one, all the indications are that the rise of China is not just a cyclical event, but a structural change of the first order. China certainly has a business cycle, like all other economies, and will slow at some point. Even so, it is highly likely that, short of some catastrophic event, China has many years of strong growth still ahead. It will not be at the 11 per cent per annum pace of the past couple of years, and there will be periods of weakness and instability. But the rise of China is not a flash in the pan of economic history. In essence, we are seeing a very large change in relative prices in the world economy, and a relative price change that is more important to Australia, in particular, than to almost any other country. These sorts of events will always produce stresses and strains, including significant divergences in performance across industries and regions (though these are often exaggerated in popular discussion). Because the event is, overall, very expansionary, it was always likely to be associated with some risk of higher inflation. But given the magnitude of the shock, when all is said and done, the economy has coped pretty well so far. Yes, inflation has risen. This is a problem, and requires a suitable response from monetary policy. But compare the outcomes on this occasion with those in the commodity price booms of the early 1950s or the mid 1970s. In the early 1950s, CPI inflation reached 25 per cent, then fell back to zero within a few years, associated with quite a pronounced recession. In the mid 1970s, inflation reached about 18 per cent, and took a very long time to come down to acceptable levels. This time, we are grappling with a peak CPI inflation rate that looks like it will be around 4 per cent in CPI terms, and trying to assess how 8 BIS Review 30/2008 
soon it can reasonably return to 2-3 per cent. This is a far cry from the problems of yesteryear. The reason we are doing better this time around is not hard to fathom, either. As work in the Treasury has argued persuasively, a flexible exchange rate, a reformed and flexible industrial environment, better private sector management and much stronger fiscal and monetary policy frameworks have made a lot of difference. The fruits of those decades of effort of reform are an economy that, for all its strains, is doing well under the circumstances. The officers of the Treasury, past and present, have played a key role in achieving that. That legacy has been handed to you, and to all of us. Our challenge is to keep those improved structures in place and to develop them further, in the period in which we have the privilege of having some influence.  BIS Review 30/2008 9 
Ajith Nivard Cabraal: Harnessing sustainable growth in emerging markets Keynote address by Mr Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the 2nd World Management Summit 2008, Karachi, Pakistan, 11 March 2008.  *      *      * As salaam Aleikum, Ayubowan, Good Morning. Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,  At the outset, I wish to thank the organizers of this World Management Summit for inviting me to deliver the keynote address. I am also greatly touched by the wonderful hospitality accorded to me in this very interesting and historic city of Karachi. Mr. Chairman, I consider it a privilege and honour to share my thoughts and views on a very timely topic, “Harnessing Sustainable Growth in Emerging Markets” at this important forum. I hope I would be able to plant a few seeds in your distinguished minds so that such seeds may be nurtured by you in your deliberations to follow. As a first step, let us examine the current global and regional trends in relation to World Economic Growth, so that we could deal with this topic in a wider perspective. As we know, over the past few years, the global economy has been experiencing one of its’ strongest sustained periods of growth, since the early 1970s. This expansion is projected to be very strong even after accounting for the impact of the recent financial market turbulence. Significantly, this growth has, as its foundation, the strong results of the emerging markets which have been leading the way. In fact, during 2007, China’s economy grew by over 11 per cent and it made the largest contribution to global growth. India grew at more than 9 per cent and Russia at almost 8 per cent. These three countries accounted for one-half of global growth over the past year, while several other developing countries also maintained their own robust expansions. In fact, the rapid growth in these countries counter-balanced the moderate growth in the United States and other advanced economies.  The current global expansion is remarkable in several ways. First, emerging markets and developing countries are now accounting for a high share of growth – more than two-thirds, compared with about one-half in the 1990s; Second, the successes arising from rapid growth are not being enjoyed by a few countries only – most countries and regions are doing better in comparison to their own past standards; and, third, the volatility of growth has declined substantially. For example, the Sri Lankan economy has grown at well over 6% during each of the past 3 years and in 2008 too, a growth of 7% or close to 7% is projected. Pakistan too has recorded an average growth rate above 7% during the last 4 years. Mr. Chairman, until the last decade, there was a clear relationship between global economic growth and the growth in advanced economies. As a matter of fact, when major economies, particularly, the USA, recorded a slow down, it retarded world output significantly. So much so, it was said that when the USA got a cold, the others got pneumonia! However, recent trends show that the world economy is no longer overwhelmingly reliant on the advanced economies only. In fact, the weights seems to be gradually shifting with the emerging global economy recording strong growth performances during recent years, while the advanced economies are basically recording moderate growth. It may therefore be useful to “flag” this important aspect when we are discussing the issues relating to harnessing sustainable growth in emerging markets. Let us consider as to what extent the current expansion in emerging markets and developing countries is due to the implementation of good policies, or as to whether it BIS Review 29/2008 1 
was just good luck that made this happen. What is the secret behind this remarkable performance of emerging economies?  A simple assessment may probably tell us that the main driver of the recent expansion has been the fast integration of these developing nations with the global economy, and the rapid opening out of their economic activity. All three major emerging economies, China, India and Russia, were basically “closed” economies a couple of decades ago. Emergence of these three giants, who collectively account for 20% of land area on the earth and serve as home for 40% of world population, has dramatically changed the shape of world trade, direction of capital flows and the growth sources of the global economy. In fact, during the last decade, the share of advanced economies in global trade reduced gradually from around 75% to around 60%, while the direction of investment also reversed, as evidenced by the fast accumulation of foreign reserves by the emerging nations.  In the meantime, we would also observe that these and other developing countries have benefited immensely by the prudent policies that they have implemented for the rapid economic development of their emerging economies. These improvements include more disciplined monetary and fiscal policies, more focused institutions, and more responsible financial sector developments. In essence, the recent success of emerging economies could be explained, to a significant extent, by conventional growth theory. Improvements in physical capital stock; improvements in human capital; and improvements in productivity. We all know that according to growth theory, increased GDP growth leads to an increase in per capita incomes, which in turn leads to a significant improvement in the quality of life of people in a country. We also know that, right now, significant growth is taking place. But, will it continue to happen? Can we ensure sustainability of this outcome? Upto what point is it going to be tough for the countries to keep on achieving? Many economic experts believe that the immediate challenge that is before the developing nations is to reach a per capita income target of around US $ 2,500 as quickly as possible. It is no secret that, when a country surpasses a threshold per capita income of around US$ 2,500, it provides a new impetus to policymakers, key stakeholders and the people as a whole, to launch into a new phase of development. Thereafter, the process of development takes place more smoothly and naturally. This is due to several reasons. First, at the new levels of income, a society naturally attains certain standards, including stronger business ethics, better behavioral patterns and wider national integration. Second, at the new levels of income, people are able to plan their investments better, as they can look beyond matching their income with the cost for basics. This includes not only financial investments, but also includes investments in skill and knowledge, upgrading and investing on physical health, both of which boost factor accumulation with less effort. Third, as income levels increase, even a lower growth rate means a higher increase in income in absolute terms.  But, moving towards that magical number is not going to be easy. In today’s trying conditions, it would be even more difficult than in the past when many of the old established advanced nations crossed the magical mark. As we know, many of today’s advanced nations passed that threshold under very different conditions than what the emerging economies are facing today. In fact, during those early days, some of those countries were able to freely utilize the labour and resources of the countries that were colonized by them, and benefit immensely by the fruits of the foreign lands and natural resources. They had to adhere to very few laws and regulations relating to education, training, health or labour practices, or standards on working conditions. There were no environmental laws or treaties, and the environment was often the first casualty in their quest of accumulating wealth.

But, today the situation is completely different. Today, emerging countries are acting in a much more responsible manner in driving their economies forward. In fact, the present day emerging economies are achieving their attractive levels of growth, while adhering to, and respecting international conventions on copyright, anti-money laundering and terrorist financing, environmental, labour, human rights, safety, health, etc., etc. This situation is sometimes forgotten by some of the economic and political analysts, particularly from advanced nations and therefore it may not be too inappropriate to remind the world of this state of affairs, on and off.  All in all, from the point of view of individual developing countries, the most important economic need at present is to maintain the high economic growth momentum that they are currently achieving, in a sustainable manner. Although it had been tough, it is heartening to note that many developing countries have, since of late, been able to do so. But the challenge is becoming more and more intense by the day, and policymakers have to be constantly alert to developments on several fronts simultaneously, in order to continue with the same momentum. Investments have to be boosted; institutions need to be strengthened; infrastructure has to be improved; regulation has to be strengthened. In addition, all this has to happen at the same time. In the meantime, global challenges and risks loom large. Some of the downside risks are so intense and serious that those could even threaten the very foundation of the present growth momentum, and drag the developing nations as well as the entire world economy towards recession! There are many such dangers lurking. The current financial market turmoil could trigger a more pronounced global slowdown. The unbelievably high and volatile oil prices and the resulting inflationary pressures could lead to severe BOP problems, disrupt capital inflows and cause large global imbalances. The aging population, the intensification of resistance to globalization, the havoc that may be caused by global warming and the danger of terrorism could all lead to serious repercussions to the sustainable growth models that the economic planners are attempting to implement. But the good news is that there is sufficient evidence to indicate to us, that many developing countries are implementing a number of structural changes order to face upto these growing threats. Improved monetary and fiscal policies, improved institutions, and better financial systems, etc., are clearly helping to stretch the current positive business cycle, notwithstanding the numerous threats.  However, we must not be complacent. We must not underestimate the recent increased financial market volatility. We must not take the oil shock or the inflation pressures lightly. We must not ignore the imbalances that are being generated by the aging population. We must not think that the resistance to globalization will just fade away. We must not conclude that terrorism is someone else’s problem and therefore it will not affect us. We must not imagine that global warming will impact only a few coastal nations and therefore we will be safe from its effects. In contrast, we must anticipate the threats and prepare ourselves to face it with confidence. Needless to say, if these challenges are not adequately addressed, or faced directly, the fall out could result in serious repercussions that will greatly hamper the continued success of the current expansion. Mr. Chairman, another interesting phenomenon is that, while most countries seem to be growing well at the aggregate level, there are also growing concerns about the equitable distribution of these gains. It is clear that rapid technological progress and continuing globalization of trade and finance have helped to enhance growth and reduce poverty. But the same conditions are also contributing to increasing the concentration of income and wealth, within certain selected groups. In general, owners of capital and scarce skills have been well rewarded, while, less-skilled workers and those with limited access to jobs or finance have enjoyed limited gains. While it is obvious that such an outcome poses serious political risks, even from an economic point of view, inequality raises an economic issue since it implies that human resources are not being productively used. Therefore it BIS Review 29/2008 3 
follows that, unless this imbalance is addressed, it would probably manifest itself in dangerous political upheavals, which could easily negate the economic gains that may have been so painstakingly built up. In recent years, the global expansion has been supported by the ready availability of external financing at relatively reasonable interest rates. Credit has been readily available, particularly as a result of innovations in financial market instruments which were supposed to have improved liquidity and distributed risk better. But those innovative models are today facing increasing pressure, and economic planners are in the process of re-thinking these processes. Therefore, in the near future another serious issue that we may have to face in our effort to achieve sustainability in our growth momentum would be that, over time, global savings may well become more scarce, putting upward pressure on real interest rates. Mr. Chairman, twice during the first half of the last century, the prosperity of the world was severely threatened by devastating world wars. Fortunately for us, the concerted efforts of many statesman-like leaders and other far thinking persons who served in respected international organizations, that danger was averted. Nevertheless the world paid a huge price for that terrible experience. But, today in a different way, the world faces another destructive force of terrorism, which is almost as debilitating as the horrible world wars of the past century. As a result, from the world’s advanced economies to the lesser developed economies, many countries have to face some aspect of terrorism; directly or indirectly. These evil forces, if not eliminated, will soon hamper the global economic growth in many ways. It will destroy physical and human capital. It will weaken infrastructure development and institution building. It will force governments to divert more and more resources to national security and terrorism prevention. It will result in reduced resources that can be channeled to developmental efforts. In that context when we are focusing on sustainable growth, the ill-effects of terrorism must also be clearly identified and we must all take, as well as support, the necessary steps to deal with this threat, both politically and militarily; both locally and internationally; both directly and indirectly; both individually and collectively. The ever increasing oil and energy prices is another serious concern for all economic planners. International prices of oil, as we all know, has increased five-fold during the last 6 years. As the world bravely adjusts daily to these unconscionable and wild increases, the oil producers enjoy the unprecedented gains. In this background, we cannot realistically expect oil prices to reduce in the near future and therefore we would have to consciously brace ourselves to deal with the harmful effects of this highly destructive attack on future growth, if we are to maintain our growth momentum.  As if the of oil shock was not enough, the international commodity prices too, have been rising sharply during the past year or so. This outcome possibly displays how tightly linked the prices of commodities are, to each other. As a result of these increases, which resulted in the global food price index recording a 54% increase over the past year, many countries are now facing their highest recorded inflation figures in the new millennium. China’s inflation in January 2008 was at its highest in 11 years. In Singapore, it was their highest in 25 years. Australia recorded their highest figure in 16 years. We, in Sri Lanka also recorded our highest rate in 18 years while we know Pakistan too is struggling with its inflation, amidst high food prices. In this volatile scenario, the challenge before the emerging countries is how to maintain price stability, without hampering the growth momentum. Unfortunately, in the backdrop of high international oil and commodity prices, there does not appear to be an easy escape route or a quick fix. Worse still, many experts are now proffering the view that the current increases in oil and commodity prices may be a “structural adjustment” rather than just another “supply shock”. If that is the case, the present sky-high prices may not return to their previous low levels. If so, policymakers will have to factor that situation into their future 4 BIS Review 29/2008 
projections. Then the billion dollar question will crop up: What do we do? If we allow domestic prices to adjust in line with the high international prices, we will immediately face high inflation. On the other hand, if we subsidize these commodities using inflationary financing, the result is again, even more high inflation in the future. Not very attractive options! But, countries have to make choices now, particularly because it is highly unlikely that this problem will go away. Mr. Chairman, we have so far discussed at length, the current trends in economic growth, and the challenges that we have to face in our attempts to harness sustainable growth. Now, let us get to an even more critical part of this discussion. How do we continue to harness sustainable growth in our own economies? How do we protect our growth momentum? Before we really get down to discussing the factors surrounding this issue, let us see as to what usually happens in the world when nations are faced with serious threats to their economic well being. In the early 1970s, when oil prices increased sharply, many countries quickly started their own oil exploration and development. When doing so, several oil reserves, which were, up to that time, believed to be uneconomical for development, were suddenly qualifying as being “economical”. In other words, many countries re-positioned themselves to become “net commodity exporters” from being “net commodity importers”, in the face of rising prices. They were quick to understand that such a shift was vital for their future economic development and well being. As in the 1970’s, today too, there is a clear trend where countries are quickly attempting to boost their capacity to produce oil and agricultural commodities. If, as expected, this re-positioning and/or restructuring occurs, and occurs quickly, the current imbalances will be addressed sooner than later. In fact, if we look at the recent increases in bio-fuel production, it has clearly been a case of steady increases in the production of all varieties of oil substitutes, all over the world. In that sense, the current vibrant and challenging economic environment provides new and exciting opportunities to both developing and advanced countries, and many countries seem eager to seize opportunities and implement decisions quickly.  Mr. Chairman, at the same time, we should also probably realize that in our constant search for sustainable growth, the more regular issues that confront emerging economies also need to be addressed appropriately through a series of fundamental policy actions. Let us therefore, for completeness sake, take a quick look at some of those policy actions as well. One, the sound management of risk. As the pace of globalization intensifies and massive flows of capital take place, on-going reforms in regulation and supervision, the development of domestic capital markets, improvement in corporate governance and an adequate and credible legal framework have to take place effectively. Two, the maintenance of sound macroeconomic policies. Sound fiscal and monetary policies leading to low and stable inflation and an environment of exchange rate stability and sustained private sector investment is vital for sustainable development. Three, the implementation of policies that promote domestic savings and investment. It is important to note that while a steady flow of foreign savings is important for emerging markets, efforts to mobilize domestic resources are equally critical for long-term growth. Four, the maintenance of reasonable debt levels so that the repayment capacity of the economy is not compromised, even if some of the major risks were to materialize. Five, the improvement of the quality of information and statistics relating to all sectors of the economy. This policy action ensures the widespread and timely dissemination of information, thereby encouraging robust economic activity. Six, the continuous expansion of trade by lobbying for major changes within the industrialized nations, while promoting greater trade among the emerging economies and within regions. BIS Review 29/2008 5 
Seven, the rapid implementation of consistent and significant poverty reduction programmes and infrastructure development projects so that it provides opportunity and hope to the poor and addresses regional imbalances. Eight, the active use of technology in economic transformation, so that backward societies or groups could “leap-frog” rather than drift along at “snail’s pace”. At the same time, we also have to keep in mind that the sustainability for growth in developing countries will be greatly enhanced by political stability. Therefore, care must be taken to ensure that any political crisis which threatens to undermine economic progress needs to be resolved quickly and satisfactorily, so that the growth momentum will not be hampered in the short to medium terms. Mr. Chairman, we should all be glad that we are today here in Karachi, deliberating on the topic of “Harnessing Sustainable Growth”, because it is a topic that will touch our lives very closely, today as well as tomorrow. In doing so, we will naturally have to closely study the worldwide conditions, trends, needs, challenges, future strategies and the many issues connected to the realization of this outcome. It is certainly a complex topic, and it will not have cut and dried answers; nor will it have an easy path, free of obstacles. At the same time there is one fact that we must all be very clear about. i.e., harnessing growth will only be the beginning. If so, we must all realize that while the beginning would be vital, we would need to methodically build capacity to sustain the growth and to keep going, amidst whatever challenges we may encounter. Implementation of policies would therefore be the key to sustainable growth. People could, of course, eloquently talk of sound monetary policies; effective fiscal policies; well structured private/public partnerships; super regulatory institutions; vibrant markets; skilled managers; technical capabilities; clean environments; safe living conditions; developed infrastructure; speedy justice; transparent systems; stable governments; corruption – free societies; free media; lower crime; balanced development; trickle down effects; equal opportunities; equitable distribution of wealth; good living standards and a whole host of similar outcomes. But, mere talk of such conditions would not lead us to achieve those goals or achieve high sustainable growth. If we are to realize all those outcomes, the continuous implementation and close monitoring and evaluation of all our programmes and policy actions is essential. That then, is the key.  Let us remember that it is better to implement one action than write 100 reports that no one takes notice of. It is better to deliver one outcome than deliver 100 speeches that no one listens to. It is better to improve one life than organize 100 workshops that no one finds useful. It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness! This then, my dear friends, is the challenge that is before us.  Very often, we encounter prophets of gloom and doom who attempt to demoralize us by showing off the magnitude of the problem or by continuously criticizing, or by telling us that we can’t. We should not fall prey to such distractions or falter in the implementation of our policy actions. We must, with conviction and courage, move towards realizing our growth targets, while improving our macroeconomic fundamentals. If we can achieve 8% growth on a continuous basis for 8 or 9 years, we would be in a position to double our per capita income. For a country like Sri Lanka that would mean we would reach a per capita income of around US$ 3,000 by the year 2015, from our current per capita of around US$ 1,600. That is not an impossible dream. Sri Lanka has shown that, with determination and a clear focus, it can be done. In fact, from 2005 to 2007, our per capita income shot up by nearly 30%! These successes can be maintained, but that could only be done with hard work and more hard work.  Mr. Chairman, South Asia, the huge giant, is finally waking up from its’ deep slumber. This giant had been taking a long rest, after enjoying a glorious past. A huge giant cannot stir, without the world around noticing the rumble. All recent indications are that the world is certainly taking note of this re-awakening. It is time for all of us in this region to capitalize on 6 BIS Review 29/2008 
this new visibility. All of us who are in this region know that our destinies are linked. We rise and fall together. Today, we see a clear light at the end of the tunnel and the tunnel is becoming wider and wider, making our journey more exciting and pleasant, but yet tough and adventurous. It is not only in cricket that we are excelling today. We are making our mark on many other areas as well.  Let us then, as a region, take our rightful place in the League of Nations by showing that we can develop economically to reasonable levels quickly and in a sustainable manner. Our people are responding. Our people are becoming more conscious that better living standards are possible. They are increasingly showing that they are prepared to work towards that goal. Our collective work ethic and productivity standards are improving. Let us support and intensify these efforts and amplify the trends. Let us keep the momentum going. Let us implement, implement, and implement! Mr. Chairman, the Global Management Summit organized by you provides an excellent forum for all of us to learn from each other and shape our strategies. Let us use this opportunity to fine-tune our own knowledge and skills and move with confidence towards delivering sustainable growth to our economies and usher better lives for our people. That is my wish for all of us and I am certain that we would have the energy and the resilience to succeed. Thank you. BIS Review 29/2008 7 
Bandid Nijathaworn: Economic volatility in the Year of the Rat Speech by Dr Bandid Nijathaworn, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at a seminar on “Economic Volatility in the Year of the Rat, Fight or Flight”, organised by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Thailand, Bangkok, 6 March 2008. *      *      * Thank you and good evening, Let me begin first by thanking the FCCT for the invitation. It must have been a long while since I last visited or spoke at a FCCT event, so it is good to be back. Tonight’s topic is economic volatility in the year of the Rat. According to Chinese astrology, Rat is an auspicious animal, and the year of the rat is usually a year of plenty, bringing opportunity and good prospects. So, I think we have a good start. And judging from what has been happening, this year looks to be interesting and challenging both for the markets and policymakers. At this time, we are seeing widespread fears of recession in the US, a deepening of the credit problem, and stubbornly high oil prices. These developments are definitely a negative setting for the global economy and financial markets. Tonight, my talk will focus on global economic volatility and possible implications for Thailand. And I want to do this by offering a perspective on how we see things developing from a financial regulator’s point of view. First, the US economy. Latest economic data from the US are not positive. There are more weak numbers than good ones, with signs of economic slowdown becoming increasingly visible. Drawing on the information up to the end of February, the key elements of the latest data include continued correction in the housing market, further fall in consumer confidence, slowdown in consumer spending and private investment, and weaker employment numbers. The good news is that exports in the US are holding up well, and the financial conditions of companies, especially the non-financial companies, are intact. But going forward, the correction in the housing market is likely to continue, which will weigh on economic activities. On the financial market side, things also are not looking up. CDX spread continues to rise, indicating increased risk premium in the CDO market. And as confidence in the market for securitized credit is yet to return, more writedown can be expected. Next, as economic activities in the US slow down, the quality of bank’s other assets such as commercial real estate and consumer loans may come under greater pressure, affecting bank profitability. With profit declining, banks may become more risk averse to protect capital, putting more pressure on credit extension and the real economy. So, latest US data point to a weaker outlook ahead with more downside risks in the near-term. The risks include further correction in the housing market, continued tightening of the credit conditions, and further decline in economic activities. Outside the US, the economic picture looks less negative. While the adjustments in housing market are also ongoing in Europe, and some European Banks have reported losses in CDOs, the impact on economic activities is expected to be more limited. For example, Consensus Forecasts in February, revised downward the Euro Zone’s GDP growth for 2008 by only 0.3 percentage points from December compared with a 0.5 percentage point downward revision for the US. For Southeast Asia, the impact is also forecasted to be limited. Latest consensus forecasts for Southeast Asia’s GDP growth is 5.7 percent for 2008, declining slightly from the forecast of 5.9 percent in December last year. These forecasts, together with the latest data, suggest that, in the short-term, things will likely get worse before they get better, and the slowing of growth in the US will impact growth globally. The key question, at this time, is how deep can things get before we see a turnaround. This is definitely an important, but a difficult question to answer. Market BIS Review 29/2008 1 
participants as usual will have a range of views, and I personally do not intend to offer another prediction. Instead, I want to share with you my thoughts on the current developments and on what this will mean for Thailand. To begin, one context that I think is useful in understanding the current turmoil is the unwinding of the global imbalance, triggered by corrections in the US housing market that began in 2006, and is now ongoing. Such unwinding is a necessary process to clear excesses and reduce financial leverages that have been built up in the form of high level of the US’s current account deficits. Economically speaking, to reduce the deficits, the value of the US dollar needs to fall and the levels of US long-term interest rates need to rise. Exchange rate adjustment is very much ongoing. The US dollar has declined by about 8.0 percent in nominal effective terms since 2006. And reflecting this, the US current account began to show improvements last year, and is expected to improve further as we go forward. Experiences from the recent episodes of current account adjustments elsewhere, including the one here in Thailand after 1997, show that this process of adjustment can be long, with a potential for substantial dislocations to economic activities, especially if proper policies are not put in place. Important in this context is the dynamic of the interactions between the real economy and the financial sector that tend to feed on each other either positively or negatively. Therefore, to address the current challenge, it is important that policymakers pay close attention to this dynamic especially on the issues of liquidity, the health of the banking sector, the conditions for a normalization of business activities, and the ability to service debt by households. In my view, policymakers in the US have moved relatively quickly on all these fronts, which is positive for the markets. Let me turn now to the implications for Thailand. Being a small open economy, Thailand will not be able to avoid the impact of the global slowdown or the increase in economic volatilities. The US now forms about 12 percent of our export markets. As for the direct impact of the sub-prime, the exposure of the Thai banking system to CDO is very limited. Total investment by Thai banks on all CDOs is 0.26 percent of bank’s total asset in June last year, of which 0.03 percent was sub-prime related. Such exposure has declined further in December, and banks that have CDO investments have increased their provisionings accordingly. At the end December last year, the BIS ratio for capital adequacy for the Thai banking system was 14.6 percent, well above the minimum requirement of 8.5 percent. More important concern, however, is the indirect economic and financial impacts through (i) possible exports decline as the result of global economy slowdown, (ii) a tightening of global liquidity, and (iii) possible increase in the volatility of capital flows, as risk is being repriced by global investors. These indirect impacts have a potential to impart more volatility to our markets, depending on the magnitude of the global slowdown. So far, no adverse impact has emerged, but with more downside risk and uncertainty ahead, it is important that one is not complacent and is alert for all possible impacts and outcomes. This point was fully recognized by the Bank of Thailand’s Monetary Policy Committee in its meeting last month. The MPC’s post-meeting statement made clear of the need to monitor the situation in the global market closely so that the stance of monetary policy can be appropriately and flexibly calibrated to ensure price stability and steady growth. Finally, the last point I want to stress is that the ability of the Thai economy to weather external shocks and global slowdown at this time are now much greater compared to the situations say ten years ago. 2 BIS Review 29/2008 
First, the country’s economic fundamentals have improved from the crisis years, with solid external positions marked by current account surpluses, high level of international reserves, and much lower level of external debt. This stronger financial position will enhance the ability of the economy to cushion itself against external shocks. Second, our banking sector is in excellent shape, with good profitability, strong capital base, and improved asset quality. The corporate sector is also in good financial shape with strong earnings and low financial leverage. These qualities will make the private sector more resilient to the impact of economic volatilities from outside. And third, policy regime in Thailand has become more flexible, especially the exchange rate, with market force now playing a dominant role in allocating resources. Such attribute provides the private sector with a mechanism to efficiently adjust to the impact of external shocks. I am confident that these improved fundamentals will help lessen the impact of the global slowdown on the economy, enhance the ability of the private sector to manage and deal with economic volatility, and provide the economy with a strong foundation to continue with stronger growth and stability in the years ahead. This is all I want to say this evening. I hope it has been useful. And I want to end by wishing the year of the Rat to be a year of plenty, bringing opportunities and good prospects to all of you at the FCCT. Thank you. BIS Review 29/2008 3 
Jürgen Stark: Contribution to the session on “Implications for the conduct of monetary policy” Speech by Mr Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the International Symposium on “Globalisation, Inflation and Monetary Policy”, organised by the Bank of France, Paris, 7 March 2008. *      *      * John Taylor has discussed a number of challenges to monetary policy-making in an era of globalisation. In my remarks, I will focus on the implications of globalisation specifically for monetary policy-making in the euro area.1  Globalisation may change the environment for monetary policy-making We all agree that globalisation offers great opportunities. It increases the scope for efficiency gains through specialisation since it allows economies to make better use of their comparative advantage in international production. This reduces production costs and expands the production frontier, generating gains which are passed on to consumers through lower prices for many goods.  Globalisation thus fosters economic prosperity and raises living standards. At the same time, the gains from globalisation may not be distributed evenly, as globalisation can affect differently the returns to different factors of production. 2  To monetary policy-makers, globalisation is important mainly for two reasons:  • First, the process of globalisation itself can occasionally lead to economic disruptions, especially if markets lack transparency. Increasingly-globalised and internationally-integrated financial markets, for example, if not sufficiently transparent, can at times be conducive to excessive risk-taking and contagion effects – a theme that rings particularly true in light of the current financial turmoil.  • Second, and more importantly, increasing global integration induces structural changes in goods markets and financial markets alike. As a result, foreign shocks may have a greater impact on domestic inflation, and the transmission of other impulses to the euro area economy can change. This also applies to the impact of monetary policy on inflation. Let me briefly elaborate on how structural changes, which are driven by globalisation, can affect the process of inflation.  • There is good reason, for instance, to believe that globalisation increases competitive pressures, both worldwide and in domestic markets. An increase in competition may – relative to previous periods – put downward pressure on wages and prices and thus contain inflation for a period of time.3 A structural intensification                                                  1  For stylised facts about trade globalisation and its likely effects on euro area inflation, see also the ECB Monthly Bulletin article entitled “Globalisation, trade and the euro area macroeconomy”, (January 2008). 2  Trade theory (Stolper-Samuelson theorem) would e.g. suggest that trade integration should place downward pressures on the relative return to lower-skilled labour. However, real wage developments have been similar across all skill groups in the euro area. See ECB (2008), op. cit. 3  While globalisation and the disciplining impact that it exerted on pricing and cost control is likely to have facilitated disinflation around the globe in the past ten years or so, globalisation per se cannot permanently reduce inflation. The main reason for the observed spread of low inflation around the globe in recent years is a BIS Review 28/2008 1 
of competition would also induce firms to work harder to increase productivity, and this would translate into an increase in the growth rate of the natural level of output.4  • Beyond this effect, the increasing use of international production opportunities based on comparative advantage may lead to a change in the production structure of our economy, which would in turn alter the relative scarcity of production factors, and thus the response of their prices and the prices of final goods to economic shocks. Thus, globalisation  • is of importance to monetary policy  • and it is likely to have a lasting effect on our economy and on the environment for monetary policy-making.  An initial conclusion therefore is that central banks need to continue to commit resources to analyse and closely monitor the structural changes and the shocks caused by globalisation, and need to build an increasing awareness of economic and financial developments outside their home countries.  Globalisation does not change rules of monetary policy-making Although globalisation is challenging monetary policy, I fully agree with John Taylor’s assessment that globalisation does not fundamentally alter the rules for monetary policy-making. Nowadays as ever, over the medium to longer term, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. This means price stability is for us to achieve. Let me stress the obvious here, namely that central banks cannot permanently determine the relative prices of specific goods. In referring to price stability, we mean stability of the purchasing power (of the domestic legal tender) as measured by the cost of a representative basket of goods. While international liquidity conditions may influence market interest rates and thus the transmission of monetary policy to real activity and inflation, central banks retain the ability to control short-term interest rates by appropriately influencing the supply of the domestic legal tender. Short-term rates in turn work their way into the domestic cost of credit and into long-term interest rates.  Therefore, central banks can ensure price stability in the medium to long-term, even in a financially-integrated world in which production factors and goods move freely, and even if the size of the world economy increases relative to that of the domestic economy.5  But, as I said earlier, as a precondition for successful monetary policy central banks need to properly adapt their analyses to the changing environment. In such an environment, it is clearly important for stability-orientated monetary policy to analyse developments in external prices, in international trade flows and in international financial flows.  This said, I agree with John Taylor that developments in exchange rates per se should not be given any special status but should be taken into account by monetary policy only to the                                                                                                                                                       change in monetary policymaking in many countries, and, more in particular, the change towards a credible commitment to price stability. 4  That is, it would lead to an increase in the rate at which the economy can grow without jeopardising price stability. 5  See, e.g., M. Woodford (2007), “Globalization and Monetary Control,” NBER Working Paper No. 13329, to appear in Galí, J. and M. Gertler eds., The international dimensions of monetary policy, University of Chicago Press. 2 BIS Review 28/2008 
extent that they have a medium-term influence on price stability. This is because another fundamental law of monetary economics is alive and well in the globalised economy: flexible exchange rates are a sine qua non for price stability.  Does a globalised world call for more international monetary coordination? With a growing set of prices and asset valuations being determined internationally, information on international developments is crucial for monetary policy-making. In this light, the financial turmoil in particular has shown the value that growing financial globalisation places on a timely and open international exchange of information among central banks and regulators.  Central banks should therefore cooperate by exchanging information and by designing a solid international financial architecture.  Beyond that, however, the scope for monetary policy-makers to coordinate is limited. This is the case as each central bank has just one policy instrument, and this instrument can only achieve a single domestic objective, price stability. As a consequence, each central bank is well advised to react to foreign developments only if these become relevant for domestic price stability. I therefore fully agree with John Taylor’s conclusion that central banks should not mechanically follow other central banks’ policy decisions.  Not least as a result of this consensus, I question the strong conclusions that John Taylor draws from some of his empirical analysis.  In brief, John Taylor finds that a simple monetary policy rule, also widely referred to as the “Taylor rule”, when applied to the euro area, has residuals that correlate positively with the US federal funds rate. He interprets this finding as implying a leader-follower structure in the sense that US monetary policy induces the ECB to deviate from its objective of price stability out of concern for the exchange rate.  This is not the case. Indeed, a more reasonable explanation for John Taylor’s findings is the following:  Central banks which are concerned with domestic price stability seek to offset potentially destabilising shocks. In a globalised world, though, different central banks naturally respond in part to similar global factors. And, as we know, a number of these factors are not well captured by a mechanical policy rule of the type which John Taylor takes as a benchmark for good monetary policy-making. Adequate policy reactions to global factors, and to the risks that they pose for domestic price stability, will thus show up – within the context of a simple rule – in the residual term.  Some observers, John Taylor included, interpret this residual as a measure of the monetary stance. It may indeed, in some cases, be possible to interpret the residual in this way. However, often the residual is a measure of the lack of explanatory power of the simple policy rule itself. Now, to the extent that economies are structurally different and are hit by shocks with different timings,  • global factors affect these economies with different lags. • As a result, the measures of inflation and the output gap used in John Taylor’s policy rule are also affected with different lags.  • In such a context, monetary policy has to react in a pre-emptive manner to current and future likely developments to ensure domestic price stability over the medium to longer term.  BIS Review 28/2008 3 
• However, such a behaviour might generate a spurious correlation between the residuals of a simple Taylor type policy rule for the euro area and interest rates in other economies.  I suspect that this is what lies behind John Taylor’s result concerning the deviations from a euro area “policy rule” and the US federal funds rate.  Having inside knowledge, I can in fact rule out that John Taylor’s results constitute any sign of a leader-follower structure or any sign of a focus on the side of the ECB on the dollar-euro exchange rate, or in fact on any exchange rate, as a target of policy. Neither is the case. I agree with John Taylor, however, that any development in that direction would be deeply worrying. Only a clear assignment of responsibilities ensures clarity about the central bank’s objective, which is at the heart of successful monetary policy. Yet international complementarities exist in monetary policymaking, to the extent that an international architecture which has each central bank keeping its own house in order is also conducive to an environment of global monetary stability.  Such architecture provides the best basis for a friendly and open exchange of views and information at an international level. Today there is frequent interaction as, for example, the BIS provides a much-appreciated forum for discussion among central bankers. In addition, there are further occasions for fruitful exchanges – this very symposium being one of them. The role of the monetary policy strategy in an increasingly globalised world I have argued that the best international monetary architecture is one in which each central bank focuses on achieving domestic price stability. In practice, even more is needed to guarantee a successful monetary policy. A clear mandate for price stability and a well-defined monetary policy strategy based on this mandate are essential for coping successfully with the analytical and practical challenges which lie ahead. Fortunately, both conditions are in place in the euro area.  A clear mandate for price stability  • ensures that a central bank is fully accountable for achieving price stability. The commitment to price stability which such a mandate generates is, in turn, conducive to anchoring private sector expectations in a lasting way. This anchoring is particularly important if globalisation causes sequences of one-sided shocks to inflation.  • prevents central bank policy from going astray. While John Taylor expresses concerns that central banks may be increasingly tempted to stabilise exchange rates at the expense of price stability, a clear mandate for price stability guarantees that a central bank will not fall into this trap. Instead price stability-orientated central banks do not assign any special role to exchange rates, important as they are as information variables in the economic analysis.  Building on a clear mandate, a successful strategy  • supports accountability.  • ensures a transparent and systematic response to risks to price stability  • guides an effective communication policy,  • and enhances the predictability of monetary policy over the medium to longer term. In this context, any measure of price stability used by central banks must adequately reflect the evolution of the purchasing power of money. Price stability is therefore best defined in terms of the cost of a representative, i.e. broad, basket of goods. An example which provides 4 BIS Review 28/2008 
a clear and assessable yardstick of price stability is the basket underlying the euro area Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices.  This encompassing definition of the underlying basket contrasts with partial, or so-called “core” measures of inflation. While these measures can be useful for assessing risks to price stability, they – if put front and centre – risk providing a distorted view of underlying price developments which would jeopardise the anchoring of inflation expectations. This would be particularly detrimental in situations in which globalisation might induce sustained movements of prices of certain categories of goods.  A broad, transparent and widely accepted yardstick instead creates the necessary clarity to ensure a firm anchoring of inflation expectations. It is this clarity which allows a central bank to adopt a medium-term orientation within which policy-makers can appropriately discount short-term price volatility and transitory movements in inflation. As mentioned, globalisation is likely to change the structure of the euro area economy both with regard to goods markets and financial markets. A strategy which monitors structural changes both from a goods market angle and from a financial or monetary point of view is therefore well-suited to cope with the challenges brought about by globalisation. The complementary perspectives of the economic analysis and the monetary analysis, which underlie the ECB’s “two-pillar strategy”, are conducive to appropriately adapting our policies to the changing environment. At the same time, the two-pillar strategy keeps minds focused on the fundamental laws of monetary economics. In particular, having an explicit monetary pillar guarantees that the ECB always has considerable expertise in the analysis of monetary and credit developments and in the analysis of their impact on price stability. The close link between monetary developments and evolving imbalances in asset and credit markets implies that monetary analysis enables central banks to detect such imbalances at an early stage and to respond to the implied risks to price and financial stability in a timely and forward-looking manner. This has, in the past, proved an invaluable asset for the ECB, notably in times of global financial turbulence.  Just as the two-pillar strategy structures the discussion within the ECB, it also provides the basis for communicating our understanding of the economy to the outside world. By adhering to transparency, the ECB has achieved a high level of predictability for its monetary policy decisions. Our strategy therefore improves our policy effectiveness.  Let me conclude.  1. Especially in an environment of ongoing globalisation, monetary policy must aim to robustly anchor inflation expectations. This requires a permanent alertness to risks to price stability on the side of the central bank, as shocks to inflation must not translate into second-round effects in price-setting and wage-setting.  2. That being said, an efficient adjustment of the economy to macroeconomic shocks can be best facilitated by monetary policy-makers if they keep a firm focus on their domestic price stability objective. In particular, there will be no external stability without domestic price stability. 3. Domestic price stability is a precondition for global monetary stability. Globalisation therefore does not expand the need for international monetary co-operation beyond an open exchange of views and information. The best international architecture is one in which each central bank has a clear mandate to focus on domestic price stability. 4. Greater microeconomic flexibility would not only allow our economy to take better advantage of the opportunities provided by globalisation, but would also facilitate macroeconomic adjustment in the wake of shocks and improve the resilience of the economy. Globalisation therefore intensifies the need for more flexibility in product and labour markets.  BIS Review 28/2008 5 
5. I have argued that a monetary policy strategy which carefully monitors developments in domestic, as well as international, financial and goods markets is well-equipped to cope with challenges that globalisation brings for monetary policy. Such a strategy is in place in the euro area. At the same time, price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to enable the euro area economy to take the full advantage of the opportunities offered by globalisation. 6 BIS Review 28/2008 
Christian Noyer: France’s banking industry in 2007 – key trends Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France and Chairman of the French Banking Commission, at the presentation of the 2007 Annual Report of the French Banking Commission, Paris, 26 June 2008. *      *      * Welcome to the working breakfast organised for the press on the occasion of the publication of the Commission Bancaire’s 2007 Annual Report today. I would like to take this opportunity to speak to you about the major trends seen in the banking industry in 2007. Naturally, the main development last year was the subprime crisis. I will also speak about the lessons learned from the crisis for the future. Even though the French banking system’s overall exposure to the risks revealed by the subprime crisis turned out to be less severe than in other G10 countries, our banking system was still affected, as can be seen in the decline in profitability. On a more encouraging note, however, French banks managed to maintain satisfactory solvency ratios, testifying to the system’s resilience and its ability to cope with a very large-scale and complex crisis. However, in addition to the impact on business conditions, the financial crisis calls for an examination of the robustness of some of the banking activities that developed so rapidly over the last ten years. These activities have complicated the task of risk management in major banking groups. The materialisation of certain risks, the return of volatility on financial markets and uncertainty about the economic outlook have meant that major banks need to make a special effort in three key areas: i) maintaining adequate capital ratios to cushion them from further shocks, which may still occur, ii) strengthening their risk management systems and processes, and iii) pricing credit and liquidity risks appropriately. To explain these developments, I would like to speak to you briefly about the following points. 1. First of all, the French banking system provided proof of its resilience in the face of financial turmoil in 2007. 2. The current economic situation calls for vigilance nonetheless, since banks must be ready to cope with new risks that may occur at any time. 3. Finally, as crisis conditions persist, I should like to talk about the main thrusts of the supervisory authorities’ actions. 1.  The French banking system provided proof of its resilience in the face of financial turmoil in 2007 After posting good performances since 2003, the French banking system was hit by the fall-out from the subprime crisis starting in mid 2007, as were the banking systems in the other leading developed countries. This led to an extended period of strong turbulence. The impact of the crisis on banks’ earnings first shows up in the third quarter financial statements and then more clearly in the fourth-quarter statements. French banks were affected through several channels: • First, through their direct exposures to American households in the subprime category or through indirect exposures in portfolios of structured financial instruments, such as residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) that are in turn exposed to subprime risks. As was the case for the rest of the banking system in Europe, indirect exposures accounted for much greater amounts than direct exposures and therefore for the BIS Review 82/2008 1 
bulk of the losses; the lessons that this situation holds for more refined risk management need to be learned quickly. • Secondly, through exposures to securitisation vehicles (conduits or structured investment vehicles) and particularly through liquidity lines, which need to be managed more rigorously going forward. • Thirdly, through exposures to assets taken back from securitisation vehicles, or even collective investment schemes, that ran into liquidity problems; this type of reintermediation needs to be given more consideration in terms of capital requirements. • Fourthly, through their exposures to monoline insurers, which insured some products and were themselves hard-hit by the crisis and thus epitomise “wrong-way” counterparty risks, which need to be assessed more carefully. • Finally, though exposures to leveraged buy-outs, or more generally by credit-risk-related costs on the most vulnerable companies, which are starting to rise. Consequently, French banks have not escaped the overall slowdown in net banking income growth affecting major international banking groups. The net banking income of the three leading groups using IFRS grew by only 3.8 per cent in 2007, after rising by 18 per cent in 2006. However, the aggregate net profit under French accounting standards for the French banking system in 2007 reached nearly €27 billion, making it possible to generate income that is used in part to strengthen the institutions’ financial foundations, thereby contributing to the financial stability of the Paris market. The diversification of French banking groups’ activities has proven to be a strength. Several business lines are showing positive trends, with further gains in retail banking, which posted growth of 9.1 per cent (particularly in foreign operations, with an increase of 22 per cent compared to 2006), and project financing. Retail banking is still a core business for French banks and it played a critical role in stabilising income sources since the beginning of the financial crisis. Origination of new loans for non-financial agents remained high. Proper pricing of risks according to the credit quality of borrowers is therefore a key issue in France’s highly competitive lending market. By contrast, corporate and investment banking activities had a broadly negative impact on earnings, due to the combined effects of asset impairment and falling profits. Losses from asset management vary more significantly from one institution to another. What can we learn from the major banks’ first quarter earnings in 2008? Earnings are obviously following the same trend as in 2007 and reflect the persistent effects of the risks associated with the subprime crisis, with valuation losses on assets and higher risk-related costs. A compound indicator, such as ROE shows a decline in profitability, but it still stands at an average of 14 per cent, compared to 18.9 per cent for the three largest banking groups in the first quarter of 2007. On this point, I would like to put this decline into context. It follows several years of exceptional profits, which raised questions about their sustainability. Despite declining income, the French banking system is still financially sound: the Tier 1 solvency ratio based on original own funds stood at an average of 7.1 per cent for the three largest banking groups at the end of 2007, much higher than the minimum ratio of 4 per cent set under Pillar 1 of the Basel II Accord. Banks increased their solvency ratios in the first quarter of 2008 and the Commission Bancaire attaches a great deal of importance to this effort. The benefits of business diversification, the effectiveness of the measures taken to limit risk exposures and the satisfactory capital levels have also enabled the major banking groups to remain highly rated by the leading international agencies. 2 BIS Review 82/2008 
2. The current economic situation calls for vigilance nonetheless, since banks must be ready to cope with new risks that may occur at any time. The sources of risks related to the crisis are being closely monitored, but the French banking system, like any other, cannot be fully protected against new negative developments stemming from the crisis. In today’s globalised financial markets, the contagion of financial turmoil can spread through many channels. Therefore, extreme vigilance is called for. For example, let me say a few words about hedge fund risks, since an increase in counterparty risk exposure to these unregulated entities may still occur, and it could be combined with “commodities” risk. In this respect, I would like to stress that it is critical for banks to ensure that their hedge fund exposures are adequately collateralised at all times. I am aware that hedge funds are attractive customers that no credit institution can afford to ignore today, and that prime brokerage activities are a path to growth for many of our institutions. Similarly, no bank can afford to ignore the growth of the financial markets linked to commodities and energy. However, it must not be forgotten that hedge funds are also very active in these highly volatile markets. It is therefore critical to avoid risk concentration and a combination of vulnerabilities stemming from these two rapidly growing sectors. Even though we have not taken a second-round shock to the real economy stemming from the financial crisis as our central scenario for the euro area, a high degree of uncertainty is still the distinguishing characteristic of the banking business in 2008. Banks are obviously faced with solving a complex equation: i) maintaining a positive contribution to net income from financial services and retail banking as risk-related costs rise, ii) controlling the risk profile of corporate and investment banking activities, while maintaining a good profitability level, iii) coping with the impact of the aftershocks of the crisis on banks’ balance sheets. In this regard, let me stress liquidity management, as market conditions remain tense, with the attendant consequences for management of hedging transactions more generally. On this last point, I should add that their diversified business model means that French banks are not among the most dependent on market financing. Therefore, the leading French banking groups were able to manage their liquidity needs effectively, even during the periods of greatest tension on the markets. Yet, the tightening-up of access to liquidity in the wake of the crisis did show how critical risk management has become. 3.  As crisis conditions persist, I should like to talk about the main thrusts of the supervisory authorities’ actions. We have always maintained that the practical implementation of the new Basel II solvency ratio would primarily ensure that banks measure their risks more accurately both in ordinary times as well as during crises. The new Basel II framework has been a reality in France since the beginning of the year. It is noteworthy that a large proportion of French banks use “internal-ratings based” approaches to credit risk. Such approaches were used for more than 80 per cent of the relevant banking assets at 1 January 2008. I would also like to point out that the impact of Basel II on credit institutions’ capital goes beyond the capital requirement calculation stipulated in Pillar 1 (even though it provides more comprehensive coverage than Basel I of new risks, such as securitisation activities). Regarding Pillar 2, the new regulations call for major additional arrangements to refine banks’ risk management and planning for capital cushions. This could lead to additional capital requirements, or other appropriate measures to enhance bank stability by considering risks that are not dealt with or are inadequately dealt with under Pillar 1. By the end of the year, this approach should lead to individual ratios for each institution that the Commission Bancaire sets on the basis of structured dialogue with each institution. BIS Review 82/2008 3 
We have also undertaken a series of major actions that are directly in line with the general framework of the recommendations made by the Financial Stability Forum. Many spheres of action have been defined, but I would like to speak about three that I think are priorities, starting with transparency and valuation, followed by adapting the capital requirements set by Basel II for certain instruments, and finally, liquidity risk. First of all, enhancing transparency and financial disclosure was quickly identified as one of the key requirements for ending the crisis. We have urged French banks, in conjunction with the national institute of statutory auditors, the CNCC, to provide detailed disclosures of their subprime exposures. A joint working group made up of staff from the Commission Bancaire, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers and the French Banking Federation has defined best practices in this area. Institutions have started implementing them in a satisfactory manner and practices should be further improved in the financial statements for first-half 2008. In 2009, the Basel Committee is planning to publish recommendations on information to be disseminated under the requirements of Pillar 3 of Basel II. In-depth discussions with banks led to a convergence of practices for asset valuation, including the priority on relying on prices and directly observable market data. Where banks have had to use valuation models because liquid prices disappeared in some markets, the recommendations deal with consideration of all risks – including liquidity risk and counterparty risk – and the rigorousness of the process for determining such prices. With regard to adapting the Basel II requirements, we are also playing a very active role in the various international working groups led by the Basel Committee to give greater consideration, where necessary, to the capital requirements related to some liquidity lines or to the securitisation rules. Finally, the crisis has highlighted the need for banks to improve their analysis, measurement and management of liquidity risk. A review of how refinancing risk could arise across all of a bank’s business lines is a priority; as is an analysis of how refinancing risk interacts with market risk, credit risk and concentration risk. The Committee of European Banking Supervisors and the Basel Committee, at the global level, are currently reviewing the principles governing liquidity risk management. On a final note, I would like to add that the crisis has highlighted the need to enhance internal control systems and to improve the circulation of information about risks, especially for senior managers. The exceptional case of fraud affecting Société Générale has strengthened our resolve in this matter. In France, this should lead to the amendment of Regulation 97.02 on internal control, with provisions on managing operating risk, along with specific efforts to fight fraud. This reform is connected to moves to ensure greater involvement of banks’ highest governance bodies in monitoring their internal control systems. All these initiatives draw on the lessons learned from the past, but they are also forward-looking. Their purpose is to establish the principles of risk management. These principles do not eliminate all risks, but they enhance the resilience of the system when tensions do emerge. This is the objective of the reforms, which I am sure will contribute to greater financial stability in the long run. * * * The Commission Bancaire therefore intends to continue its action to enhance management and control of these risks, not only within France but at the international level as well, naturally, within a European banking supervision structure that emphasises real convergence in supervisory practices. The practical implementation of supervisory colleges needs to be stepped up in order to achieve this objective. Supervisory colleges are the keystone for the supervision of large cross-border groups in Europe. The resolutely European thrust of our action, which is naturally in line with the international development of banking activities and of the sources of vulnerability for financial 4 BIS Review 82/2008 
stability, will lead to the incorporation of a European convergence objective into the mandates of domestic supervisors. From my point of view, this objective will be a major motivation for the supervisory community as a whole. BIS Review 82/2008 5 
Durmuş Yılmaz: Global challenges and local response – monetary policy in Turkey  Address by Mr Durmuş Yılmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at a congress organised by the Turkish Economic Association and the International Economic Association, Istanbul, 25 June 2008. *      *      * Dear Guests, First of all, I would like to welcome you all to Turkey. I am delighted to be here to address such a distinguished audience in Istanbul. I would like to thank the Turkish Economic Association and the International Economic Association for organizing this Congress. Let me start my talk with the words of Josiah Charles Stamp, one of the former governors of the Bank of England in 1920s: “It is easy to dodge our responsibilities, but we cannot dodge the consequences of dodging our responsibilities.” This quote will also be the theme of my speech today. Distinguished Guests, Although globalization had started in the second half of 1980’s, it has not yet reached its peak and we are still witnessing its evolution. As Thomas Friedman’s once said, globalization is making the world flatter. We witnessed record high growth rates around the world in that period; although there was also notable variation in the growth performances across countries. It will not be wrong to argue that globalization could be a powerful tool that may contribute to sustained development if it is combined with compatible policies. However, we should also keep in mind that globalization also presents some challenges and thus, it has made the job of policy-makers more difficult. Firstly, I would like to underline the concept of financial globalization. Thanks to financial liberalization and improvements in information and communication technologies, significant amount of capital has been flowing into developing countries, especially to those that offer high growth potential – helping these countries achieve relatively high growth levels. In the post-war period when globalization was not a popular buzzword, high growth rates were also observed in a number of countries, usually in the South Asia. However, these countries had something in common, which was high rates of savings. In countries like Turkey, where more than half of the population is 30 years old or younger and where savings rates are comparatively low; foreign savings, and therefore capital inflows are needed to maintain high levels of growth. In this respect, financial globalization has contributed to the convergence process among countries. Financial liberalization has also led to amplification of new and more complex financial products. As a side effect, these financial products have introduced new risks and fragilities to the financial markets. As financial markets have gradually become more integrated, the concept of financial stability has started to receive more attention and become one of the priorities of central banks. Therefore, it is not surprising that the systemic problems that emerged in the US sub-prime housing loans in the second half of 2007 and gradually spilled over to other credit markets have given enormous anxiety to policy makers. In this context, central banks have engaged in closer cooperation and information sharing with each other to address these challenges. The recent crisis in financial markets is likely to have significant repercussions over the real economy and the most obvious victim is the economic growth. A marked slowdown in BIS Review 82/2008 1 
developed countries is expected. Part of the current debate is whether developing countries could escape from a sharp slowdown in the industrialized world. Some argue that they can, thanks to progress in macroeconomic stability and structural reforms in recent years. We still do not know whether they are right. Another aspect of globalization is the huge volume of international trade, which has led to considerable convergence in business cycles across countries. Integration of previously-closed economies, like China, India and Eastern European, to international markets has led to an economic boom in the world economy, which was mostly anti-inflationary – until most recently. Needless to say, record increases in commodity prices in the last two years have created doubts in our minds about the sustainability of this anti-inflationist growth process in the near future. Dear Guests, We are currently facing significant inflationary pressures on a global scale due to record high increases in commodity prices. The surge in inflation rates has become a major challenge that threatens price stability in many countries. I would like to give you a few examples. Between 2006 and 2008, eighteen developing countries have implemented inflation-targeting regime. In 2006, the end-year inflation was within the target band in twelve of these countries. In 2007, this number dropped to five. By May 2008 only one of these 18 countries (Brazil) has succeeded to keep inflation within the target band. In the remaining 17 countries, including Turkey, inflation is outside the target band. Developed countries are also experiencing a similar problem. By May 2008, only in one of the eight developed countries the inflation rate is still within the band – and that country is Canada, by the way. Average inflation throughout the world has increased one-fold to seven percent over the last 12 months. Inflation in developed countries has reached its highest level of the last eighteen years. For the first time in many years, inflation figures of the developing countries are in two digit levels. In this period central banks have adopted different approaches for fighting inflation. One reason of this divergence is the difference between the objectives of central banks. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, with ultimate goals of price stability, financial stability and full employment, lowered interest rates by 325 basis points between September 2007 and June 2008 due to severe problems in the financial system. The European Central Bank, on the other hand, has followed a more hawkish attitude and focused on attaining its primary objective, which is price stability. The disparity between the consumption patterns is another factor causing divergence in monetary policies. In comparison to the industrialized world, food expenditures in developing countries constitute a larger share in the basket of consumer prices. That is why increases in food prices typically lead to higher increases in the inflation rates of developing countries. This is one of the reasons why central banks of developing countries focus more on price stability and display a tighter monetary policy stance in recent months. To put it in figures, since mid-2007, policy rates in sixteen major developing countries have increased by 110 basis points on average – in contrast to developed countries where policy rates have been cut by 98 basis points on average. The exchange rate regime also affects the conduct of monetary policy. As you may all know, many developing countries peg their currencies against the US dollar or the Euro. As the US dollar has lost value against many currencies in recent years, this has led to sharp increases in the inflation rates of those economies whose currencies are pegged to the US dollar. In the period of January 2006 to May 2008, inflation rates of countries whose currencies are pegged to the US dollar have increased three-fold to 15.1 percent from 3.9 percent. Inflation rates of countries whose currencies are pegged to the Euro rose to 10.2 percent from 4.4 percent. In this period, countries that avoid the nominal appreciation of their currencies have only exacerbated the inflationary effects of supply shocks. The necessary adjustments in real exchange rates have taken place through the rise general price level. 2 BIS Review 82/2008 
Until recently, the common view among central banks of developed countries was to give priority to problems in financial markets in absence of inflationary pressures. However, they have slowly acknowledged the fact that the increase in inflation has reached critical levels. Accordingly, with uncertainties in financial markets diminishing, the FED and the ECB have hinted that they may resort to monetary tightening in the near future in the face of rising inflation. What should be the best reaction of monetary policy under these circumstances? Although the factors causing higher inflation are presumed to be exogenous and beyond the control of central banks, there is a lot of controversy on this issue. But before going into detail, let me question the validity of this debate first, because to what extent the increase in commodity prices is supply-driven is questionable in the first place. Certainly, there are structural reasons behind the recent run-up in food and energy prices. However, it is also undeniable that there are significant demand-driven pressures over commodities. Loose monetary policies adopted in early 2000s certainly played a key role, together with excess liquidity in the financial system. Another culprit is high subsidies provided by many governments in the developing world to at least partially protect consumers from the cost of high food and energy prices. Fast-forwarding to the recent period, the observation that the central banks of developed countries still keep real interest rates negative in the face of financial risks may hamper a correction in commodity prices. On the other hand, many developing countries, mainly China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Egypt have decided to gradually reduce subsidizing energy prices and pass the true cost to consumers. This is a favorable development that will eventually help to control demand pressures on commodities. Dear Guests, As you may all know, the commonly accepted practice in inflation targeting regime is that monetary policy should not react to supply-driven shocks that are temporary in nature and should allow temporary increases in inflation in the short-term, unless they create deterioration in inflation expectations. Otherwise, undesired fluctuations might arise in economic activity and relative prices. The increase in commodity prices would trigger a self-correcting mechanism. By changing the relative prices, it would provide valuable information on how the resources of the economy should be distributed. While high food and energy prices curb consumption on these products, they would also encourage investment and increase supply in the long-term. In short, the common view is that central banks have nothing to do but wait for the supply-driven shocks to work out their natural course. However, in the current environment where persistent and rapid increases in food and energy prices have been observed for a considerable period, the prevalence of this view has become questionable – especially in the light of current projections that foresee even higher prices in the near future. As a matter of fact, many countries under inflation targeting regime now project that inflation will converge to the target at end-2009 or in 2010, at the earliest. Going through a long period of high inflation is a serious risk for price stability. First, the general price level may shift upwards at a faster rate, as producers and workers in other sectors ask for higher prices and wages in response to the loss of their real purchasing power. The fall in real interest rates due to deterioration in inflation expectations is another risk, since lower real rates will lead to a faster pace of credit expansion. The common factor of these two risks is that persistent supply shocks may turn into demand shocks after a while. Thus, at some point, central banks have to decide to what extent they can tolerate the rise in inflation. As the famous philosopher Karl Popper put it while defining the demarcation problem, “if we do not demarcate a scientific hypothesis, we will be leaving out one of the key steps in verifying the correctness of that hypothesis”. Any theory should be formulated in a way to allow falsification; the circumstances under which the theory fails should be identified. BIS Review 82/2008 3 
Advocators of a “wait-and-see” approach in the face of supply shocks are not clear on the question of when the supply shock ends and when demand-driven price increases take its place, in an environment where inflation keeps rising. If this issue is not clarified, any above-target inflation figure or any upward revision in inflation forecasts can easily be attributed to supply-side factors. Clear lines should be drawn as to which economic data would refute this discourse and what would constitute a limit to supply shocks from a central banker’s point of view. Dear Guests, In this part of my speech, I would like to discuss recent developments in the Turkish economy and the monetary policy implemented in this period. I believe that starting this evaluation with the developments in 2006 will be more useful in providing a better understanding of the current monetary policy stance. As you may know, in May 2006 risk perceptions for developing countries changed significantly owing to the deterioration in global liquidity conditions. In the period where the supply-side shocks started to take their toll on inflation, the rapid depreciation of Turkish lira led to a significant deterioration in medium and long-term inflation expectations – giving rise to the risk of potential second-round impacts. The Central Bank of Turkey responded to these developments with a rapid and strong monetary tightening. This strong monetary tightening was a necessary policy stance for keeping inflation expectations in check and making inflation converge to the target in the medium term. Thus, policy rates were raised by a total of 425 basis points in June and July 2006. At the same time, the excessive liquidity in the overnight market was cut down via open market operations and foreign exchange sales. These measures soon proved to be effective. The acceleration of inflation stopped in the third quarter of 2006, followed by a marked decline in inflation rate starting from the second quarter of 2007. Favorable developments in the services sector, which had recorded significant price rigidities in the past, were particularly noticeable. As you may know, bringing down services inflation takes longer compared to goods inflation, owing to structural factors such as lack of competitive pressures, high share of labor costs in the production function, and backward-looking pricing behavior. Against this background, it is a favorable development that services inflation declined to single digit levels for the first time in mid-2007, after hovering around 14 percent even in the 2004-2005 period where consumer price inflation came down to single-digit figures. The year 2007 was a time when the effects of unfavorable developments in food and energy prices became visible. Nevertheless, uncertainties over the persistence of supply-side shocks in the future and the marked slowdown in core inflation indicators created a favorable environment for a gradual ease in monetary tightening. In this framework, the Central Bank initiated a measured rate-cut cycle in September 2007 and cut interest rates by a total of 225 basis points within a six-month period. By end-2007, consumer inflation had reached 8.4 percent, exceeding the 4-percent target. However, the fall of core inflation (which excludes items beyond the control of monetary policy such as food and energy) to 4.8 percent confirmed that the monetary tightening implemented in 2006 was the right policy choice. During this period, domestic demand and capacity conditions also continued to support the disinflation process. In early 2008 the supply side shocks in food and energy prices started to exert significant inflationary pressures, as they reached unprecedented levels above and beyond expectations. For instance, October 2007 Inflation Report, based on forecasts of international agencies, had foreseen oil prices around USD 70 per barrel in 2008 and a gradual correction in food prices. In other words, it was assumed that supply side shocks would be temporary and that they would lose impact after a while. These forecasts were in line with pricing in forward and futures markets. However, these expectations did not materialize. Both crude oil prices and agricultural commodity prices continued to rise. The adverse impacts of supply shocks reached unprecedented levels during the first half of 2008. 4 BIS Review 82/2008 
Under normal circumstances, supply shocks are expected to have a temporary impact on relative prices, not changing the course of medium-term inflation. Nevertheless, the emergence of multiple shocks at the same time and their persistence for a considerable period aggravated the risks on pricing behavior. In fact, the research conducted by the Central Bank staff indicates that economic agents increasingly focus on past inflation while forming their inflation expectations. After evaluating the said developments, the Central Bank concluded that the increases in food and energy prices in recent years reflect a structural change stemming from the global economic environment. In other words, these shocks are likely to prevail for a longer time period, contrary to previous forecasts. There is no clear evidence at this point that this trend will reverse in the short term. Moreover, our revised projections suggest that even with the maintenance of a cautious policy stance for the foreseeable future, reaching the 4 percent target is going to take an extended period of time. Dear Guests, Under these circumstances, the Central Bank of Turkey had two options. The first one was to stick to the inflation targets, as many central banks do today, but to avoid implementing a monetary policy that is consistent with these targets. In other words, the Central Bank would accept a priori that inflation would surpass the target in the foreseeable future. The absence of any policy response would be justified by the presence of supply side shocks. The central banks that adopt this approach are bound to lose their credibility gradually, as long as the inflation continues to remain above the targets. The second option involves revising inflation targets to an attainable level and implementing a monetary policy that is in line with the new targets without compromise. That would help control economic uncertainties and create a new anchor to be used by economic agents in their decisions. Dear Guests, In light of these evaluations, the Central Bank of Turkey announced the framework of its monetary policy for the upcoming period in the April 2008 Inflation Report and in the letter on inflation targets that was sent to the Government on June 3, 2008. The first pillar of the monetary policy framework is the target revision. The main purpose of the target revision is to create an achievable disinflation path that can be taken as reference by economic agents and that would take us to our price stability objective in the medium term, which is an inflation rate of 4 percent. As you may know, Turkey has not witnessed low single-digit inflation figures for nearly half a century. This has adversely affected the expectations for attaining the 4 percent inflation target. Furthermore, overshooting the inflation targets in 2006 and 2007, and recent supply shocks have elevated expectations even further. Hence, the new targets announced on June 3, 2008 aim to create a new anchor for economic agents, that is attainable. At this point, I would like to emphasize that the nature of these new targets differ remarkably from those set for the 2006-2008 period. The Central Bank will treat the revised targets asymmetrically. In this framework, in the upcoming period, the Central Bank will prefer an inflation that stays below targets rather than otherwise. Accordingly, better than expected outcomes in food and energy prices or in other global factors will be perceived as an opportunity to bring down inflation faster than that is implied by the revised target path. Should the upside risks materialize; monetary policy will be conducted so as to minimize any upside deviation of inflation from the revised targets. Target revision is the solution that is provided by our Bank to the aforementioned “problem of demarcation”, which is faced by almost all central banks today. However, the revision will work only if necessary policy stance is adopted. For this reason, the second pillar of monetary policy comprises the implementation of a monetary tightening that is consistent with the new inflation targets. Newly set targets are references that would help decision BIS Review 82/2008 5 
makers in the economy understand the reasoning behind the policy stance, i.e. the factors that have led to monetary tightening and the extent of monetary tightening if and when necessary. In other words, the Central Bank has announced, via the target revision, the limits of its tolerance to the first round impacts of supply side shocks. Dear Guests, In this part of my speech, I would like to cover the Central Bank’s reasons for implementing a measured course of monetary policy tightening, in further detail. Obviously, interest rate decisions are not taken in order to curbe hikes in food and energy prices. It is not possible to control direct effects of supply side shocks with monetary policy tools. The Central Bank has been implementing a monetary tightening to offset the secondary effects of supply shocks. Since domestic demand is growing at a moderate pace at the moment, it has been curbing the pass through from cost-push factors. As a matter of fact, the prices of products that do not use food or energy as main inputs have been rather well behaved compared to the prices of products that have food or energy as inputs. However, the fact that first round effects of the supply side shocks have reached unprecedented levels has been affecting inflation expectations adversely. Monetary policy cannot remain indifferent in case of a deterioration in the overall pricing behavior. If supply side shocks last long, their effects will spill over to the other sectors in the economy. A tighter stance is a must in order to control the expectations and to prevent the mutation of supply side shocks into demand shocks. If monetary policy does not react to the disruption in inflation dynamics, supply side price hikes may, after a certain point, easily evolve into a self-feeding vicious circle. Dear Guests, Why did the Central Bank not repeat the strong monetary tightening policy that it had implemented in 2006, but instead opted for a measured and gradual increase in interest rates in 2008? The current conditions differ from the May 2006 fluctuation. Prominent reasons for the disruption in inflation dynamics in May 2006 were the significant depreciation of the Turkish lira due to the deterioration of risk perceptions in an environment where domestic demand was strong and the impact of the exchange rate pass-through on prices as well as increases in non-processed food prices were high. The Central Bank’s response was a rapid and strong monetary tightening aimed to overcome the deterioration in inflation expectations in that period – so that economic units would continue to take the inflation target as a reference in their decisions. Today, the primary cause of the lasting deterioration in inflation outlook is the presence of significant supply side shocks .As I have mentioned previously, the Central Bank’s projections suggest that it will not be possible to bring inflation back to 4 percent in the short-term even with a sustained maintenance of the tight monetary policy stance. In this case, a strong reaction by monetary policy, as was the case in 2006, would not ensure the convergence of inflation to 4-percent target in the short-term, but would create undesired fluctuations in economic activity and relative prices. It should be kept in mind, however, that the inflation expectations will deteriorate further in the absence of a reaction by the Central Bank. The current path of core inflation indicators demonstrates that the sharp increases in food and energy prices have started to adversely effect pricing behavior. The core inflation indicator that excludes food and energy prices rose to 6.3 percent as of May. Put differently, there is the risk that the deterioration in pricing behavior might spread to other sectors of the economy. This situation necessitates a measured, gradual and predictable phase of monetary tightening. The measured and gradual nature of monetary tightening is important in face of an already moderating economic growth while having a monetary tightening that is predictable is important to prevent undesired fluctuations in financial markets. 6 BIS Review 82/2008 
Dear Guests, I would like to stress once more. Macro-economic stability is one of the key inputs of sustainable economic growth. Macro-economic stability cannot co-exist with high inflation. Countries that concede higher inflation for the pursuit of economic growth in the short-term are bound to be deprived of both in the medium-term. Policies to attain price stability will entail a cost in the short-term. We need to pay this cost to achieve price stability and ensure sustainable and high growth rates. If we hesitate today and step back from our ultimate target of price stability, we will still face similar problems in the near future, but possibly in worse circumstances. In conclusion, disinflation in Turkey is an on-going process. The disinflation process was disrupted over the past two years due to the extraordinary effects of supply side shocks and inflation targets were overshot considerably. In this environment, the Central Bank of Turkey has made necessary assessments and reacted accordingly. Within the framework of the monetary policy adopted recently, the target has been revised. This is our response to the question of to what extent the Central Bank of Turkey may allow for supply side shocks. Monetary tightening consistent with the target constitutes the second pillar of this policy. If we foresee any deviation of inflation outlook from the target, the necessary policy action will be taken without any hesitation or delay. As you remember, I started my speech with the words of Charles Stamp, former Governor of the Bank of England: “It is easy to dodge our responsibilities, but we cannot dodge the consequences of dodging our responsibilities.” The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey will not dodge its responsibilities. In this environment of massive global challenges, we perceive the new inflation targets as attainable. All the existing monetary policy tools in hand will be utilized decisively and without any hesitation in order to attain these targets. While concluding my speech, I would like to extend my thanks to the Turkish Economic Association and the International Economic Association, and all other institutions and individuals who contributed to the organization of this significant event. Thank you. BIS Review 82/2008 7 
Donald L Kohn: Global economic integration and decoupling Speech by Mr Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 26 June 2008. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. *      *      * During the past decade, one of the most prominent themes sounded by policymakers, observers, and analysts of international economic developments has been "globalization." Based on rapid advances in trade, finance, transportation, and communications, the world economy has become increasingly tightly knit. Large numbers of the world's population – including those in China, India, and the former Soviet Union – have emerged from their relative isolation to participate more fully in the global economic system. The impression has been that national borders and regional differences are becoming less and less relevant as businesses increasingly operate in a single global market.  In the past year or so, however, especially as the housing sector in the United States slowed sharply and turmoil erupted in many financial markets, a different theme has come to the foreground: "decoupling." This term refers to apparent divergences in economic performance among different regions of the world economy. First, there has been a perception that the business cycles of the United States and other industrial economies are becoming less synchronized, with the U.S. economy weakening more sharply than many other industrial economies over the past several quarters. Second, decoupling is often used to refer to the fact that economic growth in the emerging market economies is holding up, even as growth slows substantially in the United States and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the industrial world. Finally, and as a related point, observers point to the fact that even as the financial markets of many industrial countries have been roiled by the turmoil that emerged last August, conditions in the traditionally volatile financial markets of emerging market economies have proved surprisingly resilient.  In my talk today, I would like to address two questions: First, is the world economy genuinely experiencing divergences in economic and financial performance being described as "decoupling"? And second, if true, can we reconcile the perception that globalization has made economies increasingly interlinked with the suggestion that the most recent U.S. slowdown has not been matched by slowing elsewhere to the extent that we have seen in recent cycles?1  Global integration through trade and finance Undoubtedly, economies have become more integrated in recent decades. For example, U.S. imports of goods and services have risen relative to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), from 10 percent in the second half of the 1980s to nearly 18 percent today. U.S. trade with other industrialized countries has more than doubled over this same period.                                                  1  The views I express are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Board of Governors. Shaghil Ahmed, Steven Kamin, and Michael Leahy, of the staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Linda Goldberg, of the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, contributed to these remarks. BIS Review 82/2008 1 
Industrialized country trade with emerging market economies has experienced a far more dramatic increase.2  These increases in trade are the natural result of various forces. Transport costs have been a big factor. Air shipping costs have declined over time, although some of this has been eroded recently with greater security costs and the rise in fuel prices. Costs of ocean shipping have come down, due to containerization, bulk shipping, and other efficiencies.3 Policy-induced barriers, such as tariffs and other means of restraining international trade, also have declined, with progress especially marked in developing Asia and in Eastern Europe after the breakup of the Soviet Union.  Additionally, information about production opportunities in foreign countries has become easier to attain, promoted in part by immigrants and multinational companies facilitating networking and by the enhanced availability of information through the Internet. These developments have led to expanded trade in traditional manufactured goods, but also have led to an expanded breadth of types of traded goods and especially services. As a consequence of these developments, internationally integrated production has risen. From the U.S. perspective, this rise has primarily occurred through growth in the import share of intermediate inputs used across all private industries. In the last decade alone, the imported input share rose from around 8-1/4 percent in 1997 to 10-1/2 percent by 2006.  The international movement of workers leads to macroeconomic consequences, particularly for smaller developing countries. In 2007, an estimated $240 billion in remittances went to developing countries, more than double the flow in 2001. These remittances represent a significant source of developing country income and broaden the scope for cyclical spillovers.4  Another area of impressive growth in international linkages has been in financial services. We've seen increased cross-listings of stocks and more cross-border ownership and control of exchanges, banks, and securities settlement systems. Outside of the United States, in 1997, 15 percent of the assets in private equity portfolios were in foreign equities. A decade later, this share has risen to 24 percent. For U.S. investors, the comparable shares grew from 9 percent of total equity portfolios to 19 percent. Bond portfolios have also become more international, especially for foreign investors. While financial integration has occurred globally, this growth has been uneven. Integration among industrialized countries, measured by the ratio of the sum of their foreign assets and liabilities to GDP, has tripled since 1990, while an analogous measure for emerging and developing economies has increased only about 50 percent.5  One result of this financial integration is that the financial channels are growing in importance in the transmission of shocks between economies.6 The extent of this integration has become painfully evident to investors and financial institutions during the current episode of financial turmoil, with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the United States spreading losses and funding pressures to many corners of the globe.  Recent analysis of the size and sources of spillovers between the United States, the euro area, Japan, and other industrial countries finds a central role for international trade. But                                                  2  Data from 1986 compared with 2007 (International Monetary Fund, 1986-2007). 3  Hummels (forthcoming). 4  Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (2008); also see The World Bank (2005). 5  Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007). 6  Imbs (2004) shows that financial integration raises business-cycle synchronization among a sample of industrialized countries, even though financial integration leads countries to be more specialized. 2 BIS Review 82/2008 
spillovers also occur through commodity prices and through financial variables such as short- and long-term interest rates and equity prices.7 For example, when liquidity conditions tighten in one country, globally active banks may attempt to pull liquidity from overseas affiliates, reducing the liquidity consequences at home but simultaneously transmitting the shock abroad.8 What is particularly interesting is that in some cases, financial linkages might now be more important for transmission than the traditional trade linkages.  Decoupling during the recent U.S. slowdown I turn now to evidence regarding decoupling during the recent U.S. slowdown. Part of the reason the hypothesis of decoupling has gained so much traction is that the economies of the world had appeared particularly "coupled" during the last major downturn in the United States, the high-tech slowdown in 2001 and 2002. Over the two years prior, during 1999 and 2000, quarterly real GDP growth in the United States averaged about 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate; U.S. growth then slowed sharply to about 1 percent during 2001 and 2002 before recovering over the subsequent two years. In other major industrialized countries, average growth slowed similarly, but the recovery was slower.9 In the emerging market world, economic growth moved in tandem with U.S. growth, falling from more than 6 percent to about 3-1/2 percent, then recovering to more than 6-1/2 percent.10What about our more recent experience? During the first three quarters of 2007, the U.S. economy was growing at a solid pace of about 3 percent at an annual rate. Over the next two quarters, U.S. growth slowed to an average of about 3/4 percent, while growth in other industrialized countries stayed much closer to trend rates at about 2-1/2 percent, and growth in the emerging market economies, at 6-1/2 percent, held up quite well.  It is important to keep in mind, however, that we are still in the midst of the current episode. Financial markets remain stressed; housing markets in many countries are adjusting after a sharp run-up in prices; and the effects of the turmoil on economic activity in the United States and elsewhere are still working themselves out. Accordingly, it is too early to tell how correlated U.S. and foreign activity will have been in this period. One piece of research on business cycles in G-7 economies, done by staff at the Federal Reserve Board, shows how difficult it is to establish with any confidence that business cycles have become more synchronized in recent decades, despite trade and financial integration having clearly increased.11 Other research, which shows a modest convergence of business cycles across a larger group of industrial economies, fails to find an increase in the correlation of industrial country cycles with emerging market economy cycles.12                                                 7  Bayoumi and Swiston (2007); International Monetary Fund (2007). 8  Cetorelli and Goldberg (2008) provide evidence of this transmission by globally active U.S. banks. 9  The industrialized-country aggregate referred to here is a weighted average of the real GDP growth rates of Canada, Denmark, the euro area, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The weights are proportional to U.S. dollar-denominated GDP computed at market exchange rates. Growth in industrialized countries went from about 3-1/2 percent to 1-1/2 percent, then recovered only to 1-3/4 percent. The recovery in the other industrialized countries took longer than in the United States, with growth picking up further after 2004, but the pattern was broadly similar. 10  The emerging market economies aggregate is based on the real GDP growth rates of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela with the same weighting scheme as that used for industrial countries. 11  Doyle and Faust (2005). 12  Kose, Otrok, and Prasad (2008). BIS Review 82/2008 3 
The other dimension of recent linkages is financial, where the evidence is clearer. First, few question the importance of financial linkages between the United States and other industrial economies, which is an area where decoupling clearly has not occurred during the recent episode. While industrial country markets for stocks and bonds have displayed a high degree of co-movement for years, in the current episode we are seeing notable new correlations across money markets, with disruptions in funding markets showing up in the euro area, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Canada, as well as in the United States. Some of the effects of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis on financial markets in these countries occurred as a result of direct or indirect balance sheet exposures by their financial institutions to U.S. securities. Other adverse consequences for foreign financial institutions occurred when entire markets, such as that for asset-backed commercial paper, became impaired. In contrast, some have pointed to the apparent resilience of financial conditions in emerging market economies during the past year as an example of decoupling. In particular, the disruptions in the advanced economies have had only limited impacts on money markets in emerging market economies, and other financial market indicators in emerging market economies appear to have held up relatively well. For example, the spreads of emerging market sovereign bond yields over U.S. Treasury securities have risen since June of last year, but by only about 1/3 of the rise in the average U.S. corporate high-yield spread over U.S. Treasury securities. That rise is roughly half the average in several previous episodes of pressure on U.S. corporate bond prices over the period from 1998 to 2005; these episodes include, among others, the Russian and Long-Term Capital Management crisis of 1998, the 2002 surge in corporate defaults and bankruptcies, and growing concerns about U.S. auto companies in 2005.  In addition, while stock prices in some emerging market countries have not performed well, a broad aggregate for these markets shows stock prices up over the past year, while the advanced economy indexes have exhibited double-digit declines, on average.13 Certainly, stock prices in the emerging market economies moved downward during acute periods of U.S. financial stress over the past year. However, these movements were similar in scale to those seen in industrial country equity markets, and during the intervening periods when global pressures were less intense, the prices of emerging market equities rebounded more substantially than those of industrial countries.  Reconciling apparent decoupling with integration How do we reconcile the obvious expansion of international trade, labor, and financial flows with the evidence, albeit mixed, of decoupling in the recent period? Three different points can help us achieve this reconciliation.  The first point is purely conceptual. The conventional wisdom is that greater international trade leads demand shocks to reverberate more intensely across international markets. However, we need to recognize that economic theory does not predict that greater economic and financial integration will necessarily result in increased co-movement of output across nations. One way in which integration might lead to less synchronization is through the tendency of international trade to promote specialization of production. If economies become more specialized, then their economic growth, and even equity markets, may be driven more by developments that are specific to the industries that have taken root in each country.14                                                   13  Stock price calculations are based on MSCI indexes for all emerging market economies and on the “World Index” for non-emerging-market economies. 14  Catao and Timmermann (2004). The authors identify high and low volatility states over the past 30 years. They find that the country factor contribution drops markedly when global equity market volatility rises, and that country-return correlations become tighter when global and industry factors are both in a high-volatility state. 4 BIS Review 82/2008 
The second point in this reconciliation stems from the observation that the correlation of business cycles will be specific to the shocks driving the cycles. In 2001 and 2002, the sharp decline in growth in the foreign countries soon after the U.S. economy slowed reflected the global nature of the bursting of the technology bubble and its worldwide transmission through equity markets and manufacturing. In the current slowdown, the implosion of the housing sector is playing the most prominent role in dragging down U.S. GDP growth. As construction utilizes local inputs and results in an output that is not traded internationally, its spillovers abroad are more limited. To be sure, a portion of the decline in domestic demand in the United States has been absorbed by foreign economies as our imports have fallen and exports have risen. However, these indirect spillovers are small compared with the more direct effects that would result from a shock in the tradable goods sector or from one of more global origin. Although the financial turmoil triggered by problems in the U.S. housing sector has been more international in scope, in particular with respect to other industrialized countries, its effects on the real side of foreign economies appears to have been limited, at least to date. The recent period also has been one of enhanced demand for commodities and sharp run-ups in many commodity prices, including for fuels, metals, and food. The actual increase in demand is benefiting many producers of commodities and is helping to offset the effect of weakening of export markets in industrial countries, thus contributing to the resilience of output in many emerging market economies.  The third and final point is that structural changes in emerging market economies have helped these countries during the recent period. One change in particular is the strengthening of the policy environment. With improved economic and financial policies, emerging market economies are more flexible and less subject to internal and external shocks that scare investors and disrupt asset markets. Inflation rates have come down dramatically since 1995, in part as a result of better monetary policy, assisted in many cases by more flexible exchange rate regimes that allowed monetary authorities to focus more intensively on domestic price stability.  In addition, structural progress has been made on the fiscal side in emerging markets. Fiscal balances are much improved, and many emerging market economies are running current account surpluses. Improvements in the policy environment have helped reinforce perceptions that emerging market assets, on average, are less risky than in the past and are less likely to be sold off in the event of financial disruptions and generalized retreats from risk, such as we have seen since August. As evidence of this, as I noted earlier, emerging market credit spreads have become less sensitive to movements in industrial country corporate spreads, and this trend has been ongoing even prior to the events of the last year.  Inflation and decoupling Up until now, I have been discussing whether movements in economic activity have or have not decoupled from each other. But whether or not business cycles have diverged, it is clear that the sharp increase in many commodity prices has given rise to highly coincident increases in inflation rates around the world. In industrialized economies, such as the United States, rising inflation has chiefly reflected the surge in energy prices, whereas in developing countries, for which food takes up more of household budgets, rising food costs have been a more important culprit. The reasons for the trajectory and persistence of increases in prices of food and energy this year, as global growth has moderated, are not entirely clear. The upward trend in prices of food and energy over the past several years, however, importantly reflects the pressures posed by rapidly growing demand in developing economies against relatively inelastic global supplies of commodities. For the moment, higher headline rates of inflation have shown only a few tentative signs of embedding themselves in core inflation or in longer-term inflation expectations. However, BIS Review 82/2008 5 
policymakers around the world must monitor the situation carefully for signs that the increases in relative prices globally do not generate persistently higher inflation. Additionally, in those countries where strong commodity demands are associated with rapid growth in aggregate demand that outstrips potential supply, actions to contain inflation by restraining aggregate demand would contribute to global price stability. Conclusion To sum up, the evidence sometimes presented as indicative of a divergence in economic performance, referred to as decoupling, is not definitive. It is certainly the case that in recent quarters, the U.S. economy slowed to a greater extent than other industrial economies, and economic activity in the industrial economies, in aggregate, has slowed more than in the emerging market economies. This experience contrasts with that near the start of this decade, when the economic downturn of 2001 through 2002 was felt more uniformly throughout the global economy. In addition, financial conditions in most emerging market economies have remained relatively stable, considering the turmoil that overtook industrial country financial markets over the past year. Even so, neither economic growth nor financial markets in the different regions of the world moved in lockstep in the past, nor are they expected to do so across all business cycles. It is far from clear that the divergences in performance we have seen of late, which are tentative in any event, represent distinct breaks from historical benchmarks. The recent divergences of economic performance reflect a particular set of shocks that have hit the global economy, as well as changes in the way that different economies have responded to those shocks.  As our global economy becomes more intertwined and complex, the nature and transmission of business cycles and the associated policy responses will no doubt continue to evolve. Economies benefit from having independent monetary policies that provide room to respond flexibly to alternative configurations of economic and financial shocks. These benefits could be increased if exchange rate flexibility were to become more widespread and monetary policies given greater latitude to respond to shocks wherever they originate.

Zdeněk Tůma: Education as investment in human capital Speech by Mr Zdeněk Tůma, Governor of the Czech National Bank, for the graduation ceremony, The New Anglo-American College, Prague, 20 June 2008. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, It is my pleasure to be here today and to share with you some thoughts that concern the role of education as an investment in human capital in the long-term development of our economy and society in general. Today it’s commonplace for politicians to swear by concepts like investment in education, knowledge-based economy or the effect of education on long-term economic growth. They are also quick to add something about the necessity to pay for university education, at least those on the right wing of the political spectrum. Don’t worry, we haven’t met today to assess individual political ideas, and we all know that sometimes it’s a long road from what politicians say to what they do. However, the fact that you are sitting here today indicates that viewing education as an investment has its place in today’s society regardless of political preferences.  I would like to use this opportunity to point out that although the concept of investment in education may be somewhat misused and can have unfortunate overtones for somebody, it has a rigorous theoretical foundation and is of high empirical relevance. In fact, I would only like to reinforce the conclusion you have no doubt arrived at – that you made a good choice when you invested in your further education. In 1987, when Robert Solow was awarded Nobel Prize in Economics for his contributions to the theory of long-term economic growth, it was already clear that his model of long-term economic growth had certain shortcomings in its description of reality. On the one hand, this is by no means unexpected, as all economic models suffer from a similar syndrome to a certain degree. On the other hand, the causes of the empirical problems surrounding Solow’s model are very inspiring from our point of view. The whole issue revolves around determining to what extent long-term economic growth is aided by human labour and capital measured as the sum of all previous investments that are still in use. In practical calculations, the contribution of human labour is always simplified as the ratio of wages paid to output. This ratio is about two-thirds for the developed world. Therefore, two-thirds of output in developed countries are used to remunerate labour and the remaining one-third to remunerate capital. Problems occur if the contributions of human labour and capital calculated in this way are applied to two countries at a different level of development. In such cases, there is a significant degree of divergence between the characteristics of these economies observed in reality and predicted by the model. It had been clear for a relatively long time that if the share of human labour in output was only one-third, Solow’s model would provide a very good picture of reality in international comparison. To overcome this inconsistency, however, it was necessary to come up with the idea of introducing a new variable in the model that would represent human capital. Although this may seem obvious today – as such things always seem to be as soon as someone else thinks of them – it was a novelty in the late 1980s. It was another Nobel Prize Laureate in economics Robert Lucas who divided human labour into a part reflecting people’s general capacity for work, and the contribution of human capital that was a result of previous investment in education. What Lucas did was very simple from today’s point of view. Using the extensive structure of US economic data, he chose the average wage of people with basic education as a basic remuneration of people’s capacity for work. Then he gradually added the average wage of BIS Review 81/2008 1 
other people after each finished year of education. The results showed that every additional year of education up to the level of a bachelor’s degree increases the wage by 8% on average. In the United States, if you finish high school and obtain a bachelor’s degree, which means you invest eight years in education, you can look forward to a wage two-thirds higher than the wage you would get if you only finished basic education. Although Lucas’s calculations didn’t include subsequent stages of education, as the bachelor’s degree was sufficient to reduce the share of basic human labour in output and improve Solow’s original concept, it’s clear that things don’t stop at the bachelor’s degree. On the contrary, one could say, it seems that a simple linear relationship ceases to be valid here, and every additional year brings an even higher wage increase compared to the previous years. Regardless of the size of the increase, investment in education is by no means an empty slogan. I wish you that you all become a living proof of this. 2 BIS Review 81/2008 
Savenaca Narube: Promoting investment in Fiji Opening address by Mr Savenaca Narube, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the opening of Westpac’s MHCC branch, Suva, 20 June 2008. *      *      * Mr. John Cashmore, Westpac Fiji Chief Manager Management and Staff  Distinguished Guests Introductory comments Today marks yet another milestone in Westpac’s history as they open their 19th banking site. They have certainly come a long way since they opened in Fiji as the Bank of New South Wales on 12th August 1901. I am honored to be part of this milestone this evening. In the last ten months, Westpac has opened branches in Port Denarau (September 2007) and Nakasi (November 2007). Westpac now has the second largest number of bank branches and agencies in Fiji. That is an impressive progress. I congratulate Westpac for their commitment to Fiji and also for their confidence in Fiji’s financial system. Investment And confidence is a special thing. True, it is hard to build and very quick to fall. And generating your own confidence when the climate is hard is a tough thing to do. But it can also be self fulfilling. It can be contagious. It is always encouraging to see businesses growing. Look at this complex. It was completed about six months ago. It is now a modern meeting point in the City. As they say “business must go on” whatever is the environment. No one owes us a living. Investment must continue. We need that now more than ever before. Investment is the locomotive of growth. Without it, the economy will lose steam. So I hope that Westpac’s confidence will rub off on many of us. We are doing what we can at the Reserve Bank to promote investment. At the end of April we raised the local borrowing limits of non-resident companies in light of the stability in foreign reserves. We listened to what the investors and the commercial banks were telling us. The change was welcomed and well received by lenders and investors. We are now going further still. We have just completed our review of the local borrowing limits of non-resident individuals. We are relaxing their borrowing too and I wish to announce the major changes. Firstly, to build a new residence in Fiji, non-resident individuals do not have to bring in all their funding from offshore – they can now borrow locally up to 60 percent of the project cost. Secondly, we are making further refinements to their local borrowing under an integrated development project. We do not want to inconvenience projects that had already started when we implemented the policy at the beginning of this year. If your company can convince us that your project had substantially started before that, we will add your project to our so called “exempted list” which would allow non-resident individuals buying your properties to borrow even more locally. Details of these relaxations will be announced shortly. BIS Review 81/2008 1 
These relaxations are positive signs. I would like to count them as proactive moves. They are intended to signal that we should focus on what lies ahead of us. I am sure that these relaxations will provide much needed impetus to private sector investment. On this front, let me take the opportunity to again say that the credit ceiling is not constraining investment in this country. If a commercial bank wants to lend to your business for investment purposes, all it has to do is apply to us and we will give our approval in a very short period of time generally within two days. Moreover, the credit ceiling has allowed us to raise liquidity which has reduced interest rates. Interest rates are generally were they were back in 2005. So again interest rates are not constraining investments. Global prices The whole world is reeling from high food and fuel prices. These prices may stay with us for some time although some easing of food prices is expected toward the end of this year. But it’s anybody’s guess where the fuel prices may end up at! For Fiji, this has come a very vulnerable time when the economy is recovering from a severe decline last year, the national debt is high and the foreign reserves are weak. Monetary policy is already tight with a credit ceiling in place. We cannot tighten any further to address inflation. Even if we could, this is not my preferred solution when prices are driven by supply constraints abroad. The adjustment burden then rests with the national budget. The question becomes: “How much load can the budget carry to mitigate rising?” My answer is that – “Perhaps not much given the high debt level!” We are somewhat caught between a rock and a hard place! In my view, we need to concentrate more on measures that will change our behaviours in how we do things – how we can reduce fuel consumption or be self sufficient in basic foods. To help in some small way, the Reserve Bank announced some relaxation to the Forward Foreign Exchange Cover Facility. Commercial banks can now enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with local importers of rice, wheat, flour, edible oils and milk to hedge against future price increases. Previously, commercial banks could only match forward sales with forward purchases. We hope that this measure will reduce import costs on food items and this benefit will be passed onto the customers. Westpac at MHCC Let me get back to MHCC and Westpac. For a shopping mall that opened in December 2007, MHCC already looks like a place to be in Suva. It appears that John and his Westpac team won what may have been a scrabble to open a branch at MHCC. With the volume of foot traffic I see today, this branch may be a small point of representation for Westpac, but it is certainly going to be a busy one. I am also told that with more cruise ships calling into Suva, the traffic will become even more intense. Retail businesses are important users of financial services and I can say that Westpac has them covered. Westpac’s presence at MHCC will compliment its branches in Cumming Street and Thomson Street. I have been told that apart from personal banking services, this branch will offer foreign exchange and international services like travelers’ cheques and telegraphic transfers. As you can see, this branch features an Internet and Telephone banking kiosk for customers wishing to do their banking online instead of standing in the queue. There is also an ATM that is accessible from 9.00am to 9.00pm – the opening hours of MHCC. 2 BIS Review 81/2008 
Shoppers and customers will be glad to know that this branch operates extended banking hours from 9.00am to 4.00pm daily and on Saturdays from 9.00am to 1.00pm. This branch will also open on Sundays when cruise liners are in port. I take this opportunity to thank Westpac for its leading role in servicing the business sector and the wider Fiji economy through its expanding outreach, innovative products and the latest banking technology. Official opening I thank Mr. Cashmore for his kind invitation. I wish him and his team at Westpac every success in their operations in Fiji. I now have much pleasure in declaring the Westpac MHCC branch open. Thank you. BIS Review 81/2008 3 
Jean-Pierre Roth: Recent economic and financial developments in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the half yearly media news conference, Geneva, 19 June 2008. *      *      * The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is leaving the target range for the Swiss franc three-month Libor unchanged at 2.25-3.25%. It intends to hold the rate in the middle of the target range for the time being. Despite a slowdown in economic activity, the global economy remains robust and the price of oil has continued to climb. This has led to a general increase in inflation. The situation on the financial markets is still uncertain, but less turbulent than it was a few months ago. Although the Swiss economy has also grown at a slower pace, the SNB has not changed its forecast of real GDP growth of between 1.5% and 2% for 2008. However, it has increased its inflation forecast and is now expecting an average rate of 2.7% in 2008. Nevertheless, assuming that the Libor remains unchanged at 2.75%, inflation should edge back down to 1.7% in 2009 and 1.3% in 2010, as a result of the expected economic downturn.  Considerable risks are attached to this inflation forecast. Stronger price increases are likely, should energy prices rise again or the Swiss franc depreciate on the foreign exchange market. A more significant slowdown in the global economy might ease inflationary pressure. Given these conditions, the SNB is maintaining its cautious stance and leaving its monetary policy strategy unchanged. In view of the medium-term inflation outlook, it can afford to do so. After all, there is enough reason to suggest that the current inflationary trend is of a transitory nature. The SNB will keep a close watch on the price of oil, movements in the Swiss franc, the economy, and developments in the financial markets, so as to assess their impact on the inflation outlook and react swiftly, in order to maintain price stability in the medium term. Global economic outlook With exports accounting for 52% of GDP, the Swiss economy has a strong global presence. This is an opportunity, but it also means that the international environment has a considerable impact on economic developments in Switzerland. The US economy – until recently the principal driver of global economic growth – has made scant headway over the last three quarters. However, the period of near-stagnation which the US economy is currently experiencing is not likely to be too prolonged. The resolutely expansionist nature of US monetary and fiscal policy, combined with a weak US dollar that favours exports, should help to reenergise the US economy. A recovery is expected towards the end of the year, albeit a tentative one, given that the deterioration in the employment outlook, the erosion of purchasing power and the fall in property prices look set to weigh on consumer sentiment and income.  Europe represents the second pole in the global economy. Although the continent enjoyed strong growth during the first quarter of 2008, the remainder of the year should see a slowdown. A number of factors will contribute to this loss of momentum. First, the strong euro and the sharp downturn in the US economy are dampening exports. The sub-prime crisis has led to a tightening of credit conditions, while consumer confidence has deteriorated. This will have a knock-on effect on consumer spending. However, the slowdown in Europe will be much less pronounced than in the US, although the subsequent pick-up in economic activity will also probably be gradual. BIS Review 80/2008 1 
The Asian economies, which constitute the third major hub, continue to exhibit strong growth as a whole, since they remain virtually unaffected by the slowdown in the US economy. Nevertheless, they have been hit by rising commodity and food prices, which are seriously reducing incomes. Regional variations aside, it would therefore be reasonable to conclude that the global economy, as a whole, is not witnessing a significant slowdown at present – as opposed to one of the rather more alarming scenarios that were only recently being mooted. The impact of the crisis in the financial sector on the rest of the economy has been felt less acutely and a lot more slowly than could have been expected. It is precisely the continued robust global growth which is the main reason for the sharp rise in food and oil prices – although market speculation may have accentuated this trend. In most countries, the rise in the price of oil has translated into an increase in consumer prices. After remaining at a moderate level for a long time, inflation is again a cause for concern. This increase in the indices risks destabilising inflation expectations, which have remained very stable over the last number of years.  Swiss economic outlook Last year saw the Swiss economy still operating at a dynamic pace, but there was a distinct fall-off during the first few months of 2008. In the first quarter, real GDP grew at an annualised rate of only 1.3%. This compares to growth rates in the region of 3% or even 4% which we saw in 2007. The slowdown is attributable to three major factors. First, the economy was turning over at an exceptionally high rate last year. A slowdown was therefore inevitable as much as it was desirable. It reduces the likelihood of the economy overheating and reflects the normalisation of monetary policy which we have undertaken in recent years. Second, the slowdown in exports played an added role, by curbing manufacturing activity. Finally, problems on the financial markets resulted in a significant drop in stock market transactions. This had a negative impact on added value in the banking sector.  However, the slowdown in production did not spread to all sectors of activity. Growth remained strong in the retail and wholesale business, the hotel and catering trade and the transportation and communication industries. This shows that domestic demand remains – on the whole – robust. With the first few months of 2008 seeing a steady flow of new jobs, the favourable climate on the job market continues to be conducive to private consumption in particular. Further growth in demand and production is likely over the next few quarters, albeit at a more modest pace. High prices for oil products and uncertainty related to the US real estate crisis will undoubtedly continue to hamper economic activity. However, growth in household consumption and equipment investment looks set to continue. The SNB continues to forecast GDP growth of between 1.5% and 2% for 2008. However, this average annual growth rate is boosted by the strong growth achieved in the second half of 2007. It therefore conceals what has been a noticeable slowdown in economic activity, with quarterly rates below potential throughout the rest of the year. Changes in the monetary and financial framework How have monetary conditions evolved since our last assessment in March? They have become somewhat more relaxed. This is mainly attributable to two factors.  First, the Swiss franc has depreciated by 3% against our 26 most important trading partners, thereby partially offsetting the appreciation that occurred at the beginning of the year. This softening is having a direct impact on inflation, by increasing the prices of imports. To give an example, the impact of oil prices on inflation has been amplified, with the price of a barrel of Brent crude rising 18% by mid-May in terms of Swiss francs, but only 13% in terms of US 2 BIS Review 80/2008 
dollars. In the longer term, the weakening in the Swiss franc is indirectly contributing to the increase in prices by stimulating demand. Second, real short-term interest rates have dropped. There has been a rise in expected inflation for the near future and this means – for given nominal interest rates – lower real expected yields for short maturities. An analysis of monetary conditions in terms of volumes leads to similar conclusions. Let us begin with money, which is the best indicator to use if a broad-brush and long-term outlook for the economy and inflation is required. The M1 and M2 monetary aggregates, which were declining until not long ago, have been practically stable for some months. As for M3, it is continuing to exhibit moderate growth.  The sub-prime crisis has confirmed the importance of mortgage loans as an indicator of the degree of relaxation of monetary policy. The reason for this is simple. Because construction projects are long-term in nature, real estate investment reacts particularly sensitively to interest rates. Consequently, mortgage loans were growing at a rate of 5–6% in 2003 and 2004, when our monetary policy was firmly expansionary. These growth rates then declined gradually as we tightened our monetary policy in 2006 and 2007. Last April, they settled at around 3.3%. The growth rate of other loans – a particularly heterogeneous category – remains high, confirming that the underlying trend in the economy remains dynamic.  In December, we emphasised the need to give particular attention to conditions in the credit market in the light of the sub-prime crisis. In order to do this, the SNB conducted a survey of 20 banks in March, in which they provided us with information on their intentions and expectations. This survey completed the analysis of credit volumes. It reveals, first, that banks have not significantly tightened lending conditions with respect to either households or companies over the course of the last few months. Second, the banks state that, in broad terms, demand for credit has remained unchanged. Third, they do not expect any significant change in either supply or demand in the months ahead. Thus this survey confirms the conclusions of the analysis of credit volumes which, as we have seen, are continuing to rise. Unlike similar surveys conducted in the US and the euro area, it shows that, for the time being, the sub-prime crisis has not led to a deterioration in credit conditions in Switzerland. Inflation and inflation risks Inflation developed in line with expectations during the first quarter of this year. Our March forecast was 2.4%, whereas actual inflation was 2.5%. Nonetheless – as you can see from the charts – we are forecasting higher and more persistent inflation for the rest of the year. However, it should drop back below the 2% level from the beginning of next year, although there are significant risks attached to this relatively favourable forecast. A more pronounced price surge would clearly be a concern should there be a further increase in the prices of energy and food. In addition, it is possible that movements in the Swiss franc will not contribute to easing upward pressure on import prices. Having said that, we should also not underestimate the potential for movements in the prices of raw materials to reverse, and inflation pressures to abate in the event of a pronounced global economic slowdown, especially as we do not yet know the consequences of the financial market turbulence. Today’s monetary policy decision reflects our assessment of these different risks.  Monetary policy decision Inflation has exceeded the 2% mark since December 2007. However, in our view this situation is temporary and the expected slowdown in the economy should have a moderating effect. We are expecting that inflation will already move back below the 2% level in 2009. Moreover, given the prevailing uncertainty as regards both the global economy – which could suffer a greater-than-expected slowdown – and the fallout from the international financial BIS Review 80/2008 3 
turmoil – which has hit Switzerland fairly hard compared to other industrial countries – we consider that a prudent attitude remains appropriate and that a change of monetary policy is not called for in the current circumstances. Nevertheless, we must remain very vigilant. A renewed rise in energy prices, a stronger economy than expected, a weakening of the Swiss franc or an increase in inflation expectations would pose a threat to medium-term price stability. We will therefore continue to keep a close watch on these factors, so as to be able to react quickly in order to maintain price stability in the medium term. Inflation forecast chart How has our inflation forecast been revised? The dashed red curve on the chart represents the new forecast. It covers the period from the second quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2011, and maps the future development of inflation on the assumption that the three-month Libor remains unchanged at 2.75% over the forecasting period. For purposes of comparison, the dash-dotted green curve shows the inflation forecast of the March monetary assessment, based on a three-month Libor of 2.75%.  The new forecast shows inflation rising in the short term, and exceeding 2% by the first quarter of next year. The increase is primarily due to the rise in oil prices combined with continued robust economic activity. However, the forecast shows that the expected slowdown in the economy, the fall in capacity utilisation rates and a baseline effect as regards energy prices will all contribute to a decline in inflation, which should thus, in the medium term, arrive at a level that is fully compatible with price stability.

Thomas Jordan: The various waves of money market turbulence and the measures taken by central banks Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the half-yearly media news conference, Geneva, 19 June 2008. *      *      * The money markets are the lifeblood of the international financial system. Properly functioning money markets are absolutely essential for the solvency of banks, as well as for the effective implementation of monetary policy. Hence, events on the money markets since the onset of the financial turmoil have been a particular focus of central banks’ attention.  So far, there have been three waves of turbulence. At the time of the last news conference, we were almost at the height of the second wave. In the meantime we have experienced a third wave, which peaked in April. An appropriate barometer of the health of the money market is the difference between the three-month Libor and the three-month (T)OIS rate (tom-next/overnight indexed swap). This difference reflects the credit and liquidity premium on unsecured money market trades compared to purely derivative business with virtually no counterparty risk. With the help of chart 1, which can be regarded as a “fever curve”, I would now like to look back at how events unfolded, and comment on the measures which the central banks took in response.  The first wave peaked in September 2007. Money market risk premia rose sharply, from below 10 basis points to over 50 basis points, and even exceeding 100 basis points for some currencies. In this phase, we reacted flexibly to the volatile bank demand by providing generous amounts of liquidity at our repo auctions, and by increasing the frequency of fine-tuning operations. In October, there was a period of calm and risk premia retreated. In this phase, our patient – the market – was prescribed the usual remedies, although in higher doses and several times a day if necessary.  The second wave arose out of concerns about refinancing shortages around the year-end, and reached its peak in December. To reduce uncertainty on the part of market participants, the Swiss National Bank increased its repo transactions at maturities of several weeks, or even several months, instead of the usual weekly maturity. These measures made it easier for banks to manage liquidity around the end of the year.  During this second wave, European banks found it increasingly difficult to refinance in US dollars, and dollar rates were regularly higher in Europe than in the US. One reason for this was the structural dollar short position of the European banks and their concern that they would not have sufficient dollar liquidity at close of business as a result of poorly functioning money markets. For this reason, the Federal Reserve, ECB and SNB decided to take concerted action. In December 2007, for the first time in its history, the SNB was able to provide its counterparties with US dollar liquidity against the usual SNB eligible collateral, thanks to a swap agreement with the Fed. In this context, it is important to point out that this dollar liquidity had no impact on either monetary policy or the SNB’s income statement. Yet it helped to facilitate refinancing by our counterparties, and thus made a positive contribution towards easing the tension on the Swiss franc money market. In this phase, the central banks supplemented their usual remedies with some booster treatments.  The third wave of turbulence, in March this year, resulted from acute liquidity problems faced by individual international banks, combined with concerns that the money market problems might become chronic. In this third phase, the SNB did not provide any new instruments, preferring to make greater use of our existing tools. In particular, we resumed our US dollar auctions, at which we now offer USD 6 billion on a fortnightly basis. In this way, we are providing the market with a maximum of USD 12 billion. In addition, we are supplying the BIS Review 80/2008 1 
market with generous amounts of Swiss franc liquidity and actively engage in fine-tuning operations whenever necessary.  Other central banks have opted for more wide-reaching measures over the past few months. For instance, the range of eligible participants and collateral for refinancing operations was expanded. The Fed and the Bank of England have introduced a new “collateral swap facility”, under which the banks can temporarily swap their unsaleable securities against liquid government paper. The pressure on banks to refinance their balance sheets is thus reduced without additional central bank money having to be injected into the market. The Fed went even further in providing support during the sale of investment bank Bear Stearns. It took illiquid and risky securities directly onto its own balance sheet. Thus, in the third phase, some countries administered new remedies in addition to the existing ones, and even performed a few emergency operations.  In the SNB’s case, the range of counterparties admitted to repo auctions has already been very broad for some time. Indeed, shortly before the turmoil began, we decided to expand the range of eligible securities for money market operations, whilst still retaining stringent quality standards. Measures such as those used in the US and UK have not proved necessary in Switzerland to date.  Monetary policy steering during the crisis The measures taken by the SNB, as described above, were primarily aimed at ensuring the smooth functioning of the Swiss franc money market during the turbulence. However, it is also important to look at the actual implementation of monetary policy strategy during the crisis. Of particular interest in this regard are two aspects which have occasionally been misinterpreted by the general public. First, there is the question of whether, in stabilising the money market, the SNB released a flood of liquidity, thereby entering into inflation risks. The SNB did indeed sometimes inject large amounts of central bank money into the market. Since the onset of the turmoil, we have in principle always provided a generous supply of liquidity through repo operations. However, fine-tuning was also consistently used to absorb any excess liquidity, as soon as call money rates fell below a certain level. Since the banks ultimately only have limited end-of-day demand for central bank money, there was a regular flow of funds back to the SNB. These operations allowed us to do two things: first, to limit the volatility of call money rates; and, second, to keep market rates close to our repo rate. This is shown in chart 2. Moreover, this also enabled us to keep the average level of sight deposits stable, which meant that we did not allow the banking system to be supplied with excess liquidity. As can be seen from chart 3, there was a wide day-to-day fluctuation in sight deposits during the crisis but, on average over the month, levels remained more or less stable. Thus Switzerland cannot be said to have been flooded with liquidity. Second, attention has focused on how the interest rates are fixed for monetary policy repo auctions. The SNB, on the basis of its monetary policy assessment, decides on a range for the three-month Libor which it considers appropriate for monetary policy purposes. This means that movements in the Libor that are not in line with the SNB’s monetary policy objectives have to be countered with a change in repo rates. Thus, over the course of the turbulence, we consistently offset changes in Libor risk premia with changes in the repo rate, as shown in chart 4. For this reason, the Libor remained in the middle of the target band during the whole episode. The Swiss franc Libor was much more stable during the turmoil than the Libor for other currencies. This simply means that we were able to protect the Swiss economy from part of the crisis-induced increase in risk premia.  Libor criticised Recently, some market observers have questioned the information value of the Libor. The Libor for all major currencies is fixed daily in London by the British Bankers Association 2 BIS Review 80/2008 
(BBA) on the basis of a survey of top-rated international banks. Critics argued that some banks would report unduly low Libor rates, in an effort to talk up their creditworthiness. Others claimed that the rates were too high because the panel of reporting banks was not sufficiently representative. These criticisms almost exclusively concerned the dollar Libor. The BBA has found no evidence of a systematic distortion of the Libor, and has announced that it is leaving the fixing method for the Libor unchanged. However, it will strengthen governance of the Libor fixing process, especially the monitoring of individual banks’ reports. In this regard, the BBA has recently published a report, and has invited comments from financial market participants. What is the SNB’s standpoint on this discussion? The SNB – like all market participants – has a strong interest in ensuring that the Libor reflects true market interest rate conditions. For the three-month Swiss franc Libor, there has so far been no evidence that this has not previously been, or is no longer, the case. The use of the three-month Libor as an operational target stems from its considerable economic significance as a reference rate for many financial and lending contracts. Here too, there is so far no evidence that the Libor has lost its significance in the Swiss franc market.  Since not all reporting banks have been equally affected by the financial market turmoil, and since the extent and liquidity of Libor-based, unsecured money market trading in a crisis is automatically much lower than usual, the range of numbers reported will automatically be wider in such a situation. This can also give rise to random fluctuations. Moreover, in general the risk premium inherent in the Libor has become a lot more volatile since the start of the turmoil. This volatility makes it harder to steer the Libor. It should, however, be borne in mind that the SNB does not use a point target but a target range, which allows a certain amount of fluctuation in the Libor. Yet the most notable thing is that, despite these difficulties, we have succeeded in keeping the Libor around the middle of the target band. This is, after all, what counts for the implementation of monetary policy.  So neither the current criticisms levelled at the Libor nor the actual movements in the Libor are an immediate reason to dispense with this rate as the operational target of the SNB.  Conclusion Let me briefly conclude. Despite clear signs of a return to calm, the money market has not yet gone back to “business as usual”. The Libor/TOIS differentials continue to indicate a certain degree of tension. The various waves of turbulence also show how difficult it is to predict what will happen next.  Central bank actions have helped to defuse the situation. Nevertheless, they can only treat the symptoms of the malaise, or fever. An effective cure and the restoration of confidence between market participants are primarily a matter for the banks themselves. The SNB’s tools – its medicine cabinet – have so far proved their worth during the turbulence. Yet the crisis provides a reason to review and where necessary adapt them. For central banks, it is important to consider, not just the immediate effect of an instrument, but also the longer-term repercussions. Thanks to their monopoly in issuing currency, central banks can engage in almost unlimited short-term intervention when markets and market participants are threatened with collapse. However, such extreme measures carry high risks for the longer term. It is all too easy for market participants to assume that they will be protected from the negative effects of their own actions during a crisis. Central banks need to keep a close eye on this moral hazard problem, and if necessary take steps to contain it through appropriate regulation. BIS Review 80/2008 3

John Gieve: A tale of two cycles Speech by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, to the North East Chamber of Commerce Durham Tees Valley Dinner, Durham, 19 June 2008. *      *      * Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to be here this evening in what has been a busy week for the Bank, with the open letter to the Chancellor in response to the news on Tuesday that CPI inflation rose to 3.3% in May, the latest MPC minutes, and the Chancellor’s announcement last night of an enhanced role for the Bank on financial stability. Things have certainly changed in the year since your chief executive, James Ramsbotham, asked me to speak here this evening. The Bank's links with this region go back to 1828 when, in response to a crisis of confidence (this one over locally issued bank notes), we opened a branch in Newcastle. The move was not well received. The Newcastle Chamber of Commerce, wrote to the Directors of the Bank of England, saying "in the absence of any avowed motive for the establishment of a Branch of the Bank of England, in Newcastle, [we] see no prospect of good from such an establishment.......[We] most earnestly recommend to the Directors of the Bank of England to re-consider the policy of the measure they are about to adopt and to abstain from trying such an experiment on a system of banking, the advantages of which are so generally felt and admitted." I am pleased that our current Agents, David Buffham and Will Dowson receive a warmer welcome from Chamber members and others as they travel around the region. Our agents are the eyes and ears of the Bank. They make sure that we take account not just of the economic statistics, which at best tell us what has just happened (and all too frequently fail to do that), but also know what businessmen and women are saying about their own outlook and plans. The Monetary Policy Committee receives a report from each region each month and I can assure you it always receives a lot of attention. All the members of the Committee also get out to meet businesses themselves and that is why I am here in the North East for two days. The main subject of my speech tonight is the wider economy, and in particular the tale of two cycles – the downswing of the financial cycle and the upswing in the commodity price cycle. The economic environment in context But first, it is important to recognise that the last ten years have been a period of remarkable stability for the UK’s economy. It has certainly been the most stable and successful period for the economy in my lifetime.1  When the MPC was set up, Charlie Bean – then a leading academic, soon to be my fellow Deputy Governor – estimated that inflation would be away from the target by more than 1 percentage point in nearly 5 months of every year. Yet this week the Governor’s open letter to the Chancellor to explain why inflation last month had deviated by more than a percentage point from the target was only the second written in over 10 years. And taking the past decade as a whole, this stability of inflation has not come at a cost to growth – quite the opposite in fact. Output growth has been high both relative to the rates                                                  1  Indeed work done at the Bank suggests that in terms of inflation, it has been the most stable decade in many lifetimes – that is, since the Restoration at least (Benati (2006)). BIS Review 80/2008 1 
achieved on average over the preceding 30 years and in comparison with our European neighbours. It also has been remarkably stable.2Of course that stability at the macro level disguises some big changes in the structure of the economy. Indeed it has provided a platform for change. The North East for example is now much more diverse than it was and less reliant on a few large industries. And, overall more people are employed in the region: the number employed in the North East has risen by more than 100,000 in the past ten years. And export growth remains relatively buoyant. In contrast to this picture of stability, the preceding 3 decades were scarred by painful recessions where unemployment rose sharply, and inflation fluctuated wildly. In particular, there were three episodes between the mid-1970s and early 1990s, when inflation rose very sharply, and at around the same time output contracted. While there are many in the room that don’t need reminding, I thought I would just give the younger members of the audience a reminder of just how desperate those times were (Chart 1). In 1975, RPI inflation peaked just shy of a staggering 27% while at the same time output fell. It was this era that entrenched the term “stagflation” in the minds of the public. Inflation fell back sharply over the subsequent year or so, only to rear its head again in 1979-80 – this time peaking at around 22%. Once again output contracted and unemployment rose sharply (Chart 2). A third and final bout of rising inflation and falling output occurred in the early 1990s, with the unemployment rate once again rising above 10%. On average, inflation in the 1970s was around 13% and 7.5% in the 1980s. The UK macroeconomic framework Why was it that output and inflation were so volatile then and why has economic performance improved so much in the past 10 years? These questions are vital as we face more uncertain times ahead and to ensure that we avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. I would point to three main factors. There have been changes to the structure of the UK economy that have made it more flexible and adaptable. Labour market reforms enacted over the past twenty-five years have led to a more flexible workforce. Unemployment has fallen without generating unsustainable growth in wages, and hence inflation. And in recent years the role of migrant labour has been important in easing the bottlenecks and skill shortages in what was otherwise an undoubtedly tight labour market. Firms have been able to adjust and adapt to events more quickly and that has produced less volatility in output, employment and inflation for the economy as a whole. With economic growth expected to slow over the coming year pressures in the labour market are likely to ease, reducing the demand for migrant labour, and possibly beginning to reverse recent strong inflows. A second fundamental change has been to the monetary policy framework. The experience of those three recessions and bursts of inflation has led to a settled consensus that monetary policy should be directed at controlling inflation and that there is no long-run trade off between inflation and output growth. This consensus has been embedded by transferring interest rate decisions to an independent Bank of England, with a clearly defined inflation target of 2% measured by annual CPI inflation. That has helped build confidence that if inflation does move away from target, we on the Monetary Policy Committee will act to ensure that it returns to target in the medium term. That confidence should ensure that                                                  2  It has only deviated by more than 1 percentage point from that average on 4 occasions. To put this in context, in the preceding 3 decades stretching back to the 1960s, annual GDP growth deviated from its 10 year average by more than 1 percentage point about half of the time (about 20 quarters in each 10 year period). 2 BIS Review 80/2008 
employers and employees are less likely to adjust their prices and wages to a surprise movement in inflation. In other words, their expectation of inflation in the medium-term remains low, stable and anchored at the target. And that has helped to contribute not only to the stability of inflation, but output as well. Reforms to both the labour market and monetary policy have undoubtedly played an important role in the reduction in output volatility and emergence of a stable, low inflation environment. But there was a third factor at play that was probably also quite fundamental. Over the first decade of the MPC the economic cycles in the rest of the world were generally moderate, although not without excitement. And there is good evidence to suggest that the integration of emerging economies, such as China, into the global economy was beneficial to countries like the UK. The share of Chinese goods in total UK goods imports has almost tripled in money terms over the past fifteen years to around 8 per cent, and it’s likely that much of the content of imports from elsewhere originated in China. This rising share of Chinese imports has reduced manufactured imported goods prices relative to other prices and wages. Consumer goods price inflation hovered around zero for most of the last ten years, until the recent rise in oil prices. As a result, the purchasing power of UK consumers has risen with higher real wages achieved without any cost to employers. In other words, for a period the beneficial tailwind allowed the economy to run at a higher level of activity than would otherwise have been the case, without generating additional inflationary pressures. But the economic environment overseas has taken a turn for the worse. In many ways it is a tale of two cycles. The financial cycle The first cycle has been in the financial sector in the West. A banking cycle is not a new phenomenon but the scale of the expansion of cheap credit for some years and speed of the downswing in the last year has been exceptional. It started in the US with a real downturn in the housing market and rising default rates on sub-prime mortgages in particular. That led to a freeze in the structured credit markets built on those loans as investors lost confidence in the credit ratings they depend on. In finance at least, it is still true that when America sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold and the sub-prime crisis swiftly spread to financial institutions across the world. They became uncertain about the value of the financial positions they held, let alone what their counterparties held. This led to a wider loss of confidence in banks, the hoarding of cash and illiquidity in many financial markets which is still not over. As financial institutions all around the world have struggled to shrink their balance sheets in the face of this storm, there has been a pronounced tightening in the supply of credit. The number of loan approvals for house purchases fell to a new low in April to – on some indicators – its lowest level in over thirty years (Chart 3). In the past, the swings in the UK economy have been home grown. Credit squeezes have typically resulted from rising domestic arrears and defaults, driven by economic downturns at home. This time the sequence has been reversed. The broadest measures of economic activity have continued to grow: quarterly GDP growth in the latest data for 2008Q1 was 0.4% and employment has continued to rise. The level of defaults on corporate and personal loans has been low. So the squeeze on new lending has preceded rather than followed the slowdown in the UK. The judgement we have to make is how far that tightening will restrain the domestic economy in future. There is no doubt it is having a material effect already (Chart 4). This is most obvious in the housing market, where prices have fallen by around 7% since their peak, and have further to fall. The drop in transactions and turnover is rippling through the housebuilding industry, BIS Review 80/2008 3 
estate agencies and mortgage brokers. Of course a fall in house prices benefits buyers just as it hurts sellers so there is no necessary link to wider consumption. But the belief that in housing you could have your cake and eat it – that is your house would not just provide a place to live but would also provide an assured capital gain – has become widespread and the shock to expectations appears to be having a wider impact on confidence. There are also signs in some of the more timely survey indicators of consumer spending that weakness is spreading there too. If nothing else were going on, the MPC would expect this prospective weakness in overall demand to put downward pressure on inflation in the medium term and that would be pointing to further rate cuts. The commodity price cycle However, there is something else going on! Because if the US still drives the financial cycle, it has become less dominant in the world economy. According to the IMF, emerging and developing countries together generated around 70% of world growth in 2007, with China alone generating around 25%. And the world economy has been and still is growing strongly. That is what has been driving the rise in oil and commodity prices. For example, since the start of 2005, China has accounted for almost all of the increase in world demand for key metals such as aluminium, copper and zinc. And since 2000, around one-third of the increase in world demand for oil has emanated from China. Between 1997 and 2004 commodity prices were largely stable. However, since the end of 2004, sterling non-oil commodity prices have doubled, while sterling oil prices have more than trebled. And half of that rise has occurred in the last 9 months. The strength of demand for commodities in emerging markets has not been matched by supply. In both the oil and metals sector, new capacity can take many years to come on stream. And in the agricultural sector, output has been affected by adverse weather conditions in North America, Europe and Australia. As of yesterday, oil was trading at around $130 per barrel. Relative to the rise in the prices of consumer goods and services, oil prices (in US dollars) are now higher than they were in the 1970s. The rise in oil prices has pushed up on fuel, retail gas and electricity prices. Similarly, the rising cost of agricultural commodities has driven up food prices (Chart 5). Taken together energy and food components can account for 1.1 percentage points of the 1.2 percentage points increase in CPI inflation from 2.1% in December last year to 3.3% in May. There is no doubt that the emergence of China, India and other Asian economies in recent years is a permanent change in the structure and balance of the world economy. But there are signs too that an element of their recent growth may be cyclical. The growing inflationary pressures and the scale of the booms in investment are typical of economies reaching the top of the cycle. The huge increase in oil and food prices will itself have a dampening effect on consumers in those countries – as it will in the West. So we may well see the balance of supply and demand shift at some point. UK inflation outlook But the immediate prospect is for rising inflation. As the Governor explained in his open letter to the Chancellor, when the rise in energy prices passes through to consumers, CPI inflation is likely to rise sharply in the second half of the year, to above 4%. There is of course considerable uncertainty around this, and if energy and other import prices rise further, CPI inflation could well go even higher in the short term. That is bound to lead to a downward adjustment to real take-home pay. That cannot be avoided. Indeed, such an adjustment was seen in response to the rise in energy prices in 2004-06. Over that period, nominal wage 4 BIS Review 80/2008 
growth was broadly stable, and there was a relatively smooth adjustment to real wages in response to the rise in energy prices. A key risk to the outlook is whether a similar, benign adjustment will occur in response to the latest price rises. With inflation having been above target for much of the past three years, and set to rise further in the near term, there is a risk that households and businesses may start to expect CPI inflation to be persistently above 2%. If that happened, and those expectations were built into higher wages and prices, the benign adjustment would not be repeated. So we are closely monitoring developments in inflation expectations. Unfortunately inflation expectations can’t be observed directly. But a number of measures, including household surveys and financial market instruments, can act as a guide (Chart 6). While all these measures have their drawbacks, most have risen – in some cases markedly – over the past year. It is unclear to what extent these measures contain information about the medium-term – the horizon over which the MPC aim to bring inflation back to target. And it is comforting that other measures – such as money spending remain stable and in line with the average rate of increase since 1997. And the Committee’s commitment to ensuring inflation returns to the 2% target should give those setting prices and wages some confidence that inflation will be close to target in the future. Conclusion There is no doubt that the current climate is the most challenging the MPC has ever had to face. Balancing the downside risk to demand associated with tighter credit conditions against the inflationary pressures emanating from the rest of the world is an enormous challenge. And the immediate prospect is for a deterioration in both output growth and inflation. Monetary policy cannot prevent the economy being buffeted by developments in the wider world economy but the experience of the past 10 years has shown that the economy is now more flexible in responding to events. Crucially we now have a credible framework for setting monetary policy to meet the inflation target in the medium term. Monetary policy cannot prevent the short-run ups and downs of economic cycles. In the current climate, the Committee believes that, if Bank Rate were set to bring inflation back to target too quickly, the result would be unnecessary volatility in output and employment. Instead we are focused on returning CPI inflation to the 2% target in around two years, when the present sharp rises in energy and food prices will have dropped out of the CPI inflation rate. We judge that in order for inflation to return to target it will be necessary for economic growth to slow this year, reducing the pressure on supply capacity of the economy and dampening increases in prices and wages. But the risks to both the upside and downside remain large and the MPC will continue to make its judgement about the appropriate level of Bank Rate month by month. The next year is not going to be comfortable for anyone and we already hear calls to change the system, the target, and our focus on inflation. But the new framework and the independence of the Bank was designed for difficult times as well as for plain sailing. I hope we can look to you and other businesses for support in doing what is needed to bring inflation back to target.  BIS Review 80/2008 5

Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell: Towards an integrated securities market – The TARGET2-Securities project Speech by Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central, Bank, at the 12th FESE Convention, Stockholm, 18 June 2008. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here today at the FESE convention to share with you my vision of the T2S initiative, and its important role in creating an integrated European securities market. But let me start by putting the T2S project into the broader context of overall financial integration in Europe. I am often asked why we need to integrate financial markets There is enough economic evidence to convince even the most hardened sceptic that financial integration at European level will create substantial gains for society as a whole. Financial integration will foster a more efficient allocation of resources, increase competition, reduce costs, lead to higher trading activity, and more transparent pricing and thereby raise the overall potential for stronger economic growth. It will increase consumer choice, open a multitude of new investment opportunities, strengthen the EU banking sector and make Europe a centre for financial innovation.  Moreover, more from my perspective as a central banker, increased financial integration will enhance the smooth transmission of monetary policy and is crucial for global resilience of financial markets which constitutes an important element for safeguarding financial stability. Efficient integrated markets generally reinforce the shock-absorbing capacity of the economic system as they offer a wider range of options for sharing risk among economic agents.  The economic gains of financial integration coincide with the objectives expressed in the Lisbon agenda, of granting the citizens of Europe access to a genuine single market in which financial services are offered on the same conditions within and across borders. Thus every cross-border business in Europe needs to become truly domestic. Achieving this requires action of several kinds at all stages in the process – in trading and in post-trading.  I think there is evidence of already great progress on the trading side; notably, European Stock Exchanges and the relatively new MTFs (multilateral trading facilities) are extending the range of instruments offered on their trading platforms to create genuine competition. This offers the potential for lower costs for intermediaries and all classes of investors. It also improves the prospects for retail investors to diversify their securities portfolios across Europe, increasing the potential returns on investments and diversifying their exposure to financial risks. Issuers should also benefit from greater market depth for their fund raising.  But what about the post trading arena?  There is considerable evidence that costs in the European post trading area are much higher – particularly for cross border activity – than in other very large markets, such as the US market, but also several markets of the Eastern Hemisphere states. The cost gap – for example – in relation to the US market arises in large part because of differences between different European local markets. The lack of harmonisation is often the result of history – differences in market practices, laws, tax administration and so on. Often, the post trading infrastructure in the local market has been rapidly developed in the relatively recent past to provide very efficient means of accommodating such local market features. BIS Review 79/2008 1 
The solutions were often created under huge pressure, to help each individual market to cope with the dynamics of innovation and of trading volumes. These were major achievements in that context, but the world has changed and we now need to move to the next stage of development. Our today’s task is, therefore, to become more competitive in a rapidly changing global financial market environment. Differences across Europe’s post trading markets have to be overcome. For this, integration and harmonization need to be promoted, synergies need to be used and economies of scale have to be exploited. This will foster competition and the expansion of markets, facilitating a more efficient allocation of better-priced capital.  We, the Eurosystem, contribute our part in promoting further financial integration in the post trading sector by acting in several roles – as market operator, facilitator and catalyst.  The Eurosystem already offers core, neutral and borderless infrastructure to support real-time settlement in central bank money with the TARGET2 system. Moreover, we are working to produce the next generation of the Eurosystem’s collateral management system (Collateral Central Bank Management or CCBM2). The Eurosystem also supports market initiatives such as SEPA – the new Single Euro Payments Area – enabling customers to make payments anywhere in the euro area as quickly, safely and easily as they can in their own country, by using a single set of payment instruments.  How can the TARGET2-Securities initiative contribute to this process? Let me focus today on the Eurosystem’s TARGET2-Securities initiative (T2S). T2S is a proposal to overcome the fragmentation in the European market for securities settlement providing a harmonised venue, a single European, borderless, settlement platform, offering highly secure delivery versus payment for any security, using central bank money. T2S reinforces the other main European Union initiatives, the Code of Conduct for clearing and settlement, the Giovannini harmonisation process and of course the MiFiD in driving forward the single market objectives set out by the Lisbon agenda. In particular, T2S will be tightly integrated with the TARGET2 system, combining cash and securities settlements in a single shared platform in real time to provide the single European settlement platform for securities in central bank money, irrespective of the location of the issuer, the security or the settlement counterparty. This will create a single pool of securities available to market users and service providers through their chosen CSD, eliminating the costly process of cross-border security settlement in Europe. In this way, T2S will provide – just like an airport servicing various airlines – a basic infrastructure. In this basic infrastructure the CSDs can operate, offering – for example – a mix of products and services to their customers. In this regard, T2S will simply provide the basic platform that offers its services to all CDSs at the same unit costs. This will obviously contribute to more competition among the CSDs, leading to more transparent and efficient pricing, and facilitating competition to provide cross-border trading venues. This will create substantial gains for the European financial industry.  Thanks to efforts made by hundreds of experts from over 80 European institutions and from the Eurosystem over the last year, the Governing Council of the ECB has been able in the last few weeks to invite the European CSDs to express their support for T2S. We have sent the European CSDs detailed user requirements, an economic impact analysis, a description of governance for the next project phase, and a presentation on harmonisation efforts in the context of T2S. These are the outcome of a transparent and constructive consultation process, cooperating with CSDs and market users. Let me just point to a few elements of the economic impact study which you can find on our website. This analysis confirms that the economic benefits of T2S will be substantial. Despite using rather conservative assumptions it shows that T2S has the potential to bring significant 2 BIS Review 79/2008 
benefits to both the securities market participants in particular and to the European economy in general. The analysis concludes that the costs of settlement can be reduced substantially from the 73 cents a CSD charges on average in the euro area (excluding communication costs) today to 32 cents per transaction under T2S.  The T2S benefits would be even higher if the CSDs of the UK, Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland were to join; in such a scenario the T2S settlement cost would decline to 21 cents, and the annual savings would range between EUR 220 million and EUR 340 million.  These numbers represent only the narrow business case, and do not capture – of course – the full dynamic impact of T2S arising from enhanced competition in a more complete single market for security settlement and related services. The Commission estimates the impact on EU welfare of such post-trading cost reductions to be in the range of EUR 1.1 billion to 1.6 billion.  Let me stress very clearly that while there is room for much discussion about the exact estimates I just mentioned, we definitely cannot contest the overall benefits of a more competitive and more integrated European financial market. You may wonder why I call for more competition but at the same time offer only one single settlement engine for Europe. The answer is in two parts. First, the alternative to what we offer is the creation of many cross CSD settlement links, which have to be highly efficient and safe. This has not been realised today, partly because of cost and partly because of commercial dynamics; and I suspect it would take many years for a suitable such network to become a reality. It is very likely that the cost and time would be better employed in providing cross border asset servicing, which is of course necessary to take full advantage of borderless settlement in T2S. This activity is high value-added, and can involve taking commercial risk; it is a clear priority for investment and effort by the private sector.  Second – in my view – there is unlikely to be much benefit in the form of innovation gains from preserving a multiplicity of competing platforms; and there is in any case likely to be competition from settlement in commercial bank money. Let me also stress that integration and harmonisation have become a core objective of the European Union; the European financial industry is requested to increase competitiveness by giving access to an efficient, state of the art financial infrastructure supporting a true single market. In this respect, T2S has been developed with harmonisation in mind. T2S will deliver and embody a significant amount of settlement harmonisation in important areas such as common interfaces, common set of rules for intra-day settlement finality, a common daily timetable, and common messages. These features are an immediate contribution to the elimination of 6 of the 15 so-called Giovannini barriers. For the future, we expect T2S to foster greater harmonisation efforts beyond the area of pure settlement, addressing more barriers – as already addressed in the current concept of T2S – of the kind identified by the Giovannini Group. Accordingly a Harmonisation Group will be established by the T2S Advisory Group to agree and implement an action plan for harmonisation with the support of market leaders.  It is likely to be necessary to harmonise market practices for – among others – repo instructions, collateral management procedures, auto collateralisation and multilateral settlements without a central counterparty.  And on top of this I expect that changes in legislation – where there is a credible consensus within the market that these produce significant benefits – will be proposed.  BIS Review 79/2008 3 
Before coming to an end, let me come back again to the decision that lies ahead of us. Since the participation of CSDs in the T2S project is voluntary, the ECB has asked all European CSDs to express – by 4 July 2008 – whether they support T2S. We are sure that CSDs will consult their clients and other stakeholders, many of whom have already expressed strong support. I would like to encourage all of you to express your views so that CSDs have a sound basis to decide on the future of the European settlement landscape.  Let me be very clear. The Eurosystem is ready to firmly commit to deliver T2S as a state-of-the-art settlement system to the market via the CSDs by 2013 at the latest. But it is also clear that the Eurosystem cannot do it alone. As substantial financial investments will need to be made for building T2S; we need the support and the commitment of the CSDs and their customers.  To conclude, I see T2S as Europe’s best route to a single securities settlement system, in which secure real time settlement in central bank money is provided across accounts held within a single platform, open to all. It will be operated by a neutral and trusted entity, the Eurosystem. Therefore, it can be relied on to operate in a transparent way and on a not for profit basis.  Let me also use this occasion, to express my warm “thank you” to all the stakeholders, the members of the national user groups, individuals and institutions who have worked together with the Eurosystem on the T2S project, for their openness and expertise and their contribution to the successful completion of work done so far. This is an example of how Europe can co-operate to harmonise and innovate in pursuit of the economic benefits of the single market. Nearly 10 years ago, the euro was introduced and is now the common currency of more than 320 million Europeans. The euro has been a great success in harmonising the exchange of cash across the euro area. Let us strive for a similar success in a harmonised security settlement market. It’s now time to implement the monetary union that we began 10 years ago in the post trading sector. I am sure we can do so with your support and co-operation.  Thank you very much. 4 BIS Review 79/2008 
Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London at the Mansion House, London, 18 June 2008. *      *      * My Lord Mayor, Mr Chancellor, My Lords, Ministers, Aldermen, Mr Recorder, Sheriffs, Ladies and Gentlemen: Can it really be only a year since we last met in this magnificent room? With the financial crisis continuing, I was tempted to deliver last year’s speech again. But that would not allow me to welcome the Chancellor to his first Mansion House Dinner as Chancellor. After the past – difficult – year, could I say, Chancellor, how much we at the Bank have appreciated the patience and good humour with which you have handled the “slings and arrows of outrageous fortune”. Over that year, the west wind of a credit crunch emanating from the United States and the east wind of higher energy and food prices resulting from the strength of Asian economies have been stirring up the waters through which our economic ship must pass. These two challenges of rising inflation and falling economic growth have led to a crop of doom-laden predictions best captured by my less well-known addition to the well-known words of Robert Frost: Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. But whichever it is It won’t be NICE. That “non-inflationary consistently expansionary” decade, as I described it in 2003, has drawn to a close. Yesterday we learnt that inflation in May rose to 3.3%. In line with our remit, I sent an open letter to the Chancellor. As I said in my letter, inflation is set to increase further over the next few months. Oil prices have doubled since the beginning of last year, and, in real terms, are now as high as they were in the 1970s. And further sharp increases in domestic gas and electricity prices are probably on their way. So what should the Monetary Policy Committee do in the face of this rise in inflation? The immediate cause of the current pickup in inflation is increases in food and energy prices relative to other prices. They are caused by the pressure of demand on the supply of food and energy in the world as a whole. Part of that pressure may well reflect expansionary monetary policy in the world as a whole. But the rise in commodity prices cannot, by itself, generate sustained inflation in the United Kingdom unless we allow it to. We will not. So although inflation in the UK will rise in the short term, inflation will then fall back. That means that the rate of increase of other prices and domestic costs, notably pay, must remain low. The MPC does not take that for granted. Surveys – including our own – indicate that expectations of inflation have risen, meaning that inflation is likely to have some tendency to persist. That is why, as I explained in my letter to the Chancellor, we believe that a slowdown in the economy this year, creating a margin of spare capacity, will be necessary to dampen price and wage pressures and ensure that we fulfil our remit by returning inflation to the target. And growth is now slowing quite sharply – broad money growth is falling, business surveys point to particularly weak output growth in the second quarter and growth is likely to remain subdued for the rest of the year. Where Bank rate will ultimately need to move to bring inflation back to target is impossible to judge now. Decisions on Bank Rate will be made one month at a time in the careful way that the MPC has developed over more than ten years. But there should be no doubt that the BIS Review 79/2008 1 
MPC is prepared to take whatever action is needed to return inflation to the 2% target and to keep expectations of inflation in the medium term anchored to the target. The fact that growth and inflation are heading in opposite directions has led some commentators to question our monetary framework. Target growth not inflation is the cry. I could not disagree more. This is precisely the situation in which the framework of inflation targeting is so necessary. Without it, what should be a short-lived, albeit sharp, rise in inflation, could become sustained. Without a clear guide to the objective of monetary policy, and a credible commitment to meeting it, any rise in inflation might become a self-fulfilling and generalised increase in prices and wages. And surely the lesson of the past fifty years is that, when inflation becomes embedded, the cost of getting it back down again is a prolonged period of sluggish output and high unemployment. Price stability – returning inflation to the target – is a precondition for sustained growth, not an alternative. We are in the most challenging period since the MPC was set up in 1997. But we have the right framework in place to ensure that inflation returns to the target and growth recovers. The stormy waters we are navigating now make for an uncomfortable passage compared with the calm conditions of the nice decade. Our inflation performance then was surprising not so much because inflation was low, but because it was so remarkably stable. Neither inflation nor growth are likely to be as stable in the future. But even if inflation proves to be more variable, it will not be systematically either higher or lower than the target. The right framework is essential if we are to maintain low inflation and steady growth. But there are two recent developments in our economy at present that no monetary policy, whatever the framework, can prevent. The first is the impact on living standards of rising food and energy prices. These prices have risen relative to most other prices. Monetary policy should not, and in the end cannot, prevent such changes in relative prices. They will show up either in higher consumer prices or in a lower level of other prices and pay. Either way, the result is the same – a loss of real purchasing power. This year our real take-home pay will rise at a slower pace than national productivity. Rising fuel, gas, electricity and food prices, mean that average real take-home pay will stagnate this year. It will not be an easy time, and I know that some families will find it particularly difficult. But it is only a temporary slowing in the growth of our real take-home pay and remember that this is the opposite side of the coin to the falls in prices of manufactured goods from countries such as China and India, which in the nice decade allowed our standard of living to rise at a rate faster than productivity. The squeeze on real take-home pay will arguably be an even more significant restraint on consumer spending this year than the credit crunch. And it will affect the housing market too – lower demand in the high street will go hand in hand with lower demand in the property market. I have said in the past that there is no causal link between house prices and consumer spending. That remains the case. How closely they move together depends on the underlying forces that are driving them both. This year, the squeeze on real income growth is likely to mean that both house prices and consumer spending weaken together. The housing market leads me to the second recent development – the reassessment and re-pricing of risk in the financial sector. It is clear that the housing market is being severely affected by the reluctance of the banking system to expand its balance sheet further. Banks are adjusting to the fact that many asset markets are unlikely to re-open in their old form and, as they do so, the supply of mortgage finance is being restricted. Once the adjustment in the financial sector is complete, banks will be able to resume lending. But the era of cheap mortgage finance that underpinned the housing market in 2006 and the first half of 2007 is over and, as a result, it is reasonable to expect the ratio of house prices to incomes to fall back, though with real interest rates still low by the standards of the past fifty years, not to previous averages. 2 BIS Review 79/2008 
These changes to our spending power and to the housing market are “real” shifts that, although not easy to accept, we cannot side-step. Lord Mayor, we face the most difficult economic challenge for two decades. But I am confident that we can meet it. Inflation will fall back and growth will recover. But the cost of the necessary adjustment will depend on the credibility of the framework for monetary stability. After all, the value of paper money rests on only one thing – trust. Trust in the ability and determination of those setting interest rates to maintain the value of money. Central to that is the independence of the Bank of England. An independent central bank has, over time and around the world, proved to be a cornerstone of the arrangements necessary to underpin trust in paper money. So, Chancellor, I welcome your intention to introduce a proper process for making appointments to positions on the Monetary Policy Committee. I welcome too, Chancellor, the announcements you made tonight about the shape of a new framework for financial stability to be embodied in a Banking Bill. I particularly welcome the new responsibilities for the Bank of England and associated reforms to our governance. We now have the chance to put in place a set of reforms that provide a coherent framework for banking regulation. It is an opportunity we must not throw away. I can assure you all that the Bank of England will devote time and resources to meeting the new responsibilities which the Chancellor plans to give us. Lord Mayor, shortly after assuming office, you were quoted as saying, “I think like a lawyer. I’m very prudent, very risk-averse”. What a pity you weren’t running a bank a year or two ago! But in a difficult year for the City you have provided leadership and thrown yourself into the enormous workload of your office. Tonight all of us here would like to pay tribute to your work since you became Lord Mayor, and to thank both the Lady Mayoress and yourself for the splendid hospitality which you have extended to us all this evening. So I invite you all to rise and join me in the traditional toast of good health and prosperity to "The Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress, David and Theresa Lewis". BIS Review 79/2008 3 
Caleb M Fundanga: Access to finance – corporate governance and sustainability Opening remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the official opening of the Microfinance and Small to Medium Enterprises Conference on “Access to Finance: Corporate Governance and Sustainability”, Lusaka, 17 June 2008. *      *      * • Honourable Felix Mutati, MP – Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry;  • Mr Michael Mundashi – Non-Executive Director Standard Chartered Bank;  • Mrs Mizinga Melu – Managing Director Standard Chartered Bank  • Mr Prashant Thakker – Global Head of Microfinance Institutions of Standard CharteredBank • Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen I am honoured to have this opportunity to make keynote remarks at this conference on Microfinance Institutions and Small to Medium Enterprises organised by Standard Chartered Bank, whose theme is “Access to Finance: Corporate Governance and Sustainability”. I wish to extend a warm welcome to all participants, particularly those that have travelled from outside the country. I hope that you will find time to see some of the tourist spots of Lusaka and experience the warm hospitality that Zambia has to offer. Distinguished Guests, following the liberalisation of the Zambian economy in the early 1990’s, the number of small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) has increased significantly as the Government divested from running business in the economy to pave way for increased participation of the private sector. For instance, in the mining sector, the supply of goods and services has been taken up by private companies including those that can be classified as SMEs. Similarly, the transport sector, which was dominated by Government through the United Bus Company of Zambia (UBZ), Zambia Railways and Zambia Airways, etc, is now largely run by the private sector, consisting mostly of small and medium entrepreneurs. One can go on to mention the tourism, manufacturing, real estate, construction and others. This development is of great benefit to the economy in general and individual entrepreneurs in particular. Therefore, small- and medium-scale enterprises have the potential to make a significant contribution to the growth of the economy, thereby improving the economic welfare of the population. As you may know, SMEs in Zambia often have a direct impact on community development. Since they are usually based in places where the owners live, they draw upon the community for their workforce and rely on it to do business. They provide employment, particularly for low-skilled workers, as well as women and the youth, who usually make up the greatest proportion of the unemployed. However, this sector has faced difficulties in accessing credit for working capital and expansion of their investments. Mr Chairman, even if more SMEs wished to modernise their plant and equipment, they would find it hard to do so because of the difficulty of obtaining financing. Many banks choose not to provide credit to SMEs as they are perceived to be more risky and yet less profitable. Some banks that might want to make such loans may lack the knowledge of how to make small loans and package them appropriately. The other challenge lenders have to work with in assessing SMEs for them to access credit is the lack of reliable data. For example, data on the share of bank credit to SMEs are almost non-existent in Zambia. Even in banks where credit data are available from credit registries, in most cases they do not include information about the size of firms. Any estimates regarding the share of credit to SMEs have to rely on proxies, such as the size of loans. BIS Review 79/2008 1 
Mr Chairman, it is clear that lending to SMEs is different from lending to large firms. In the case of young firms, it is more difficult to acquire information. Moreover, given the small size of the loans, it does not pay for the bank to undertake a detailed review of the creditworthiness of SMEs. Thus, for SME lending to be profitable, banks must experiment with new approaches and technologies for risk assessment and loan management. Such experimentation produces positive externalities by generating knowledge that is difficult for the bank to keep for itself, since trained agents can leave the bank to work with competitors. The other benefit we get from SMEs is that when there are adverse shocks in the market, their small size and flexibility allow them to speedily adjust to market changes. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is encouraging to note that, in the recent past, banks and non-bank financial institutions have expanded their provision of finance to SMEs, although there is still a lot of room for further improvement. We have recognised that a long-term strategy for SMEs calls for action across a wide range of policy domains, including education, research and development, financial sector regulations, competitive policies and a sound banking sector. These actions should address the need to create a healthier overall economic environment in which the business sector, SMEs in particular, operate. All key stakeholders should therefore strive to put in place SME-specific policies and programmes that provide the sector with the support it needs to prosper. The banks are not an exception in this regard. The most recent statement of policies for SMEs are outlined in the Fifth National Development Plan, and they are in line with the country‘s long-term economic programme as enunciate in the Vision 2030. The primary stated objective of this policy is to create conditions conducive to sustainable growth in a structural context of private sector participation, openness and enhancing efficiency within a competitive environment. In order to enhance their contribution to economic growth, the Government during the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP) period is focusing on addressing constraints that have negatively impacted on the performance of the manufacturing sector. One of the specific interventions in assisting enterprises, particularly the SMEs, is to access affordable finance. As major players in credit provision, Banks have an urgent challenge to provide products that are suitable to SMEs and within their reach. Honourable Minister, at current levels, interest rates are too high for the SMEs to access credit. We urge banks and other financial institutions to continue reviewing the cost of borrowing as part of the process to improve SMEs access to the much needed finances to expand their operations, employ more people, and thereby provide impetus to significantly reduce poverty rates in the country. Honourable Minister, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, in view of the financing gap for the SMEs, the microfinance sector in Zambia has taken a leading role to fill this vacuum. However, the services provided by the microfinance institutions fall short of meeting the demands of SMEs. The sector can be said to be relatively young with the pioneers being established in the early 1990’s. Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to note that the conference will also focus on the very important aspect of corporate governance. Corporate governance is vital to building a solid, efficient and sustainable financial system and growth of businesses. Without these sound foundations, the institutions capable of reaching out to the poorest in society will never be encouraged. It is generally agreed that there is a strong link between corporate governance and access to finance. The following are some of the attributes of an enterprise with good corporate governance: 2 BIS Review 79/2008 
(i) A well managed and coordinated company; (ii) Role and duties are clarified; (iii) Easier access to finance; (iv) Financial awareness and the ability to respond quickly; (v) Significant reduction in business risk and corporate failure; and (vi) Increase in monetary value of the firm. In the case of Zambia, a BoZ Microfinance Survey of 1999 highlighted that most of the MFIs were inadequately capitalised and had weak corporate governance structures. The survey also pointed out that there were about 98 MFIs operating across the country in an unregulated environment. The study further revealed that the nature of microfinance business in Zambia was generally targeted at the lower income group which have limited or no access to financial institutions offering financial services such as credit or savings. Following the study, broad consultations were held with various stakeholders, including Government, commercial banks and other financial institutions, and the general public. The purpose of the consultations was to ensure that the development of legislation relating to the microfinance sector was as comprehensive and appropriate as possible. The consultations by the Bank of Zambia were extended to various countries to obtain international best practice that could be of benefit to our local environment. Therefore, in order to ensure that the MFI sector grows in a sustainable manner and to protect public deposits, the BoZ developed the Banking and Financial Services “Microfinance Regulations” which came into effect on 31 January 2006. The Regulations were aimed at strengthening the sector and ensuring accountability and transparency in operations and providing effective smooth integration of the sector into the mainstream financial sector. Honourable Minister, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, at the time of the coming into effect of the Microfinance Regulations, there were only three microfinance institutions licensed by the Bank of Zambia. Today, the number of licensed microfinance institutions has increased to thirteen. This number is expected to increase further in light of the additional applications that are currently being considered. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is pleasing to see the extent to which commercial banks are working at providing financial services to the medium and small scale entrepreneurs. This is so because such financial inclusion is bound to lead to wealth creation. It is imperative that commercial banks, in providing financial services, ensure that the projects they are supporting are financially viable. The role of the commercial bank, in this regard, goes beyond sifting out unviable projects and providing finance for the best projects. As Bank of Zambia, we are pleased to see that the private sector, especially banks, are now taking steps to partner with Government in working towards reduction of poverty through increased provision of financial services to a wider clientele. We are also pleased to witness the unique partnership between Banks and MFIs and SMEs on sharing skills and experiences in areas of common interest. This is key to creation of common understanding. I wish to conclude by urging participants, to actively participate in the deliberations of this conference. I am certain that this conference will benefit both the local institutions and our visitors from abroad.  BIS Review 79/2008 3 
Once again, I would like to thank Standard Chartered Bank Zambia Plc, for organising such an important workshop for MFIs and SMEs. Honourable Minister, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I thank you. 4 BIS Review 79/2008 
Caleb M Fundanga: The new K10,000 banknote in Zambia Opening remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the official launch of the new K10,000 banknote, Bank of Zambia, Lusaka, 16 June 2008. *      *      * • Members of the Press • Official from commercial banks present • Ladies and Gentlemen I wish to welcome you all to the Bank of Zambia. The objective of this Press Briefing is to announce the introduction of the new K10,000 banknote in our economy. The new K10,000 banknote will be put into circulation as early as this week. By showing you the new K10,000 banknote first, we expect that you will, in turn, help us to inform the public about this new banknote. In order for us to help you understand the new K10,000 banknote, we have produced posters and will make a short power point presentation. The posters are showing the main public recognition and security features of the new K10,000 banknote. Let me from the outset inform you that although we are calling it a new K10,000 banknote, most of the features on the banknote are still the same as those on the current K10,000 banknotes. The differences can best be detected by comparing this new K10,000 banknote with the current K10,000 banknotes in circulation. Ladies and Gentlemen The new features on the K10,000 banknote are as follows: (1) On the front of the banknote – there is a new bright silver demetallised holographic lead representing a fish eagle. This has replaced the old hologram of the head of a fish eagle. (2) On the back of the banknote –the area around the value numeral, K10,000 in the right top corner, is printed with a special ink which shifts colour from copper to green when angle of view is changed. These are the two changes that have been made to the K10,000 banknote. All other features are basically the same. The reason for the introduction of these two features is mainly to enhance the security of the banknote. The Bank of Zambia would further like to inform the public that the new K10,000 banknote and the current circulating K10,000 banknotes shall circulate side by side. The new and current banknotes will therefore all be legal tender. The current K10,000 banknotes will be replaced by the new K10,000 banknote once they reach the end of their lifespan through soiling and/or mutilation. Therefore, I urge you to take a closer look at the new K10,000 banknote in order to inform the public correctly. I thank you. BIS Review 78/2008 1 
Radovan Jelašić: Corporate social responsibility and protection of the rights of the disabled Speech by Mr Radovan Jelašić, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, at the Conference on Corporate Social Responsibility and Protection of the Rights of the Disabled, Belgrade, 9 June 2008. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, It is a true honour for the National Bank of Serbia to be a member of the Serbian Global Compact network and the UNDP’s local partner in promoting it. The Serbian Global Compact network already boasts 26 members, which will, no doubt, contribute to this initiative as much as they can. One of the key principles underlying the Global Compact is the protection of human and labour rights.  Disabled persons in Serbia live in an environment of discrimination and prejudice, for which we alone are to blame, not only as citizens, but as employers as well. I am absolutely sure that we can count on full cooperation of disabled persons and their organizations, and that the ball is in our court now – it is the citizens and employers who should provide their undivided support to the disabled. The employers attending the conference have made a huge step forward in this respect by the sheer fact of coming here today. They did not turn a blind eye to the disabled persons’ issue or shelved it away as the “problem of the state” – we are the state.  I sometimes have a feeling, and practice has confirmed it too, that foreign and private-owned companies tend to do a lot more in the area of corporate social responsibility and protection of the rights of the disabled than public enterprises. Although the problems that the disabled face day to day are countless, some of the most common ones include: lack of social responsibility, prejudice, inadequacy or inadequate implementation of existing legislation and regulations, and lack of access to transportation. And while the state can and should solve a number of these issues, there is plenty of work for us, too.  Let us begin from the basics: who is to blame for the inaccessibility of buildings and public institutions (the National Bank of Serbia being one of them) to the disabled? I will not even try to pin the blame on somebody else. I am to be blamed, I and my colleagues for not having done enough to put things right. Last week the National Bank of Serbia received from the Centre for the Development of Inclusive Society the results of an expert study based on which our office buildings will be entirely adjusted to the needs of the disabled. By the end of the year, our buildings, most notably the one in the Slavija Square, will be accessible to everybody. In addition to this, the National Bank of Serbia organizes visits for the disabled to the money museum in our head office building (12 Kralja Petra Street). Therefore, I would like to use this opportunity to invite all of the people present here to give us a call and set up the time and date of their visit – and we are ready to cover a part of the costs involved. Today’s conference is an opportunity for me and my colleagues to acquire some specific knowledge and to hear about the experience of other people in this area, which will hopefully help us all in performing our public functions better.  In terms of hiring disabled persons, as the governor of the National Bank of Serbia, which is an institution of public significance, I can only say that I see no reason for waiting for the adoption of the Law on the Employment of the Disabled. I am deeply convinced that public institutions should take the lead in this respect and set an example for the private businesses. The NBS will resort to affirmative action in its staff recruitment so as to give the disabled a chance to become equal members of the society, which they will never become without jobs or stable income. And now let us look at the socially responsible practices of the BIS Review 78/2008 1 
NBS: this year, the National Bank will give three scholarships to final year students, who will be obligated to work for the NBS once they complete their studies. More information on this will be available on our website. Once the adaptation of our office buildings is completed, we will be able to increase the number of students doing their summer practice program in the NBS by five students with disabilities.  Finally, I would like to invite all the interested participants to gather again in September to exchange ideas and consult on the drafting of a public strategy on the employment of people with disabilities. And all of this for one single reason – to MAKE OUR SERBIA MORE BEAUTIFUL AND ITS PEOPLE HAPPIER. 2 BIS Review 78/2008 
Christian Noyer: International financial stability and the role of central banks in the crisis Address by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, at the Plenary session: “The international economy in transition” of the Montreal Conference, Montreal, 9 June 2008. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great honour for me to take part in this conference and to set out, before such a distinguished audience, my thoughts on the role of central banks regarding financial stability in the current environment. I should like to organise these thoughts around the following five questions: 1) Do central banks have a role to play regarding financial stability? 2) What have they done since the start of the financial turmoil in the summer of 2007? 3) Were they right to take these steps? 4) Why have they responded differently as regards their monetary policy stance? 5) What lessons can we learn for the future? 1)  Do central banks have a role to play regarding financial stability? This question might appear paradoxical when we recall that historically the raison d’être of central banks has been to ensure financial stability, that is, the smooth functioning of financial markets and payment systems. In this context, they play the role of the ultimate liquidity provider, in other words, of lender of last resort. However, some people now regard this role as inconsistent with that which in the meantime has universally become the primary task of central banks, i.e. ensuring price stability. Three main arguments are generally put forward to support this view: - The first is that central banks have only one instrument at their disposal, i.e. the interest rate, and that this instrument, by virtue of Tinbergen’s Principle, can only be assigned to a single objective, that of price stability. Other means – particularly regulatory or prudential measures – would be better suited to and more effective in ensuring financial stability. But the current crisis demonstrates that central banks actually have several instruments at their disposal. Indeed, liquidity management in periods of financial turmoil needs to be separated from the issue of the monetary policy stance. To put it more clearly, the monetary policy stance simply consists in setting key interest rates at a level consistent with the central bank’s macroeconomic objectives, whilst liquidity management aims to enable the money market, and financial markets in general, to function “normally” so that monetary policy impulses may be efficiently transmitted to the rest of the economy. - The second argument is policy-based in nature and postulates that monetary stability is a necessary and sufficient prerequisite for ensuring financial stability. The latter would then be a welcome consequence of the implementation of an inflation targeting strategy, which consists in only responding to shocks that have a lasting impact on medium-term price stability. Here again, the argument does not hold up in the face of the facts since the financial crisis unfolded in an environment of low interest rates and contained inflationary pressures in spite of soaring property and commodity prices, in short, in a context where price stability seemed well secured. The same was true for the previous bubble that formed on stock markets. A low BIS Review 78/2008 1 
interest rate environment, which often makes agents less vigilant about risk or makes them less able to gauge it, combined with very strong central bank credibility, is in no way a guarantee of financial stability. This is one of the manifestations of what some economists have termed the paradox of credibility. - The third argument relates to the extraordinary transformation that our financial systems have undergone over the past few years, with a growing, if not predominant, role for market financing at the expense of bank intermediation. Yet the operational framework of central banks, by means of which they perform their role of lender of last resort, is mainly focused on banks, and retail banks in particular. Here again, the facts prove the opposite. The crisis has shown that banks remain at the heart of the financial system and that, as a consequence, the operational framework of central banks remains entirely effective. In addition, this framework makes it possible to reach other market participants, such as broker-dealers and investment banks. 2)  What have central banks done since the start of the financial turmoil? The overall impression in the press is that central banks have injected vast amounts of liquidity into the banking system in order to face up to the crisis. This is not true to reality. In volume terms, the amount of liquidity allocated by the Eurosystem has posted slow growth since the summer of 2007. On the other hand, during the crisis, some central banks, such as the Fed and the Bank of England, have had to make adjustments to their operational framework, while others, like the ECB, have been able to rely on their existing framework, up until very recently. This has resulted in a remarkable convergence of central banks’ operational frameworks and fields of intervention around four main areas: - a lengthening of maturities for central bank lending: these maturities have been increased from a few weeks to a few months. In the case of the Eurosystem, a major share of refinancing operations have a maturity of three months, and, recently, a six-month facility has been introduced; - a widening of the range of eligible collateral, i.e. the securities used as collateral. Securities such as ABS and RMBS, which have always been accepted by the Eurosystem, are now accepted by all other major central banks; - an extension of the list of eligible counterparties, in particular in the United States, where investment banks now have access to the Fed’s lending facility; - a greater degree of coordination between central banks: this not only includes joint statements aimed at reassuring the markets about the provision of liquidity when the need arises, but also the signing of swap agreements between central banks. This facility enables any European bank which needs US dollars to pursue its activities to secure this funding from the ECB or the SNB. 3)  Were central banks right to take these steps? The fast spillover of the US subprime crisis to other market segments, and subsequently to other countries through the seizing up of the commercial paper market and the major strains on money and interbank markets, called for rapid central bank intervention. This not only included providing liquidity to the market as a whole but also, in some countries, granting emergency liquidity assistance to systemic institutions. These interventions have raised a number of questions: did not central banks, by adapting their operational framework to fit the circumstances, increase moral hazard? Did they not unduly save institutions that did not deserve to be saved, in particular those which had taken 2 BIS Review 78/2008 
excessive risks? Did they comply with the traditional principles expounded by Bagehot many years ago, i.e. lend to temporarily illiquid but solvent financial institutions, lend at penalty rates against sound collateral, and provide liquidity to any institution satisfying the aforementioned solvency and collateral criteria? These essential questions are, however, mainly academic. Today, they take on different dimensions. Indeed, all financial crises cause a downward spiral in asset prices, which before long transforms a temporarily illiquid institution into an insolvent institution, making Bagehot’s initial distinction difficult to apply. This situation is exacerbated in our developed financial systems by the joint application of new accounting standards requiring fair value measurement for financial assets and prudential arrangements that may prove partly pro-cyclical. In this context, central banks have the clear duty of preventing the market from seizing up, with incalculable consequences for other financial players and more generally for the real economy. However, it should be borne in mind that the central banks’ criteria for accepting assets as collateral for their refinancing operations are particularly restrictive and penalising, and comply with the traditional principles that I have just mentioned. In particular, the value of these securities must be at least equal to the amount lent and the accrued interest, after applying a haircut to take account of a possible decline in their market value during the repo. 4)  Why have the central banks responded differently as regards their monetary policy stance? As regards the central banks’ response to the crisis, although they converged in their short-term liquidity management methods, they nonetheless responded differently in terms of monetary policy. The underlying reasons for this divergence are both due to the nature of the shocks that the economies are facing and the mechanisms of their propagation to the real economy and to nominal variables. Over the recent period, the industrialised economies have undergone three common shocks: rocketing real-estate prices at least in a number of countries, soaring commodity prices and finally the financial crisis triggered last summer. They have also experienced specific shocks: the real-estate crisis in the United States in a context of household overindebtedness, for example. In the latter case, the economic slowdown already underway since mid-2006 and the expected consequences of the credit crisis on economic activity over the medium term has led the US monetary authorities to change their monetary policy stance. The very different situation in the euro area, where activity remained favourable, has led the ECB to keep its monetary policy stance unchanged in spite of the uncertainties generated by the financial crisis in a context also characterised by persistent inflationary tensions. 5)  What lessons can we learn for the future? At the current juncture, financial turmoil is still affecting the markets. However, after more than nine months, I think it is already possible to draw first conclusions in three main areas: - First, the close co-operation between central banks on the one hand and between the supervisory authorities and central banks on the other hand seems, in my opinion, to be a determining factor for efficient crisis management. This point was indeed underscored during the recent work carried out by the Financial Stability Forum. I must say in this respect that the French model of banking supervision, in which banking supervisors have close ties with the central bank, has once again proven its worth in the current context. The necessity of this proximity has also been BIS Review 78/2008 3 
increased by the new accounting and prudential standards which have proven to be pro-cyclical and in which liquidity and solvency are intertwined. In this context, when in a financial crisis, it is crucial to cross-check, at every moment, information on the evolution of banks balance sheet and data on money market functioning in order to assess the risks to financial stability. Such an assessment enables to adapt, as far as needed, the refinancing policy of the central bank, in order to alleviate tensions in the market; those tension being a threat both to financial stability and to the effectiveness of the transmission of monetary policy. - Second, with regard to monetary policy, let me reiterate that one must carefully distinguish between the monetary policy stance on the one hand, which should remain focused on the macroeconomic objective of price stability in the medium term, and the refinancing conditions of the banking system on the other hand, that may have to be adapted in times of financial turmoil. Moreover, a solid anchoring of inflation expectations seems to me particularly crucial in a period of economic and financial uncertainty. - Last but not least, in my view, regulatory issues related to the increase of financial innovation over the recent period of rapid market growth should now be a matter of primary concern. Moreover, the return of greater market discipline, closer monitoring of risks by market participants and quite simply the use of commonsense principles, such as acknowledging that there is no such thing as low risk/high return assets, are in my view prerequisites for a return of confidence to the markets. 4 BIS Review 78/2008 
Paul Tucker: A protracted “peacetime” Remarks by Mr Paul Tucker, Executive Director and Member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, at the Chatham House Conference on “The new financial frontiers”, London, 29 April 2008. *      *      * The turmoil and stress in the global financial system has now been going on for nine months or more. Much has been said about the “wartime” conduct of the authorities, the banking industry and asset managers. But the seeds of the current stresses, and many of the remaining risks, lie in the preceding period of “peacetime”. The main purpose of my remarks this morning is to underline that the community must not in the future lose sight of the need to head off the risks that can creep up during a prolonged period of “peace”. The recent period of peacetime was long enough for substantial macroeconomic imbalances to build up, globally and domestically. Long enough for innovations in financial intermediation to mask, from many, the degree of leverage in the system. Long enough for many to assume that funding structures could be chosen on the basis of deep liquidity being maintained in a range of new asset markets. Long enough for most with long memories to be tending their gardens. Long enough for the international authorities to think they would get time to fix problems in the regulatory capital regime before they gave rise to serious problems (such as the zero-weighting of 364-day lines of credit, which underlay the profusion of bank-like conduits etc). Long enough for many to proceed on the basis that “it couldn’t happen” or, indeed even after it began, “wasn’t happening”. Long enough, crucially, for investors to get too used to elevated returns. Those returns came largely from two sources. The fall in risk-free rates, brought about by an ex ante imbalance of global savings and investment; and the fall in risk premia, which may in part have flowed from improved monetary policy regimes around the world. The ensuing Search for Yield can be thought of as asset managers and bankers wanting to sustain into the future the fabulous ex post returns “achieved” as asset prices rose. Its main engines were leverage, and maturity transformation. A cocktail that not only raised private risks for asset managers and lenders, but also systemic risks. The upshot has been a protracted, and not yet concluded, period of deleveraging. That, in the great scheme of things, relatively small US subprime mortgage delinquencies could set this off shows just how fragile the system had become. Structural changes in the financial system really matter As commentators struggle to make sense of this, a lot has been said about the “originate and distribute” model of financial intermediation. Three comments on that. First, not enough was done to reflect changes in business models in disclosure regimes and practices. In some distant world, banks in, say, Germany were exposed largely to German companies and households; and similarly Californian banks to Californian borrowers and projects. So if conditions deteriorated in Germany, California or wherever, the markets would be alert to the need to scrutinise the “home” banks operating in those regions or sectors. In today’s world, the markets knew that risk really had been dispersed. But they did not know where it might be concentrated; and, crucially, did not know how or how far it might flow back to the banking sector and so towards the core of the payments system that supports our BIS Review 77/2008 1 
monetary economy. It is in the interests of banks themselves – and certainly in the interests of their creditors and shareholders – to make those risks clearer in future; and if they do so, they will face stronger incentives to avoid risk concentrations. But my second point is that talk of the shift to “Originate & Distribute” can be overdone. Many of the largest global banks seem to have occupied a half-way house. They retained large positions on what amounted to a view that macroeconomic conditions could never get so bad as to cause material impairment, but booked them to portfolios that were marked-to-market (or to models). That left them exposed to a deterioration in financial conditions, particularly in liquidity, and so to a fall in “market” prices way beyond anything they contemplated, or perhaps still contemplate, for fundamental impairment. This is the mentality of traditional “banking book” risk assessment grafted on to post-Glass Steagall “trading book” valuations and financial accounting. As the regime currently works, mark-to-market is not – or, rather, cannot be – just an accounting convention; it needs to be a culture, or way of life, for those who adopt it. The dynamics of a financial system in which the vast majority employ MTM accounting, irrespective of their declared holding periods, are fundamentally different from one in which just a few “market-makers” do so. Third, therefore, the rules and infrastructure supporting the financial system need to help it withstand stress. Accounting and valuation policies is one such area, now being debated. Another is the trading and clearing platforms themselves. The authorities must do what they can to encourage the industry to focus on whether more wholesale market activity could and should be conducted across central trading and clearing platforms rather than OTC. In the past, intermediaries have tended to be doubtful about this. But it is plausible that the system would have been somewhat more resilient if “vanilla” products had been subjected to the minimum standards, greater pre and post-trade transparency, and centrally set margin requirements that accompany transacting across central infrastructure. The underlying point here is that the bodies providing such central infrastructure have a clear interest in effective system-wide risk management and stability, and can be monitored by the authorities. For the authorities internationally, the moral of the story is that they must take an interest, from a systemic perspective, in the regimes which govern, and drive changes in, the structure and behaviour of the financial system. That means maintaining that interest during peacetime, not just a necessary rush of activity after crises occur. In setting the rules of the game, the authorities need to strike a trade off between risk and efficiency. We could reduce the risk in the system by stifling innovation. But in order to choose to tilt the balance towards innovation and efficiency, the authorities need to be confident that they have regimes that, amongst other things, (i) are effective in mopping up the mess, and (ii) do not create bad long-term incentives. Orthodoxy is to cut off incipient systemic stress at the pass: intervene early, and decisively, but leaving losses with the private sector and afterwards rejigging the structure of the system to contain the implications for future behaviour. For that, tools are needed. In very broad terms, this is precisely what the Special Resolution Regime for banks and improved deposit insurance proposed by the UK authorities are about. They are tools the authorities need to contain the disruption caused when bank failures occur and so to make such individual firm failures tolerable. But we also need policies for containing systemic stress more generally; and, if possible, for heading off the risk of systemic problems in the first place. Like others, in speeches I have identified three elements in that armoury: monetary policy; central bank liquidity policy; and policies towards bank capitalisation and liquidity. Monetary policy I have for some years openly queried the notion that it is enough to rely on monetary policy “mopping up” after the event. 2 BIS Review 77/2008 
The “mopping up” doctrine came out of a view that monetary authorities could not spot bubbles but that policy could cushion the bursting of what turned out to be a bubble. The doctrine effectively assumes that, faced with the possibility of systemic stress, the monetary authority can always reduce its policy rate without taking risks with inflation. The current conjuncture tests that assumption. There is a nasty shock to demand from tightening credit conditions, here and abroad. And that may get worse rather than better in the coming months. So far, the financial system has faced a “trading book” problem; but we cannot rule out a “banking book” problem caused by rising defaults. We face a race involving whether the deleveraging process can be sufficiently advanced for financial conditions to stabilise before macroeconomic slowdown, here and abroad, raises loan defaults and so brings a new dimension to the challenges in the banking sector and so to the supply of credit to the real economy. But, absolutely crucially, we also face a nasty shock to costs from rising commodity prices and sterling’s depreciation. That is going to push up UK inflation over the next few months, creating a risk of upward pressure on pay and higher inflation expectations. The MPC’s strategy to date has been clear: to offset part but not all of the shock to demand, consistent with an overriding determination to maintain medium-term inflation expectations anchored to the 2% target. The path of rates will depend on judgments about the balance of those risks to the inflation outlook. And, in the context of my remarks today, that is different from a “mopping up” strategy involving simply reducing rates enough to offset estimates of the effect of the demand shock plus some insurance on top of that. Central bank liquidity policy: the Social Contract If monetary policy has been constrained in alleviating the consequences of the financial turmoil, so too, for different reasons, has central bank liquidity policy in many centres. For over a century – coincident with the development of central banking – there has effectively been a Social Contract between the banking system and the authorities. On one side of the Contract, commercial banks have been permitted to profit from maturity transformation, turning liquid savings into illiquid loans. Commercial banks’ ability to do this relies on their deposit liabilities being a universally acceptable means of payment, money. But maturity transformation – borrowing short to lend long – is risky; it relies on confidence. And if that confidence cracks, the costs are felt not just by the customers and shareholders of the banks concerned, but more widely in the economy given the potential disruption to the payments system. Our monetary economy relies on stability in the banking system. The other side of the Contract has, accordingly, had three elements designed to protect the economy from those risks. First, prudential regulation of banks, to contain their risk taking and so reduce the likelihood of confidence cracking. Second, deposit insurance, to make retail depositors more or less whole in the event of failure notwithstanding that regulation. And thirdly, central bank liquidity policy. Essentially, central banks have stood ready to provide unlimited amounts of liquidity against good collateral at a rate above the market rate prevailing during peacetime.12  During the recent turmoil, that last part of the Contract broke down because borrowing from the central bank via premium-rate facilities became stigmatised.                                                  1  In Lombard Street (1873), Bagehot talks about high rates of interest rather than penalty rates as such. This is in part because he was writing in the context of the gold standard regime, in which systemic stress was often associated with an external flight of credit and so rising short-term interest rates (see pages 56 and 57); in part because Bagehot thought about the premium in terms of comparisons with normal conditions (page 197). 2  This is to be distinguished from support operations for individual institutions. BIS Review 77/2008 3 
This could not have been more important. It has made innovation in central banks’ liquidity provision imperative during the turmoil. And, when we regain peacetime, reforms will be needed to avoid a recurrence of this problem. Open-market operations (or auctions) against wider collateral, and the Bank’s Special Liquidity Scheme launched on 21 April, should both be seen in that light. Such measures need to be constructed so that they do not interfere with the implementation of monetary policy, which depends on the central bank’s net supply of reserves matching demand in the economy so as to stabilise (risk free, or secured) overnight money market interest rates broadly in line with the policy rate. The monetary part of central banks’ market operations is simply the injection of reserves. The other characteristics – counterparties, maturity, collateral etc – are essentially non-monetary interventions. In most circumstances, central banks want to make them as neutral as possible, so as not to interfere with relative asset prices in the economy. When markets break down, however, central banks may need to calibrate their interventions to contain the spillovers to the economy. Thus the SLS is designed to underpin the liquidity of the banking system, and so confidence in the system as a whole. Taming the credit cycle But can we, the authorities, do more to avoid the system getting into such a fragile state in the first place? We really must consider how to do that. At the level of the system, the underlying issue is not that bankers are wicked or stupid. There is, though, a nasty collective action problem. In the period leading up to the turmoil, many market participants on both sides of the Atlantic thought financial risk was under priced, especially in credit markets. But they did not know when the correction would come, or indeed that it would definitely come abruptly. Each feared that by “stepping off the bus” before their competitors, they would crystallise “business risk” as customers and activity flowed away from them. This seems to point to the need for some kind of intervention by the authorities. And, perhaps with hindsight, it is baffling that the authorities internationally contented themselves with issuing warnings. What instruments might the authorities have? There are already welcome exercises underway to make the Basel Capital Accord less procyclical. The accountancy world is also moving towards understanding that its policies affect behaviour and so system-wide conditions. On both these fronts, the design of micro measures affects macro outcomes. At a more macro level, we need to debate whether or not it would be feasible to design discretionary levers that the authorities could employ as credit-cycle circuit breakers. Candidates include the authorities adjusting industry-wide benchmark capital requirements or margin requirements to slow commercial banks’ supply of leverage to the financial system during the upswing. The debate needs to be international, as capital flows freely across borders and so the capability of national authorities to act alone is constrained. Conclusion Interest in the issues I have touched on this morning must not ebb when peacetime is eventually regained. Parochially, there has been massively more public interest in the Bank of England’s financial stability role during the period of turmoil than over the preceding years. But what we all do in peacetime will affect how the next “war” plays out. We must not forget that. Central banks can play a role because they can bring together and synthesise analytical and practical expertise in macroeconomic conditions, financial markets and the financial infrastructure. That synthesis is rather special, and should be at the service of the system as a whole. 4 BIS Review 77/2008 
Irma Rosenberg: The monetary policy decision-making process Speech by Ms Irma Rosenberg, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Riksbanken, Stockholm, 13 June 2008. *      *      * The Riksbank is considered to be one of the most open central banks in the world.1 Openness has also been one of the basic principles in shaping our activities. If an independent central bank is to be perceived as credible it must be possible for outsiders to understand its decisions and to assess its activities. We have therefore tried to be as open and clear as possible about what we do and why we do it. This increases the credibility of our monetary policy and makes it easier to anchor inflation expectations around the target. Part of this openness entails clearly describing how our analyses are achieved and the processes for making interest rate decisions. I believe that most people are familiar with the way we conduct monetary policy in general. We look ahead and base our monetary policy on forecasts. We have held many speeches on this subject. But how do we go about producing a forecast that leads to a decision on the interest rate? This is probably not as well-known and I intend to talk about it today. In recent years we have changed our methods of working in a number of fields. For example, since the beginning of 2007 we report very clearly the future interest rate path we expect to see. Our forecasts of inflation and other components, like the interest rate decisions, are based on a forecast of the future repo rate path. These forecasts change as new information is received, but we report our current views of the future every time we publish a monetary policy decision. The Riksbank is governed by an Executive Board The year 1999 is a natural starting point when describing the process for monetary policy decision-making. This was when the price stability target was prescribed by law and the Riksbank was given a more independent position with regard to our principal, Sveriges Riksdag (the Swedish parliament). This entailed a major change with regard to our decision-making and the way we work in relation to the General Council of the Riksbank.  As you already know, the work at the Riksbank has been headed since 1999 by an Executive Board consisting of six members, one of whom is Governor of the Riksbank and Chairman of the Executive Board. The members are appointed for a period of six years at a time. Normally the periods of office for the different members overlap to create continuity in the work of the Bank. Previously it was the Governing Council of the Riksbank, whose members are appointed by the Riksdag, who governed the Bank together with the Governor. Today the General Council has more of a controller function. They appoint the members of the Executive Board, but do not have any influence over, for instance, the decisions on the repo rate. It is the Executive Board which independently makes the decisions. The Executive Board is what is usually known as an individualistic committee.2 This means that each member has an individual responsibility. Interest rate decisions are made by voting and the members can then publicly express their views. The Bank of England also has this type of committee. In this, we differ from a number of other central banks, although most                                                  1  See, for instance, Dincer and Eichengreen (2007). 2  For a review of different monetary policy decision-making models, see Blinder and Wyplosz (2004). BIS Review 77/2008 1 
have a committee that makes decisions on the interest rate.3 One exception is, for instance, New Zealand, where the central bank governor is alone in making the decisions.  Many other central banks instead have a collegial committee. In this case the members reach a decision which they then all publicly support. Any differences of opinion are kept within the group; outwardly they speak with one voice. The way they reach a decision varies. In what is known as a genuinely collegial committee the decision is preceded by an internal discussion where each member puts forward his or her views. The ECB is an example of this type of committee. In an autocratically collegial committee, on the other hand, it is the chairman who more or less dictates the group's “consensus”. Some researchers have considered the Federal Reserve’s FOMC committee under the leadership of Alan Greenspan to be an example of such a committee.4 The changes made recently indicate that the FOMC is more of an individualistic committee. The Riksbank is one of the central banks with the most pronounced individual responsibility. Major changes in the way the material for the decision is produced  During the years I have worked at the Riksbank there have been major changes in the work on producing the material for monetary policy decision-making.  Six years ago our forecasts were based on the assumption that the repo rate would be held unchanged, regardless of whether or not this was a realistic assumption. The forecasts extended two years ahead, compared with the current three years. The analysis was to a great extent based on assessments and discussions. Formal models were used but did not play the same central role as they do today. Although this functioned fairly well, it also involved limitations. For example, it is difficult to see how alternative scenarios – something that is being given greater scope in our analysis – could be used without a more coherent model. The fact that we are now using models more also makes it easier to explain how a forecast is made and to assess the forecasts. In recent years we have made some major changes that have had significance for the way we organise our internal forecasting work. The main change being that we now base our forecasts on our own view of the future repo rate path and we give this forecast relatively large significance when communicating our monetary policy. We have also worked extensively on bringing in new, larger models, such as general equilibrium models, into the forecasting work.  The forecasts are the result of an interplay between models and assessments Our toolbox for making forecasts consists of assessments, theories, empirical studies and models. These tools complement one another and have different roles in the work. They are all important and necessary to make as good forecasts as possible.  As the economy is so extremely complex, we use various macroeconomic models to help us piece together a coherent picture of the economy. These models are based on modern economic theory, empirical studies and practical experience of different correlations in the economy. This makes it easier for us to make a consistent assessment of how the different parts of the economy will develop. If one merely studies individual correlations one misses the interdependence existing between the different parts and sectors of the economy. There is a considerable risk that the different parts of the analysis will not hold together.                                                   3  Pollard (2004) shows that 79 out of 88 central banks have committees which make interest rate decisions. 4  See Blinder and Wyplosz (2004). FOMC stands for Federal Open Market Committee. 2 BIS Review 77/2008 
But models are merely simplifications of the reality. They must be supplemented with analyses and assessments by experts in different fields. The experts have important insights into the real situation that the models are unable to capture. Forecasts based on models provide a good starting point and help to structure the discussions. The experts then adjust the models’ forecasts on the basis of their specific knowledge and assessments. The assessments become particularly important when unusual events and structural changes occur in the economy. Such models, which are merely based on historical correlations, may have difficulty dealing with these. Major advances in academic research regarding macro models In recent years models have come to play an increasingly important role in the forecasting work. This is also the case for many other central banks. The background is that methods have developed very quickly with regard to the empirical properties and forecasting performance of large structural macro models. There have also been major advances with regard to time series models, that is, models focusing on regularities in data and based to a lesser extent on economic theory.5 Increasingly powerful computers have played an important role in this context. They enable us to make advanced and time-consuming calculations.6  Structural macro models have been based to a greater extent than before on micro based theory of household and corporate behaviour. For example it is assumed in the models that there are various market imperfections combined with nominal and real rigidities. The agents in the model also have rational expectations, that is, they use the information available in the best possible way when they make their decisions. This type of model is usually referred to in the research literature under the generic term of New Keynesian DSGE models.7 The methods have been developed in close cooperation between academic researchers and economists at central banks who have exchanged ideas and experiences. The Riksbank has developed its own macro model for the Swedish economy  At the Riksbank we have developed a dynamic macro model for the Swedish economy which is known as Ramses.8 This is a so-called general equilibrium model and belongs to the group of New Keynesian DSGE models. General here means that it tries to explain the whole economy and not merely a particular section of it, such as private consumption or the labour market. The fact that it is an equilibrium model means that it assumes that market mechanisms create a balance between supply and demand in the different markets of the economy.  Ramses is currently used to make forecasts, to interpret economic developments and to calculate the effects of monetary policy, for example. Some areas are not yet very well developed in Ramses. This includes, for example, fiscal policy and the credit market. We therefore use partial models that focus on certain individual variables as a complement to Ramses. We also use so-called Bayesian VAR models. A VAR model is a system of equations, which can be used for instance to capture the average variation in macro data.9 In                                                  5  In academic research these models are usually called models of reduced form. 6  For a review of the results from the models and their forecasting performance see Adolfson et al (2007a). 7  DSGE stands for Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models. 8  RAMSES stands for the Riksbank’s Aggregated Macro model for Studies of the Economy in Sweden. For a more detailed description see Adolfson et al (2007b). 9  VAR stands for vector autoregressive model. BIS Review 77/2008 3 
a Bayesian VAR model some form of subjective information prior to estimation is used, for instance how high the long-term sustainable growth rate is.  In general, the further ahead we look, the more importance we give to economic theory and the assumptions of long-term equilibrium in Ramses and the Bayesian VAR models. To gain an impression of the current situation in the Swedish economy we instead use different time series models and indicator models. These are used to make forecasts 1-2 quarters ahead. The forecasts are then used as starting values in the large macro models. Of course there are also substantial elements of assessments of what comprises a probable development for the economy throughout the entire process.  Material for our assessments and forecasts comes from many sources On the whole, we use official statistics and the results of surveys from authorities such as Statistics Sweden and the National Institute of Economic Research and their counterparts in other countries. We also closely follow the assessments made by other forecasters in Sweden and abroad and regularly evaluate our own forecasting performance. We also bring back new impressions from the many international meetings we regularly attend. In addition, the Riksbank has begun to carry out its own company surveys. This involves our employees visiting companies around the country and hearing their views on the economic situation. This is a means of obtaining explanations of what we can see in the official statistics and of capturing tendencies before they appear in the statistics. The process begins with a discussion of the risks Before I go in greater detail into how we make forecasts, I would like to make some general observations. Firstly, making forecasts is a continuous process. Many of us at the Riksbank, both Executive Board members and employees in the different departments, closely monitor economic activity. The increased use of models makes it easier to some extent to update the forecasts when new information is received. But we only make a new, thorough and coherent assessment of what all the new information means for future monetary policy in connection with our monetary policy meetings, which are held six times a year.  Another observation is that the Executive Board as a collective is now more involved in the forecasting process than it was a few years ago. This is largely because we have chosen to publish our forecast for the repo rate. I shall return to this shortly. A third observation concerns the logic of the process. We try to deal with that which is independent of our own monetary policy at an early stage. Sweden is a small, open economy, so the international forecasts can be settled without taking into account what may later crystallise into a well-balanced Swedish monetary policy. The current situation in the Swedish economy is also largely independent of what the Executive Board determines at the next meeting, in that it takes time before monetary policy has an effect on the economy and inflation.  But please note that we have a relatively broad definition of the "current situation”. The National Accounts are published with a lag of almost one quarter. They are our most important source of statistics regarding the real economy. This means that we often do not know at the start what the outcome was for the economy during the previous quarter. This means that an assessment must be made for both the previous quarter and the current quarter. We use various indicators that are published on a monthly basis to make this assessment.  So what is the actual process for making the forecasts? It usually starts around eight weeks before the monetary policy meeting (see Figure 1). This is the case when a Monetary Policy Report is going to be published; otherwise the process is slightly shorter. In total, around 30 4 BIS Review 77/2008 
economists are involved in some phase of the forecasting work, together with the Executive Board members.   The material for the monetary policy meetings is mainly produced in the Monetary Policy Department in close cooperation with the Executive Board. The process begins with a risk meeting. The participants at this meeting are the Executive Board, employees of the Monetary Policy Department, some employees from other departments and some advisers to the Executive Board. The purpose of the meeting is to capture at an early stage various types of risk and alternative sequences of events for the economy that we envisage in the future. The discussions at this meeting are relatively unbiased and take a broad perspective. It is at this meeting that the alternative scenarios begin to take shape, those that are later described in Chapter 2 of the Monetary Policy Report and that show how the economy might develop if particular events occur. The scenarios can be used as a kind of counter-example to explain why the Executive Board considers that the main scenario is the one that at present gives the most well-balanced monetary policy. It can also illustrate different risks that an individual member wishes to illustrate or perhaps even a scenario that one person prefers instead of the main scenario.  Our experience is that the work on the different scenarios makes it easier for us Executive Board members to agree on a main scenario that the majority of us can support. The results are then presented at something called the first large monetary policy group meeting. This meeting is held in roughly the third week of the eight-week long forecasting process. Of course, we also have the capacity to produce new alternative scenarios later on in the process if this is necessary. BIS Review 77/2008 5 
Several different meetings lead up to the main scenario Prior to the first large monetary policy group meeting a number of meetings are held within the Monetary Policy Department. The Executive Board members are invited to intend these meetings, but they are mainly intended to be working meetings for the economists. The discussions are often at a relatively detailed and technical level. It is at these meetings that the forecasts in the main scenario begin to take shape. The main scenario is the development we consider to be the most probable and which is described in Chapter 1 of the Monetary Policy Report. Important new statistics and new events in Sweden and abroad are presented and analysed at these meetings. There are also comparisons with how developments relate to the earlier assessments. The purpose is to gain an impression of the current status of the economy.  For a small, open economy like Sweden the natural starting-point for the forecasting work is how economic activity and inflation develop in the world around us. The forecasting work therefore begins with an international outlook meeting, which has the purpose of reaching a preliminary forecast for international events.  Soon after this a financial market meeting is held. At this meeting there is a discussion of market participants’ expectations of the repo rate and how these have changed since the previous monetary policy meeting. These are then compared with the model forecasts for the repo rate and how these have changed. In addition, there are analyses and discussions of what has happened in the financial markets since the previous assessment. House prices, credits, stock market rates, exchange rates, money supply, international rates and so on are also discussed at this meeting. After this a current status meeting is held, where the focus is on the current situation in the Swedish economy. One particularly important aspect is to assess how much of the Swedish economy’s total resources in the form of labour and machinery are currently being used to a normal extent. Apart from new information on the current economic situation, there are also discussions of other new information that may be important for the forecasts in the slightly longer term. The first monetary policy group meeting with the Executive Board summarises new information After this it is time for the first large monetary policy group meeting. The entire Executive Board and most of the members of the Monetary Policy Department take part in this meeting. In addition, a number of advisers to the Executive Board and employees of the Financial Stability Department usually take part. A summary of the new information and the current status of the economy in Sweden and abroad is presented at the meeting. We also run through the alternative scenarios ordered at the risk meeting a few weeks earlier and discuss whether they really capture the risks that we Executive Board members envisage. We also have the opportunity at this meeting to request more information on various issues considered important to the coming decision. The meeting usually takes around three hours. Monetary Policy Department establishes its forecasts At approximately the same time as the meeting with the Executive Board, the Monetary Policy Department establishes its view of macroeconomic developments over the coming three years. In a preliminary stage it focuses on around ten key variables such as inflation, interest rates, GDP, number of hours worked, exchange rates and resource utilisation. The forecasts are produced on the basis of the exogenous conditions, the international forecasts, the model forecasts for the Swedish economy conditional on the current situation and assessments. The forecast for the interest rate path produced by the Monetary Policy Department is meant to reflect the Executive Board’s normal, historical behaviour. It is not 6 BIS Review 77/2008 
any form of recommendation from the Department. All of this is discussed at a macro forecasting meeting in the Monetary Policy Department. When the overall macroeconomic picture has been established, the economists chisel out the different points of the forecast in more detail. For instance, they make a complete forecast of the components in the balance of resources and in the labour market. Finally they check the overall picture to ensure that the different parts of the forecast hold together and have been added up correctly. In total, the economists forecast around fifty variables. All of these are then compiled into an internal document that summarises the Department’s view of how inflation and economic activity will develop in the future. Another document is also created, explaining how the forecasts are affected by model results and assessments. None of the Executive Board members takes part in this stage. The idea is that the product then reported to us will as far as possible be a civil servants’ product. It should not be influenced by the ideas of the different Executive Board members. The civil servants thus hold a relatively strong position in the process. The Executive Board’s main contribution is not to get involved in all of the details of the forecasts – instead we shall highlight different perspectives and broaden the analysis. The fact that the civil servants produce their own draft forecasts also contributes to strengthening and maintaining the internal competence. The Executive Board discusses the forecast at the second large meeting  The Monetary Policy Department then presents its forecast for the main scenario to the Executive Board at the second large monetary policy group meeting. This takes place in week five, that is, approximately three weeks prior to the monetary policy meeting. The organisation of this meeting differs from the first one. The meeting is divided into two parts. The first part of the meeting is open to the majority of the employees of the Monetary Policy Department. The civil servants then report their outlook on the economy over the coming years. They present the results from any in-depth reports ordered by the Executive Board. There is now an opportunity for us Executive Board members to ask questions about and express opinions on the forecasts to the different sector experts.  The second part of the meeting is held in a smaller circle consisting of the Executive Board, senior staff at the Monetary Policy Department, a couple of advisers and representatives of the Communications Secretariat. It is now that the Executive Board discusses and expresses opinions on the main scenario on the basis of its assessments. This may sometimes mean giving different weight to alternative macroeconomic scenarios, that is, the risks. The main scenario is then adjusted in accordance with the views of the Executive Board. In this situation the forecasts, including the interest rate forecasts, may be regarded as a well-founded guess as to which main scenario will receive the support of a majority of the Executive Board members a few weeks later. But there is still a possibility for the Executive board to make changes to the forecasts. The Executive Board can also ask the civil servants to provide further in-depth reports or follow up certain issues. These are then presented 1-2 days later at a follow-up meeting with the Executive Board. Here I would like to take the opportunity to refer to the current round of forecasts. On Monday we will be discussing the Swedish macroeconomic outlook at the second large monetary policy group meeting. This means that we Executive Board members are entering an intense phase of the monetary policy process. The decision-making situation we have had during the spring has on the one hand concerned rising inflation and on the other hand signs of a slowdown in economic activity. In both respects the outcome for Sweden has been slightly worse than we had anticipated in the April Monetary Policy Update. The inflation figure for May was 0.4 percentage points higher than we had forecast in April. A large part of this deviation is due to energy prices having increased more than we had expected. At the same time, growth was lower. The National Accounts for the first quarter of this year show that GDP growth was 2.2 per cent, which was 0.6 percentage points less than we had forecast in April. In principle, we are now facing the same type of problems in our deliberations, that is, BIS Review 77/2008 7 
rising inflationary pressure and weaker economic activity. The way we Executive Board members finally decide to balance these factors and all of the other new information we will receive is something we will return to at our monetary policy meeting on 2 July. We are six Board members and it is during the coming weeks that each person will finally form his or her opinion of how the economy will develop in the future and what monetary policy is required to attain the inflation target at the same time as avoiding excessive fluctuations in the real economy. Material reworked into a Monetary Policy Report After the second large monetary policy group meeting the Monetary Policy Department continues its work and compiles the first draft of the Monetary Policy Report. The Department now has close contacts with the Executive Board. A formal Executive Board meeting is held the week after the second meeting with the focus being on the forecasts. The editorial work on the Monetary Policy Report continues and is regularly checked with the members of the Executive Board. A few days prior to the monetary policy meeting we have another formal Executive Board meeting where we go through the text of the report in detail and where the report is tabled. However, the forecast can be changed as late as during the monetary policy meeting. It is not until the monetary policy meeting that the text and forecasts of the Monetary Policy Report are finally determined.  The Executive Board makes interest rate decisions through a majority vote The Executive Board holds six monetary policy meetings a year. If necessary we can meet more often. The number of meetings is not stipulated by law, but is determined by us Executive Board members.  We make decisions on the current level of the repo rate at the monetary policy meetings. We also agree on which interest rate path is most appropriate at the present time. The decisions are made through a majority vote, where the Chairman of the Executive board has a casting vote, and they are announced in a press release.  In addition to the Executive Board members, a number of employees from the Monetary Policy Department and the Communications Secretariat take part in the meeting, as well as some advisers and legal advisers. In addition, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the General Council regularly take part in the meetings and thus obtain a good insight into the work of the Executive Board. They both have the right to express opinions, but not to put forward proposals or take part in any decisions. In total, around 20 persons are usually present at the meeting.  What happens at a monetary policy meeting? There is an agenda which states the order in which we will discuss the different items. The meeting usually begins with a brief update on how the financial markets have developed, including market expectations of the repo rate with regard to our meeting, and other new, important information that has been received in the last few days. This is followed by a summary of the main elements in the Monetary Policy Report or the Monetary Policy Update.  After these introductory words from the civil servants, I and my colleagues go on to discuss economic developments over the coming three years. First we deal with economic activity and inflation abroad and in Sweden. Each person puts forward his or her view of the current economic situation and how the interest rate needs to be adjusted to attain the inflation target. There is no predetermined order as to who will begin the discussion. The discussion is fairly free at this stage. During the course of the process each one of us has formed his or her own opinion, but of course the formal decision is not made until the actual meeting. The Chairman of the Executive Board usually concludes by summarising the discussions held 8 BIS Review 77/2008 
and what proposals have been put forward regarding the current interest rate. After this we move on to the decision and vote. To give the general public insight into the decision-making process and to make it easier to assess our activities, we take minutes at the meeting which the bank then publishes. As of summer 2007, we also write the member’s names in the minutes. The minutes are published around two weeks after the monetary policy meeting. Interest rate decision announced on the day after the monetary policy meeting  A press release is published the day after each monetary policy meeting. This contains the most important reasons for and considerations behind the majority decision. The press release also contains the Riksbank’s forecasts for economic activity and inflation and a description of what monetary policy is currently considered to be well balanced. In connection with the publication of the interest rate decision we also hold a press conference where journalists are given the opportunity to ask questions.  In connection with three of the monetary policy meetings a Monetary Policy Report is published. On the other occasions a shorter Monetary Policy Update is published instead. This contains a more limited number of forecasts for the central macro variables.  That is to say, it is the majority view that is reflected in the press releases and the reports. Any differences of opinion can be seen in the minutes of the monetary policy meetings. There it is stated in detail how each of the members has argued and voted. But before the minutes are published it is the majority line that applies when we Executive Board members make speeches outside of the Riksbank. After that we members are each free to describe our personal differences of opinion regarding the interest rate decision.  Constant assessment means that we are always prepared for change Let me round off. Today I have talked about the major changes in recent years in the way we produce material used as a base for our interest rate decisions. Some of these have come about because the methods of making forecasts in general have developed, something that also affects other central banks.  Other changes have been shaped by the specific conditions that apply in Sweden. The Riksbank’s independent position makes demands on us to be open and clear, what economists usually term transparency. The Riksbank’s decision to begin publishing its own forecasts for the repo rate is a step in the work on increasing transparency and further improving our analysis.10  The new assumption for the repo rate has led to the Executive Board becoming more involved in the forecasting process. We are constantly evaluating our forecasts to see how successful they are at capturing developments. This also means we are constantly striving to improve our ways of working. If we make any major changes that have significance for our forecasts we will of course let you know. Sources: Adolfson, M., M. Andersson, J. Lindé, M. Villani and A.

Lucas Papademos: Economic outlook in the euro area Statement by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the 2008 Asia-Europe (ASEM) Finance Ministers’ Meeting, Jeju, Korea, 16 June 2008. *      *      * Introduction  It is a great pleasure for me to participate in the ASEM Finance Ministers’ Meeting. In my statement, I will focus on the economic outlook in the euro area, with special emphasis on inflation prospects and risk, the monetary policy stance of the European Central Bank (ECB), recent financial market developments and our assessment of the outlook for financial stability. Economic outlook The pace of economic activity in the euro area is expected to decelerate in 2008 and 2009 from the robust 2.7% GDP growth rate recorded last year. The Eurosystem staff projections, published on 5 June 2008, foresee annual real GDP growth in the range between 1.5% and 2.1% in 2008, and between 1.0% and 2.0% in 2009. Recent growth forecasts for the euro area by the European Commission, international institutions and organisations and the private sector are broadly in line with the Eurosystem staff projections. All in all, our latest assessment, based on the macroeconomic projections produced by the staff of the Eurosystem, and our analysis of the most recent information, from data and survey indicators, confirms the expectation of moderate but ongoing economic growth. Both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support GDP growth in 2008. The resilience of global economic growth, which benefits from the robust economic activity in emerging market economies, should support euro area exports. Domestic factors, however, are expected to contribute the largest part of euro area growth in both 2008 and 2009. In particular, non-residential private investment is expected to provide support to economic activity, as capacity utilisation remains high and profitability has been sustained in the non-financial corporate sector. This outlook for economic growth is surrounded by continuing high uncertainty and downside risks prevail. The financial market turmoil could have a more adverse impact on the real economy than currently anticipated. In addition, further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices could have dampening effects on consumption and investment. There are also risks stemming from the possible emergence of protectionist pressures and from the still large, though declining, global imbalances.  Turning to price developments, the outlook for price stability in the euro area has deteriorated and the risks to this outlook remain on the upside and they have increased. Annual inflation has remained above 3% over the past seven months and it is estimated to have increased to 3.6% in May 2008, reaching again the ten-year peak recorded in March. These developments confirm the persistence of strong upward pressures on euro area inflation, which are largely the result of the sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in the previous months. Domestic inflationary pressures have also intensified. They partly reflect the accumulation of price pressures, also driven by higher energy and commodity prices in the initial stages of the production chain that have not yet reached the consumer level. Producer price inflation rose to a new peak at 6.1% in April. Moreover, after a period of contained labour cost increases, an acceleration of wage growth was visible in the first quarter of 2008. The pick-up of wage growth could continue in 2008 in an economic environment characterised by tight BIS Review 77/2008 1 
labour markets, high capacity utilisation and persistently high inflation involving the risk of second-round effects.  According to the June Eurosystem staff projections, average annual inflation is expected to be between 3.2% and 3.6% in 2008 and between 1.8% and 3.0% in 2009. These projections are based on the assumptions that external price pressures will diminish over the projection horizon, in line with futures prices for oil and agricultural commodities, and that there will be no broad-based second-round effects on wages. Given these assumptions, it is likely that the annual inflation rate will remain above 3% for a protracted period of time before it moderates only gradually in 2009. The medium-term outlook for prices continues to be subject to a number of upside risks. These risks include, on the external side, possible further increases in energy and food prices beyond those foreseen thus far, and, on the domestic side, the risk of broad-based second-round effects in wage and price setting. This latter risk is greater in market segments with low competition, such as parts of the services sector, where the pricing power of firms may prove stronger than currently expected. Moreover, higher-than-expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation, tight labour market conditions and the elevated inflation perceptions and expectations of consumers. In addition, the continuing very vigorous money and credit growth confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium and longer term. Monetary policy Against this background – the prospect of stronger and more protracted inflationary pressures than previously envisaged and the assessment of the increased upside risks to price stability over the medium term – the Governing Council indicated that it is in a state of heightened alertness and ready to act in a firm and timely manner to prevent second-round effects and ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. The Governing Council also emphasised its commitment to maintain price stability in the medium term and its strong determination to secure a firm anchoring of medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability. Financial markets Let me now turn to financial market developments and the financial stability outlook in the euro area. The financial system of the euro area is still undergoing further adjustment as the processes of risk repricing and de-leveraging continue. The stresses on the financial system have persisted longer and they have become broader and deeper than anticipated six months ago.  Although there have been some signs of easing tensions in certain markets since mid-March, elevated pressures remain in others, notably in the term money markets of major currencies. Moreover, high uncertainty surrounds the future dynamics of property prices, the magnitude of possible further asset valuation write-downs by financial institutions and the effects of the market turmoil on the broader economy.  Over the past two months, money, credit and other financial markets appear to be sending mixed signals. The term money market spreads between euro deposit and EONIA swap rates have remained high and close to record levels, for maturities from three to twelve months. Tensions in the term money market continue to be a global phenomenon. Currently, the spreads between three-month deposit and overnight-indexed swap rates are virtually the same in the euro, US dollar and pound sterling money markets. In the credit markets, greater risk awareness by banks and increased bank funding costs have been reflected in the significant and general further tightening of lending standards in the euro area, the UK and the US. At the same time, credit default swap (CDS) indices in 2 BIS Review 77/2008 
Europe and the US have declined since mid-March (though recently they have increased somewhat), the availability of bank credit to households and non-financial corporations in the euro area has not been significantly affected by the financial market turbulence, and corporate bond spreads have narrowed Moreover, the functioning of the leveraged loan market is showing some tentative signs of improvement.  With regard to the impact of the market correction on bank profits, the write-downs disclosed by many euro area financial institutions went far beyond the expectations of late last year. Although major euro area banking groups did report large write-downs, these were significantly smaller than the income losses disclosed by their European peers from outside the euro area and by large US banking groups. More write-downs are expected to be revealed in 2008 and these expectations have been broadly confirmed by the financial results reported for the first quarter of 2008. The disclosure of the full-year 2007 financial results of euro area major banking groups revealed that the subprime-related turmoil has had a material impact on their profitability, but their capital buffers remained largely intact in 2007. Looking ahead, it can be expected that the profitability of these institutions will be adversely affected this year as the process of de-leveraging continues and as spillovers to asset markets and the real economy materialise. The expected slowdown in profit growth is a consequence of possible further valuation losses, increased funding costs, as well as declining non-interest income from securitisation and capital market activities.  Financial stability outlook With regard to the outlook for financial stability, according to our assessment (recently published in the June 2008 edition of the ECB Financial Stability Review) the risks to euro area financial system stability, on balance, have increased in 2008. And, indeed, since the beginning of the year, some of the risks previously identified have materialised. Conditions in the US housing market have further deteriorated, valuations losses endured by large banks were larger than anticipated at the end of 2007, and banks have tightened their lending standards significantly.  Looking ahead, the risk of de-leveraging by euro area large banks of sufficient severity to induce a significant shortage of credit in the economy appears rather low. However, the financial stability outlook remains highly uncertain and depends, among other things, on the following three factors: First, how conditions in the US housing market develop; second, how banks respond to a much more challenging operating environment; and third, the extent to which initiatives and measures aimed at restoring confidence and strengthening financial system resilience are eventually implemented. It is probable that the adjustment process within the financial system will be protracted as banks continue to strengthen their liquidity and capital positions. This means that balance sheet expansion is likely to be somewhat curtailed in the period ahead. So far, however, the availability of bank credit to households and non-financial corporations has not been significantly affected by the financial market turbulence.  Given the heightened uncertainty and an environment in which balance sheet conditions could change unexpectedly, vigilance by financial institutions and market participants is of the essence and those with relevant exposures will need to step up their efforts to effectively manage the risks that may lie ahead. I would like to conclude on a positive note by recalling that the losses disclosed so far by the financial institutions affected by the turmoil are mostly mark-to-market losses on hard-to-value assets. If the outturns for implied credit losses ultimately prove less severe than currently expected, then it cannot be ruled out that those financial firms still holding these assets will see some offsetting valuation gains in their portfolios.

Donald L Kohn: Lessons for central bankers from a Phillips Curve Framework Speech by Mr Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's Annual Economic Conference “Understanding Inflation and the Implications for Monetary Policy: A Phillips Curve Retrospective”, Chatham, Massachusetts, 11 June 2008. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * An economic model of inflation is an indispensable input to monetary policy deliberations. A model in the Phillips curve tradition remains at the core of how most academic researchers and policymakers – including this one – think about fluctuations in inflation; indeed, alternative frameworks seem to lack solid economic foundations and empirical support. But the modern Phillips curve differs substantially from versions in use several decades ago; policymakers and academics alike are now attuned to the importance of expectations, the possibility of structural change, and the uncertainty that surrounds our understanding of the dynamics of wage and price adjustment. Moreover, the link between inflation and resource utilization often emphasized in a Phillips curve framework accounts for only a modest part of inflation fluctuations. My comments today will focus on how the lessons from recent research on the Phillips curve are helping me think about the influence of fluctuations in the prices of commodities, such as oil, on the outlook for inflation and the appropriate policy responses to such developments.1  Policy objectives and a framework for analyzing inflation fluctuations The Federal Reserve has been charged with the pursuit of price stability and maximum employment. Price stability is uniquely in the control of the central bank over long periods, and it is a prerequisite for the economy performing efficiently over time. The welfare costs of inflation result from many factors: the potential costs to households and firms that result from efforts to insure themselves against inflation or from confusion regarding real and nominal prices; distortions to the financial system related to inflation; imperfect indexation of the taxation, especially of capital income, and the related distortions to economic activity; and the costs associated with a slow adjustment of nominal prices and wages. The costs of inflation imply that central banks should aim for low measured inflation. Moreover, many of the costs of inflation – such as those associated with misconceptions regarding inflation, efforts to insure against inflation, and distortions to the financial system – are associated with the rate of change in the entire set of prices of goods and services facing households or firms, suggesting that measured inflation should be gauged by the rate of change in a broad set of prices. Accordingly, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been emphasizing that it gauges price stability over the long-term by the behavior of the overall personal consumption expenditures price index. The economic framework that helps me think about fluctuations in inflation is based on the substantial body of research on models of price dynamics that has been developed over the past five decades. At its heart, the framework is based on the importance of sluggish adjustment in (some) nominal wages and prices to changing economic conditions. This sluggishness undoubtedly reflects a number of factors, which include the costs of adjusting                                                  1  Michael Kiley, of the Board's staff, contributed to these remarks. The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. BIS Review 76/2008 1 
some nominal prices and wages, imperfect information regarding shifts in economic conditions, and learning by firms and households about the structure of the economy, including the setting of monetary policy. Regardless of its source, the presence of sluggish nominal adjustment brings to the fore three key elements driving wage and price dynamics: inflation expectations, supply shocks, and resource utilization. Because some prices and wages are adjusted only infrequently, both firms and households anticipate the future erosion of real prices and wages by incorporating the expectations they have for inflation into their current price settings and wage demands. As a result, inflation expectations play a critical role in the formation of monetary policy. Moreover, the tendency of some prices to adjust very quickly to changing circumstances in conjunction with sluggish adjustment in other prices and wages implies that large, sharp price movements, such as a change in the price of oil, lead to relative price distortions throughout the economy; these distortions imply that relative price shocks have important implications for the functioning of the economy.2 Finally, fluctuations in resource utilization, through their effects on the costs of production and on firms' desired markups over these costs, are a significant determinant of price and wage decisions. The link from resource utilization to inflation provides a major channel through which monetary policy settings influence inflation: Adjustments in the policy interest rate bring about changes in resource utilization, which then influence current and expected inflation.  Inflation forecasting and commodity price shocks The economic outlook is the prime focus of monetary policy. Because the stance of policy influences economic activity and inflation only with a lag, policymakers must adjust policy to minimize the costs from fluctuations in activity and inflation in the future. The Phillips curve framework is an important input into the forecast for inflation. I will focus specifically on how a shock to the price of oil affects the inflation outlook within this framework. This topic is especially salient of late – commodities prices in general, and perhaps most glaringly the price of oil, have risen sharply over the past year; indeed, oil prices have risen sharply for more than four years. Consider a sharp rise in the price of oil that primarily reflects a shift in the balance between demand and supply in the global market for oil.3 In the first instance, higher oil prices lead to an increase in the overall level of consumer prices. When thinking about the outlook for future inflation, it is useful to distinguish between oil and other prices. The most significant factor determining oil prices is the current and prospective balance between demand and supply. The aggregate behavior of most other prices, consisting of a large set of nominal prices and wages that adjust slowly, is driven by the factors that enter the Phillips curve – inflation expectations, resource utilization, and supply shocks (in this case, a shock to the price of oil). In a forecasting context, the Phillips curve framework motivates reduced-form regressions of the rate of inflation for consumer prices excluding food and energy against proxies for each                                                  2  Relative price shocks act like supply shocks in the Phillips curve framework for two reasons. First, some prices are sluggish and others are flexible, and the Phillips curve framework focuses on the adjustment of sluggish prices. Second, prices are more likely to adjust to very large shocks, and the skewness on the distribution of relative price disturbances can fluctuate substantially, giving rise to shocks to the Phillips curve. Ball and Mankiw (1995) discuss these issues and argue that the second type of relative price shock is quantitatively very important. 3  The rise in a broad range of commodity prices, as has occurred from time to time recently, would not affect the basic analysis which rests on the contrasting behavior of flexible and sluggishly adjusting prices. However, the simultaneous rise in many commodity prices might suggest that strong global aggregate demand is playing an important role, which would affect the appropriate setting for monetary policy. See the section below on Global Demand, Trending Commodity Prices and Monetary Policy. 2 BIS Review 76/2008 
key factor. Lagged values of inflation typically proxy for inflation expectations. The deviation of output from potential or of the unemployment rate from its sustainable rate serves as a proxy for resource utilization. And changes in relative prices for energy, food and imports are traditionally included as measures of supply shocks.4 This type of regression is among the most useful tools for forecasting inflation. Nonetheless, its forecast record is far from spotless, and hence I consider the forecasts from such regressions as just one input that helps inform my outlook for inflation. The results of such exercises imply that, over recent history, a sharp jump in oil prices appears to have had only modest effects on the future rate of inflation. This result likely reflects two factors. First, commodities like oil represent only a small share of the overall costs of production, implying that the magnitude of the direct pass-through from changes in such prices to other prices should be modest, all else equal. Second, inflation expectations have been well anchored in recent years, contributing to a muted response of inflation to oil price shocks. But the anchoring of expectations cannot be taken as given; indeed, the type of empirical exercises I have outlined reveal a larger effect of the price of oil on inflation prior to the last two decades, a period in which inflation expectations were not as well anchored as they are today.5  Of course, oil prices have jumped repeatedly in recent years. The (relatively) continuous rise in energy prices since 2003 has been a surprise to me and to most others, as least as best as I can gauge by looking at prices that have been embedded in futures contracts over this period. These contracts currently suggest that the price of oil will flatten out in the period ahead. Nonetheless, repeated increases in energy prices and their effect on overall inflation have contributed to a rise in the year-ahead inflation expectations of households, especially this year. Of greater concern is that some measures of longer-term inflation expectations appear to have edged up since last year. Any tendency for these longer-term inflation expectations to drift higher or even to fail to reverse over time would have troublesome implications for the outlook for inflation. The structural Phillips Curve, commodity price shocks, and monetary policy  The central role of inflation expectations implies that policymakers must look beyond this type of reduced-form exercise for guidance. After all, the lags of inflation in reduced-form regressions are a very imperfect proxy for inflation expectations. As emphasized in Robert Lucas's critique of reduced-form Phillips curves more than 30 years ago, structural models are needed to have confidence in the effect of any shock on the outlook for inflation and economic activity.6                                                   4  The amount of related literature is large. The article by Robert Gordon (1998) represents a good example and is relevant when considering the notion of supply shocks generally. Stock and Watson (1999) present a broad interpretation of the empirical Phillips curve in which a large number of macroeconomic indicators are used to forecast inflation. 5  These factors are not the only two that have contributed to a lower effect of oil prices on inflation. For example, the energy intensity of the economy has fallen over time. Research like that in Hooker (2002) and subsequent work has discussed various possibilities in more detail. Blanchard and Gali (2007) suggest that the seemingly muted affect of changes in the price of oil and inflation in recent years has been the result of falling energy intensity, more flexible labor markets, better monetary policy, and good luck.  6  See Lucas (1976). Robert Lucas had emphasized the importance of structural models of the Phillips curve well before his 1976 article; for example, see his contribution at the conference on wage and price dynamics held at the Federal Reserve in 1970 (Lucas, 1972). Michael Woodford (1994) presented an important critique of some research on commodity prices, inflation, and monetary policy in which the role of the Lucas critique was central: In particular, he re-emphasized that a tendency of commodity prices to forecast inflation may not be structural and could break down under alternative policy regimes – a tendency that seemed to be BIS Review 76/2008 3 
The importance of structural relationships as inputs to the monetary policy process poses a challenge; for instance, there are many "structural" models of nominal price and wage adjustment, each of these models emphasizes different frictions or imperfections and therefore can have different policy implications, and empirical work has reached different conclusions regarding the merits of alternative models.7 As a result, policymakers must look to lessons that are common across alternative specifications and base policy on our current understanding of the most likely important structural factors. Fortunately, I think that many of the models of nominal price and wage adjustment imply similar conclusions regarding the influence of commodity prices on the inflation outlook and the appropriate response of monetary policy.  I will again focus on a sharp jump in the price of oil, reflecting supply and demand in the market for oil. Because many nominal prices and wages are costly and slow to adjust, the efficient allocation of resources is impeded during a transition period in which relative price signals are distorted. For example, the prices of energy-intensive goods need to rise relative to those of less-energy-intensive goods, but this adjustment follows a gradual and asynchronous pattern. Similarly, the equilibrium real wage – the relative price of labor – will tend to be depressed by an oil price shock due to the accompanying adverse movements in the terms of trade and reduction in labor productivity, but the needed wage or price adjustments proceed gradually.8 An efficient monetary policy should attempt to facilitate the needed economic adjustments so as to minimize distortions to economic efficiency on the path to achieving, over time, its dual objectives of price stability and maximum employment.9In particular, an appropriate monetary policy following a jump in the price of oil will allow, on a temporary basis, both some increase in unemployment and some increase in price inflation. By pursuing actions that balance the deleterious effects of oil prices on both employment and inflation over the near term, policymakers are, in essence, attempting to find their preferred point on the activity/inflation variance-tradeoff curve introduced by John Taylor 30 years ago.10 Such policy actions promote the efficient adjustment of relative prices: Since real wages need to fall and both prices and wages adjust slowly, the efficient adjustment of relative prices will tend to include a bit of additional price inflation and a bit of additional unemployment for a time, leading to increases in real wages that are temporarily below the trend established by productivity gains. I should emphasize that the course of policy I have just described has taken inflation expectations as given. In practice, it is very important to ensure that policy actions anchor inflation expectations. This anchoring is critical: As demonstrated by historical experiences around the world and in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s, efforts to bring inflation and inflation expectations back to desirable levels after they have risen appreciably involve costly and undesirable changes in resource utilization.11 As a result, the degree to                                                                                                                                                       confirmed by Mark Hooker (2002) in his work documenting a break in the link between oil prices and inflation in recent decades. 7  For example, Rudd and Whelan (2007) and Kiley (2007) review a number of models and empirical studies as well as conduct their own empirical analyses; these two studies reach quite different conclusions on the merits of alternative specifications.  8  For example, see the article by Chao Wei (2003) illustrating the effects of a rise in oil prices in a dynamic equilibrium model. 9  Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000) discuss the importance of relative price adjustments in the presence of sluggish nominal prices and wages in a general context; Mankiw and Reis (2003) present related results. Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri (2007) apply this reasoning to oil price shocks.  10  See Taylor (1979). 11  Ball (1994) presents estimates of the costs of disinflation for a variety of countries, including the United States. Kiley (2008) provides evidence on how survey measures of inflation expectations in the United States have responded to economic developments and presents a model that attempts to explain the patterns in the data. 4 BIS Review 76/2008 
which any deviations of inflation from long-run objectives are tolerated to allow the efficient relative price adjustments that I have described needs to be tempered so as to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are not affected to a significant extent. Global demand, trending commodity prices, and monetary policy My remarks so far have concentrated on the factors guiding the monetary policy response to a shock in the prices of commodities like oil that stems from a shifting balance of supply and demand in the specific market for these commodities. Some might think that this focus misses the point in the current context, for at least two reasons. First, it has been suggested that the run-up in the prices of a broad range of commodity prices reflects, in part, global excess demand rather than sector-specific forces. And second, some have suggested that important commodity prices, like that of oil, may be on a more significant upward trend than is currently embedded in futures prices. It seems highly likely that, over the period since 2003, the rise in commodity prices has reflected strong global economic growth as well as some sector-specific factors, such as geopolitical tensions and other disruptions to the supply of oil.12 In this regard, I share the views expressed by Chairman Bernanke at this conference two days ago in which he discussed a range of factors that have likely influenced relative commodity prices.13  However, the fact that rising relative commodity prices have likely reflected many factors does not, by itself, change the analytical framework that I used to frame policy deliberations. As I highlighted at the beginning of my remarks, the most important drivers of inflation in the model of inflation dynamics I use are relative price shocks, inflation expectations, and the balance between aggregate demand and supply in the United States, as measured by some notion of resource utilization. If a shift in global demand affects both commodity prices and the demand for U.S. goods, the model I have in mind accounts for these influences on inflation through relative price shocks and resource utilization. For example, the rise in the price of oil this year has lowered consumption demand by pinching households' real incomes and likely damped the growth in labor productivity by trimming energy input; both of these factors have probably contributed to a lower equilibrium real wage, as I described earlier. If the impact on demand from these factors was accompanied by stronger global demand that boosted demand for U.S. goods generally, the forecasts of inflation would need to take this into account. In any event, resource utilization has been slackening, judging from the rise in the unemployment rate and the slow pace of economic growth in the United States, on average, over the past six to nine months. Some have suggested that the price of oil is on a more significant upward trend than currently appreciated.14 Such an unanticipated shift in trend would not be embedded in the anticipated rate of change in slowly adjusting nominal prices and wages, implying that an adjustment period with distortions to relative prices would follow. Moreover, there would likely                                                                                                                                                       Orphanides and Williams (2005) present a model in which perpetual learning leads to fluctuations in inflation expectations at various horizons and provide examples of how alternative monetary policy settings can influence the course of inflation expectations, thereby illustrating the importance of the interaction between expectations formation and efficient monetary policy.  12  With regard to oil prices, Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri (2008) discuss the effects on the price of oil and the U.S. economy from shocks to various factors in a theoretical model; Kilian (2007) provides an empirical analysis. More generally, this area remains a fertile field for future research. 13  See Bernanke (2008). 14  One might question whether significant price trends can reasonably be anticipated for a storable commodity like oil. The price of such a commodity should reflect expected demand and "anticipated" increases should be limited to approximately the cost of storage, including the nominal interest rate. Still, the following discussion would also apply to a shift in the trend in any important subset of consumer prices.  BIS Review 76/2008 5 
be upward pressure on overall inflation during this period, reflecting the slow response of the rate of change in some nominal prices to the new trend in the price of oil. This tendency for higher overall inflation could risk a rise in inflation expectations. An appropriate monetary policy response would share many of the characteristics I discussed earlier. In particular, bringing overall inflation immediately back to the low rate consistent with price stability could be associated with a much higher rate of unemployment for a short time. It may be efficient to allow some adjustment period in which both overall inflation exceeds its desired low level and the unemployment rate is higher than its long-run sustainable level; as before, setting policy in a manner that balances the undesirable effects of a shock to the system on both inflation and employment will tend to be more efficient than setting policy so as to deliver more extreme outcomes in either inflation or unemployment.15However, two additional considerations are likely important when considering a shift in trend. First, developments in inflation expectations following a significant shift in the relative price trend of a commodity like oil should be monitored carefully, as our understanding of changes in long-run inflation expectations is limited and shifts in trends are infrequent, potentially implying a greater chance of confusion between relative price trends and overall inflation. Second, it is very important to remember that the costs of inflation in excess of the low rate of measured inflation consistent with price stability over any extended period are significant and reflect a broad range of factors. As I emphasized earlier, economic research into the many costs of inflation has suggested that these costs are associated with the rate of change in a broad set of prices. As a result, a trend in any individual relative price should not, in itself, lead to a change in the desirable rate of measured inflation over the long run. Summary To reiterate, the Phillips curve framework is one important input to my outlook for inflation and provides a framework in which I can analyze the nature of efficient policy choices. In the case of a shock to the relative price of oil or other commodities, this framework suggests that policymakers should ensure that their actions balance the deleterious economic effects of such a shock in the short run on both unemployment and inflation. Of course, the framework helps to define the short-run goals for policy, but it doesn't tell you what path for interest rates will accomplish these objectives. That's what we wrestle with at the FOMC and is perhaps a subject for a future Federal Reserve Bank of Boston conference. References  Ball, Laurence M. (1994).

This shock placed downward pressure on inflation and raised both employment and the equilibrium real wage. In the presence of nominal price and wage rigidities, an efficient policy response would facilitate the rise in the real wage by allowing some downward drift in price inflation and upward drift in employment and wage inflation, which is, in fact, about the result observed over this period.  6 BIS Review 76/2008

Caleb M Fundanga: Narrowing Zambia’s investment gap for sustainable development Keynote address by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the Euro-Money Zambia Investment Conference “Narrowing Zambia’s investment gap for sustainable development”, Lusaka, 10 June 2008. *      *      * 1.0  Introduction Over the recent past, the Zambian economy has performed relatively well. This is reflected in the positive growth rates in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), low inflation, relative stability in the exchange rate of the Kwacha against major currencies, stable financial sector and improved banking services. The recent impressive economic trends suggest that the reform programmes that have been pursued are working and bearing fruit. These reforms have focused on the restructuring of the economy, to let markets determine prices, shift production decisions from the Government to the private sector and provide an enabling environment for increased investment. This has led to a stable macroeconomic environment and has provided a basis for growth. However, the challenge that still remains is that of meeting the basic needs of Zambians in order to uplift their living standards. Equally, the economy still has low savings needed to finance development activities and therefore needs more foreign capital to expand its productive capacity and create more jobs that contribute to the uplifting of people’s living standards. Zambia is a country with abundant natural resources and human capital. It is a centrally located country with eight neighbouring countries and close proximity to the large market of South Africa, a surface area of over 750,000 sq km, and an approximate population of over 11 million people. It also boasts of a suitable climate, peace and a multi-party competitive democratic political system. The country possesses all the necessary attributes for sustainable economic growth and development. Competitive production costs, incentives, and reforms have also enhanced the attractive investment climate for both local and foreign investors. Numerous investment opportunities exist amongst the agriculture, manufacturing, tourism and mining sectors across various regions of the country. Almost all provinces in Zambia remain potential areas of investment whose resources remain largely untapped. Its active participation in the SADC Trade protocol and the COMESA/FTA offers preferential tariff access to market potential of nearly 380 million people. The Zambian Development Agency (ZDA) Act ensures that property rights are fully respected with full compensation on market value made in case of expropriation. The country is also a signatory to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency of the World Bank which guarantees foreign investment protection in cases of disasters and other disturbances. Bilateral investment treaties with a number of countries also encourage, promote and protect foreign investment. Foreign investors seeking joint venture partners can approach ZDA which registers investors together with project profiles of domestic investors seeking collaboration. 2.0  Recent economic developments 2.1  Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) During the period 2001-2007, growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaged about 5.1% per annum, largely due to investment in the mining, tourism, construction and transport BIS Review 76/2008 1 
and agriculture sectors. This has set a strong basis for further favourable economic growth in the medium to long-term. Thus GDP growth is projected to rise by no less than 7.0% in 2008 and beyond. Consistent with the developments in the economy, GDP per capita rose to US $934.5 in 2007 from US $360.5 in 2001. 2.2  Interest rates Commercial banks’ lending rates have also been declining, though not as fast as the reduction in inflation and Treasury bills rates. For instance, the commercial banks average lending rate fell from 54.6% in December 2001 to 24.4% in December 2007. Lower lending rates are expected in the current environment of low inflation and will contribute to reducing the cost of doing business in Zambia. 2.3 Inflation Inflation has declined from 18.7% recorded in 2001 to single digit level of 8.2% in 2006 and 8.9% in 2007. It is projected to slow down further to 7.0% by December 2008. This inflation outturn was largely credited to the conduct of appropriate monetary policy coupled with prudent fiscal policy and relative stability of the Kwacha, assisted by lower food prices following the favourable 2005/06 and 2006/07 farming seasons. 2.4  External sector Zambia’s external position continues to show remarkable improvements as reflected in the build up of gross international reserves to 3.6 months of import cover in 2007 from 0.9 months of import cover in 2001. Preliminary assessment is that Zambia’s surplus trade balance rose to US $983.1 million compared to the deficit of US $342.2 million in 2001. Similarly, the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP reduced to 4.4% in 2007 from 19.1% in 2001. This outturn was mainly attributed to high receipts from increased copper exports following increased production and record high prices on the international market due to strong demand mainly from China. Coupled with this, between 2000 and 2007, nontraditional export earnings rose by 260% from US$ 255.7 million in 2000 to US$ 920.7 million in 2007 with commodities such as sugar, copper wire and tobacco, coupled with receipts from tourism making notable contributions. In addition, the attainment of the enhanced HIPC completion point in April 2005 and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006 provided for cancellation of (IMF, IDA and ADB) debt resulting in a reduction in debt stock to about US $2.1 billion in 2007 from the end-2001 debt stock of US $7.3 billion. The debt relief and increased budget support from cooperating partners also helped strengthen the external position. The foreign exchange market is liberalised, therefore the Kwacha is determined by demand and supply conditions in the market. In 2007, the Kwacha appreciated against the major international currencies with the exception of the euro. Against the US dollar, the Kwacha appreciated by 7.2% compared with a depreciation of 20.7% in 2006. This was attributed largely to higher inflows of foreign exchange on the market due to increased export receipts, which largely reflected high copper prices and the continued participation of foreign portfolio investors in the domestic Government securities market. The depreciation of the Kwacha against the euro can be attributed to significant gains of the euro against the US dollar and other major currencies, supported mainly by relatively buoyant growth prospects in the euro area. 2 BIS Review 76/2008 
2.5  Banking sector environment The overall financial condition and performance of the banking sector has been satisfactory, as reflected in adequate capitalisation and most banks meeting their minimum regulatory capital requirements. With 13 commercial banks in operation comprised of both local and foreign, investment opportunities are immense. The Government through the Bank of Zambia continues to modernise the overall commercial banking environment, by endorsing various legislation to promote safe, sound and efficient operations and development of not only the banking sector but the financial system as a whole. This is evidenced by enhanced financial stability and the emergence of a number of financial institutions offering an array of financial services. For example, the National Payments Systems Act was enacted in June 2007, while Access Bank, the fourth largest bank in Nigeria is expected to open a branch in the country by July 2008, raising the number of commercial banks to 14. 2.6  Capital market developments The Lusaka stock exchange performed remarkably well, market capitalisation increased by 45.0% to K18,872.9 billion compared to the increase of 13.9% in 2006. The Lusaka All Shares index almost doubled, rising by 92.9% to close the year at 3,533.52 points compared to an increase of 47.7% in the previous year. This robust performance was a reflection of strong macroeconomic fundamentals in the economy and positive investor expectations in the growth and earnings prospects for both listed and quoted companies. Government introduced 7, 10 and 15-year bonds to help deepen the financial markets in 2007. Foreign investments in Government securities rose to K830.5 billion as at December 2007 from K539.8 billion recorded end-December 2005, an indication of the rising confidence in the economy. 2.7  Fiscal developments On the fiscal front the Government is expected to limit domestic borrowing to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2008. By reducing levels of government borrowing and enforcing prudent budget execution, this should result in greater mobilisation of domestic resources and effective coordination with the monetary authorities. Zambia has articulated its long-term development objectives in the National Long Term Vision 2030, which is aimed at raising Zambia to a middle income status by 2030. Part of this vision is enshrined in the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP); 2006-2010 whose theme is: “Broad Based Wealth and Job Creation through Citizenry Participation and Technological Advancement”. The growth of the economy will be driven by increased activities by the private sector in agriculture, mining, export-led manufacturing and tourism. Government will support this growth by accelerating the implementation of structural reforms and promote investing in key infrastructure such as roads, energy and telecommunication in conjunction with the private sector as well as improve legal, institutional and regulatory frameworks. 3.0 Infrastructure development In order to consolidate the recent economic successes and to realize full potential, Zambia needs to address the large infrastructure gap that is inhibiting further growth. Weak infrastructure such as: roads, rail system, airports/airstrips and other communication barriers reduce the ability to take advantage of the good location that the country has. Furthermore investment, particularly in rural infrastructure needs to be scale-up significantly. Poor infrastructure and inadequate access is resulting in significantly increased cost of doing business, making it difficult to integrate the rural population with the rest of economy. Opportunities for investment in infrastructure development exist in the following sectors: BIS Review 76/2008 3 
3.1  Transport and communication The generally good land route communication networks of Zambia’s neighbouring countries have encouraged the southern connections. The government of Zambia has embarked on the process of rehabilitating the road network, which covers 35,168 km. Therefore investment opportunities are available in the areas of road rehabilitation, routine maintenance and consultancy. Although the country has international highway links with Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa, the roads can not accommodate the growing traffic due to increased trade with other countries. There is a large investment potential for multiple lane highways to cater for the smooth running of traffic for increased efficiency in trade. Further, the railway system remains the dominant mode of transport for heavy goods to local and international routes. It also links Zambia to six African seaports such as Dar es Salaam, Beira, East London, Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town. The railway system however, requires substantial investment to upgrade it into an ultra modern facility that would allow speedy transportation of goods and products to the ports for delivery to other markets. In air transport, Zambia has 4 international airports at Lusaka, Livingstone, Mfuwe and Ndola. In order to support the increased transportation demand for goods and services, there is need to increase the capacity of the existing airports to provide direct links with most countries in the sub-region and other places. Connections to all countries in the subregion will also encourage large commercial airlines to set up in the country and take advantage of Zambia’s central location. Over 97 percent of the telephone exchanges are automatic, and the country enjoys direct dialling facilities, fax, e-mail and television links with the rest of the world. In the main urban centres, public telephones and independently operated cellular telephone networks are in place. Zambia also hosts ZamNet and other internet service providers. In order to continue diversifying our export base and further increase our export earnings, it is imperative that we intensify use of marketing strategies that take advantage of the fact that globalisation requires each country to develop more efficient modes of communication. Therefore, inadequate infrastructure, institutional capacity and investment in skilled human resources should continue to be aggressively addressed by targeting identified weak areas, and implement policies to tackle the weaknesses speedily so as to enhance economic growth and developments prospects. In addressing these issues, it is crucial to build strong partnerships, particularly with the private sector, for effective Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development in Zambia. The agriculture sector however, remains one of the key areas where advancements in ICTs have not yet been fully taken advantage of in order to benefit rural communities and the economy in general. In fact, communications infrastructure has been either lacking or inadequate in most rural areas of Zambia to give an opportunity to rural communities to access and distribute information at low cost, as well as facilitate interactive participation in the creation and use of agricultural information. The potential benefits of a well integrated ICT in agriculture are diverse and include: • transparent dissemination of information such as weather patterns, seed and fertilizer use, availability and distribution; • easy accessibility to suppliers of inputs; • common distribution of information on market prices of crops; and • generally bringing together of suppliers and buyers of crops. Government has put agriculture at the core of rural development and poverty reduction as well as employment creation. It is therefore important to note that the expansion of ICTs in rural communities is more required now than ever before, as most information is now 4 BIS Review 76/2008 
disseminated through internet and cellular phones. These facilities will help uplift the living standards of rural communities. 3.2  Agriculture Zambia’s agriculture sector has enormous potential to become a major grower and exporter of agricultural and horticultural produce. The country has an abundance of quality land, water (over 40% of fresh water resources in Southern Africa) and ideal climate all suited to a wide range of agricultural products. Only 15% of Zambia’s 60 million hectares of arable land is under cultivation. The recent surge in food prices in the world presents an enormous opportunity for Zambia to become the food basket of the sub region. This can be achieved by re-doubling efforts to boost agricultural productivity coupled with substantial increase in infrastructure investment to ease supply bottlenecks that are pushing up prices. Zambia’s irrigation potential is estimated at more than 500,000 hectares while only about 40,000 hectares are irrigated despite the country having abundant water resources. Increased yields in agricultural products like maize, rice and wheat, requires inputs such as fertilizers, irrigation water and proper roads to enable the harvested crops to be transported to the main markets and to prevent crop losses. 3.3  Energy (electricity) Abundant investment opportunities exist in the energy sector in view of the huge power deficits in Southern Africa and Zambia’s potential for more hydro-power generation plants. Due to vast water resources and coal reserves, Zambia is ideal for the provision of hydroelectric power. Although most of the electricity is supplied from major hydro stations, there are also small diesel power stations in rural areas. There are plans to develop a 600-megawatt hydroelectric generation plant on the Kafue River. Currently, the development of Itezhi-Tezhi Hydro Electric Project; Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro-Electric Project; Zambia-Tanzania Interconnector; and Zambia-Namibia Interconnector are underway. However, there is still potential for more power generation capacity for the private sector to invest in. Apart from the mining sector that provides a huge demand for power in the country, there is a huge demand for power in the SADC region as well as the Eastern African bloc. The expected rise of the manufacturing sector will also increase demand for power in the country. Opportunities also exist in alternative sources of power such as solar energy and gas energy for domestic cookers. With a temperatures ranging between 15 and 27 degrees for most parts of the year, the solar energy potential is high. The oil refineries in the country also emit gasses that can be tapped and turned into gas for domestic cookers. 3.4  Mining Zambia’s mineral wealth remains substantial. Quite apart from the traditional mining activities in copper and cobalt the list of investment opportunities in this sector include: • Precious metal-gold; silver; selenium; • The platinoid group – iron, tin, nickel and manganese; • Agro-minerals-rock phosphate and igneous phosphate suitable for conversion to fertilizer, peat, limestone; • Reclaiming of copper from slug tailing dumps; • Gemstones-emerald, amethyst, aquamarine, tourmaline; • Nickel; BIS Review 76/2008 5 
• Uranium; and • Other deposits-talc, fluorspar, graphite, barites and clays, etc. The 1995 Mines and Minerals Act provide exemption from import duty and VAT on all machinery and equipment, including specialised motor vehicles required for prospecting or mining activities. In its 2008 Budget, the Government introduced the new fiscal and regulatory framework for the mining sector. Under this framework, the mining sector will begin to adequately contribute to the advancement of and the social economic welfare of the people of Zambia. 3.5  Tourism Untapped tourism opportunities exist in all the 19 National Parks and 34 game management areas as well as the 23 million hectares devoted to the conservation of an amazing variety of animals. Major attractions include the Victoria Falls (one of the seven natural wonders of the world) and the Kariba Lake (one of the largest man-made lake). Specific areas of investment in this sector include: • Game ranching; • Provision of accommodation (i.e. high quality five and four star hotels, Lodges and Camp sites near the popular tourist areas); • Transport service – Investment potential exists in air charters in form of helicopters and/or small planes to service game areas; • Adventure holiday packages; • Organised tours; • Out door sports facilities (golf courses and stadia); and • Zambia’s cultural heritage. 3.6  Construction and real estate The construction sector is yet another area of investment as the economy expands. A lot has been done in the recent past in construction with housing schemes coming up in various parts of the country. However, there is still a large deficit in terms of housing in Zambia. This deficit in housing provides an opportunity for further investment in the construction of more houses. 4.0  Conclusion Looking ahead, the achievement and maintenance of a low and stable inflation rate, remains key to enhancement of investment, business planning, confidence in the economy, maintaining external competitiveness and stabilising people’s incomes. In the medium-term, Government continues to pursue market and structural reforms in partnership with the private sector with the view of consolidating the gains so far attained for sustained economic growth and development. Currently, there are enormous business opportunities which still lie unexploited in Zambia in virtually all sectors of the economy. The overall economic growth in the economy would be enhanced underpinned on low and single digit inflation and relative stable exchange rate. With an enabling environment, the private sector would exploit their full potential. Hence, employment would increase and poverty reduction would be achieved. This would contribute to the achievement of MDGs and towards the attainment of the Vision 2030. 6 BIS Review 76/2008 
Axel A Weber: Financial markets and the central bank Keynote speech by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the SUERF Colloquium “New trends in asset management: exploring the implications”, Munich, 12 June 2008. *      *      * 1 Introduction  Ladies and gentlemen In recent years, we have seen far-reaching structural changes in global financial markets. Financial innovation has manifested itself in various ways, the most prominent being the growing importance of new and complex financial instruments, the increasing significance of new business models, especially in the realm of securitisation and disintermediation, and intensifying competition, partly owing to the consolidation process in the banking sector, partly owing to the rising importance of relatively new, largely unregulated players, such as hedge funds, private equity firms, conduits and SIVs. These remarkable financial developments are bound to alter the range of activities financial market participants pursue. But are they also changing financial markets’ reaction to monetary policy? The starting point for answering this question is easy to find: the monetary policy transmission process. This term describes the long, variable and uncertain process by which a change in a central bank’s official interest rate impacts first on financial markets and is ultimately transmitted to the economy in general and the price level in particular. As a significant part of this monetary policy transmission process takes place in financial markets, it goes without saying that the recent trends in global financial markets are of special interest to central bankers – and it would not have needed the recent financial market turmoil to drive home that point. Against this backdrop, I will focus my remarks today on the following three issues. First, have the recent structural changes in the global financial system altered the transmission process of monetary policy – and, if so, do these changes make a central banker’s life more – or less – difficult? Second, how can central banks help avoid disturbances in the financial system? This is a crucial question because financial stability is a precondition for the effective transmission of monetary policy decisions to the real economy. Third, how does financial integration affect monetary policy transmission? Specifically, what is the current state of affairs in the euro area? 2  Financial markets and monetary policy transmission I shall start with the most general question. To what extent have the recent financial market trends changed the way monetary policy affects the economy and its price level? This is a crucial issue. Without a fair knowledge of the monetary transmission process, its key variables and the lags involved, central banks will face a tough job when deciding on official interest rates. For this reason, the Eurosystem closely monitors structural developments in financial markets. We also try to detect how financial innovations could have modified the way changes in short-term interest rates are transmitted to other financial variables, output and inflation. Without wanting to go into too much detail, it is essential to point out that, when it comes to the impact the recent financial trends have on monetary policy transmission, several countervailing effects are in play. These countervailing effects are best captured when unravelling monetary policy transmission into its different channels, that is by considering BIS Review 76/2008 1 
individually the different ways in which a change in central bank interest rates affects economic variables – at least in the short term. Let me focus on the channels and arguments that are the most prominent in the euro area. To begin with, there is the interest rate channel. According to the existing literature, the development of deeper, more complete and more competitive financial markets seems to have strengthened the pass-through from central bank interest rates to market interest rates. This can be put down to two factors: Consolidation in the banking system, implying the emergence of (fewer and) larger banks and thus improved arbitrage opportunities between different financial markets, and an enhanced availability of alternative capital market-based instruments for debt financing. It is indeed likely that the increased competition between banks, as well as between bank loans and different financial market products, has led to a closer relationship between market and bank interest rates. Consequently, the deepening of financial markets should have amplified and/or speeded-up the effects of monetary policy on bank interest rates (and, other things being equal, on other financial variables, output and inflation). Financial developments over the past decade should also have strengthened the balance sheet channel. Basically, the idea is that, in an economy with highly developed mortgage markets and a proliferation of mark-to-market accounting rules, changes in the value of collateral and wealth have a greater impact on the economy. In such an environment, borrowers’ balance sheets tend to fluctuate more, which leads to a higher volatility in the amount of funds banks are willing to lend to households and firms. Obviously, greater changes in the supply of credit will translate into greater changes in consumption and investment, thereby strengthening monetary policy transmission. At the same time, a third prominent monetary policy transmission channel, the bank lending channel, is generally supposed to have become less important. Comparable with the balance sheet channel, the bank lending channel emphasises that monetary policy can influence aggregate demand not only through interest rates, but also through its impact on the supply of bank loans. Whereas the balance sheet channel focuses on the availability and value of collateral necessary for borrowing operations, the bank lending channel refers to changes in the banks’ and borrowers’ funding possibilities. Usually, two reasons are put forward why the balance sheet channel has weakened of late. Banks have become more flexible because of the growing use of securitisation and improvements in risk management. Consequently, banks can respond more flexibly to changes in financial market conditions and will therefore not pass through each and every change in the central bank’s official short-term interest rate. Hence, other things being equal, the effect of monetary policy on the overall loan supply has decreased. Moreover, financial development has not only broadened banks’ options in terms of responding to interest rate changes; it has also broadened borrowers’ financing opportunities, reducing their dependency on bank loans. To put all the arguments in a nutshell, monetary policy seems, on balance, to have gained influence on financial market prices and the real economy in the short run. This is confirmed by the existing theoretical and empirical literature, which, by the way, delves much more deeply into the intricacies of the various transmission channels than I am able to do today. In any case, it should be borne in mind that the evidence is still tentative. As financial development is an ongoing phenomenon, it should therefore be considered valid only at the current juncture. Nonetheless, the bottom line is that, in the face of greater competition among financial intermediaries, financial innovation and financial globalisation, monetary policy remains a powerful tool for delivering price stability.  In this context, however, it is of the essence that the monetary policy strategy utilises a broad-based approach in order to guarantee a robust assessment of the developments in the economy and on financial markets. 2 BIS Review 76/2008 
3  Financial stability 3.1 Financial stability analysis Let me now turn to financial stability. A widely accepted definition of financial stability is the ability of the financial system to perform its key functions efficiently, namely, the allocation of capital and risks and the settlement of payments and securities transactions. These functions must be fulfilled smoothly not only in normal times, but also during periods of structural adjustment and stress.  For obvious reasons, supporting financial stability is an important objective for central banks – and has always been so. First, as noted above, monetary policy is largely transmitted through financial market operations. Hence, the effect that monetary policy has on the real economy depends crucially on the smooth functioning of financial intermediaries and financial markets. It is at this point that financial stability analysis and monetary policy analysis are most closely interlinked.  Second and more generally, major macroeconomic objectives, especially price stability and sustainable output growth, are jeopardised if the financial system suffers from instability. This is underlined by the generally high macroeconomic costs of financial crises. In addition, this aspect has gained importance since financial turbulences seem to have become more frequent in past decades owing to accelerated growth in financial transactions and the greater complexity of new financial instruments. Third, financial stability is closely linked to a central bank’s interest in the prudent design and management of the payment and settlement systems which process its currency. The Eurosystem, for instance, has the statutory task of promoting the smooth operation of payment and settlement systems. Against this background, referring to financial stability analysis as a new trend among central bankers would be something of a misnomer. Indeed, financial stability analysis is anything but a passing fashion. It has, in fact, been a field of research of its own right since the mid-1990s. This is reflected in the wide dissemination of Financial Stability Reports, which are now produced in more than 50 countries worldwide.  Nonetheless, it is fair to say that financial stability analysis is still, to a large extent, work in progress. To illustrate my point, let me outline briefly the kind of challenges central banks face. To begin with, financial stability is not easily measured. This is hardly surprising as, in contrast to monetary policy analysis, there is no single indicator (such as inflation) to observe. Similarly, initiatives to create some sort of an all-encompassing financial stability index have failed to convince so far. Instead, the concept of financial stability involves various financial intermediaries, financial market segments and infrastructure, for which a whole host of different quantitative and qualitative indicators exist. As a consequence, determining the degree of financial stability remains a highly complex task. At this point, the natural suggestion from an academic outsider would be to construct a theoretical model. Such a simplified representation of reality would help the academic to single out the most relevant indicators and to define the interrelationships between financial market and economic variables. However, model-based financial stability analysis is still in its infancy. Three issues are particularly striking. The feedback effects between financial system behaviour and the real economy are difficult to model, especially in episodes of stress. Currently, most macroeconomic models treat key financial system interactions and feedback effects only in a rudimentary manner. Therefore, the “true” costs in terms of real GDP that are associated with systemic risk in financial markets are difficult to determine. This is a significant limitation, given that feedback effects play a crucial role in assessing a financial system’s vulnerability to contagion and system-wide stress. BIS Review 76/2008 3 
Another principal reason why episodes of stress are difficult to model lies in the fact that financial instability is inherently non-linear. As one consequence of this non-linearity, risk factors typically are not normally distributed. Instead, their distribution is characterised by fat tails, implying that extreme values are observed more frequently than what would be predicted under the assumption of normality. Modelling non-linearities greatly complicates research, but it is indispensable, given the central focus of financial stability analysis on default, contagion and spillover effects.  A further challenge faced by financial stability analysts is a lack of relevant data. First of all, historical time series on episodes of stress are rare, luckily. But that makes it even more difficult to understand financial markets’ behaviour in the fat tail of risk distributions. Moreover, and more generally, some of the data needed for financial stability analysis still require development. With the exception of market prices and regulatory information, only a limited set of data is on hand in a timely, comparable and satisfactory manner. Think, for instance, of financial intermediaries’ financial reporting and the little information available on credit risk transfer. Therefore, methods have to be found for handling the shifting demand for data in an environment in which financial markets are constantly undergoing change. To sum up, feedback effects, non-linearities and the handling of a limited set of data are prime examples of the numerous challenges encountered by financial stability analysts in designing financial stability models. As a consequence, it comes as no surprise that a standard analytical model of financial stability has not yet been developped. At present, modelling is often scattered with respect to risk categories, financial market segments and structural or regulatory issues. Mind you, there is no reason to play down the progress achieved so far, on the contrary. Financial stability analysis is becoming more and more sophisticated, as is borne witness by the increasing number of related working papers and conferences.  As for the recent financial market turmoil – the trigger for the recent financial market turbulence, the speed at which it spread across global financial markets and its persistence were not foreseen, but that does not conflict with my statement. Far from it – financial stability analysis does not aim for clairvoyance. Instead, it is most likely that financial crises will continue to emerge in spite of perceptible progress in financial stability analysis. But the crucial point is that their impact can be alleviated by warnings, moral suasion and – if necessary – adjustments to the institutional and regulatory framework. For this reason, further improvement in the framework for financial stability analysis is a very high priority for central banks.  3.2  Dealing with episodes of financial instability  There is yet another reason why central banks need to keep well-informed on financial market developments. The turmoil that has been affecting global financial markets since summer last year has been a further example of central banks not only taking a predominantly passive role in analysing and commenting on financial stability, but also of playing an active part as well. Indeed, the role of central banks in crisis management dates back to the 19th century and was reflected in the views of Thornton and Bagehot. Both noted that a central bank should – under specific conditions – provide liquidity to the banking system as a lender of last resort.  And that is exactly what happened when the crisis in the US subprime market triggered a rapid loss of confidence among financial intermediaries on a global scale. As a result of it, uncollateralised interbank lending has been muted – the reasons for which are twofold. On the one hand, banks’ willingness to lend has fallen sharply due to mounting counterparty risks. On the other, the uncertainty banks face with respect to their own longer-term liquidity planning has increased considerably. To alleviate ongoing tensions in interbank money markets, central banks from all over the world have acted as liquidity providers of last resort to the banking system.  4 BIS Review 76/2008 
As for the Eurosystem, we have so far stood the test in this challenging environment. Owing to the broad design of our liquidity operations toolbox, the Eurosystem’s operational framework has had to change only slightly since the outbreak of the financial market turbulence. What is more, the Eurosystem succeeded fairly quickly in reestablishing confidence in the functioning of the Euro money market by promptly injecting additional funds on a temporary basis. We shall continue to provide liquidity flexibly – which seems warranted given the ongoing tensions in the Euro money market, including, and especially, in the longer-term sector.  Although there have recently been some identifiable signs of easing in several financial market segments, it is still too early to give the all-clear. Specifically, the still elevated level of money market spreads underlines the fact that there is no room for complacency.  In this context, I would like to stress two points. In the Eurosystem, we have strictly separated our management of aggregate liquidity conditions from the determination of our monetary policy stance. Hence, when deciding on interest rates, the primary objective of the Governing Council has been (and will continue to be) price stability. Against the background of the continuing and persistently strong upside risks to price stability, the Governing Council is in a state of heightened alertness and in readiness to act. Moreover, our strict separation makes clear that the Eurosystem does not intentionally and directly offer some sort of ex post insurance to financial market participants who have engaged in excessive risk-taking. This is intended to limit moral hazard to a large extent. Apart from this, it seems appropriate to point out that, in a free market economy, central banks’ liquidity support must always be confined to a transitional period. In other words, in the medium run, central bank interventions cannot substitute the need for financial intermediaries to regain confidence gradually. At the top of the list of requirements, I would like to see financial intermediaries trying to enhance their transparency regarding credit and market risk exposures and also, if necessary, raising capital and adjusting business models. Furthermore, it is essential that financial intermediaries convince investors that the financial system as a whole is capable of managing risks adequately in a setting of continuously changing financial market trends. Finally, taking a step back from crisis management, the recent financial market turmoil has underscored the need for crisis prevention to be strengthened. This is exactly what is taking place at the moment. National, European and international forums and organisations are currently putting a lot of effort into identifying the lessons to be learned. There are various initiatives under way, but it is particularly important that the recommendations made by the Financial Stability Forum are implemented rapidly and effectively. The implementation of these recommendations, including those on disclosure standards and risk management, will be a major step forward in enhancing the resilience of the international financial system.  4  Financial integration in the euro area If I were governor of a central bank whose currency area coincided with the boundaries of its financial markets, I could end my speech here with a brief summary. However, as governor of a central bank that is an integral part of the Eurosystem, there is yet another topic to cover: financial integration. It is generally accepted that, in a currency union, well-integrated financial markets facilitate the implementation of the single monetary policy. There are three aspects worth mentioning. First, a currency union should work more smoothly, the more integrated the national financial markets are. Indeed, financial integration can help individual EMU member states to absorb country-specific shocks more easily. The reason for this is that the more diversified the sources of national income and the easier it is to borrow abroad, the less consumption and investment need to follow fluctuations in national output. Hence, national consumption and BIS Review 76/2008 5 
investment levels can be insulated from domestic macroeconomic shocks via cross-border risk sharing. Second, financial integration strengthens the stability of the euro area financial system – and of the macro economy in general. Basically, in a well-integrated financial system, risks tend to be more diversified on a cross-border scale which should lead to financial intermediaries, markets and infrastructure becoming more resilient to idiosyncratic shocks. Having said that, integrated financial markets arguably broaden the scope for spillover effects across borders – as manifested by the recent US subprime crisis. Third, I have already stated that the Eurosystem’s tasks include the smooth operation of payment and settlement systems – which is closely linked to the progress of financial integration. There is an abundance of evidence that the launch of the euro was a major catalyst for financial integration in the euro area. In general, financial integration is most advanced in those market segments which are the closest to the single monetary policy. This is particularly visible in the unsecured money market, which was almost perfectly integrated right at the start of EMU, as measured by the low cross-country standard deviation of the average overnight lending rates among euro area countries. Moreover, the euro has significantly reduced home bias in the euro area bond and equity markets, albeit to varying degrees. Principally, financial integration has progressed most in government bond markets and is least advanced in equity markets. Having said that, the percentage of cross-border holdings of bonds and equities in the euro area has grown over the past ten years. In addition, bond market yields and share prices are increasingly being driven by common euro area factors, although local factors continue to play a role. These developments have been supported by the elimination of currency risk within the euro area, the higher demand from a larger pool of investors, and – as far as bonds issued by smaller member states and companies are concerned – the reduction of liquidity premiums in domestic-currency debt. In essence, however, these developments reflect the high degree of substitutability among bonds and equities issued by various governments and corporations across the euro area. Let me also highlight the fact that the recent financial market turbulence has not undone the process of financial integration in the euro area. True, euro area sovereign spreads vis-à-vis the German benchmark have increased substantially. Moreover, cross-border country and cross-sector dispersions in euro area equity returns have risen since the second half of 2007. Both examples indicate that national factors in market dynamics and asset pricing have regained importance in a time of financial market tensions. But the scale on which this has happened is still small in comparison with the major developments of the past ten years. As already noted, financial integration in the euro area has not proceeded at the same pace across all sectors and markets. Integration of the retail banking markets, for instance, has remained limited, reflecting the persistence of legal, institutional and cultural differences. This shows that financial integration in the euro area is dependent not only on how close a market segment is to monetary policy, but also on how far the relevant market infrastructures have become integrated. A case in point is the high degree of integration of the large-value payment systems in the euro area. They have made possible the integration of euro area money markets. TARGET2, offered by the Eurosystem, is a further step forward in that direction. Other efforts to reduce infrastructure barriers are under way. One of the most significant initiatives in this regard is the Eurosystem’s TARGET2-Securities project which will provide a pan-European securities settlement platform. These innovations demonstrate that the Eurosystem attaches great importance to promoting financial integration in the euro area. 6 BIS Review 76/2008 
5  Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, this has been a wide-ranging overview of the changing relationship between central banks and financial markets. I hope it has given you some flavour of the importance that financial stability, financial market developments and financial integration have for monetary policy implementation. Financial markets have always been a field of vital interest to the Eurosystem, but certainly, the recent financial market turmoil has been a further spur to our efforts in coping with periods of financial stress, conducting financial market research, and supporting the integration of the euro area financial markets. First and foremost, however, the Eurosystem contributes to safeguarding financial stability by maintaining price stability in the euro area in the medium term.  Thank you for your attention.

Axel A Weber: Financial markets and monetary policy Speech by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the University of Constance, Constance, 25 June 2008. *      *      * 1  Introduction  Ladies and gentlemen It is a great pleasure to be here, at the University of Constance, where I myself studied economics some 30 years ago. When I finished my studies, the university’s postgraduate studies programme “International Economic Relations” had not yet been launched. In retrospect, I think there were many interesting topics to study in the late 70s and early 80s. Think of the two oil price crises of the 1970s or the Great Inflation in the USA. In fact, both topics are worryingly relevant today – even though the background story is now a different one and our theoretical and empirical insights have advanced significantly.  I would therefore like to come back to both issues later on when I will also be able to talk about the current monetary policy stance of the Eurosystem. Before doing so, however, I would like to focus on yet another topic: financial markets and central banks. My choice seems a natural one given the extent to which global financial markets have been characterised by turmoil and volatility over the past 11 months. Indeed, what began as a fairly contained deterioration in the (relatively small) US-subprime market in August last year has rapidly developed into a severe test of the stability of the global financial system.  Financial markets perform an indispensable task for economic welfare. They provide the services and products by which the intertemporal allocation of savings and investments is accomplished. As such, financial market stability is a precondition for macroeconomic stability and economic growth. In addition, monetary policy is largely transmitted to the real economy and the price level through financial market operations. It should therefore come as no surprise then that central banks have always had a keen interest in financial market developments. And, most certainly, there was no need for the recent financial market turmoil to drive home that point. I have chosen two topical questions to guide me in my following remarks: First, what are the underlying causes of the recent financial market turmoil? Second, how can central banks help avoid disturbances in the financial system?  2 The underlying causes of the recent financial market turmoil When looking at the underlying causes of the recent tension in the global financial system, is one particular development to blame as a clear cause? In fact, numerous culprits have been put forward: securitisation, quality of risk management, credit rating agencies, compensation schemes, accounting standards – to name just a few. Against this background, I am extremely sceptical about monocausal explanations. Instead, I believe that a cocktail of various ingredients triggered the shock waves for the financial system.  Many ingredients in this recipe stem from innovations in financial intermediation or, to be more precise, from a combination of new and complex instruments to transfer credit risks and the “originate and distribute” business model. The disruptions of the previous few months have highlighted the increased complexity of credit risk transfer (CRT) instruments. This would have been less problematic if the risk management systems of financial intermediaries had kept pace with the changing characteristics of the financial landscape. However, not all of them did. At the same time, the investor base has become more diffuse, with some participants being only recent entrants to the CRT markets. All of this suggests that several investors may not have fully appreciated the higher-risk nature of CRT products and were therefore overly optimistic in their assessments of the risks involved.  BIS Review 82/2008 1 
As you probably know, the securitisation activity was promoted by the “originate and distribute” model at large banks and securities firms. On a positive note, the securitising, tranching and trading of credit risks has led to a fairly broad risk dispersion. But it has become clear that the “originate and distribute” model can actually improve the resilience of the financial system only if a high-quality standard is maintained at all levels of the transfer process and no new concentrations of risk arise. The past few years, however, have been characterised by a series of distorted incentives which has manifested itself in lax origination standards for products such as subprime mortgages and an excessive reliance on credit ratings by some investors.  As a final point, let me add that, at the end of the day, the “originate and distribute” model led – rather unexpectedly – to a huge reintermediation of credit risks on to banks’ balance sheets. In other words, the financial market turmoil has demonstrated that removing assets from bank balance sheets does not mean that banks are no longer exposed to the risks associated with them. Hence, risk management systems should reconsider their view of reputational risk, credit guarantees and credit lines to off-balance-sheet entities such as structured investment vehicles and conduits. In a nutshell, securitisation, as Claudio Borio aptly put it in 2008, has, in the end, “distributed fear rather than risks”. However, while financial innovation has undoubtedly increased vulnerabilities in the global financial system, there is more to the present financial market turmoil than meets the eye of the casual observer.  The proliferation of structured finance products and the “originate and distribute” model would arguably not have been possible without the benign economic and financial backdrop notably robust global economic growth, low inflation, a low level of interest rates, low default rates and rising asset prices in many countries, not just in the USA. This Goldilocks economy, where conditions were neither “too cold” nor “too hot”, had – as a side effect – masked the gradual build-up of financial imbalances. Hence, while lending and risk-taking experienced rapid growth, words of warning by central banks and other institutions were largely disregarded on the basis of “this time, developments are surely different from the past”. The fact that minor financial market tensions in the spring of 2005 and in 2006 had left financial markets more or less unscathed only reinforced that impression. Once, however, the vulnerabilities in the global financial system were revealed in August last year and financial imbalances started unwinding, we all witnessed that the scene changed considerably. 3 Financial stability analysis at central banks For some time now, there has been much talk about financial stability and the respective role of central banks, and so I would like to address this topic here. A widely accepted definition of financial stability is the ability of the financial system to perform its key functions efficiently – namely, the allocation of capital and risks and the settlement of payments and securities transactions. These functions must be fulfilled smoothly not only in normal times but also during periods of structural adjustment and stress. Stable financial systems reduce uncertainty and therefore develop positive external effects on the real economy, thereby contributing to greater economic prosperity. However, the reverse is also true: Instability in the financial system can have negative external effects and therefore cause high economic costs. Contributing to financial stability is thus part of a central bank’s core area of responsibility, in order to ensure price stability and avert negative repercussions of the financial system on the real economy. Just over a year ago, some observers questioned this view, calling it a temporary “fad” or even dismissing it as the result of central banks’ searching for new responsibilities – these voices have now been silenced for obvious reasons. Indeed, financial stability analysis is anything but a passing fashion. It has established itself as a field of research of its own right since the mid-1990s, when financial stability issues were boosted by 2 BIS Review 82/2008 
financial globalisation and an acceleration in financial innovation. This is reflected in the wide dissemination of financial stability reports, which central banks now produce in more than 50 countries worldwide.  I would therefore like to give you a brief overview of the kind of challenges central banks face when embarking on financial stability analysis. It starts with the fact that financial stability is not easily measured. This is hardly surprising as, in contrast to monetary policy analysis, there is no single indicator (such as inflation) to observe.  Similarly, initiatives to create some sort of an all-encompassing financial stability index have failed to convince so far. Instead, the concept of financial stability involves various financial intermediaries, financial market segments and infrastructure, for which a whole host of different quantitative and qualitative indicators exist. As a consequence, determining the degree of financial stability remains a highly complex task. Moreover, constructing theoretical models and conducting model-based financial stability analysis are still in their infancy. One particular difficulty lies in modelling periods of stress. To begin with, modellers face a lack of relevant data as historical time series on episodes of stress are rare, luckily. More generally, it is difficult to capture the behaviour of financial market participants because they are affected by feedback effects between the financial system and the real economy. In many cases, a shock to the financial system will be amplified by interrelationships between financial markets and economic variables. For instance and without reference to the present situation in the euro area, if, after a period of financial turbulence, financial intermediaries experience a widespread process of deleveraging, credit crunch mechanisms might come into play that could drive bigger second-round effects on the economy and, in turn, cause further losses in the banking sector. How to model such feedback effects consistently is still an open issue. Another significant limitation to assessing a financial system’s vulnerability to contagion and system-wide stress is the fact that financial instability is inherently non-linear. As one consequence of this non-linearity, risk factors typically are not normally distributed. Instead, their distribution is characterised by fat tails, implying that extreme values are observed more frequently than what would be predicted under the assumption of normality. Modelling non-linearities greatly complicates research, but it is indispensable, given the central focus of financial stability analysis on default, contagion and spillover effects.  To sum up, it should come as no surprise that a standard analytical model of financial stability has not yet been developed. At present, modelling is often scattered with respect to risk categories, financial market segments and structural or regulatory issues. Mind you, there is no reason to play down the progress achieved so far. On the contrary. Financial stability analysis is becoming more and more sophisticated, as is borne witness by the increasing number of related working papers and conferences. As for the recent financial market turmoil, central banks (and other institutions) have frequently and in good time warned of many aspects, notably excessive risk-taking and a general underpricing of risk. However, the trigger for the recent financial market turbulence, the speed at which it spread across global financial markets and its persistence were not foreseen, but that does not conflict with my statement. Far from it – financial stability analysis does not aim for clairvoyance. Instead, it is most likely that financial crises will continue to emerge in spite of perceptible progress in financial stability analysis. But the crucial point is that their impact can be alleviated by warnings, moral suasion and – if necessary – adjustments to the institutional and regulatory framework.  Right now, national, European and international institutions and forums are putting a lot of effort into identifying the lessons to be learned. In an international context, most notably, the analysis and recommendations by the Financial Stability Forum and the recently published “Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision” by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision deserve close attention. They are an important step forward in making the international financial system more resilient.  BIS Review 82/2008 3 
4  The Eurosystem’s current monetary policy stance Even though financial stability is of vital interest to the Eurosystem, our primary objective is the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. During the past ten years, the Eurosystem has lived up to this mandate. Since the inception of the euro, annual inflation in the euro area has, on average, remained in the close vicinity of 2% (at 2.05% to be precise), which is only marginally above the Eurosystem’s benchmark for price stability. Recently, however, euro-area inflation has accelerated, remaining above 3% for the past seven months and reaching a worrying record high of 3.7% in May. This confirms that the current upward pressures on euro-area inflation, which result largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level, are rather persistent.  On the face of it, the present inflationary pattern seems to bear some resemblance to that of the 1970s. Not only is inflation unusually high in many countries but the oil price increase that has occurred gradually over the past few years is now comparable in real terms to that of the 1970s. Furthermore, economic growth is slowing down on a global scale, even though, as far as the euro area is concerned, we do expect it to remain robust, but certainly less dynamic in the quarters ahead. On closer observation, however, there are several caveats worth mentioning. They might explain why the present oil price shock has so far been less damaging than that of the 1970s. First, oil intensity has decreased substantially over the past 30 years both as a consequence of the declining relative weight of the energy-intensive industrial sector in the industrialised countries and growing ecological awareness. Second, whereas the shocks of the 1970s were caused mainly by sizeable disruptions to the oil supply, the present episode is largely driven by unexpectedly buoyant demand for oil, particularly from the rapidly growing emerging market countries – notably China. The latest price hikes, however, are primarily related to supply-side factors. The third, and arguably most important, difference between today and the 1970s is the accumulated advance in the theory of monetary policy making. Monetary theory no longer sees inflation as a by-product of real-sector forces which are largely outside the control of the central bank. On the contrary, in the long run inflation is generally believed to be a monetary phenomenon. Therefore, there is widespread agreement on the substantial benefits of price stability and central bank independence, on the forward-looking nature of monetary policy and its need for credibility and commitment. Given these changes in monetary policy, the re-emergence of an inflationary wage-price spiral which was characteristic of the 1970s now appears less likely. But even if these differences to the 1970s are reassuring, there is no room for complacency. First, oil prices have hiked more strongly and persistently than generally anticipated. Their present level in real terms even surpasses that of the 1970s. In addition, the uncertainty surrounding future oil price developments greatly complicates the accurate forecasting of inflation and therefore poses a further challenge to monetary policy. Second, apprehension is growing that inflation expectations are on the rise. In the euro area, this is chiefly true for short-term to medium-term inflation expectations, which cover the policy-relevant time horizon of monetary policy. By contrast, medium to longer-term inflation expectations which are the best indicator of the public confidence in the central bank and its credibility have not moved significantly. This is especially true for survey-based measures. Yet, even if the rise in longer-term inflation expectations is only marginal compared to the substantial temporary increase in the current HICP rate, this is not guaranteed to remain unchanged.  In that respect, the Great Inflation of the 1970s should serve as a cautionary tale. Subsequent to the two oil price shocks, many industrialised countries experienced a period of elevated inflation. As a word of warning I would like to add that correlation should not be confounded with causation. Obviously, global developments at that time were affected by more than just high and rising oil prices. Nonetheless, I will focus my remarks on the nexus between oil price hikes and monetary policy. In particular, I will touch on two examples of the 1970s, that of Germany (which I am most familiar with) and the USA (which has been widely 4 BIS Review 82/2008 
discussed in the macroeconomic literature). Germany suffered to a much lesser extent from the Great Inflation than many economies elsewhere. One reason for that might be the high inflation aversion in the German public that had evolved as a consequence of the two periods of hyperinflation in Germany in the first half of the 20th century. It enabled the Bundesbank to adopt a firmer monetary policy stance than many of its counterparts. The start was not perfect. In 1973, right after gaining freedom of action after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the Bundesbank tried to keep inflation low by means of moral suasion rather than by committing itself to a clear strategy. Trade unions more or less ignored the Bundesbank’s signals and pushed through high increases in nominal wages, trying to compensate for the loss in real disposable income. As a consequence, inflation went up. But the Bundesbank learned from that experience and, in 1975, together with the Swiss National Bank, was the first central bank worldwide to adopt a monetary targeting strategy, thereby committing itself publicly to a stability-oriented policy. After the second oil price shock, from 1979 to 1981, the Bundesbank sent out clear signals for restoring price stability by raising its key interest rates sharply. As a consequence, German inflation did not rise as much as in the USA and started to decline earlier. At the same time, output losses also remained lower than in the USA, demonstrating that a restrictive monetary policy can, in the medium term, prove superior also in real terms.  The situation in the USA and in many other industrialised countries was different. In the USA, consumer prices started to hike as early as the mid-1960s for reasons which were at first unrelated to the oil market (Vietnam War, food prices, monetary policy geared to combating recession) from 1½% in 1965 to 6% in 1970 and in the aftermath of the oil price shocks to more than 14% in 1980. In response to this persistent upward trend in actual inflation, short-term inflation expectations also drifted upwards, until they peaked at 12% in 1981. Such a spiral of mutually reinforcing increases in inflation and inflation expectations suggests that monetary policy somehow did not rise to the challenge of that period.  The macroeconomic literature has put forward numerous, often complementary explanations, and I would like to focus on two of them. First, it has been argued that monetary policy in the USA – though broadly committed to price stability – did not respond sufficiently strongly to high and rising inflation rates before 1979 (technically speaking, it did not adhere to the Taylor principle).1 By not readily raising key interest rates, the Fed allowed public inflation expectations to become unhinged, which gave rise to a damaging wage-price spiral and further fuelled inflation. According to this view, monetary policy itself injected volatility into the US economy, thereby contributing markedly to the large and persistent inflation fluctuations of the 1970s. As I noted earlier, both the macroeconomic framework of the 1970s and the general understanding of monetary policy have undergone notable changes. Nonetheless, the US experience demonstrates how quickly inflation expectations can drift upwards if actual inflation is persistently above the stability norm of the central bank and if, consequently, market participants lose confidence in the central bank’s will to restore price stability. Another explanation of the Great Inflation focuses on the Fed’s response to output.2 This view does not regard the Fed’s weak response to inflation as problematic, but the importance it attached to output stabilisation. Indeed, a strongly activist monetary policy, which strives to keep the economy close to potential, suffers from a fundamental conceptual problem. Although such a policy performs well under ideal conditions, it may well produce markedly sub-optimal outcomes given the inevitable uncertainties associated with estimating the output gap in real time. The latter is what happened during the Great Inflation. It is argued that the Fed did not detect the productivity slowdown in the USA, which started in the mid-                                                 1  See Clarida, Galí and Gertler (2000). 2  See Orphanides (2003, 2004).

1960s, in real time. In a similar vein, the Fed (and probably many other central banks) did not immediately take account of the fact that a persistent increase in oil prices has a dampening effect on potential output, even if the exact magnitude is difficult to quantify with any precision both directly via a reduction in energy inputs and indirectly via making some of the existing capital stock redundant. Both factors led to a systematic overestimation of US potential output. Consequently, the slow-down in the US economy after the first oil price shock was (wrongly) perceived as a significant increase in economic slack, which the central bank did not want to counter with a tightening monetary policy. For the same reasons, the central bank systematically underestimated inflationary pressures and, hence, thought its monetary policy stance more restrictive than it actually was. In any case, the lesson to be learned from this explanation is that monetary policy has to factor in changes in potential output even if they are unobservable in real time. In particular, central banks should keep in mind that persistent oil price hikes are likely to cause a decline in potential output. Against the background of the Great Inflation, the most pressing issue at the current juncture is whether there is any danger that the Eurosystem will repeat the policy mistakes of the 1970s. To give you the answer straightaway, no, I do not think so. As for the risk of inaccurately assessing potential output, I would first like to emphasise that the Eurosystem does not primarily aim at output stabilisation. Our primary objective is price stability. However, potential output, the output gap and capacity utilisation are part and parcel of the collection of data that the ECB Governing Council monitors to assess the short and medium-term risks to price stability. But we are aware of the uncertainties surrounding such data and make allowance for it by cross-checking the short to medium-term indications for monetary policy coming from the economic analysis with the medium to long-term perspective stemming from the monetary analysis. Given the Eurosystem’s stability orientation, we take the dampening impact of oil price shocks on potential output into account and have therefore not yielded to calls to relax our monetary policy stance. If we did, monetary policy would only strengthen the shock-related inflationary pressures. At the current juncture, however, with inflation in the euro area having reached a record high and inflation risks still on the upside, there is the concrete risk that longer-term inflation expectations will start creeping up more strongly. The experience of the Great Inflation demonstrates that a stability-oriented central bank is well-advised to fight the risk of broad-based second-round effects decisively and proactively. By doing so, it will keep the costs of curbing inflation dynamics relatively low. Our commitment to a systematic focus on price stability is even more important, as the recent rounds of wage settlement in the euro area have not contributed to curbing inflation pressures. On the contrary, recent wage dynamics in conjunction with elevated and persistent energy and food price pressures have increased the risk of a prolonged period of intolerably high inflation. At our last meeting of the ECB Governing Council, we emphasised that, given the uncertainty about the economic outlook and the prevailing downside risks to economic growth, the continued vigorous expansion of money and credit and the strong upside risks to price stability, the Governing Council is in a state of heightened alertness. Financial markets should by now have understood our readiness to act. It is our strong determination to secure a firm anchoring of medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability. After all, the best contribution that the Eurosystem can make to sustainable growth in the euro area is to safeguard price stability in the medium to long term And lastly we should also not forget that a reliable monetary policy also helps to reduce uncertainty in times of an ongoing financial market turmoil.  Thank you for your attention. References Beyer A., V. Gaspar, C. Gerberding and O.

Martín Redrado: Fiscal space for stability, growth and social inclusion Remarks by Mr Martín Redrado, Governor of the Central Bank of Argentina, at the G-20 workshop, Buenos Aires, 19-20 June 2008. *      *      * As many have mentioned, it could be a rarity to find a central banker addressing on fiscal policy. But, as we have been discussing over the two days of this workshop, the growing complexity of the world economy poses major challenges to policy makers. And, definitely, the ability and flexibility to coordinate the different branches of economic policy lay as one of the most significant. It seems long ago when Keynes realized that there was more room for fiscal policy than just being a public good provider. I believe it wasn’t just a coincidence that it was him, being a specialist in monetary issues, who came out with an answer to, probably, the most intriguing problem of his time. His extraordinary comprehension about how the economy works planted the seeds for the emergence of a macroeconomic theory, which we are still working out and improving on a daily basis. In my opinion, we have a debt of honor to his legacy given the long misinterpretation and wrong pursuing in economic policy on his word. The analysis of public finance has many sides, some of which were addressed along this workshop. From a theoretical standpoint, we can not state that a clear cut effect from fiscal policy on growth. For instance, neoclassical growth models in the Solow’s spirit account for the government basically as a tax collector, showing that the impact on consumers’ behavior depends on savings pattern derived from the usual consumption optimization process. This ultimately implies that fiscal policy can only determine the level of income, but can hardly affect the pace of economic growth. These models have become an engine for the analysis of fiscal policy and taxation. In my view, these kinds of frameworks are robust in terms of describing some stylized facts for free-market environments with very simplified hypothesis. However, they are not able to address some empirical regularities, which are more usual in emerging countries. The vast amount of unemployed resources, including the capacity of the public sector to take the first step in solving this inefficiency is just one example. On the other hand, endogenous growth models acknowledge that fiscal policy is one of the key factors in explaining the different growth rates among countries. But according to this line of thinking, as well as the classical models, a rise in public expenditure has no long-run effect on the growth rate. The exception is the fact that they may increase private sector’s yields and, in that case, public investment could have positive effects on growth. This ultimately can be seen as an improvement in productivity, and might help to understand why the fiscal policy effect on growth seems to be underestimated, as Daniel Cohen pointed out on his exposition. But, as we are aware, models are set for very limited environments and the real world is extremely complicated. Santiso made this point clearly. I am not saying that we must forget about theory. Instead, i am suggesting that, in very dynamic economies, we, policy makers, should relay as much on models as we do on good judgment. The world is not linear, we have many discontinuities in the form of shocks from many different sources. It would be too much to ask a model to be able to account for these regular irregularities and, further, to be able to extract sound policy advice from it. Another relevant issue on fiscal policy relates to the appropriate moment for implementation, especially with regard to its implications for stability. In this respect, we need to identify better ways to put together long-run objectives with short-run ones.  BIS Review 82/2008 1 
In the later case, we are more prone to recognize its role as a stabilizing force. However, the ability of fiscal policy on reducing the volatility of the economic cycle is under deep scrutiny, especially in the developed world. Probably this has to do with the usual handing over of the stabilizing role to monetary policy. Also, the budgetary process seems to be too rigid to be able to respond in a timely way.  In developing economies, usually more exposed to external shocks that hinder long-run fiscal sustainability, the implementation of countercyclical policies seems to be more difficult. Notwithstanding, there is mounting evidence on the relevance of fiscal policy as a stabilizing economic force. As we are witnessing today, when there are dual mandates and divergent paths, we, central bankers, are confronted with an extremely challenging task that calls for coordination with other economic policy instruments, that gives more room for fiscal action. As an answer to the budgetary rigidities, there is a growing case for fiscal rules. Many countries are putting in place this kind of framework as an institutional device to preserve the countercyclical role of fiscal policy. We heard relevant experiences such the UK and Chile, showing the applicability to both, industrial and emerging economies. But, we can not forget the intervention from our colleges from Japan. They reminded us how disappointing this could be and that there is no single recipe for every country.  Another striking issue for policy makers is the scope of public expenditure as a mean to improve social inclusion and economic growth. We have seen the debate within the G-20, evolving to these policy aspects. This morning the clear distinction between monetary and fiscal policy was made, with the later, definitely, better suited to tackle micro problems. In my opinion, this issue must be included on top of every single country agenda given that income distribution is becoming not only a typical problem for developing countries but also, more recently, for developed ones too. As a central banker, the issue of policy interaction – largely debated on the economic literature – is of great importance. One usual approach relates to the intertemporal debt sustainability that calls for an aggregate budget constraint between fiscal surplus and seigniorage revenue. This is a clear implication that macroeconomic management involves both the treasury and the central bank. As a matter of fact, as Sargent and Wallace pointed out back in 1981, the fiscal surplus must be large enough to pay out public debt services. They framed it as a necessary condition for a consistent reduction in the rate of inflation over time.  And this calls for another relevant relationship between fiscal and monetary policy, named fiscal dominance. Fiscal dominance can arise in situations were public deficits and a perception on government debt unsustainability hinders monetary policy credibility, even when central banks have legal and de facto independence. In this regard we have the theoretical framework first devised by Woodford that shows that is not enough to have a monetary commitment to price stability to achieve it. Fiscal behavior must be clear in order to evaluate the ability of the central bank to put in place its policy.  Pierpaolo Benigno also stressed the point when he was asked about the interaction of fiscal and monetary policy over the business cycle. Speaking about inflation targeting, he stated that a specific target on inflation might not be the best framework for countries with high fiscal dominance or high nominal output volatility. For instance, the eighties for Latin-American countries are acknowledged as a period of deep fiscal dominance, which ended up in a collapse of many economies derived from overspending and over-indebtness processes that in some cases led to hyper inflation episodes.  Today the picture looks very different. Policy makers seem to be very aware of the costs of overtaking money supply to fund public expenses. Recently, many emerging markets 2 BIS Review 82/2008 
reduced the fiscal stimulus as economic growth became more stable and resilient. Definitely, what i call a “crowding-in” process. Several countries in Latin-America evolved towards the recreation of budgetary institutions to encourage inter-temporal fiscal responsibility. Latin-American governments have made notable efforts in the fiscal area to improve debt levels and management as a mean to reduce vulnerability, with significant progress in recent years. Pablo Guidotti also showed this yesterday. As a result, financing needs are not an issue as it was in the past, even though shallow capital markets all over the region act as a constraint for sustainable growth over the long term. In fact, financial development is key – and will be even more so in our agenda.  The depth of the financial system and its integration with international capital markets has a powerful disciplinary effect as it reduces incentives to follow expansionary policies as foreign capital flow out to other markets with more predictable returns. On the liability side, important progress has also been made in the region. The public debt to GDP ratio decreased almost 30 percentage points over the last five years. This reflects, in part, better liability management, which also shows up in the enormous reduction in the exposure to foreign currency debt. The region is finally leaving behind the well-known original sin that features last decades (currency mismatches), providing solid grounds for developing domestic yield curve in local currency. All over Latin America, financial systems are better-matched, well capitalized and less exposed to public sector debt, another sin from the past. Not long ago, we used to have not only central banks but also the financial system financing the treasury with no limits whatsoever. In the case of Argentina, for instance, the policy designed by the central bank aimed to this purpose led banks to reduce their government debt holdings that recently stands at 14.6% of net assets, the lowest level in many years. In my view, good economic analysis also imply not to bundle Latin American countries as they follow very different patterns and are at different stages in their paths towards long-term sustainability. Hasty diagnosis and simplistic comparisons among the various countries’ situations may lead to inappropriate policy recommendations. To sum up, we have been through a period of better macroeconomic management all across the world. We are witnessing the most turbulent times for the world economy in decades.  As I referred to early last year, when were heading towards a more volatile environment, the resurgence of volatility is about to remain with us for a while. In such a context, emerging economies are more resilient than in the past to confront external shocks.  And, while unusual conditions such as commodities price increases have played an important role (as it was discussed this morning), more robust monetary policy and fiscal strength are a key development behind this performance. On a longer-run, we must keep working on rising human capital productivity by improving public education, investing on social infrastructure all across the cycle, and adopting countercyclical measures to prevent distributional effects in the downswings. Ultimately, this is the most important contribution that we can deliver to our constituents. As policy makers, we have to be careful about our assessment of current economic environment. We must avoid a usual mistake which is to take that exceptionally good times are about to remain forever, leading to policy relaxation. Here we are confronted with two types of error: the first one is to take the good times as permanent ones, when it is really only a temporary situation. The other possibility is to work as it is only a transitory good time but the real underlying developments are about to be in place on a more permanent basis. As policy makers we can not afford to fall in the first one. Thank you. BIS Review 82/2008 3 
Svein Gjedrem: From oil and gas to financial assets – Norway’s Government Pension Fund – Global Speech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the conference “Commodities, the Economy and Money” in Calgary, Canada, 20 June 2008. *      *      * Introduction Good morning and thank you for the invitation to this highly topical conference. I have been asked to talk about the “objectives and experience of the Norwegian oil fund”. In doing so, I will try to explain the set-up and purpose of the Fund and draw some preliminary conclusions about the outcome so far. Since Norway became an oil nation some 40 years ago, the petroleum sector has grown to become an important part of our economy. Today, petroleum accounts for approximately 25 per cent of Norway’s gross domestic product (GDP). And even though the production of oil is declining after peaking around the turn of the millennium, total petroleum production will remain high for many years to come. The economic challenges posed by petroleum extraction were widely recognised early on. As early as in 1974, the Norwegian parliament discussed these challenges in depth, and in the early 1980s, the idea of a fund that would stabilise petroleum revenue spending was launched. Due to domestic economic turmoil and financial crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it took time before the idea of a fund was turned into actual savings.  Why a Pension Fund? The Government Petroleum Fund was formally established in 1990. In 2006, the name was changed to the Government Pension Fund – Global. In spite of the name change, the Fund is more similar to an endowment than to a pension fund.  Since the first transfer of some USD 400 million was made in 1996, the Fund has grown rapidly in size. Its assets are currently valued at around USD 400 billion. One third of the portfolio, about USD 130 billion is invested here in North America. The Fund is expected to grow rapidly in coming years, and may double in 5-10 years. The Fund was established as a tool to support prudent management of Norway’s petroleum wealth. One purpose is to shield the non-oil economy from price fluctuations (see Chart 3). The Fund is also a long-term savings instrument. It will help to cope with future financial commitments linked to an ageing population.  Accumulation of capital in the Fund reflects the depletion of a non-renewable resource, which is exchanged for financial assets through the Fund’s investments. By setting up the Fund, it became possible to establish a path for production of oil and gas that is independent of the profile for petroleum revenue spending.  Furthermore, to effectively shield the non-oil economy, and to make sure that private sector investment decisions could be made independently of the public sector’s saving of petroleum wealth, the Fund is only invested abroad. This also enhances the expected return on government wealth and reduces the risk. The alternative to a fund would have been to directly regulate production by putting a conservative upper limit on annual extraction. This was attempted in the 1970s and -80s. At that time, we had a production ceiling of 90 million standard cubic metres per year. This approach was abandoned in the 1980s. Today, the government steers exploration activities BIS Review 81/2008 1 
and awards production licenses, but has no explicit production target. Since the mid-1990s, total petroleum production has been around 250 million standard cubic metres per year. The Fund mechanism The Fund is by law fully integrated with the government budget, and the same priorities are imposed on spending from the Fund as on any other government spending. This means that the entire petroleum revenues are transferred to the Fund. An amount equal to the non-oil budget deficit is then transferred to the fiscal budget. The mechanism ensures that the accumulation of capital in the Fund is equal to government net financial savings. There is no corresponding increase in liabilities. Furthermore, legislation prohibits use of Fund money for purposes not prioritised in the regular budget processes. There is no hidden use of oil money, or any use for special purposes. The Fund is strictly and effectively “out of bounds” to special interests.  In 2001, the Norwegian parliament approved new fiscal policy guidelines stipulating that the annual transfer from the Fund to the fiscal budget – that is annual spending of oil money – should correspond to the expected real return on the Fund. The expected real return is estimated at 4 per cent. The point of reference for the spending rule is a normal cyclical situation. In the event of particularly high capacity utilisation, spending should be lower than 4 per cent, whereas in a cyclical downturn, somewhat higher spending may be appropriate. The intention is for this wealth to be transferred to future generations, and that each generation should only spend the returns. The rule gives weight to long-term considerations when addressing current economic policy challenges. The rule also helps stabilise exchange rate expectations. The fiscal rule has the advantage of having intuitive appeal, and it is easy to check whether it is being followed over the business cycle.  In line with the rule, the transfer from the Fund was higher than the expected real return of 4 per cent in the cyclical downturn in 2003 and the following two years. Since 2006, however, the transfer has been lower. It should also be noted that the target for the rule is the cyclically adjusted transfer, shown by the solid line in Chart 6. Automatic stabilisers are allowed to work, thereby reducing actual transfers during upturns and increasing them during downturns, as illustrated by the broken line in Chart 6. Governance structure and management model Now, let me turn to the Fund management model. The governance structure is based on a clear division of responsibilities between the political authorities and the operational management.  • The Ministry of Finance is the owner of the Fund. The Ministry defines the mandate and monitors and evaluates performance.  • The management of the Fund is delegated to Norges Bank. The Bank’s task is to implement the investment strategy and exercise ownership rights. Norges Bank also provides professional advice to the Ministry on investment strategies. The Fund’s investment strategy is to maximise financial return with moderate risk. The long-term strategic allocation is defined in terms of a benchmark portfolio, which consists of equities and fixed income instruments. Equities account for 60 per cent of the Fund's strategic benchmark portfolio. The size of the Fund implies that it currently owns about 1 per cent of listed European equities and ½ per cent of listed equities on a global basis. Fixed income instruments account for 40 per cent.  2 BIS Review 81/2008 
Furthermore, the Ministry has recently decided that the Fund should prepare the ground for investing in real estate at 5 per cent of the strategic benchmark portfolio. In time, this will reduce the fixed income share to 35 per cent. Norges Bank has built an organisation with emphasis on investment returns and based on three fundamental principles: Accountability, transparency and professional standards. Norges Bank manages parts of the funds internally, while parts are managed by external managers appointed by the Bank on a commercial basis. Active management has become an important part of our investment operations. We believe that the search for excess return has had a strong disciplinary effect on the organisation.  Transparency and disclosure of information is a key feature of the Fund. All investment principles and guidelines as well as strategic advice and second opinion reports are made public. We publish quarterly reports on Fund performance, which are presented at press conferences. The Fund’s annual report discloses a list of every single investment held at the end of the year, and also provides an overview of corporate governance work, including voting at general meetings.  Initially, transparency was aimed at building confidence among Norwegians, but we have also seen that our policy of transparency is highly appreciated internationally. The challenges for the Norwegian economy The risk of “Dutch disease”1 is often cited when discussing the impact of natural resource windfalls.2 Dutch disease occurs when the basis for internationally exposed industries is eroded and fluctuations in economic activity are amplified. In our case, we can say “so far so good”. The economy has been fairly stable and oil price fluctuations have only had a moderate impact on our currency. Furthermore, while it is difficult to know how the economy would have developed without oil, we have a sort of “control group”. The other Nordic countries – Denmark, Finland and Sweden – are comparable in size and structures, but are mainly non-oil economies.3 Three indicators may be relevant in this context. First, there is no evidence that our productivity growth has been eroded. In fact, Norway has generally managed to sustain high productivity growth compared with most other advanced countries.  Second, there is no evidence that labour force participation has been impaired. In fact, labour force participation is now high, after having lagged behind our neighbouring countries up to the mid-1980s. A third indicator is welfare spending. Here, there is evidence that developments have been less favourable. Norway has seen a sharp increase in sickness absence and a steadily higher share of the working-age population is on disability benefit or rehabilitation schemes. Over the past decade, Norway has underperformed on this score compared with the other                                                  1  The expression ”Dutch disease” originates from the Netherlands, where the government rapidly spent large revenues from extraction of gas in the 1960s. 2  The economic literature includes many studies that look at the relationship between income from natural resources and economic growth, see for example Jeffrey D. Sachs and Andrew M. Warner, “The curse of Natural Resources”, European Economic Review 45 (2001) and Thorvaldur Gylfason, “Natural Resources and Economic Growth: From Dependence to Diversification”, Discussion paper No. 4804, CEPR. 3  Denmark has also been producing oil and gas since the early 1970s, but on a smaller scale than Norway. The impact on the Danish economy has therefore been more limited. BIS Review 81/2008 3 
Nordic countries. The growing number of people outside the labour force and on benefits is increasingly becoming the Achilles’ heel of the Norwegian economy. On balance though, the picture is fairly positive: We have managed to keep macroeconomic developments on a steady course, we have avoided dramatic changes in industry structure, and we use our resources fairly efficiently. It is, however, too early to draw definite conclusions. We probably have to wait another generation or two to see the long-term impact of this huge windfall. The debate on sovereign wealth funds Let me wind up with a few words on the sovereign wealth funds debate.  Typical features of many sovereign wealth funds are long investment horizons, no leverage and no claims for the imminent withdrawal of funds. This differentiates such funds from for instance the rising number of leveraged funds and investors with short time horizons. Hence, sovereign wealth funds have a strong risk-bearing capacity and an ability to accommodate short-term volatility. Sovereign wealth funds may reduce volatility in asset prices and increase efficiency. Again, transparency and disclosure of information is an important tool in building confidence. This runs both ways, of course.  It should also be noted that the separation of spending of petroleum revenues from the current revenue stream through a fund mechanism allows oil producers to extract petroleum at a higher rate than would be appropriate if all the proceeds were to be redeployed in the domestic economy. Hence, the petroleum funds do not just offer an attractive way of recycling oil producers’ revenues in international financial markets, they can also have an indirect stabilising effect on the oil market. In my view, sound management of oil-producing countries’ petroleum wealth is in everyone’s interest.  Thank you for your attention.    4 BIS Review 81/2008

Y V Reddy: Fiscal policy and economic reforms  Address by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), New Delhi, 26 May 2008 (edited transcript). *      *      * Respected Professor Govinda Rao and distinguished scholars, I am honoured by my friend, Prof. Govinda Rao’s, kind invitation to me to visit the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP). I had the opportunity of working very closely with the NIPFP on several occasions. Apart from my personal affinity to the NIPFP, there is a close relationship between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the NIPFP, from an institutional point of view also. For instance, Prof. Govinda Rao is a Member of the Southern Local Board of RBI.  Initially, I thought of speaking on fiscal policy and economic reforms from a central banker’s perspective. I realised later that while I have been working as a central banker over the last one decade, I had worked for most parts of the three decades prior to that in the Ministry of Finance, in the Government of India as well as in the Government of Andhra Pradesh. So it was a difficult choice for me as to whether I should give a fiscal view of the monetary policy or a monetary view of the fiscal policy. I have worked for a short period in the World Bank, which gives a global governments’ view and also in the IMF, which gives a global monetary authority’s view. As a via-media, I have opted to give a practitioner’s perspective of fiscal policy, and economic reforms.  India’s fiscal situation: a brief prelude Broadly, during the first 30 years of independence, between 1950 and 1980, the fiscal deficits of both the central and the state governments were not excessive. This was a period of revenue surplus in general. However, automatic monetisation of government deficit by the RBI, which started as an exception during the mid 1950s, became a regular practice thereafter. Simultaneously, there was also a distinct shift in the management of the financial sector with the nationalisation of major commercial banks in 1969 and 1980. These two developments had a significant bearing on the relationship between the monetary authority (RBI) and the fiscal authority (Government). There was a significant deterioration in the fiscal situation in the 1980s, accompanied by large and automatic monetisation of government deficits. The process involved issue of ad-hoc Treasury bills at rates initially on par with 91-day Treasury Bills. Since July 1974, the ad-hoc Treasury bills were offered at off-market discount rate of 4.6 per cent which was less than half of the prevailing market rates. There were two immediate consequences. One, when large government deficits were monetised, there was excess liquidity in the system, which prompted the monetary authorities to increase the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks at regular intervals with a view to mop up the excess liquidity. Two, to facilitate the central government to borrow comfortably, the monetary authority, which is also the debt manager for the government, periodically increased the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) to be maintained by banks. This process went on to an extent that CRR and SLR, together, pre-empted more than 50 per cent of banking sector liabilities, for a period. In other words, more than 50 per cent of the resources of the banking sector were pre-empted to primarily finance the budget deficits of the governments. Further, the deposit and lending rates of banks were, for most part, administered. This situation impacted the health of the banking system and the consequential adjustments during the banking sector reform process were, naturally, somewhat complex. BIS Review 81/2008 1 
The large fiscal deficit and its monetisation had some spill-over effect on the external sector, which reflected in the widening current account deficit in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Triggered by the balance of payments crisis in the early 1990s, when our foreign currency assets depleted rapidly to the extent that it could barely finance just two weeks of imports, we started the reform process in 1991-92. A credible macroeconomic structural and stabilisation programme encompassing trade, industry, foreign investment, exchange rate, public finance and financial sector was put in place, which created an environment that was conducive for the expansion of trade and investment. Simultaneously, several reform measures towards the marketisation of government borrowings were initiated.  At the instance of Dr. Rangarajan, one of my illustrious predecessors as Governor, the RBI entered into the first agreement with the government in 1994 to place a limit on automatic monetisation. The First Supplemental Agreement between the RBI and the Government of India was signed in 1994 setting out a system of limits for creation of ad hoc treasury bills during the three-year period ending 1996-97. Then in 1997, soon after I moved to the RBI, the second agreement with the government was signed, where Mr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia represented the government. In pursuance of this Second Supplemental Agreement between the RBI and the Government of India on March 6, 1997, the ad hoc Treasury Bills were completely phased out from April 1997, replaced by a scheme of Ways and Means Advances, subject to limits. In order to smoothen the transition, the Government of India was allowed to incur also an overdraft, but at an interest rate higher than the rate applicable for Ways and Means Advances (WMA). With effect from April 1, 1999 these overdrafts were allowed only for a maximum of ten working days. These features placed the Central Government on par with the State governments which were brought under an “Overdraft Regulation Scheme” since 1985. Furthermore, it was agreed that the RBI would trigger fresh floatation of Government securities whenever 75 per cent of the WMA limit was reached. It was also agreed that the government’s surplus cash balances with the RBI, beyond an agreed level, would be invested by it in government securities. While the transition to a full-fledged WMA and overdraft mechanism was gradual, non-disruptive and consensual, the successful implementation of this mechanism made it possible to incorporate some of these practices into a law – the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM Act). It is noteworthy that this law also practically prohibited RBI from participating in primary issues of all government securities.  As a result of the concerted efforts to restore fiscal balance through tax reforms, expenditure management, institutional reforms and financial sector reforms in the first half of the 1990s, there was significant reduction in the magnitude of fiscal deficit and the proportion of debt relative to GDP during the period 1991 to 1997. However, during the period 1997 to 2003, there was a reversal in the trend of fiscal consolidation, and the cumulative impact of industrial slowdown, fifth pay commission award, and a lower than expected revenue buoyancy culminated in fiscal deterioration. This deterioration in the Indian fiscal position happened at an inopportune time when there was fiscal improvement the world over and India was trying to globalize. It is important to remember that India’s fiscal situation has been significantly divergent from the global fiscal situation and continues to be so even now. I think, this is the background we have to keep in view whenever we discuss the pace and the content of economic reforms in India. The coming into force of the FRBM Act, 2003 on July 5, 2004, which established a framework for a rule based fiscal consolidation, should be viewed in this background.  In the period subsequent to 2003, the central government’s fiscal position has been improving, though there are several underlying fiscal pressures that are not entirely evident in the numbers, as will be explained later. The states’ fiscal positions have also improved significantly during this period and their revenue deficits are close to being virtually eliminated. However, as in the case of the Centre, there are some underlying pressures that are not reflected in the fiscal numbers of the States.  2 BIS Review 81/2008 
Despite considerable improvement in the fiscal scenario, both at the centre and in the states, India’s combined fiscal deficit (centre and state), as a percentage of GDP, still continues to be one of the highest in the world. Prof. Rao would also be able to explain to you separately in detail that India’s public debt, including the external debt, as a percentage of GDP, is one of the highest in the world. In this context, the U.K. based weekly the Economist (dated November 17, 2007 – Pages 75-77) ranked India, along with Turkey and Hungary, as the riskiest economies among select leading emerging market economies. The Economist based its conclusion on standard parameters such as current account balance, budget balance, inflation and growth in bank lending, for assessing the degree of risk. One cannot disagree with the relevance of these parameters in assessing risks. Yet it is noteworthy that most of these risky elements were present in the Indian economy for several years, almost all through the reform period, and yet the economy exhibited macro-stability and impressive growth even while withstanding some significant domestic and global shocks. In view of this evidence, we need to explore the reasons for such risks not de-stabilising our economy so far; and the measures that are needed, in future, for insulating the economy from such de-stabilising effects, to the extent feasible. I think it is important that this big picture be reckoned while we analyse the pace and intent of reforms, despite some agreement on the destination as well as direction of economic reforms. Role of RBI in fiscal reforms Now, let me briefly explain the role of RBI in fiscal reforms. As a central bank, we are generally sensitive to the fiscal situation. It is not true that the RBI was not aware of the implications of what was happening on the fiscal front during the first three decades (1950 to 1980). Given the institutional arrangement, the RBI’s primary objective is to maintain monetary stability. It was clear that the fiscal situation was something that was decided and determined by the sovereign. Once the fiscal situation was decided and determined by the sovereign, it was the central bank’s responsibility to ensure that monetary stability was maintained and the government’s borrowing programme was managed with minimum disruptions, in terms of stability. Some argue that accommodating the fiscal pressure through monetary action is like, what some people call, a soft-budget constraint. Let me revert to the reform process and how we got rid of the remnants of automatic monetisation of the previous years. The stock of ad hoc Treasury bills, when we put an end to issue of such bills, was over Rs. 1,00,000 crore. This stock was in fact public debt in perpetuity, held by the RBI, bearing a discount rate of 4.6 per cent though the market rates were far higher. In coordination with the government, it was agreed that these papers will be converted into dated marketable securities at market related rates, in phases, depending on the market conditions warranting open market operations by the RBI. Thus, the stock of the ad hoc treasury bills has been wiped-out. This is an evidence of the varieties of ways in which the RBI conceives and implements the process of reforms, in a non-disruptible fashion, in coordination with the government. Let me share a story related to the FRBM Act with you. One day, Governor Jalan said that the Finance Minister is making an announcement on introduction of Fiscal Responsibility Bill (which was the then proposed nomenclature). Governor Jalan said that he had discussed with the Minister and that they had decided that I will be named the Chairman of a Committee that would draft the Fiscal Responsibility Bill. I submitted that the government officials should be working on the legislation relating to fiscal issues and that the RBI should not be involved, as the ownership of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill should be with the government. Governor Jalan did not relent and said “No, it has been decided that you do it”. So finally, we arrived at a compromise. A main formal Committee was set up in 2000 with the then Secretary, Economic Affairs, Dr. E.A.S. Sarma as the Chairman and Dr. Ashok Lahiri as one of the members; and a working group comprising of RBI officials was set-up under my Chairmanship to provide technical assistance to the main Committee on several aspects for drafting the Fiscal Responsibility Bill. The RBI Working Group was actively involved in the BIS Review 81/2008 3 
Sarma Committee to draft the Fiscal Responsibility Bill. Mr. Prem Chand of the IMF, at our invitation, spent some time advising us on the international best practices in this regard. At this stage, we advised the Government that without incorporating transparent budget management rules and medium term fiscal framework, the objective of fiscal responsibility would not be achieved. Therefore, the name of the Bill was changed to “Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill” incorporating additional features. In short, I am illustrating that the RBI has been actively collaborating with the government, whenever sought, but with appropriate propriety.  Our experience shows that the FRBM Act has a positive effect of focusing attention on fiscal issues. At the same time, it may, sometimes, unintentionally lead to increased recourse to expanding off-budget fiscal liabilities. Such a practice is not entirely uncommon in many countries, but the magnitudes involved and the persistence in resorting to off-budget liabilities in India are noteworthy. The issue is not merely one of transparency in fiscal operations or a de facto larger borrowing programme of the Government than admitted, but one with significant implications for the Government debt market and monetary management.  Past experience clearly suggests that recourse to such off-budget items is not ad hoc or one-time only. The repeated recourse to issue of Government bonds has been exercised not only for fuel, food and fertilizers for financing subsidies, but also for financing deferred liabilities in regard to bank loan waivers and contribution to the capital of public sector banks. Hence, unless there is a noticeable change in global prices or a change in policy towards recurrent subsidies and deferred liabilities, continuation of such special bonds may not be ruled out. The significant quasi-fiscal transactions to finance recurrent revenue expenditures through de facto borrowings pose challenges in managing the links between fiscal, external and monetary management.  The RBI has rendered advice on FRBM to the state governments also. A forum has been provided by the RBI, which brings together the Finance Secretaries of state governments, for exchange of ideas and sorting out the issues. The bi-annual conference of State Finance Secretaries hosted by the RBI, initiated in 1996, is also attended by the Secretaries in the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, representatives from the Planning Commission, the Comptroller and Auditor General of Accounts (CAG) and the Controller General of Accounts (CGA). The deliberations in these bi-annual conferences have proved very useful in identifying the common issues and developing best practices in regard to state government finances. A number of important initiatives relating to ways and means advances, approach to market borrowing programme, investment of surpluses, ceilings on state government guarantees, model scheme for state level fiscal legislations, apart from changes in the content and format for reporting budget related documents to ensure transparency etc. have emanated and taken shape as a result of interactions in these meetings. The RBI has, through this forum, also helped the state governments prepare the state level FRBM legislations.  Incidentally, the first research and policy paper on pension funds in India was prepared by Dr. Urjit Patel, who used to work with us. In those days, it was so hard to get any data that we had to tap our informal links in the various offices in Delhi, including some of my old colleagues, to give him some access to relevant information. Dr. Urjit Patel did a very good job and then he published an article in the Economic & Political Weekly. Thus, the public policy on pensions was, in a sense, triggered by the work done by a consultant in RBI, at our request. RBI also worked on a Report on Pensions for state government employees. This is another evidence of the collaboration between the RBI and the governments and often our views are accepted. Now, let me come to the fisc and monetary management issues.  Fisc and monetary management Let me clarify the general approach of RBI in its relations with the government on matters relating to monetary management. As illustrated in the case of preparation of the Fiscal 4 BIS Review 81/2008 
Responsibility and Budget Management Bill, coordination between the government and the RBI is essential for structural reforms, especially when legal and institutional changes are involved. In regard to operational issues relating to monetary policy, there is some element of freedom but, in view of the fiscal dominance in the economy, the overriding approach has been harmonization of monetary policy with fiscal policy for ensuring stability. Within this framework, through mutual cooperation, several reform measures have been undertaken by the government and the RBI and I will provide a few illustrations.  First, the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) has been gradually reduced to the then statutory minimum of 25 per cent, effective October 21, 1997. Also, the CRR has been reduced gradually, depending on the liquidity conditions, as a first step, with the objective of ultimately reducing it to the statutory minimum of three per cent. In the meantime, RBI’s commitment to the removal of the statutory prescriptions of minimum reserve and liquidity requirements was demonstrated by its proposal to the Government for legislative amendments to remove the minima. These legislations have since been passed. Now, there is no minimum statutory stipulation for SLR and CRR.  The challenge now is to reduce the CRR and the SLR stipulations, as we go along. The reduction in CRR will be contingent upon liquidity conditions and the need for using it as an instrument of sterilisation along with other instruments. The reduction in SLR will primarily be governed by the fiscal situation of the government. The issue is not one of desirable destination but one of negotiating the path in an optimal way. RBI has two options for proceeding in this regard. Either we accept the fiscal situation and wait for it to improve, to effect any further reductions in SLR or reduce prescriptions gradually consistent with fiscal situation and market development. So that is the type of choices we are facing at this juncture and RBI prefers to assess the fiscal situation and proceed with the reductions in a cautious manner. Second, an issue that has come to the fore in the recent period pertains to higher volatility in government’s cash balances maintained with the RBI, which impacts the liquidity conditions in the financial markets. Volatility in Government’s cash balances is not unique to the Indian situation and is an issue even in other countries, but in our situation, it has become increasingly prominent now. It so happens that, at times, government’s cash balances and the external situation move in different directions and they create very little net impact on liquidity from the perspective of overall monetary management. However, there are occasions when they move in the same direction, in which case the volatility in the liquidity conditions is much higher. This is one major current issue in monetary management which could be linked to cash management in the government. The link becomes critical for maintaining orderly liquidity conditions in the money market and effectively using short term overnight interest rates for monetary operations.  Third, the magnitude of the combined fiscal deficit of the centre and the states is close to half of the households’ financial savings, which is the largest component of domestic savings. If fifty per cent of households’ financial savings are taken away by the government sector, it has vital implications for ensuring stability in the financial markets because the demand for funds from the non-government productive sectors of the economy has to be met simultaneously.  Fourth, India is still a bank-dominated system and about 70 per cent of our banks (in terms of business) are owned by the government. Thus, we could have a situation when the objective of monetary policy and the objective of broader public policy dealings with banking converge, in which case the monetary policy could be very effective. Sometimes, it could happen that the objective of monetary policy and the objective of broader public policy may not converge, in which case monetary policy may not be that effective. In other words, the effectiveness of the monetary policy depends not only on the actions of the monetary authority, but also on other public policy postures. This certainly complicates monetary management. Of course, the issue of conflict of interest in public sector banking and government ownership is yet BIS Review 81/2008 5 
another issue. The issue of conflict of interest in private sector banks arises when the owner of the bank borrows from his own bank. The single largest source of borrowing for the government being the government-owned banks themselves, this conflict is rather apparent.  Fifth, one of the factors imparting rigidity to the interest rate structure in India is the administered interest rates, particularly on small savings instruments. In this context, administered interest rates fixed by the Government on a number of small saving schemes and provident funds are of special relevance as they have generally offered a rate different from those on corresponding instruments available in the market, in some cases along with tax incentives. The administered interest rates significantly impact the level and allocation of savings. On the lending side also, there are some administrative prescriptions for banks. Depending on how it is calculated, on both the savings and the lending sides, the administered structure of interest rate would apply to about 25 to 40 per cent. In this context, it is pertinent to note that the monetary policy mainly operates through interest rates and interest rate signals, and constraints posed by administered interest rates have to be duly recognized while dealing with issues relating to monetary policy transmission mechanisms.  Sixth, theoretically it is well recognised that monetary policy is generally a more effective counter-cyclical policy instrument than fiscal policy because interest rate changes can be made and reversed quickly. However, monetary policy adjustments may take longer than fiscal policy adjustments to affect aggregate demand. It is also recognized that fiscal policy contributes to broader-based stabilization through the impact of taxes and government spending on income-sensitive (in addition to interest-sensitive) components of aggregate demand. When monetary policy is thus constrained in responding to output variations, fiscal policy should normally take a more central role. Thus, effective co-ordination between the fiscal policy and monetary policy is important. At a more aggregate level, in the context of our capacity to respond to global developments, if we have a counter-cyclical policy approach, not only the monetary policy but also the fiscal policy should be counter-cyclical. If the fiscal policy continues to be uni-directional, as we have in our case, with persisting deficits, then the fiscal policy is not in a position to produce a reasonable counter-cyclical impact. In these circumstances, the monetary policy has a challenge in designing and implementing appropriate counter-cyclical policies, that has the added burden of off-setting the impact of the fiscal policy. Well, despite these challenges, the RBI has managed the situation reasonably well and we have the confidence that we would be able to continue to manage. However, it is important to recognize that, at times, unorthodox policies have assured the stability of the Indian financial system despite fiscal stress, which is a desirable outcome rather than achieving ritualistic compliance with pre-set rules.  By and large, these are some illustrations of the links that exist between fiscal and monetary management. We are continuously refining the monetary policy framework and the conduct of the monetary policy, taking into account the progress in fiscal consolidation. The reform of the monetary policy framework and the conduct of monetary policy have to recognise the fiscal, and the related institutional as well as policy constraints. That is the limited point I want to make to those who are impatient with the current monetary management framework.  Now let me go to fisc and the financial market. Fisc and financial markets First, the foremost link between the fisc and financial markets is through the government securities market. As has already been explained in detail, the central government’s borrowing programme was significantly monetized in earlier days. It may be of interest to all of you to know that since a large part of the borrowing programme has to be completed in the first half of the fiscal year, in view of seasonality of demand for credit on private account, the monthly average gross market borrowings by the centre is around three-quarters of a percent of GDP in recent years. Despite this high level of government borrowing programme, the RBI, as debt manager, has been able to successfully complete the market borrowing 6 BIS Review 81/2008 
programme, over the years, while pursuing its interest rate objectives without jeopardizing external balance, by taking recourse to several initiatives in terms of institution, instruments, incentives and strategies.  Second, an important issue that remains is that we cannot claim that there is a genuine market for government securities in India, when we have a statutory liquidity ratio prescription of 25 per cent. The question is that can we really proceed on the assumption that there is a genuine government securities market, and hence reinforce more marketisation by rapidly reducing SLR or do we ensure a viable market borrowing programme and reduce SLR in tandem? Here again RBI has to assess the sensitivity of the fisc to interest rate burden, in case SLR is reduced rapidly? The importance of SLR status for bonds issued by government has come to the fore recently when oil bonds issued by Government of India turned out to be illiquid despite carrying a higher yield of 25 basis points over SLR-eligible bonds of similar maturity. The reform of debt markets in India, as we go along, should recognise these realities. Third, in the case of state governments, when we tried to marketise the individual state’s borrowing programme, many of the states were not comfortable. They were not sure whether they would be able to get subscriptions for their bonds unless RBI manages the borrowing programme of all the states in a coordinated fashion with uniform terms and conditions for all states. Knowing that banks cannot be compelled to subscribe to the programme, RBI provides the investors a higher yield for states’ paper over the centre’s paper of comparable maturity. Subsequently, we encouraged some states to go through auction route on a stand-alone basis. Now it has become possible for the RBI to conduct the borrowing programme of each state without serious disruption in the markets, through the auction route. As a result, some states have also begun to take initiatives to improve their fiscal profile and discharge their liabilities promptly to banks, and, consequently, gain comparatively favourable treatment in the debt market. It took about six to seven years for RBI to equip the state governments and the markets to get used to this kind of discipline. This was perhaps possible because RBI commands the trust of state governments as an apolitical and a professional public institution.  Fourth, another aspect worth exploring is the fiscal implications of failure of financial institutions and markets. The RBI, as the central bank of the country, is also responsible for ensuring financial stability. Broadly, one can say that when a country’s fiscal position is strong, its capacity to take on the risks arising from the failure of financial institutions is higher. On the other hand, with a weak fiscal situation, the capacity to take care of a financial or banking crisis is rather limited. More important, whenever pockets of vulnerability arise in the financial sector, the headroom available in the fiscal position to provide succour to financial entities needs to be assessed. In this context, one important source of strength as well as vulnerability remains the publicly owned financial institutions, which may have fiscal implications. They contribute heavily as a source of tax revenue. Another source of linkage is the cross subsidies and we have to identify the areas of maximum cross subsidies in public sector entities. The sources of indirect subsidies through and by financial intermediaries are also important. A reading of the several budget speeches of the Finance Ministers in recent years would show the extent to which activities of public sector financial intermediaries operate as instruments of fiscal policy though these entities are competing in the market with private sector on all fronts. These public policy oriented operations of the public enterprises at the instance of fisc seriously limit the efficient price discovery, depth and vibrancy in different segments of the financial markets. Thus, it is evident that while analysing the link between the fiscal and the public sector, perhaps, one should not confine to public sector borrowing requirements only.  Fifth, as regards further reforms in the financial markets, it is very clear that the development of insurance and pension sectors are very important especially for the government debt market and the corporate debt market. However, there are some challenges in this regard. The tax treatment of investment in debt and equity is quite asymmetrical in India with a BIS Review 81/2008 7 
favourable tilt towards investment in equity. There are limited incentives for encouraging contractual savings. Hence, some of the areas that have to be looked at, as we move forward, relate not only to the demand side which advocates development of financial markets, but also to the supply side through policies that promote contractual savings, especially through pension and life insurance funds. Now let me move to the fisc and the external sector.  Fisc and the external sector In the context of the external sector, there are certain issues from the perspective of fiscal policy that are of contextual relevance.  The first issue pertains to the opening-up of government debt market to non-residents through, what we may call foreign currency sovereign debt. In fact, about a decade ago, several arguments were put forward in favour of issuing foreign currency sovereign debt when the government’s intention to take recourse to sovereign borrowings in the international markets was formally announced by the Hon’ble Finance Minister. Several academics argued in favour of the proposal since they felt that it may be more economical for the government to raise funds abroad. However, such borrowings may entail foreign currency exposure and hence the foreign currency risk, which was not built into the analysis of benefits. Another line of argument that was put forward in favour of foreign currency sovereign borrowings was that the government’s borrowing abroad would help develop a benchmark for the private sector foreign currency debt. However, now weightage for sovereign risk is assigned to a private sector debt even without the sovereign benchmark, after taking into account the sovereign risks. Moreover, the issue is that there are always political and economic temptations, as happened in many other countries, to raise foreign currency sovereign debt, when credit market sentiment is favourable probably without factoring-in the likely situation that may prevail when the sentiment turns unfavourable.  The RBI worked along with the government when this issue came up and came to the conclusion that, at that point of time, it might not have been desirable to issue foreign currency sovereign bonds. One of the arguments against approaching the international markets for sovereign bonds was the persistence of a large revenue deficit of the government. Thus, in the above context, the point to be considered is that, given the magnitude of the public debt as a percentage of GDP and the magnitude of fiscal deficit, whether public policy would have the same manoeuvrability for maintaining stability if the debt is denominated in foreign currency and held by the non-residents.  In the above backdrop, it may be concluded that, given the fiscal situation, the health of financial institutions, and the stage of development of financial markets, the scope for non-resident participation in the government securities market particularly foreign currency denominated bonds may be expanded only gradually. However, the pace of opening up of foreign currency sovereign debt for non-residents would be dependent upon the pace of progress on the fiscal, institutional, and market fronts.  Second, another key issue basically from the practitioner’s perspective is the fiscal cost of market stabilization scheme (MSS). Perhaps I should explain the background and story, since this is an academic forum. Around the end of 2003, when I joined as Governor, we looked at the macroeconomic parameters and we anticipated large capital inflows. During the late 2003 to early January 2004, two Groups were constituted in the RBI, one was on the issue of sterilisation and the other was for review of liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) which was in operation since 2001 as part of the monetary policy operating framework. The draft reports of these two Technical Groups and their deliberations were placed in the public domain on the RBI website and were intensely debated. Anticipating enhanced capital inflows in future and the possible volatility in liquidity, while MSS was introduced as a new 8 BIS Review 81/2008 
instrument of sterilisation, the focus of LAF was shifted by the RBI to management of the day to day liquidity fluctuations.  The related issues that surfaced were that if there is accumulation of foreign exchange due to market interventions, whether to sterilise or not to sterilise and finally if we decide to sterilise, how much to sterilise and who should bear the sterilisation cost. One view was that, similar to the practice in some other countries, the central banks may take decisions not only on intervention but also on sterilisation and accordingly the central bank may issue its own bonds. As a prudential requirement, the RBI is prohibited from such bond issuances. As a result, the MSS was introduced whereby sterilisation was through issuance of government securities.  Simultaneously, given the larger public policy implications of the exchange rate in the Indian context, it was deliberated whether it was desirable for the central bank alone to take a view on the extent of sterilisation. After considerable debate between and within Government and RBI, it was agreed in march 2004, that the limit for Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) would be prescribed by the Government from time to time in the light of proposals from RBI. This implies that by prescribing the limits for the MSS, the Government was recognising the fiscal cost that it was ready to bear in the context of external sector management. Third, the related issue was whether the fiscal cost of sterilization should be borne by the central bank or by the Government. We were unique in showing it as a part of Government’s budget unlike the practice followed in some other countries. It would be pertinent to mention that the practice of taking quasi fiscal cost on the central bank balance sheet has led to erosion of capital base of many central banks. Although these central banks operate autonomously, the consequences were erosion of capital and subsequent recourse to the government for infusion of capital. Thus, in the Indian context, the major fiscal cost attributable to sterilisation in the context of external sector management is clearly shown in the government’s budget, through the mechanism of MSS, which adds to fiscal transparency. Incidentally, the desirability of MSS was discussed afresh with the Government after June 2004, when a new Cabinet was sworn in and they reconfirmed the MSS arrangement as a desirable one.  Fourth, contextually, there have been some studies by the IMF and the ICRIER on the quasi fiscal cost of sterilization in India. Technically, it is possible to look at total accounting returns. However, to assume that whenever central bank accumulates reserves it has an adverse impact on the balance sheet, may, however, not turn out to be universally right. For instance, till the last year, China’s domestic interest rates were lower than the return on foreign currency assets. In that case, the carrying cost of reserves was negative for the Chinese central bank, resulting in a quasi fiscal benefit. Fifth, a related issue in this regard is valuation of forex reserves on a marked-to-market basis on the balance sheet of RBI. An appreciation of the reserve currency translates into losses. But in some senses one can argue that such loss is notional. Again, every central bank has different ways of accounting. Most of the central banks and, definitely, the RBI, adopt a conservative accounting practice so that unrealised gains are not shown. The issue here is how one calculates the cost of holding reserves or even “excess” reserves. Since this is essentially an opportunity cost, the only way that it can be calculated reasonably is in terms of interest rates on local currency assets vis-à-vis those for foreign currency assets. But interestingly, the question that arises is how to account for the macroeconomic benefits. Many central banks, with or without the concurrence of the government, are adding to the reserves or are holding on to the reserves even though they incur a quasi fiscal cost. This clearly suggests that there must be some benefits of such a widely adopted practice and if so, what are these benefits? My submission is that these benefits unfortunately are not quantifiable. But just because they are not quantifiable, I do not think it is appropriate to ignore them. The list of benefits can be summarised as follows. One, it enhances the confidence in the economy, particularly of the emerging market economies and results in a BIS Review 81/2008 9 
better sovereign rating. This, in turn, translates into finer spreads at which both public and private sector can raise money. Two, it enhances the capacity to absorb shocks. The shocks can be of two types: the real sector shocks in terms of oil shocks, food grain shock or both of them and the financial shocks in terms of the financial flows. On both, the real sector and the financial sector, there is scope for smoothening volatility when there are adequate reserves. Apart from these, one arguably fundamental issue is whether some excess volatility can be moderated in order to avoid the destabilising effects on growth and employment. Therefore, we have to recognise not only the costs – the cost of holding reserves may be negative or positive – which are quantifiable but also the benefits which are not quantifiable. These have public policy implications as there is a fiscal policy element, namely the quasi-fiscal cost of reserves.  Sixth, there is another link between fiscal policy and reserves. If one reads the rating agencies’ sovereign rating, one may find a mention of how forex reserves are perceived to provide a cushion against fiscal conditions. In some sense, therefore, even if there is a fiscal cost of carrying reserves, they also give a benefit to the fisc and this is recognized by analysts. Maintaining orderly conditions in forex markets can be viewed, in some senses, as a public good and if the provision of such a public good to market participants involved addition to or depletion of forex reserves, incurring of the attendant fiscal costs, if any, of holding reserves may be justifiable.  Let me now come to the concluding section on the RBI’s approach to fiscal policy. RBI’s perspectives on fiscal policy The RBI’s approach to fiscal reforms is that while we agree on the need to eliminate the revenue deficit, and agree on a nominal limit for fiscal deficit, what is even more important is the mode of financing the fiscal deficit and the use that the resources so raised are put to. In addition, we focus on fiscal empowerment which was clearly articulated around 2000 in the Annual Report of the Board of Directors of the RBI. Exclusive focus on fiscal deficit may tend to reduce the role of the Government, and consequently, it will not be in a position to aid the process of growth, in particular, inclusive growth. Re-prioritisation of expenditure may be achieved through reduction or elimination of subsidies and deployment of resources thus released to the more needy sectors. Higher level of resources may also be available through reduction in tax exemption. So the whole idea is that, in an economy like ours which requires structural transformation and investment in social and financial infrastructure, we should strive for an appropriate level of fiscal activity particularly because public goods have to be provided and that would enable us to maintain fiscal discipline and macro-stability rather than aim for a mechanical reduction in fiscal and revenue deficits at a lower level of fiscal activity.  In the light of financial turbulence across the world in the recent period, the relevance of the fisc in the management of the macro economy has become even more important. When we have not seen such financial turbulence in our country, it is important to remember that when all else fails, it is only the fiscal that has to take the hit and come to the rescue.  I would like to read out a sentence from one of the rating agencies and then make my comment, to conclude. It says, “India’s monetary management is conservative and prudent, together with its low external debt position and relative ease in local currency funding, this helps alleviate its fiscal weakness.” The important point here is if RBI’s policy is helping to alleviate fiscal weakness, how can it be conservative? It perhaps needs to be described as “appropriate”. This address is dedicated to Mr. S.L.N. Simha, at whose instance the transcript has been edited for publication.

Heng Swee Keat: Talent management strategies in Singapore Opening address by Mr Heng Swee Keat, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Chairman of the Institute of Banking & Finance (IBF), at the 2nd IBF Annual Conference, Singapore, 20 June 2008. *      *      * Welcome to the 2008 IBF Annual Conference which is held in conjunction with our 33rd Annual General Meeting. When we held our last AGM and Annual Conference in May last year, the mood among global financial institutions was buoyant. The outlook for the global economy and financial markets was positive. The main concern among firms was the severe shortage of staff. Today, the mood is cautious. The credit crisis is still working its way through, inflation has become a major concern everywhere, and economic prospects are more uncertain. In Asia, investors and economists remain cautiously optimistic about the growth prospects of the economies. While financial institutions had limited exposures to sub-prime assets and related credit derivatives, financial markets in Asia are not isolated from global markets. We are seeing a similar rise of risk aversion and tightening of credit conditions. The situation in the coming months will remain fluid and we must remain vigilant. Talent management – a strategic imperative The developments in global financial markets in the last one year have important implications on human resources strategy. For instance, among the many findings in the report released by the Senior Supervisors Group is that firms which weathered the recent crisis better have senior management members who have expertise in a range of risks. This underscores the need to attract and develop talent not only in the frontline, but across critical functions and at various levels of the organisation. Financial institutions planning to expand must treat talent development as a strategic priority, and such development has to be undertaken in a holistic way, across the entire organisation. But this is not an easy task. There is a Chinese saying that it takes ten years to grow a tree, and a hundred years to develop an individual. Talent development requires consistent focus and commitment, from leaders at all levels of the organization. The efforts need to be sustained over many years, through good times and difficult times. The demographic changes in Asia coupled with rapid growth in the economies will make this task even more challenging in the coming years.  Building a world class financial sector workforce IBF is committed to working with the industry to drive the development of talent in the financial sector. Let me now turn to some of the key initiatives undertaken in the last twelve months. Last year, we focused on increasing the industry’s adoption of the Financial Industry Competency Standards (FICS). The FICS is a comprehensive framework for continual development of our financial professionals. We reached an important milestone in July 2007 with the appointment of 5 lead providers. Since then, over 35 programmes covering an additional 17 job families have been accredited. In the coming months, the accredited providers will roll out over 100 programmes covering 38 job families, including Compliance, Anti-money Laundering, Risk Management, Trade Finance, Product Control, Deal Processing & Settlement, Investment Advisory, Private BIS Review 81/2008 1 
Equity and General Insurance Underwriting. We now have 93 certified competency-based assessors, who can provide the assessment of candidates.  On the demand side, 470 individuals have undergone the FICS accredited programmes. A total of 49 financial institutions have benefited from the FICS accredited training or assessment programmes. Apart from sending staff or programmes run by the lead providers, I am pleased that several financial institutions have adopted FICS for their in-house programmes. I encourage more financial institutions to make use of the FICS framework and the grants available to step up their training. Last year, IBF introduced an additional set of standards on life insurance–relationship management. IBF will continue to review and expand the scope of the standards when new needs are identified. Please let us have your suggestions. Another important milestone was also reached when we appointed the pioneer batch of 11 Financial Industry Certified Professionals (FICPs) in October 2007. Our FICPs are professionals who exhibit high standards. I am delighted that so many of our top professionals have stepped forward for this accreditation. You will serve as role models for our young.  Attracting talent into the financial sector To increase the flow of talent into the financial sector, IBF has also been reaching out to our institutions of higher learning. Under the financial sector seminar series, IBF and our industry partners have delivered a series of talks at our universities and polytechnics to highlight the dynamism and the diverse career opportunities in the financial sector. These talks attracted a total audience of over 1000 participants. To increase the supply of job-ready graduates, IBF spearheaded intensive finance preparatory programmes (FPP) for jobs in high demand. The first batch of students for the FPP in Global Banking and Securities Operations, which was introduced in July 2007, will be completing their programme next month. IBF is currently exploring the need for FPP in Insurance. These programmes will continue to attract 70% co-funding support from the Financial Sector Development Fund Gaining international mindshare To create greater international mindshare, IBF launched the FinanceConnectSingapore website to profile Singapore’s financial sector, to provide more information on the career opportunities here and to promote Singapore as a choice location to live, work and play. To date, the website has registered over 100,000 visits. IBF recently partnered with Contact Singapore to provide a job portal for financial institutions to post job openings targeted at financial professionals from overseas. Bringing value to IBF members I have outlined some of the initiatives undertaken by IBF over the past year. Going forward, IBF will continue to take a proactive role in promoting best practices and thought leadership in talent management strategies. On thought leadership, I am delighted to warmly welcome our keynote presentation speaker Professor Ronald Collard for this year’s Annual Conference. Professor Collard will speak on the topic of “Talent Strategies for Sustained Profitable Growth”. I believe you will learn much from Professor Collard’s extensive experience and expertise in the area of talent strategies. I also wish to thank the panelists, David, Richard, Robert and Mark for their participation, and look forward to a lively discussion later. 2 BIS Review 81/2008 
As IBF management is quite confident that Professor Collard and our panel of speakers will whet your appetite for more learning, I am pleased to announce that we will be holding the Beacon Series for HR Professionals in October and the Distinguished Speaker Series for business leaders in November. The year ahead will be exciting. Many of you have contributed to IBF in various ways. I wish to thank my fellow Council members, the FICS Steering Committee, the FICS Working Group members, and FICPs for your contribution to promoting the FICS framework. Let me extend my appreciation to our industry associations and partners, including the Embassy of Switzerland in Singapore, Swiss House Singapore and Swiss Business Hub ASEAN for partnering IBF in its organization of the workshop on “Talent Development in Wealth Management” in November last year; and PricewaterhouseCoopers without whom we would not have had the pleasure of listening to Professor Collard today. I also wish to thank the Singapore Workforce Development Agency and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, for their close collaboration with IBF. I look forward to more of such collaboration between IBF and our industry associations and partners in the year ahead. I wish you a fruitful session ahead. BIS Review 81/2008 3 
Philipp Hildebrand: Current state of the financial system in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the half-yearly media news conference, Geneva, 19 June 2008. *      *      * The Swiss National Bank publishes its sixth annual report on financial stability today. My comments are based on this report. I will begin with a brief assessment of the current state of the financial system. Then I will present the most important lessons which the Swiss National Bank has learned from the credit market turmoil.  As you know, the situation in the Swiss banking sector worsened significantly in 2007 as a result of the correction in the US real estate market. In the second half of the year, profits fell at the Swiss big banks and there was a substantial deterioration in their capital base. The other Swiss banks, by contrast, were hardly affected by the turmoil. Most of them were able to benefit from the buoyant Swiss economy and surpass the good results they had achieved the previous year.  Since the beginning of 2008, developments at the big banks have been mixed. On the one hand, in the first quarter of 2008, they suffered losses in the international credit markets due to further deterioration in the international credit markets. On the other hand, they strengthened their capital bases and partially reduced their risk positions. In the past few months, the overall market environment has calmed somewhat. Nonetheless, it is too early to sound the all-clear. The ongoing price corrections on the US real estate market will probably continue to put a strain on the US economy. Ultimately, this will spill over to countries outside the US, although according to our assessment the affects will be limited. Consequently, although the SNB expects a slowing in momentum in the coming quarters, it expects the decline in economic growth to be less pronounced than in the US.  However, there is considerable uncertainty attached to the current forecast. This means that market participants, and in particular the banks, also need to take less favourable scenarios into account. A clear escalation of the crisis in the US real estate market would heavily depress economic growth in the US and this, in turn, would leave a more pronounced mark on Switzerland. Moreover, real estate prices have risen appreciably in recent years in the US, as in other countries. Price corrections can already be observed here and there in the real estate markets of other countries. Further developments of this kind cannot be ruled out. We do not see any greater risks for the Swiss real estate market at the present time.  As already mentioned, the Swiss big banks have reduced some of their risk positions in recent months. However, they remain exposed with regard to international developments. So far, the financial market turmoil has mainly affected the trading portfolios of the big banks, and hardly any losses have been recorded in traditional lending business. This could change. Should the general economic situation indeed deteriorate further, the solvency of borrowers would also worsen. This would result in losses in the big banks’ lending portfolios. The effect on banks with a domestic business focus would depend on the extent of the deterioration in the international environment. Entering into risk is a bank’s core business and, as such, is desirable. What is important is that these risks can be both calculated and carried. However, experience shows that is not always the case. In each of the three most recent international financial crises, a Swiss big bank was particularly hard hit. Each time a crisis occurred an increasing amount of equity was wiped out. This should serve as a warning. If the wheels are not set in motion now, the impact of the next crisis could be even more severe.  Should a big bank collapse, the consequences for Switzerland would be dire. Therefore, measures need to be taken now in order to ensure that the Swiss big banks are sufficiently BIS Review 80/2008 1 
resilient in the future. The SNB and the Swiss Federal Banking Commission recognise a need for action in – basically – four areas: capital, liquidity, monitoring and crisis management. In our stability report we discuss measures in all four areas. Today I would like to focus on the most important measures in the area of capital.  It is in the nature of the financial markets that there will always be crises. Even with the best risk management, banks can be hit suddenly by unexpected events or developments. I am convinced that managements will continue to misjudge situations in the future. This is something we have to live with. The financial system therefore needs to be made more resilient to possible shocks. This means the buffers in the financial system have to be increased. Fine-tuning of the current regulations is necessary in many respects. However, in my view it is an insufficient response to the steadily increasing complexity of financial markets. It is therefore questionable whether the current regulatory approach, with its increasingly complex provisions that intervene at an ever deeper level in the daily business of banks, is the right one. The authorities are, by nature, always a step behind the latest developments. Even the most complex models will never be infallible. In the current crisis, the model-based form of risk measurement failed. The SNB therefore believes that two fundamental adjustments need to be made to the capital requirements for the Swiss big banks.  First, the risk-weighted capital requirements for the Swiss big banks need to be tightened. One way of achieving this would be by using an appropriate multiplier to increase the capital requirements under Basel 2.  Second, a limit on leverage – often referred to as “leverage ratio” – needs to be introduced for the big banks as a complement to the risk-weighted capital requirements. As clearly outlined in our Financial Stability Report, leverage at the Swiss big banks is very high, and since the mid-1990s, average indebtedness at the two big banks has risen from 90% to over 97%. That means over CHF 97 of borrowed capital for every CHF 3 of equity. This ratio is also very high by international standards. In terms of return on equity, high leverage may appear attractive. In terms of financial stability, however, it is also a source of risk. Thus, in the current crisis, losses arose on Swiss big bank risk positions which are relatively small in comparison to total assets. However, because leverage was high, in the case of UBS these losses destroyed almost half the bank’s equity.  The two measures mentioned above have a complementary effect. The risk-based requirements ensure the best possible risk-sensitivity for capital adequacy purposes. Alongside this, a leverage ratio would guarantee a minimum safety buffer which does not depend on complex models. Thus, the leverage ratio would be a protection against unexpected shocks that are not sufficiently covered by the risk-weighted requirements. This limitation set on the degree of indebtedness would mean that capital requirements would increase for activities based on large amounts of borrowed funds, such as proprietary trading. In the US, banks have long been subject to a leverage ratio. They have to comply with a capital-to-assets ratio of at least 5% in order to be considered as well capitalised. The Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC) – as the authority with responsibility for this area – is currently in the process of spelling out in detail what measures will be needed in the area of capital adequacy requirements. Careful planning will be particularly important with respect to implementation of the new measures. First of all, the current crisis has to be seen through. The appropriate measures then need to be introduced progressively over a number of years. In this project, the SFBC can count on the full support of the SNB, in the interests of securing a long-term strengthening of the Swiss financial system.  2 BIS Review 80/2008 
Mark Carney: Capitalizing on the commodity boom – the role of monetary policy Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Haskayne School of Business, Calgary, Alberta, 19 June 2008. *      *      * Everyone here remembers the bumper sticker. For two decades, Albertans promised not to waste the next boom if one were granted. With US$130 oil, US$10 natural gas, US$200 coal, and US$8 wheat, the next one has clearly arrived. The question now is how to make good on that promise. This evening, I will concentrate on one aspect of the answer: how monetary policy can help to create the conditions that will allow all Canadians to benefit from sustained high commodity prices. I am grateful for this opportunity because monetary policy is more effective when it is well understood. Seldom is this understanding more important than when our economy faces the types of supply and demand shocks engendered by a series of sharp increases in commodity prices. Outlook for commodity prices We are experiencing a commodity super cycle. Throughout the current boom, the scale of price increases has been higher, and the range of affected commodities broader, than in previous upturns. Since 2002, grain and oilseed prices have more than doubled, base metals prices have tripled, and oil prices have quadrupled. Beyond the breadth and magnitude of these price increases, the current boom is also unusual in that it began earlier in the global economic cycle and has lasted longer. While booms usually herald a downturn, this one appears to be evidence of unusually robust momentum in global growth.1These dynamics suggest that a combination of very favourable and mutually reinforcing factors are at work. These include burgeoning demand, a subdued supply response, important links among commodity markets, and supportive financial conditions. An environment for a secular increase in commodity prices has been building since the middle of the 1990s. That said, we can expect considerable volatility around this longer-term trend and must remember that while supply and demand may be inelastic in the short term, they are decidedly more flexible over longer periods.  Current commodity-price dynamics are intimately linked to the globalization process. In particular, rapid growth in emerging-market demand is driving most prices. Positive underlying demand fundamentals in emerging markets include sustained growth in per capita income, rapid industrialization, and a more intensive use of commodities in production. Research at the Bank of Canada and elsewhere suggests that while oil and metals prices have historically moved with the business cycle in the developed world, this relationship has broken down over the past decade. For example, industrial activity in emerging Asia now appears to be the dominant driver of oil-price movements,2 and China alone is expected to become the world's largest consumer of energy by 2010.3 Emerging markets and developing economies have accounted for nearly 95 per cent of the increased demand for oil since                                                  1  See International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook (Washington: IMF, April 2008) p. 198-99. 2  C.

2003.4 As recently as the 1990s, marginal demand was roughly split between OECD and non-OECD countries. In the face of this demand, the supply response has been disappointing. Consider oil. OPEC's annual production has declined by 2 per cent since 2005 and, with a few exceptions, non-OPEC supply has failed to meet expectations. Among OECD countries, oil output has fallen by 8 per cent since 2002. As a consequence, inventories remain very tight at 31 days, and spare capacity is limited. With inelastic demand in the short term, actual or perceived supply disruptions can lead to sharp price spikes and continued volatility.  There are many reasons why the supply response has been limited thus far. First, access to many of the world's most promising regions is often tightly controlled or wholly restricted to state-owned enterprises. Second, while nominal investment has surged, so too have costs.5 Many in this room know from direct experience how hard it is to find skilled workers, drilling rigs, and pipeline capacity. Exploration and development costs for conventional crude have doubled, and oil sands costs have tripled. Across the global industry, surging investment costs have meant that real investment has remained flat. The net result is that a 70 per cent nominal increase in non-OPEC capital expenditure since 2003 has barely replaced declining production from existing fields.6  Over the medium term, high prices will encourage the development of new supplies and energy alternatives. Canada will be one of the most important marginal suppliers of oil. With more than $150 billion of new investment in the oil sands proposed or under way,7 output from the oil sands is expected to grow by 3 million barrels per day by 2020, representing about 15 per cent of expected marginal global demand.8 Other supplies can be expected to come on stream, and alternative energy sources should be developed. Although there will be lags, it would be a mistake to assume that the market has ceased to function. Demand will also be more responsive over time. SUV sales in the United States have fallen by nearly one-third so far this year – an important early indicator. Oil demand in OECD countries has been essentially flat since 2003, and the International Energy Agency projects it to remain weak for the next few years.9 As a result, the extent of continued upward demand pressure will depend almost exclusively on emerging markets. There are several considerations. First, we are about to find out the extent to which slowing domestic demand growth in the G-7 will affect growth in emerging Asia. Second, the stance of monetary policy in emerging markets will be an important determinant of prices in the short term. Monetary policy remains highly accommodative in a number of fast-growing economies that are major marginal consumers of commodities. The combination of accommodative monetary policy and overheating economies will eventually be reversed, either through policy action or generalized inflation. In either case, aggregate demand in emerging markets will likely slow relative to current trends. A third consideration is that the demand response in many economies is currently being muted by the prevalence of administered food and energy prices. These efforts to protect the most vulnerable are usually poorly targeted and, as a consequence, highly distortionary. By keeping domestic commodity prices artificially low, the authorities are simultaneously                                                  4  Data supplied by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). See http://www.eia.doe.gov/ipm/. 5  According to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), a 100,000-barrel-per-day integrated oil sands project that cost $3.3 billion to build in 2001 now costs over $10 billion.

encouraging consumption, which leads to higher prices elsewhere, and discouraging the internal supply response that would normally occur. In addition, by interfering with the price signals, these policies delay necessary economic adjustment and increase the risk of a dramatic and difficult reversal in the future. Encouragingly, in recent weeks, several countries have taken important steps to ease such controls. Demand can be expected to follow.  As in the wake of previous commodity-price spikes, this demand response will ultimately include the adoption of new technologies. Indeed, commodity-intensive economies will likely replace energy-inefficient capital more rapidly than their peers did three decades ago. With today's major marginal commodity consumers operating at levels well below peak efficiency, the question is how quickly they will adopt more efficient, existing technologies once they have determined that the relative price adjustment will be sustained. There has been much discussion about the contribution of financial factors to the commodity boom. It does appear that low long-term interest rates and past weakness in the U.S. dollar may have played minor supportive roles. The impact of outright speculation and index investment is less clear cut.10 If speculation were keeping the spot price of a commodity substantially higher than the level where supply and demand naturally intersect, inventories should build as the incentive to increase supply outstrips the desire to increase consumption. However, there is little evidence of this in commodities as diverse as crude oil, wheat, or aluminum.  At this point, the bulk of the evidence suggests that the increase in most commodity prices is due to the fundamentals of strong demand and weak supply. This appears to be a durable relative price shift. That does not necessarily imply persistent price increases. Demand and supply will adjust, particularly as prices are passed through. In the short term, low inventories suggest continued price volatility, which may be amplified by trend-following speculation. What the current boom means for Canada Although natural resources as a whole represent only 6 per cent of direct employment and 12 per cent of GDP, the sector has an important influence on Canadian economic activity through a number of channels. Resources account for roughly one-third of all business investment and about 45 per cent of our exports. As such, the benefits of the current commodity boom can be felt across Canada – not just in resource-heavy sectors and regions. Above all, rising commodity prices have made Canada wealthier as a nation. Since 2002, rising commodity prices have fuelled a 25 per cent improvement in our terms of trade, which alone has been responsible for roughly two-thirds of the 15 per cent gain in real per capita disposable income recorded over that period. These income gains have helped reduce corporate leverage to its lowest level in a quarter of a century and have helped our governments to record consistent fiscal surpluses. Higher commodity prices bring increased investment, which entails direct and indirect benefits not only for the sectors in question, but also for the service sectors that support them. As well, many individual Canadians – and their pension funds – have benefited greatly from the gains in the value of their own investments in commodity-producing firms.11 Finally, the rise in our terms of trade has brought with it an associated appreciation of our currency that has benefited everyone by lowering the cost of imported goods and services. With this downward pressure on import prices, productivity-                                                 10  For example, the prices of many non-indexed commodities have risen more rapidly than those of indexed ones. 11  The TSX energy sector has risen roughly 18 per cent per year since the beginning of 2002, while the metals and mining sector is up 11 per cent annually and the fertilizers and agricultural chemicals sector is up 44 per cent annually. These sectors have a combined weighting of 50.3 per cent of the TSX composite index. BIS Review 80/2008 3 
enhancing machinery and equipment – much of which is imported – has become less expensive for all firms, not just commodity producers. These benefits are important. However, it is unavoidable that large, sustained changes in terms of trade – whether favourable or unfavourable – will cause stress and dislocation because of significant shifts in production and employment among economic sectors. In macroeconomic terms, terms-of-trade shocks trigger a shift of resources to activities generating higher income. From that perspective, postponing adjustment would mean forgoing the potential income gains that the reallocation of resources can bring. Adjustment is always difficult, but it is vital to our long-term economic prosperity. Despite the difficulties involved, the adjustment process of the past few years has gone more smoothly than in previous periods. Canada's labour force participation rate has risen to a record high, and the jobless rate has fallen to a 33-year low. While the manufacturing sector has lost about one in seven jobs since 2002 – a total of about 335,000 jobs – total employment in Canada has risen by 1.6 million jobs over the same period. Equally encouraging is the quality of the jobs being created. More than 80 per cent of new jobs are in sectors where the average hourly wage is higher than in manufacturing. Canada's ability to capitalize on higher commodity prices (or to mitigate the impact of lower ones) depends crucially on the continued ability of our economy to adjust. Product and labour market flexibility is essential. The Trade, Investment, and Labour Mobility Agreement (TILMA) between Alberta and British Columbia is a good example of the type of response needed. It is encouraging that other governments are contemplating similar liberalizations. Lessons from the previous boom Before turning to monetary policy considerations, I would like to recall some lessons from the last sustained upturn in commodity prices. During the 1970s, a number of commodity prices spiked – including oil prices, which rose five-fold during the decade. Like today, common drivers included low real interest rates globally and supply factors, in particular, the emergence of OPEC. The decline of the newly floating U.S. dollar also pushed oil prices higher, along with the persistence of inflation in G-7 countries once inflation expectations began to rise. Authorities in many oil-producing countries acted as if higher prices would persist indefinitely. They increased spending rapidly, which would prove calamitous when prices reversed and large structural deficits were revealed. In Canada, total program spending by the federal government rose from 17 per cent of GDP in the early 1970s to 21 per cent only a decade later. In 1985, the general government structural deficit peaked at 8 per cent of potential GDP. We should keep fresh in our minds the memory of the Herculean efforts required to eliminate this drain on future generations. The management of monetary policy, in hindsight, was not much better. Authorities in many countries mistakenly assumed that the productivity gains experienced over the previous quarter century would continue. Rising unemployment was taken, falsely, as a sign of rising excess capacity. This ignored the fact that much of our industrial activity, indeed much of our society, was based on an assumption of perpetually cheap energy.  The monetary authorities of the day reacted to the oil-price shock by accommodating the price increase. Viewing the higher prices as contractionary, they loosened monetary policy to avoid a slowdown. The absence of an explicit nominal anchor for policy made this decision easier and its consequences far worse. As we know now, the assumed excess supply was illusory.  The fallout from these errors in monetary and fiscal policy was severe. The global recession of 1981-82 was, in large measure, the end result. In Canada, both consumer price inflation 4 BIS Review 80/2008 
and the unemployment rate reached double digits by the early 1980s. The damage to inflation expectations meant that inflation would remain a real and present danger for years.  Implications for monetary policy in the current situation This experience is relevant to the current situation. At a fundamental level, it underscores that the primary goal of monetary policy should be to keep inflation low, stable, and predictable. While commodity-price shocks raise complex issues, a relentless focus on inflation clarifies policy decisions, makes communications easier, and maximizes the likelihood that expectations will remain well anchored. A credible inflation target helps to keep the cost of capital down and highlights relative price movements, thus allowing individuals and firms to make better investment decisions. In Canada, we have developed a well-functioning monetary policy framework based on inflation targeting and supported by a flexible exchange rate. Inflation targeting naturally leads the monetary authorities to take a disciplined and rigorous approach to understanding the drivers of inflation. However, even with the best framework, execution is everything. In the face of the largest commodity-price shock in our lifetimes, we cannot be complacent. Indeed, the current period of exceptional volatility in commodity prices raises several issues for the conduct of monetary policy. First, the commodity boom underscores the importance of well-anchored inflation expectations. People's expectations for future inflation do influence actual future inflation rates. Thus, there is a risk that the high visibility of energy prices could lead to increased inflation expectations and to more general inflationary pressures. On the other hand, if people recognize that a one-time increase in commodity prices has a temporary impact on total CPI, other prices and wages will be unaffected. The demand and supply fundamentals that I discussed at the start give reasons to expect firm commodity prices, but not necessarily persistent – let alone accelerating – commodity-price increases. Quite simply, high commodity prices do not necessarily mean rising commodity prices. In fact, high prices themselves make further commodity-price inflation less likely because of the demand and supply responses they provoke.  The Bank of Canada's clear commitment to its inflation target and its consistent past success in achieving it, have kept inflation expectations well anchored. The Bank will continue to monitor movements in inflation expectations using a wide range of survey and market indicators.  Second, and relatedly, the Bank needs to be mindful of the possibility that rising commodity prices may affect the relationship between total and core CPI. The experience in Canada has been that total CPI persistently moves towards the core measure over time.12 Moreover, our experience has been that commodity-price inflation has been one of the least persistent forms of inflation. As a consequence, in the pursuit of our 2 per cent target for total CPI, we use our core measure as an operational guide. This is because, over the years, core CPI has been a good gauge of the underlying trend of inflation and has been a better predictor of future changes in the total index than has total CPI itself. In practice, targeting total CPI inflation requires a high degree of confidence about the future path of commodity prices. The relationship between core and total CPI is more marked in Canada than in other countries, reflecting both the success in anchoring inflation expectations around 2 per cent and the fact that, as a major commodity exporter, movements in our dollar in response to commodity-price changes generally provide an offset that reduces the Canadian-dollar prices                                                  12  See J. Armour, "An Evaluation of Core Inflation Measures" (Working Paper 2006-10, Bank of Canada, 2006) and J. Hoddenbagh, M. Johnson, and E. Santor, "Total and Core Inflation: Recent International Evidence" (Bank of Canada Working Paper, forthcoming). BIS Review 80/2008 5 
of all imports, including commodities. For example, the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar is one reason why food-price inflation has been markedly lower in Canada than in the rest of the developed world.13 Overall, the Bank of Canada's commodity-price index (BCPI) has risen only half as much in Canadian-dollar terms as it has in U.S.-dollar terms, since 2002.  The Bank will continue to monitor the stability of the relationship between core and total CPI. The Bank will also continue to look at a range of measures to assess the underlying trend of inflation. Considerable judgment must always be applied, and no one measure should be relied on exclusively. Third, we need to consider the possible impact of higher commodity prices on Canada's potential growth. The Bank spends a great deal of effort trying to understand the factors that shape potential output and its components. This focus on potential should mean that we are less likely to misread the outlook for productivity and potential growth in the face of large relative price shifts, and thus avoid a key policy mistake of the 1970s. In particular, we need to consider the possibility that the combination of Canada's relatively high energy intensity,14 the exploitation of more marginal resource deposits that high prices encourage, and the significant shifts in productive resources across our economy could temporarily lead to lower productivity and potential growth. There are, of course, countervailing forces that could raise potential growth, including the strong capital investment incentives arising from a stronger dollar and the tightness of the labour market. We will make such determinations carefully and will provide our updated views in the October Monetary Policy Report. Fourth, the pace and nature of recent commodity-price moves has important positive demand implications. As I mentioned earlier, large improvements in our terms of trade mean large increases in Canadian real income and wealth. This fuels domestic demand, especially for non-traded goods and services, and provides a timely offset to weaker external demand from our largest trading partner, the United States.  Finally, a central lesson from past commodity booms (and busts) is the value of a flexible exchange rate as shock absorber. A floating exchange rate is a key element of our monetary policy framework that allows Canada to pursue an independent monetary policy appropriate to our own economic circumstances. To be absolutely clear, irrespective of the path of commodity prices specifically, or global price movements more generally, a floating exchange rate means that we can continue to achieve our inflation target.  Exchange rate movements act as a signal to shift resources into sectors where demand is strongest. During the Asian crisis in the late 1990s, commodity prices fell sharply. The resulting depreciation of the Canadian dollar helped with the significant but necessary reallocation of resources out of the resource sector and into other sectors, such as manufacturing, whose competitive positions had improved. In recent years, the process has worked in reverse. It is important to remember that with changes in terms of trade, adjustment will follow. It is only a question of how. Our floating exchange rate helps to achieve the appropriate adjustments without forcing very difficult changes in the overall level of wages, output, and prices.                                                  13  Canadian food-price inflation has averaged 1.4 per cent over the past year, versus the OECD average of 4.3 per cent. Reasons include the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar, increased competition among food retailers, and some special factors such as the excess supply of meat. Although these factors can be considered temporary, the same may well apply to the future path of food-price increases. 14  For instance, there is evidence from the United States that the productivity slowdown of the 1970s was concentrated in sectors that were most energy intensive and were therefore the hardest hit by the energy shock. See W. Nordhaus, "Retrospective on the 1970s Productivity Slowdown" (Working Paper No. 10950, National Bureau of Economic Research, 2004). 6 BIS Review 80/2008 
Conclusion: the current environment  Let me close with a few words about the current stance of monetary policy. In addition to sharply improved terms of trade driven by commodity prices, the Canadian economy is being hit by two major and related shocks: a marked and prolonged slowdown in the U.S. economy and severe dislocations in financial markets. The challenge for the Bank is to assess the combined implications of these three forces and other factors for the balance of aggregate supply and demand in the Canadian economy and the prospects for inflation in Canada. Reflecting the severity and persistence of the downside shocks, the Bank reduced its key policy rate by a cumulative 150 basis points since December. In our April Monetary Policy Report, we reviewed these forces at length and laid out a base-case projection for the economy that contained upside and downside risks to inflation. Those risks were judged to be balanced. We said at the time that "some further monetary stimulus will likely be required," but noted that the timing of "any further monetary stimulus will depend on the evolution of the global economy and domestic demand, and their impact on inflation in Canada." Since then, there have been developments in the global economy relative to our expectations in April that led the Bank to decide on 10 June to maintain its target for the overnight rate at 3 per cent. Commodity prices, as measured by the BCPI, rose 10 per cent over the period between decisions, and the futures curve for oil moved sharply higher. This will support domestic demand. Other considerations included stronger global growth than previously expected and higher global inflation, which increases the risk of higher-than-projected costs for Canadian imports. In addition, many of the downside risks to inflation have eased. For instance, the price discounting on cars and books, which followed the move of the Canadian dollar to parity with the U.S. dollar, does not appear to be spreading materially to other products. In addition, as I noted a moment ago, the risk remains that potential growth will be weaker than currently assumed. Although global financial conditions remain strained, their evolution has been in line with expectations. Credit conditions in Canada are better than elsewhere, as evidenced by the Bank's decision in May to become the first G-7 central bank to begin withdrawing its extraordinary provision of liquidity to markets. Thus, developments since April shifted the balance of risks to the inflation projection in the April MPR slightly to the upside. This evolution of the global economy and domestic demand was sufficient to alter the view that "some further monetary stimulus will likely be required." As a result, the Bank now judges that the current accommodative stance of monetary policy is appropriate to bring aggregate demand and supply back into balance and to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target. Going forward, there remain important downside and upside risks to inflation, but these risks are now judged to be evenly balanced.  The Bank will continue to monitor closely the evolution of developments in the Canadian and global economies in order to assess their implications for aggregate supply and demand and the outlook for inflation. One thing is certain: over time, the balance of risks will change again. Monetary policy will adjust accordingly, while always remaining focused on achieving our inflation target. In this manner, the Bank of Canada can make its best contribution to helping Canadians capitalize on the current commodity boom, and that famous bumper sticker can remain a relic.

Donald L Kohn: Risk management and its implications for systemic risk Testimony of Mr Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, Washington DC, 19 June 2008. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Allard and members of the Subcommittee, it is my pleasure to appear today to discuss several issues related to the oversight of financial institutions. First, I will discuss the circumstances leading to the establishment of our temporary facility for lending to primary securities dealers and our arrangements for monitoring their financial condition. Then, I will describe Federal Reserve activities related to the banking institutions we supervise, including concrete steps to address identified issues and to help these institutions improve risk management practices. Finally, I will briefly summarize planned enhancements to our consolidated supervision of bank and financial holding companies.  Federal Reserve monitoring activities related to the Primary Dealer Credit Facility Three months ago, the Board approved the establishment of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF). This action was taken pursuant to Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, which empowers the Board of Governors to authorize a Federal Reserve Bank to lend to a corporation, including a securities firm, in "unusual and exigent" circumstances when the corporation cannot "secure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions." In doing so, the Board of Governors made the necessary statutory finding that market circumstances were indeed unusual and exigent. We judged that without increased access to Federal Reserve liquidity by major securities firms, overall financial market conditions would have deteriorated further and would have had a substantially adverse effect on the economy. We fully recognized that the use of this legal authority was an extraordinary step, but considered it necessary given the circumstances. To quickly design and implement a facility to provide this liquidity, we made use of existing business relationships with a group of 20 securities firms, known as primary dealers. The Open Market Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York trades U.S. government securities with primary dealers to implement monetary policy on behalf of the Federal Reserve System. The PDCF makes available overnight funding to sound primary dealers in the form of loans secured by collateral eligible to be pledged in open market operations, plus investment-grade corporate, municipal, and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. The PDCF was authorized for a minimum period of six months.  Most of the primary dealers are owned by either U.S. or foreign banking organizations that have been approved as U.S. financial holding companies. The U.S. financial holding companies owning primary dealers are subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve, but for the primary dealers within financial holding companies we rely extensively on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as functional regulator. The SEC, rather than the Federal Reserve, serves as consolidated supervisor for the major U.S. investment banks with primary dealers. In connection with the establishment of the PDCF, we created a program to monitor the financial and funding positions of primary dealers, focusing on those primary dealers not owned by financial holding companies. From the beginning, we have coordinated closely with the SEC, and we are currently working on an agreement with that BIS Review 80/2008 1 
agency to enhance information sharing both for primary dealers that are part of financial holding companies and for those that are not.  The objectives of our PDCF monitoring program are: (1) to establish the basis for an informed judgment by the Federal Reserve of the liquidity and capital positions of the primary dealers accessing the PDCF; and (2) to minimize the risk that the availability of financing under the PDCF undermines the incentives for the consolidated entity to manage capital and liquidity to levels appropriate for a sustained period of market disruption.  The Federal Reserve's monitoring program for primary dealers includes a limited on-site presence at the four largest investment banks and has a narrower focus than our broader supervision and examination of state member banks, bank holding companies, and the U.S. operations of foreign banking organizations. Specifically, the Federal Reserve is not supervising investment firms comprehensively to assess risk management. Rather, our purpose is specifically to assess the adequacy of liquidity and capital.  To support our monitoring efforts, which are closely coordinated with the SEC, we receive internal information from the firms on a daily basis that enables us to identify changes in the level and composition of the firms' holdings of cash and unencumbered, highly liquid assets. We also receive qualitative information regarding the posture of counterparties and clients toward the firms, including the extent, if any, to which the firms are encountering difficulty in rolling over secured and unsecured funding. In addition, along with the SEC, we are assessing the firms' current and planned capital positions in light of their near-term earnings prospects. In both of these areas – liquidity and capital – we are evaluating the firms' efforts and, with the SEC, providing feedback to their senior management teams. Broadly speaking, we believe that primary dealers are strengthening liquidity and capital positions to better protect themselves against extreme events. We also believe their management has learned some valuable lessons from the events of the recent financial turmoil that should translate into better risk management. We continue to monitor the effect of the PDCF and are studying a range of options going forward.  Federal Reserve supervisory activities I would now like to discuss the Federal Reserve's recent activities relating to banking institutions we supervise. As I noted in testimony before the full Committee on June 5, recent events have highlighted a number of risk management lessons for banking organizations, many of which have been documented in recent public reports.1 In that testimony, I outlined the Federal Reserve's broad supervisory responses to recent events, which include requiring banking institutions to improve risk management, augmenting existing supervisory guidance, and where necessary, enhancing our own supervisory processes.  Naturally, the risk management lessons from recent events vary by institution, since the types of deficiencies differed and some institutions fared better than others. Thus, in our supervisory efforts, we are taking these broad lessons and applying them to each institution as needed. But we can point to some general areas where we are focusing supervisory attention and encouraging better risk management at banking institutions. For one, supervisors are reinforcing and strengthening their assessments and testing of fundamental                                                  1  President's Working Group on Financial Markets (2008), "Policy Statement on Financial Market Developments", March 13;  Financial Stability Forum (2008), "Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience", April 7;  Senior Supervisors Group (2008). "Observations on Risk Management Practices during the Recent Market Turbulence", March 6.  2 BIS Review 80/2008 
risk management processes, requiring vigorous corrective action when weaknesses are identified. We are ensuring that institutions take a more comprehensive and forward-looking approach to risk management across the entire firm, and are more intensely verifying assertions made by bank management about the robustness of their risk management capabilities.  Supervisors are also ensuring that banks understand the full spectrum and the scale of the risks inherent in increasingly complex banking activities and the potential for their risks to crystallize in times of stress. In particular, banks must focus on the inter-relationships among risk types, not just with respect to those areas that precipitated recent events, but more broadly.  In light of recent events, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that senior management properly defines overall risk preferences and creates incentives for employees to abide by those preferences, such as effective firm-wide limits and controls. We are reminding banks of the importance of information-sharing throughout the entire organization and of the dangers of information silos. In addition, we are strongly encouraging institutions to improve and/or build out their risk functions, so that independent risk managers are empowered to dig deep for latent risks, including concentrations that often arise only in times of stress.  Having given some general thoughts on current supervisory issues and supervisory approaches to improving risk management, I would now like to turn to a few specific areas in which we are addressing the challenges facing institutions and helping bring about improvements in their risk management.  Residential lending Risks associated with residential mortgage and home equity lending remain a top supervisory priority due to the continued negative trends in home prices, elevated levels of delinquencies and foreclosures, and slack demand for residential mortgage securities in the secondary markets. Banks continue to experience losses on residential first mortgage loans, especially, but not exclusively, on nonprime lending. Losses on home equity loans are also increasing significantly, even for lenders not heavily involved in subprime lending, and loss severities as a percentage of outstanding exposure on this product are greater than for first lien loans. And mortgage securities markets whose instruments are not supported by government-sponsored entities continue to be adversely affected by problems in the housing market, complicating banks' risk management in this sector.  Supervisors are acting on several fronts to address problems related to residential first and second mortgages. First, we are making sure institutions comply with our existing guidance on nontraditional mortgages and on home equity loans, issued in 2006 and 2005, respectively, as well as guidance on subprime lending issued last year. And we are evaluating institutions based on the risk management practices discussed in those guidance documents. We expect institutions to conduct rigorous stress tests of potential future losses related to residential mortgage loans, home equity lines, and mortgage-backed securities. We continue to encourage lenders and mortgage servicers to work constructively with borrowers at risk of default and to consider prudent workout arrangements to avoid unnecessary foreclosures. As you know, the Federal Reserve believes that prudent workout arrangements that are consistent with safe and sound lending practices are generally in the long-term best interest of both the financial institution and the borrower. Furthermore, we are working to finalize the proposed amendments to the rules under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act that we proposed in December. The proposed amendments, which would apply to all creditors, would better protect consumers from a range of unfair or deceptive mortgage lending and advertising practices that have been the source of considerable concern and criticism. Our proposal includes key protections for higher-priced mortgage loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling and addresses concerns about a lender's assessment of a borrower's ability to make the scheduled BIS Review 80/2008 3 
payments, including verification of the consumer's income and assets. The proposal also addresses concerns about prepayment penalties and the adverse impact on consumers of lenders failing to escrow for taxes and insurance. Protecting consumers also has benefits for lenders because it should reduce delinquencies and defaults that can occur when consumers do not understand or cannot afford certain types of loans. We are working toward issuing final regulations in July. Commercial real estate lending Commercial real estate (CRE) lending is another area that requires close supervisory attention. In 2006, well before CRE markets began to soften, property values began to level off or decline in certain markets, and fundamentals began to turn somewhat negative, the Federal Reserve and other banking agencies issued guidance on CRE concentrations. We were concerned that the increasing concentrations of CRE loans in the portfolios of many banks, especially small and medium-sized lenders, made them more vulnerable to a softening in this market if the risks were not well managed. Since then, delinquencies on construction loans have begun to rise, particularly for residential construction loans, and they are expected to rise further. Those institutions with high CRE concentrations in geographic areas suffering real estate pressures will likely bear losses. Further, the significant slowdown in the origination of commercial mortgage-backed securities will reduce banks' options to manage CRE portfolio risks through the secondary market.  As I noted in my March testimony on the condition of the U.S. banking industry, we have been stepping up our reviews of state member banks and bank holding companies exhibiting concentrations in CRE, especially in those areas of the country exhibiting signs of weakness. We continue to monitor banks' adherence to the supervisory guidance I just noted. These efforts include monitoring carefully the potential impact of lower valuations on CRE exposures. Through those reviews, we are identifying weaknesses in banks' risk management practices, including underwriting practices, appraisal processes, stress testing, and market analysis. Based on these results, we are updating our supervisory plans and examination schedules to focus our resources most effectively on those institutions presenting the greatest risk and needing the most improvement. Finally, we just concluded a Federal Reserve examiner training effort on CRE topics, including appraisal practices, loan loss allowances, stress testing, and board and management oversight. The training focused on the importance of ensuring prudent risk management practices, without unduly curtailing credit availability. Counterparty credit risk Concerns in financial markets about the creditworthiness of some financial intermediaries have eased somewhat since the first half of March, but those concerns remain relatively high. More fundamentally, the proper management of counterparty credit risk – which is the risk of loss from a counterparty's failure to perform its financial obligations – is a prerequisite for protecting the entire system from contagion when any one institution fails.  Consistent with the recommendations of recent reports, we are looking at how firms are addressing weaknesses in counterparty credit risk management practices highlighted by recent events, including the measurement and aggregation of exposures stemming from a wide range of transactions with both unregulated and regulated entities. For instance, we are emphasizing that firms should use a variety of techniques to measure potential exposure on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, repurchase agreements, and other contracts, and that they should aggregate all exposures to each counterparty. In this context, we have been closely monitoring counterparty exposures arising from transactions with monoline financial guarantors and have been discussing with banks the measurement and management of these positions.  4 BIS Review 80/2008 
In addition, we are working to strengthen the market infrastructure for financial transactions to make it more robust and more resilient. In particular, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York continues to work with domestic and international prudential supervisors of OTC derivatives dealers to strengthen the infrastructure for those large and rapidly growing markets. The supervisors are emphasizing to the major dealers and to other active market participants the importance of setting standards for the accuracy and timeliness of trade data submission and for the timeliness of resolutions of errors in trade matching for OTC derivatives contracts. Furthermore, consistent with the recommendations made in recent reports on turbulence in financial markets, supervisors are encouraging the development by the industry of a longer-term plan for an integrated operational infrastructure supporting OTC derivatives that captures all significant processing events over the entire lifecycle of trades, delivers operational reliability, and maximizes the efficiencies obtainable from automation and electronic processing platforms. In addition to supporting more robust exposure measurement and capture, these enhancements should strengthen participants' ability to manage counterparty risk through loss mitigation techniques such as the use of netting and collateral agreements. We are encouraged by recent industry efforts to address counterparty credit risk, such as plans to extend central counterparty clearinghouse services to credit derivatives and other initiatives.  Credit cards Credit card charge-offs have continued to rise over the past several quarters, although charge-offs remain well below their early 2002 peak. Not surprisingly, some banks report that delinquency rates for unsecured consumer debt are generally higher in areas that have experienced significant home price depreciation and increased unemployment. In response to these trends, many issuers are tightening credit standards and reducing exposures in these higher risk markets. Rising delinquencies and increased card usage that has been reported in recent months are likely to push charge-off levels higher in future quarters. Therefore, we will continue to monitor credit card markets and other consumer lending sectors for potential weaknesses. The Federal Reserve has also taken steps toward improving consumer protection for credit card users. Our first step was the Board's 2007 proposal to substantially revise and improve credit card disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act. In preparing this proposal, we conducted extensive consumer testing to determine the type and format of information that consumers find most useful in shopping for and choosing a credit card. This extensive consumer testing – and the thousands of public comments on our proposal – suggested that disclosures may not provide sufficient consumer protection with regard to certain practices. Therefore, we recently proposed rules under the Federal Trade Commission Act to protect consumers from financial harm caused by those practices. If implemented, the proposed rules would require financial institutions to make changes to their business models and to alter some practices. The Federal Reserve developed this proposal jointly with the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration. We are continuing to use consumer testing as we work toward issuing final rules for credit cards by year-end.  Commercial lending Commercial lending activity, aside from a few sectors such as leveraged lending, has not been markedly affected by the recent volatility in the financial markets, but may encounter more difficulty should slow economic growth persist. Lenders and investors are demanding stricter underwriting standards and higher returns for commercial loans. With regard to the condition of existing commercial loan portfolios, delinquencies have been rising recently as has the volume of criticized assets. This has been most evident in the leveraged loan market, where lending standards appeared to weaken noticeably in recent years, and which tends to be more susceptible to soft economic conditions.  BIS Review 80/2008 5 
Supervisors are monitoring banks' commercial lending activities, particularly leveraged loan portfolios, to detect weaknesses in asset quality that may result from slowing economic conditions and to ensure appropriate risk management practices. In part, the agencies rely on their Shared National Credit (SNC) program to assess the credit quality of banks' commercial loan portfolios. The 2008 review is now underway and will provide additional insight into the condition of large syndicated credits that are shared by three or more banks, including an evaluation of underwriting practices and trends in the leveraged loan market and the broader syndicated loan market.  Adequacy of loan loss allowance As the banking system has faced a more difficult environment in recent quarters, our examiners have identified significant weaknesses at some institutions in identifying and reserving against problem loans, which in some cases have led to deficiencies in allowance levels at some supervised institutions. In response, our examiners continue to remind bankers that allowance levels should be reflective of loan portfolio quality, based on sound processes, and consistent with current supervisory guidance. We recently provided additional clarity to our examiners regarding existing interagency guidance on loan loss allowances that should be factored into current examinations and inspections of state member banks, bank holding companies, and their nonbank subsidiaries. We believe this further clarity to our examination staff will help them in their regular discussions with bankers to ensure that reserving practices are robust and loan loss allowances are indeed adequate to the circumstances facing each institution.  Liquidity risk management Recent reports cite the need for enhancement to liquidity risk management as one of the key lessons from recent events. Financial institutions must understand their liquidity needs at both the legal entity and enterprise-wide level and be prepared for the possibility that market liquidity may erode quickly, unexpectedly, and for a protracted time. As is now widely recognized, many contingency funding plans did not adequately prepare for the possibility that certain off-balance-sheet exposures might have to be brought onto the firm's balance sheet, calling on available liquidity. Nor did they adequately account for the possibility of widespread and protracted declines in asset market liquidity. While liquidity pressures in banking and financial markets have eased of late, we do recognize that institutions must prepare themselves for the possibility that liquidity problems could return, either market-wide or at an individual institution.  Supervisors are working with institutions to improve liquidity risk management practices. For instance, we are reviewing banks' contingent funding needs and sources of funding. We are ensuring that bankers develop appropriate short-term and long-term liquidity risk management strategies. Consistent with the findings of recent reports, we are emphasizing the importance of appropriate stress testing of liquidity needs and maintenance of robust liquidity buffers. In addition, we worked with our colleagues on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to enhance existing guidance on the management of liquidity risks, which was released two days ago. That work was drawn from recent and ongoing efforts on liquidity risk by the public and private sectors and is intended to strengthen banks' liquidity risk management and improve global supervisory practices. Of course, the Federal Reserve has undertaken a number of programs to bolster market liquidity.  Capital needs Clearly, capital is a critical defense against unexpected losses. Even with the recent turmoil, the U.S. banking system remains well capitalized. However, as I noted in my June 5 testimony, we are encouraging institutions to raise capital as needed, in part so that they will be well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities and to support a strengthening of 6 BIS Review 80/2008 
financial conditions and a rebound in economic growth. And the recent capital injections into banking organizations and other financial institutions are a good sign that investors see value in those institutions and in the banking industry as a whole.  To assess the sufficiency of firms' capacity to absorb unexpected losses from a wide range of sources, Federal Reserve supervisors have heightened their review of capital analysis and forecasting at banking organizations. Examiners are reviewing the reasonableness of assumptions banking organizations use to assess capital needs and are emphasizing forward-looking analysis. For example, we are evaluating banks' use of stress scenarios to see if they adequately incorporate a range of possible events and properly identify potential capital needs and capacity across the firms. The scenarios address a number of possible factors including unexpected balance sheet expansion, earnings deterioration across key business lines, and stress-level losses generated by a variety of positions and multiple sources.  In addition, last year the Federal Reserve conducted a review across a number of large banking organizations to assess these firms' use of so-called "economic capital" practices, which are a means for firms to calculate, for internal purposes, their capital needs given their risk profile. Consistent with other findings, we found that some banks relied too extensively on the output of internal models, not viewing model output with appropriate skepticism. Models are dependent on the data used to construct them. When data histories are short or are drawn mostly from periods of benign economic conditions, model results may not be fully applicable to an institution's risk profile. We concluded that banks would generally benefit from better evaluation of inputs used in their internal capital models, stronger validation of their models, and broader use of stress testing and scenario analysis to supplement the inherent limitations of their models. We are incorporating the results of this horizontal review in our current assessments of banks' overall capital adequacy, as well as using it to evaluate banks' readiness to meet the requirement in Pillar 2 of Basel II that banks develop their own internal process to assess overall capital adequacy, beyond regulatory capital measures. Consolidated supervision program The supervisory activities just described are intended to address many of the risk management lapses seen over the past year, some of which pertain to shortcomings in firm-wide risk identification and measurement. Consistent with our regular efforts to improve supervisory practices, we realize that our program of consolidated supervision could be enhanced and made more systematic. Supervising a consolidated banking organization requires review of all risks on an enterprise-wide basis, not just review of the risks contained in each subsidiary legal entity. To this end, the Federal Reserve is nearing completion of enhancements to its supervisory guidance to clarify our role as consolidated supervisor of bank and financial holding companies.  The updated consolidated supervision guidance, which will be publicly available, is primarily intended to provide greater clarity to our own examination staff. For example, it provides for more consistent Federal Reserve supervisory practices and assessments across institutions with similar activities and risks, detailing expectations for understanding and assessing primary governance functions and risk controls, material business lines, nonbank operations, funding and liquidity management, consumer compliance, and other key activities and risks. In this sense the forthcoming guidance is very consistent with the Federal Reserve supervisory actions I have just described. The enhanced guidance will help us better identify and address firm-wide issues at supervised banking organizations, while also promoting better risk management.  I want to make clear that consolidated supervision of bank and financial holding companies in the United States generally works well, with strong, cooperative relationships between the Federal Reserve and other relevant bank supervisors and functional regulators. Indeed, much of the supervisory work I just described is being done in cooperation with primary BIS Review 80/2008 7 
supervisors and functional regulators. Information sharing among relevant supervisors and regulators is essential to ensure that a banking organization's global activities are effectively supervised on a consolidated basis, and we have worked over the years to develop and enhance interagency coordination and information sharing. But as institutions grow larger and more complex, we need to ensure that our system of consolidated supervision keeps pace.  Finally, it is worth noting that the Federal Reserve's umbrella supervision role closely complements our other central bank responsibilities, including the objectives of fostering financial stability and deterring or managing financial crises. The information, expertise, and powers derived from our supervisory authority enhances the Federal Reserve's ability to help prevent financial crises, and to manage such crises should they occur, working with the Treasury Department and other U.S. and foreign authorities. In this manner, enhancements to our consolidated supervision program, which include close coordination with primary supervisors and functional regulators, should provide broad benefits for the financial system and the economy.  8 BIS Review 80/2008 
Su Ning: Keep good credit records and endeavor to aim for a harmonious society Speech by Mr Su Ning, Deputy Governor of the People’s Bank of China, at the Launch Ceremony of the National Credit Information Education Month, Beijing, 31 May 2008. *      *      * Vice Mayor Mr. GOU Zhongwen, Ladies and gentlemen, Good morning! Welcome to the launch ceremony of the National Credit Information Education Month. I appreciate your care and support to the building of China’s credit information system. Enterprises and individuals, as the subjects of a credit information system, comprise an important force pushing ahead the building of a credit information system. Improved awareness of enterprises and individuals of the credit information system and expanded outreach can help protect the rights and interests of enterprises and individuals and promote the healthy development of the credit industry. It remains a priority in the PBC’s credit information work to popularize the knowledge about credit information, help enterprises and individuals to understand and use credit information to create more transaction and development opportunities. In recent years, under the guidance of the Central Publicity Department and with the support of the Ministry of Education and other central government authorities and local governments, the PBC has undertaken various credit information educational campaigns and achieved some good results. Credit information is no longer a strange word, but has penetrated into the daily life and economic and financial activities of the public, starting to influence behaviors of enterprises and individuals in its unique manner and propelling the building of a social credit system. In order to improve understanding of credit information system and expand its use, the PBC has decided to launch the National Credit Information Education Month, in a bid to generate synergy and magnify the results. Credit is not something that you are endowed with. If default is not recorded or punished, people will not have the motive or discipline to value creditworthiness, and it is possible that honest enterprises and individuals will turn their back to credit and honesty. As such, the building of social credit is not only to be held up by moral standards, but also be regulated by legal and institutional systems. The credit information system, as an institutional guarantee regulating credit-related behaviors of enterprises and individuals, is the foundation for the social credit system and the cornerstone for the stable performance of a modern financial system. In recent years, the PBC has implemented policy measures of the State Council on social credit system building, organized commercial banks to establish a national database covering credit information of both enterprises and individuals, namely the credit information system for enterprises and individuals. Credit records were created for 13 million enterprises and nearly 600 million natural persons, including information of their borrowing activities and law-compliance in environmental protection etc, facilitating their economic and financial activities and promoting economic and social harmony. Banking financial institutions have included inquiry into the credit information system as an indispensable step in pre-lending examination. Some regions mandate that personal credit reports should be referred to when reviewing candidacy of deputies of the National People’s Congress and delegates of China People’s Political and Consultative Conference and admitting public servants. Authorities in charge of human resources, social security, environment protection and quality inspection and quarantine also access the credit information system for information that will help them with industrial credit building and law enforcement. The credit information system, while exposing and preventing financial risks, promoting the deepening of China’s financial sector and improving the international competitiveness of China’s financial sector, contributes to the improvement of the social credit environment and the healthy development of economy. BIS Review 79/2008 1 
Today the National Credit Information Education Month is kicked off in Beijing. We hope the event is the just the beginning of credit knowledge dissemination and the improvement of credit awareness. The PBC will continue to support and actively engage itself in the building of a credit system in Beijing so as to push forward the reform and development of Beijing’s financial sector. This event takes the theme of “Keep good credit records and enjoy a happy life”. If you want to know more about credit information, how to build good credit records and etc., you are welcome to join our activities in the Education Month. I wish the Education Month a complete success. 2 BIS Review 79/2008 
Durmuş Y lmaz: Recent developments in international markets and their impact on the Turkish economy Keynote address by Mr Durmuş Yılmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at the Euromoney Turkey Finance & Investment Forum, Istanbul, 18 June 2008. *      *      * Dear Guests, I am delighted to be here to address such a distinguished audience in Istanbul. I hope this timely and important Forum will contribute much to debates about future growth prospects of Turkey, through exploring many prominent issues. Let me begin with recent developments in international markets and their impacts on the Turkish economy. As you may all know, both developed and emerging countries have been suffering from higher inflation and lower growth rates for a while. There are two main reasons behind this undesirable economic situation. One is the turbulence that emerged in the second half of 2007 in financial markets; and the other one is the continuously increasing global commodity prices. The second half of 2007 was not an easy period for central bankers – and 2008 is likely to be even more challenging. There is an apparent acceleration in consumer prices inflation all over the world and the annual inflation even in developed countries is at its highest level of the last 16 years. Improvement in the wealth of big developing countries such as China and India has created a demand-driven pressure on commodity prices. Moreover, the utilization of foodstuff in the bio-fuels production combined with the unfavorable weather conditions last year has led to further increases in commodity prices. Despite economic slowdown expectations in developed countries, the surge in commodity prices has continued in 2008 and the oil prices reached USD 140 per barrel. On the other hand, the sub-prime mortgage crisis that has started in the U.S. in mid 2007 has grown to a level that threatens the stability of financial system in many countries. The growth expectations were scaled back significantly. The turbulence might also have negative implications on the Turkish economy. Nevertheless, economic indicators show that the Turkish economy’s resistant to fluctuations in global markets has increased substantially, compared to the previous episodes of turbulences. The current relative resilience is an outcome of the successfully and decisively implemented macroeconomic policies since 2001 together with comprehensive structural reforms. Still, we are facing challenges now. The year-on-year consumer price inflation climbed to double-digit levels in May and it will probably remain high till the last quarter of this year and then decline gradually. Moreover, the growth rate of the GDP stood at 4.5% in 2007, as compared to 2001-2006 period, which was 7.2% on the average. Dear Guests, Turkey has several comparative advantages compared to many of its counterparts that can support high growth rates in the medium term. The first one is the demographic structure. Turkey has a young and skilled population that is one of the most important ingredients of economic growth. More than half of Turkey’s population is under the age of 30. However, unemployment rate for the young population stands at 21.2%. In order to unleash our potential, we need to keep investments at high levels and utilize human capital effectively. Since domestic savings rate in Turkey is not high enough to finance investments, we need to attract foreign savings, which implies having BIS Review 79/2008 1 
current account deficit. But the good news is that the quality of financing has improved significantly in recent years. The FDI inflows were more than USD 20 billion in each of the last two years. Nevertheless, I should say that ratio of greenfield FDI to the total FDI is relatively low yet. I believe that the greenfield FDI will also increase in the following years as we keep the macroeconomic and political stability in place and continue to improve the business environment. The second comparative advantage that I would like to underline is the convergence story of Turkey to European Union. Steps taken during the negotiation process will undoubtedly increase the momentum of Turkey and help unlock the growth potential of the country. European Union membership is our medium-term anchor and all parties in Turkey should adhere to this aim decisively. Dear Guests, The best way that a central bank could support sustainable growth is reaching and maintaining price stability, especially in a country that experienced high and chronic inflation for decades. As you may know, Turkey has adopted the full-fledged inflation-targeting regime in 2006. Looking back, one can notice that a protracted period of rising food and energy prices have led to a significant over shooting of the inflation targets since the adoption of the inflation targeting regime. This has increased the stickiness in inflation expectations, as economic agents have become more backward looking. Under normal conditions, supply shocks are expected to alter relative prices rather than the underlying inflation trend. Nevertheless, the fact that several long lasting shocks appeared concurrently has increased the risks to the price setting behavior. Our revised projections incorporating the latest developments suggest that it will take a relatively long time for inflation to reach 4 percent level. Even more importantly, current inflation target no longer seems to serve as a nominal anchor in the short term. Inflation targeting regime is one of the monetary policy regimes and all regimes have their own rules and frameworks. Our main policy document published in December 2005 describes the framework of our inflation-targeting regime. 24th paragraph of that document states that: “A pre-announced inflation target shall only be changed in the event that very sharp and long-term deviations from the target are expected or medium-term targets no longer make sense due to factors beyond the control of monetary policy. At this point, a new target will be set with the government with respect to the Law.” The paragraph that I have just read completely defines the recent conditions and explains why we revised the inflation targets for 2009 and 2010. Under these conditions, a revision in inflation targets has become a technical necessity. Therefore, the Central Bank of Turkey proposed the government to revise the targets for 2009 and 2010 to 7.5 and 6.5 percent, respectively; and to set the target for 2011 at 5.5 percent, and the government accepted our proposal. I would like to re-emphasize that, we will not treat the revised targets symmetrically. Monetary policy will aim to keep inflation below the revised target path. Dear Guests, We stick to our price stability objective. At the same time, we are aware of challenges we have to face. First of all, the rapid rise in food prices may be more permanent than expected due to rapid economic growth, slowdown in agricultural productivity and employment shift from agriculture to industries. Considering the fact that food has a higher share in the consumption basket of developing economies, including Turkey, this would lead to a decoupling in inflation rates between industrialized world and developing countries for years to come. 2 BIS Review 79/2008 
Similarly, commodity prices may remain elevated for the foreseeable future, which may prove to be a challenge for Turkey in particular. Note that Turkey is a net commodity importer in contrast to many other developing countries. Last, but not least, price stability necessitates stability in financial markets. We need to put our house in order to attract foreign capital with long-term horizon, rather than highly mobile short-term capital. I believe structural reforms together with macroeconomic stability, fiscal discipline and prudent monetary policies will create the necessary economic environment to achieve and maintain sustainable growth rates and price stability in the future. Thank you. BIS Review 79/2008 3 
Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell: European financial integration and harmonisation Speech by Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the International Bankers’ Club, Luxembourg, 16 June 2008. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Carlo Thill and the Board of Directors of the International Bankers’ Club Luxembourg for having invited me to speak on this occasion today. I am very glad to be here and to share my views with such distinguished audience of the International Bankers’ Club Luxembourg, who has always shown a strong interest in European Union matters.  In my speech today I will focus on the need for European financial integration and harmonisation, and on the ECB’s endeavours to support these objectives, in particular through two important central banking services: TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities.  Let me say that it is always a pleasure to be in Luxembourg, a country whose historic and strategic importance dates back to its founding as a Roman era fortress site, a country that represents the junction between Roman Europe and Germanic Europe, uniting customs drawn from each of these rather distinct traditions.  Luxembourg has proved to be a pioneer. It was a founding member of the European Union, the United Nations, and participated in the EMU from its first day in 1999.  The evolution of the city as a significant financial centre has strengthened its character as an international metropolis. As Jean Monnet said: "the small city has become a cross-road of Europe".  I see Luxembourg as a microcosm of the Europe of tomorrow and I sincerely hope that its success, with the highest GDP per capita in the world, will inspire other parts of Europe. In that respect, my topic of creating a single European financial market is very relevant since it will help to increase economic growth and prosperity in every member state. It will increase consumer choice, open a multitude of new investment opportunities, strengthen the EU banking sector and make Europe a centre for financial innovation.  I am sure you share this ambition – but the question – of course – arises how we can make it happen? Well, as the proverb says: “where there’s a will there's a way”. That means, we all have to be determined to undergo the necessary changes that will lead to an integrated and harmonized European financial market. That seems the only “way” to go! Let me be clear. The single European financial market requires our support if it does not emerge by itself. Integration and harmonization are intended to promote economic well-being as increasingly integrated financial markets that ignore national boundaries broaden the geographic domain in which financial institutions and their customers make decisions. Competition now has an inescapable global dimension, even for many small businesses.  Ladies and gentlemen, I do not have to explain to you neither the benefits of intense competition, nor the risks to those who do not adapt. We in the Eurosystem want to support the private sector’s adaptation and success by promoting integration and harmonization of the financial system. Both of these enable the realisation of economies scales; they foster competition and the expansion of markets, and facilitate a more efficient allocation of better-priced capital.  As you may recall, the European financial integration objective was addressed in detail in Lisbon in March 2000, where EU leaders adopted a ten-year programme (the Lisbon BIS Review 78/2008 1 
Agenda). The Financial Services Action Plan consists of a set of 42 measures, designed to strengthen the European financial industry by encouraging free market access, competition and the creation of more efficient markets.  Some of these measures took the shape of EU law, either as a Regulation or as a Directive, such as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and the Collateral Directive. These have undoubtedly liberated competitive forces, with positive results for Europe. Other initiatives were allocated to the users of markets. In particular, providers of securities market infrastructure have adopted, with encouragement from Commissioner Mr McCreevey, the Code of Conduct, in which they commit to meet certain standards in the areas of price transparency, open access and interoperability, and service unbundling. While there has been some progress, the jury is still out on whether providers will co-operate enough to achieve the high levels of interoperability required for an integrated infrastructure.  As Alexander Schaub from the European Commission said several years ago in Dublin, “financial integration is not simply a question of turning up and declaring the single market open for business”.1 We need to accelerate the harmonization, or removal, of issues which are barriers to cross-border business – such as market practices, discriminatory provisions and domestic protectionist barriers – so that what is now cross-border business in Europe becomes truly domestic. Indeed, we have already helped, in various ways, in the removal of the barriers to efficient and competitive markets identified by the Giovannini Group, for example by providing advice to the European Commission on regulatory aspects that need to be addressed. Let me now turn to TARGET2, the new RTGS system for the settlement in real time of predominantly high-value euro payments in central bank money as a perfect example of the ECB’s contribution to more integrated and harmonized financial markets. TARGET2 provides a single integrated platform to replace 20 decentralized technical TARGET platforms. It has been working very well from its start and provides the core, integrated and borderless infrastructure that Europe needs. To give you a flavour of the scale of its service, in the first week after completing final migration TARGET2 processed 1.72 million payments amounting to a total of 16.5 trillion euro.  TARGET2 is a practical example of a successful delivery by the Eurosystem and banks, working together, of integrated infrastructure which embodies the process of harmonization. I also wish to congratulate the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg and the Luxembourguise banking community on this occasion for their remarkable contribution and excellent preparatory work, and for helping to pioneer the migration to the new system in November last year.  I would like to turn now to another large integration project – namely TARGET2 for Securities, or T2S, as it is commonly known.  In contrast with the current fragmented scenario, T2S will deliver a single technical platform to provide very secure and real time delivery versus payment for all classes of European securities against central bank money, replacing dozens of local platforms. This will create a single pool of securities, available to market users and service providers through their chosen CSD. With T2S, the concept of cross-border settlement in Europe will disappear.  T2S will integrate the security settlement infrastructure as well as embody harmonization in important areas such as common interfaces, common set of rules for intra-day settlement finality, a common daily timetable, and common messages. These features are an immediate contribution to the elimination of 6 of the 15 so-called Giovannini barriers.                                                   1  Alexander Schaub- European Commission: “Removing regulatory barriers to international finance: Pointers from the EU single market”. Dublin, 30th March. 2 BIS Review 78/2008 
This will – of course – create substantial gains for the financial sector, but also for the society as a whole, through a reduction in costs and a better allocation of resources. There is no doubt that the economic gains will be substantial. T2S will contribute to increasing competition, more transparent pricing facilitating overall the trading activity. Since T2S will be operated by a public entity, the Eurosystem, T2S can be relied on to operate in a fair way and on a not for profit basis. Furthermore, more from a central banker’s perspective, more effective post trading structures – as achieved by T2S – will contribute to global resilience of financial markets and hence constitutes an important element to safeguard financial stability. Moreover, T2S will contribute to lower cost of capital, hence contributing to the general growth in financial markets and overall economic growth. Let me add that post trading costs in the US are at much lower levels than in Europe. Therefore, we need to make Europe more competitive in the global financial market, and T2S is an important contribution in this regard.  Thanks to efforts made by hundreds of experts from over 80 European institutions and from the Eurosystem over the last year, the Governing Council of the ECB has been able in the last few weeks to invite the European CSDs to express their support for T2S.  We distributed to the European CSDs detailed user requirements, an economic impact analysis, a description of governance for the next project phase, and a presentation on harmonization efforts in the context of T2S, which are all the outcome of a transparent and constructive consultation process, cooperating with CSDs and market users.  Let me just point to a few elements of the economic impact study which you can also find on our website. The analysis concludes that the costs of settlement can reduced substantially from 73 cents a CSD charges on average today to 32 cents per transaction under T2S. These costs can be even further reduced if more CSDs decide to join the T2S project. These numbers represent only the narrow business case and do not capture – of course – the full dynamic impact of T2S arising from enhanced competition in a single market for security settlement. Let me stress that while one can be skeptical about the precise numbers I just mentioned, but we should definitely not be skeptical about the overall benefits of a more competitive and more integrated European financial market.  T2S has been developed in a pure harmonization spirit which excludes – of course – specific functionalities supporting local practices. This does not mean that T2S prevents CSDs from supporting local practices; it will however give those concerned – including legislators and regulators – an opportunity to consider whether their preservation is in the long term interests of the relevant economy.  We have worked with the T2S stakeholders to identify topics that can be further harmonized in the future. These topics fall into three categories: further harmonization within the scope of T2S, harmonization to be implemented by the private sector or harmonization that they may require action by the public authorities.  It is clear that the Eurosystem will promote and implement all the issues that can be directly harmonized within T2S.  As regards the private sector, we expect that the market transformation induced by T2S will offer market participants to develop and implement their own harmonization initiatives, for example in the field of corporate actions. The Eurosystem welcomes very much all such efforts towards harmonization and stands ready to give all the support needed. As regards harmonization to be carried out by the public authorities, this would fall under the responsibility of the European Commission bodies and working groups, such as CESAME, the Legal Certainty Group (LCG) and the Fiscal Compliance Experts Group FISCO. Working with the industry leaders and experts on the T2S Advisory Group, we, the ECB and the Eurosystem will advise and cooperate with such bodies, with a firm eye on the need for progress. To focus our own effort, we intend to present a progress report on the achieved degree of harmonization to the ECB’s Governing Council by early 2009. BIS Review 78/2008 3 
Overall, integration and harmonization have become a core objective of the European Union; the European bodies are determined to support the European financial industry to increase competitiveness by giving it access to an efficient, state of the art financial infrastructure supporting a true single market.  The Eurosystem is ready to firmly commit to deliver T2S as a state-of-the-art settlement system to the market via the CSDs by 2013 at the latest. It is also clear, that the Eurosystem cannot do it alone. As substantial financial investments will need to be made for building T2S, so we need the support and the commitment of the CSDs.  We have asked all European CSDs to express – by 4 July – their support for the T2S project. We are sure that CSDs will consult their clients and other stakeholders, many of whom have already expressed strong support, often also in public. The Governing Council will take into account this feedback when it meets on 17th July to decide if the Eurosystem will further support the T2S project.  As President Trichet has said on many occasions “it is not, in any respect, time for complacency”. While we can be pleased to have got so far so fast, we need to keep up a fast pace. We are ready to start the next phase of the project immediately after the – hopefully – positive decision of the Governing Council in order to meet the next milestone: defining the next level of the detail in the form of the general functional specification. This will make it possible for T2S to be live no later than 2013.  Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Eurosystem, let me conclude by thanking the distinguished representatives of the banking sector for their contribution to the successful completion of the work done so far, and by asking for your continued support and co-operation. Thank you very much. 4 BIS Review 78/2008 
Anselmo L S Teng: Risk and compensation management Opening remarks by Mr Anselmo L S Teng, Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Macao, at the Macau Management Association (MMA) 2008 Annual Management Conference, Macao, 14 June 2008. *      *      * Council Chairman Lau Distinguished Guests Dear Delegates Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning! 1. I am honoured to be invited by the Macau Management Association to make an opening remark in this conference, the theme of which, “Navigating Complex Changes through Corporate Strategies”, is most timely and relevant, especially when organizations, big and small, are facing a lot of threats and challenges, both internal and external, under a globalised environment nowadays. As you are aware, the business definition for corporate strategy is the direction an organization takes with the objective of achieving business success in the long term. I’ll use the sub-prime fallout as an example to illustrate two important aspects within corporate strategies, i.e. risk related aspects and human resources related aspects. 2. The turbulence of the international financial markets caused by the subprime fallout will probably linger for another 1-2 years. The rescue actions adopted by central banks of the developed economies have prevented a major financial calamity from happening but the impact on global economy and financial markets will remain for quite a while. There is no exact figure for overall subprime losses. The estimates made by financial experts and international institutions range from USD400 billion to USD1 trillion. The losses will be borne by financial institutions and individual investors. The investors who have suffered losses will inevitably cut back investment and perhaps consumption. The losses incurred by financial institutions of the developed economies however have inflicted more serious repercussions. The immediate effect is the overall shrinkage in liquidity in the international financial markets. The most devastating impact is the reduction in lending capacity of financial institutions as the write-off and provision of delinquent loans and/or investments directly eat into the shareholders’ fund of a financial institution. 3. After the subprime crisis, financial experts around the world have started to find out the reasons why it happened and proposed ways to prevent similar mistake from happening again. There are a lot of findings but they all boil down to a big topic – “risk management”. In the past few years, financial and technological innovations have given rise to a number of subprime related products coming from financial institutions. These included subprime loans, collateralized debt obligations (CDO), structured investment vehicles (SIV) and other exotic financial products. As a matter of fact, a large number of risk management tools such as risk management models, ratings, credit default swaps (CDS) did emerge in the subprime cycle. But unfortunately fallout still occurred which in essence reflected inadequate risk management. Financial post mortem analysis has suggested that financial institutions who have suffered seriously from subprime fallout have failed to mitigate a number of risks, such as market risk, liquidity risk, concentration risk and counter party risk etc. That is to say, the corporate strategy in so far as risk mitigation is concerned was incomplete, untimely and was not commensurate with its business BIS Review 78/2008 1 
profile and development. As financial institutions, or organizations with different business nature, offer more sophisticated products and services in order to achieve business success, there will be more associated risks in their on-going risk management framework. This is particularly true as they grow in size and complexity, and their ability to identify, define, measure, manage, and organize to manage their risks; and how to reflect all those elements as appropriate in the corporate strategy is of utmost importance. 4. Besides risk management, however, there is also one aspect which can apply to management of virtually all trades. The human resources part of corporate strategies relates to the management coherent to an organization’s most valued assets – the people working there who individually and collectively contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the business. The goal of human resources management strategy is to help an organization to meet strategic goal by attracting, and maintaining employees and also to manage them effectively. In practice, human resources management incorporates a vast number of issues which include, but not confined to, recruitment, workforce planning, orientation, skill, training and last, but not the least, compensation. We have to admit that compensation, amongst other motivating factors, is the most effective driving force behind a person’s desire to perform in the workplace. There have been many papers written on the most appropriate compensation scheme. One of the many schools of thought is the performance related pay which is money paid to someone relating to how well he or she performs. Car salesmen, real estate agents, production line workers, for example, may be paid in this way, or through commission. This compensation scheme is based on the belief that money was the main incentive for increased productivity. This scheme cannot be applied universally as it has its own limitations although it has been widely adopted in a number of fields and proven to be successful. The tool however is a double edged knife and the financial sector has vindicated such a conviction. 5. One of the causes of the subprime bubble is the pay structure adopted by financial institutions in launching subprime products. During the subprime cycle, most financial institutions pursued a compensation scheme which gave incentives to all personnel involved in the subprime products to chase after high income through risky trading, launching risky products that generally provided higher rates of return. Bonus payments for successful and senior investment bankers, including those in the business holding subprime positions, were very substantial. Essentially, bonuses were measured against gross revenue after personnel costs, with no formal account taken of the quality or sustainability of those earnings. We have to admit that greed is part of our human nature. In the face of profit, quality of product and hence the revenue derived therefrom could be compromised. The phenomenon was common among institutions and staff involved in the subprime trade, from top management, originators, agents to traders. 6. All enterprises, not confined to financial institutions, should learn from this lesson that, to maintain the sustainable growth of an entity, all compensation schemes should in future adequately reflect performance in the medium and long term as well. As a matter of fact, the compensation schemes for staff involved in the subprime bubble all had a common feature in that there were enormous rewards for deals but there was also a failure to impose penalty symmetrically when losses occurred. To put it in a nutshell, a viable compensation scheme should be well structured and be geared to the long term corporate target and strategy rather than short term profit. 2 BIS Review 78/2008 
7. I hope my opening remarks on risk management and compensation management will kick off a series of discussions on management of other facets of business. Experts and seasoned practitioners from different trades are going to share with us their views, experience and insights to resonate with today’s theme “Navigating Complex Challenges through Corporate Strategies”. I am sure the conclusions of this Conference will enable the attendees to formulate the correct corporate strategies to navigate through uncharted waters of the contemporary global economy. Finally, please accept my best wishes for a huge success of this visionary conference. Thank you. BIS Review 78/2008 3 
Nout Wellink: The significant role of microfinance and supervisory issues Speech by Dr Nout Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the ING Microfinance Seminar “A billion to gain – the next phase”, Amsterdam, 16 June 2008. *      *      * Introduction 1. I am pleased to be joining you today and to be speaking to so many microfinance experts. Before starting I would like to commend the conference organisers for putting together such a comprehensive programme on this important topic. Microfinance is becoming ever more relevant, and there can therefore be no doubt that we need to keep it on our agendas. Today, I want to touch upon two issues. I will start with the significant and increasing role of microfinance to combat poverty in the world. This role cannot be called “micro” anymore. Then, I will discuss some supervisory issues that follow from the microfinance concept. Microfinance is booming 2. To start off with: microfinance is booming! It all started in the 1970s with the Nobel price laureate Mohamed Yunus, who was the first to experiment with the provision of very small –or micro- loans to people in Bangladesh. He then founded the famous Grameen bank. And nowadays, it cannot be denied that microfinance has successfully enabled extremely impoverished people, especially women, to engage in self-employment projects. These people were previously considered unbankable, as they typically do not meet even minimal qualifications to gain access to traditional credit, such as steady employment or a verifiable credit history. Microfinance allows them to generate income and to begin to build wealth and ultimately exit poverty. The term microfinance is generally used for the provision of financial services, in most cases micro-loans, to the poor, and many people have begun to realise its opportunities. Indeed, the concept of microfinance has been accepted as an effective means to reach out to the poor. And this conviction is not just confined to charitable institutions, but can beyond doubt be called a worldwide drive. Microfinance institutions have notably expanded their loan portfolios. Data from The Microfinance Information Exchange show that over the period 2001-2006, the number of micro credit borrowers each year increased on average by 19%. Over the same time period, the average loan portfolio grew by an annual 30%. This is huge. For comparison, in the EU-25, the average loan portfolio growth reaches a mere 6.4%. By the end of 2006, globally more than 1100 MFIs were active, comprising over 59 million borrowers. Also savings accounts surge, totalling 16 billion US dollars in 2006 and 68 million savers. 3. Meanwhile, also private organisations and investors have found their way to microfinance and microfinance institutions, and devote ample resources to them. Although exact figures are not available, it has been estimated that in 2006 worldwide $ 4 to 5 billion was invested in microfinance institutions. Especially investors with a long-term perspective, such as pension funds, consider microfinance an attractive investment. This is no wonder: usually returns are in line with market averages, while risks are relatively low. Moreover, microfinance shows a low correlation with international financial markets and hence provides diversification benefits. 4. And on top of this, as we can see here today, microfinance starts to attract increasing interest from commercial banks, including ING. One element evidencing this interest is the financial support provided by way of loans to or investments in microfinance institutions. But in my opinion, a second element is far more important: namely the sharing of expertise in BIS Review 78/2008 1 
banking business and the provision of assistance and training. Enhanced cooperation between existing financial institutions and microfinance institutions contributes to the development of local financial markets. For example, commercial banks may help microfinance institutions expand their portfolios with saving services, varied loan products and insurance, while microfinance institutions in turn may facilitate the development of commercial banks’ customer base. Furthermore, microfinance institutions may build upon the existing IT and risk management infrastructure of commercial banks. 5. Another reason for the remarkable growth of the microfinance sector is that new technological developments are quickly being picked up. Recently, I came across an internet organisation set up to enable private individuals to lend money to poor people in developing countries. The creditors can actually see and choose the persons to whom they lend. The money is transferred to the person via a local microfinance institution. Another innovative feature of this concept is that the loan providers receive regular updates on the borrower. This brings the benefits of microfinance really at your doorstep! And look, for instance, at the telecommunication industry. Rapid innovations have made it possible to conduct your banking operations via mobile phone. For banks, it offers the opportunity to transmit loan applications and check credit details instantly. For microfinance, this means a real breakthrough. As you know, a core problem for microfinance institutions is the geographically wide dispersion of their client base. This makes it difficult to serve clients in very remote areas and drives up expenditures. Operational costs can be as high as 15 to 20% of loans, compared to less than 5% for banks in industrialised countries. The introduction of mobile phone banking now makes it possible to reach millions of people, in a fraction of a second and without the high costs of establishing an extensive network of offices. Such cost savings are important for microfinance institutions, as they allow them to reduce interest rate margins while not impairing profitability. 6. These positive figures are truly good news. As a central banker, I care for economic growth and the reliable functioning of financial markets. And microfinance clearly contributes to these goals. For one, microfinance stimulates households to start business activities. Access to credit allows poor people to take advantage of economic opportunities, thus contributing to local economic development and job creation. Second, microfinance fills a gap in the traditional financial infrastructure, which did not provide for lending to the poor. Indeed, broad access to financial services is a key characteristic of a deep and efficient financial system. It is encouraging to see that the market is now taking over the role which was previously only performed by governments or NGOs. And third, more and more microfinance institutions have become real financial intermediaries and now also offer deposit facilities to households. As such, microfinance can help households to smoothen their consumption over time, reducing saving and borrowing constraints. Such constraints are particularly relevant for poor households because their incomes are often uncertain and they generally lack collateral. At the same time, deposits form an additional funding base for microfinance institutions and decrease their dependency on external funding. In these ways, microfinance enhances economic growth, enriches financial markets and increases welfare of individual households. Role for the prudential supervisor 7. But this is only one reason for my interest in microfinance. The other one follows from my role as prudential supervisor. This brings me to the second remark I want to make today. So far, the growth of microfinance has, by and large, occurred outside a regulatory framework. But as a depositor, you expect your bank to be safe and not to take undue risk, so that you can retrieve your money at all times. If the bank accepts too much risk, it may no longer be able to meet its obligations to depositors. Therefore, in most countries, only licensed banks are allowed to attract deposits from the public. Licensed banks are subject to prudential supervision and have to comply with an extensive and strict set of regulations. The prudential supervisor requires banks, for example, to have in place an effective risk management 2 BIS Review 78/2008 
system to screen, price and manage risks. For microfinance institutions, the protection of depositors is especially important. If a microfinance institution runs into trouble and cannot repay its depositors, this will affect a very large group of people who do not have the buffers to cushion such a loss. The effects of such a failure on individual borrowers´ and their families´ lives can be disastrous. 8. The need for depositor protection is underlined by the finding that the quality of the micro credit portfolio may deteriorate very rapidly. If some debtors are unable to repay their loans, this may induce other debtors to default on their loans as well. This perverse incentive may be especially strong in the case of credit provided to a group of persons. Furthermore, micro credit risks are usually more correlated than those of a traditional bank, since the loan portfolio generally consists of a relatively homogenous group of people who depend on the regional economy. Also, as costs are generally higher microfinance institutions may have smaller financial buffers. At the same time, in many cases it will be difficult for the microfinance institution to raise additional capital on short notice. For deposit-taking microfinance institutions, prudential supervision is hence of high relevance. 9. Though most agree that prudential supervision of microfinance institutions is needed, it is not yet clear what this supervision actually should comprise. Compliance with prudential rules can be costly to supervised entities and may be especially burdensome for microfinance institutions. Under circumstances, supervision may even stifle such a valuable and booming sector as microfinance. In devising a supervisory framework for microfinance activities, we therefore have to take the unique characteristics of microfinance into account. Most conspicuous of these characteristics is perhaps the lack of physical collateral. Other characteristics specific to microfinance institutions that need to be taken into account are a quick turnover rate, high operational costs and a different lending process. Also know-your-customer requirements are burdensome, as many poor people do not have a passport or other proof of identity. 10. We also need to be mindful of the large differences between microfinance activities and microfinance institutions from one country to another. For instance in Brazil, a popular form of microfinance is the use of correspondent banking, or in other terms “branchless banking”. Due to the sheer size of this country, commercial banks are only located in the main cities and did not or could not offer financial services to people in distinct villages until 1999. With the lifting of several regulations in that year, commercial banks were allowed to set up relationships with non-financial and non-bank firms to provide a wider range of services. Many banks contracted local chains, for instance grocery stores, pharmacies, etc., which were allowed to handle simple banking operations on behalf of the financial institution. However, the financial institution itself is the ultimate provider of financial services and remains responsible in the end. In India, in the 1999s, microfinance evolved quite successfully through so-called Self Help Groups. In these groups, 10 to 20 persons pool savings, collectively obtain loans and lend to each other. And in Bolivia, the most successful microfinance institution was incorporated as a commercial bank in 1992. 11. But despite these differences, microfinance supervision should not and cannot be a complete divergent regime. A different supervisory framework for microfinance activities carries the risk of unbalancing the international level playing field. Moreover, many banking standards already offer flexibility to allow for the level of complexity and size of institutions, the level of risks or the existence of international activities. And all the same, supervision of microfinance institutions need not be harmful per se. Adequate supervision may also enhance the perceived legitimacy of microfinance institutions and improve their operational management, due to for instance the higher standards for reporting and financial control. This may broaden their access to funding, allowing them to expand their financial activities and serving more clients. Furthermore, there may exist a positive relationship between the development of supervisory guidance for microfinance activities and for supervision in general. So taking all this together, we should search for a tailor-made solution within the scope of existing regulation. BIS Review 78/2008 3 
12. One such solution can be found in the Basel Core Principles. To support supervisors worldwide in building and improving a set of prudential regulations, the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision has developed this set of minimum standards for sound supervision. The Core Principles provide a benchmark for a wide range of supervisory aspects, in areas such as licensing, capital adequacy, risk management, and more. In total there are 25 Principles. But, I stress, these are principles, not rules, and require further specification. The Basel Committee considers that many of these Principles would also be appropriate for non-bank financial institutions that offer deposit and lending services similar to those provided by banks. But the Committee also recognizes that some of these categories of institutions may be regulated differently from banks as long as they do not hold, collectively, a significant proportion of deposits in a financial system. However, they need some form of regulation commensurate to the type and size of their transactions. How should we tailor regulation to the unique characteristics of microfinance activities? The Basel Committee is currently working on illustrating what forms regulation can take, keeping in mind the diversity of the sector. That is why this effort is a collective one, and why the Committee works together with supervisors from all over the world in the Committee’s International Liaison Group, as well as the IMF, the World Bank, CGAP and regional groups of banking supervisors. Concluding remarks 13. Ladies and gentlemen, I will conclude. Microfinance is booming. It is now widely acknowledged as an effective way to reach out to the poor. And, as I said in the beginning, this belief is not just confined to charitable institutions, but felt the world over. Still, the current market size forms only a small part of the estimated global demand for microfinance services. As such, the broadening of financial services offered by microfinance institutions, specifically the deposit-taking facilities offered by many microfinance institutions, is a welcome development. In parallel with this, the role of the prudential supervisor will become ever more relevant. Prudential supervision can contribute to inclusive financial systems by taking account of the specific characteristics of microfinance while not disturbing the international level playing field. The efforts of the Basel International Liaison Group will be an important step forward in this regard. Furthermore, adequate supervision may enhance the perceived legitimacy of microfinance institutions, improve their operational management and extend their access to funding. In this way, microfinance not only contributes to the economic development of a country, but also enriches the financial system and financial supervision. So maybe, rather than “A billion to gain”, it’s a question of “Billions to gain”! Thank you. 4 BIS Review 78/2008 
Ben S Bernanke: Challenges for health-care reform Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Senate Finance Committee Health Reform Summit, Washington DC, 16 June 2008. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * Improving the performance of our health-care system is without a doubt one of the most important challenges that our nation faces. In recent decades, improvements in medical knowledge and standards of care have allowed people to live healthier, longer, and more productive lives. New medical technologies and treatments promise more and better to come. From a social point of view, we hope as many people as possible benefit from these advances. But health care is not only a scientific and social issue; it is an economic issue as well. The decisions we make about health-care reform will affect many aspects of our economy, including the pace of economic growth, wages and living standards, and government budgets, to name a few.  By any measure, the health-care sector represents a major segment of our economy. Spending on health-care services currently exceeds 15 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Indeed, health-care spending is the single largest component of personal consumption – larger than spending on either housing or food. Importantly, health care also has long been, and continues to be, one of the fastest-growing sectors in the economy: Over the past four decades, this sector has grown, on average, at a rate of about 2-1/2 percentage points faster than the GDP. Should this rate of growth continue, health spending would exceed 22 percent of GDP by 2020 and reach almost 30 percent of GDP by 2030.1Health-related spending is also a large and growing share of government budgets. Last year, health care accounted for about one-quarter of total federal spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that, under current policies, health spending will account for almost one-half of all federal non-interest outlays by 2050.2As the public interest in these issues testifies, the stakes associated with health-care reform, both economic and social, are very high. But we must keep in mind that, for all its problems, the U.S. health-care system also has many strengths. We must take care that we do not lose what is good about our system as we try to address the significant concerns that certainly exist. In the remainder of my remarks, I will discuss three key challenges for health-care reform. These challenges are, in short, the issues of access, quality, and cost.  Challenges for health-care reform Access Access to health care is the first major challenge that health-care reform must address. In 2006, a total of 47 million Americans, or almost 16 percent of the population, lacked health insurance. Although the federal and state governments spent more than $35 billion to finance uncompensated care in 2004, the evidence nonetheless indicates that uninsured persons                                                  1  Congressional Budget Office (2007). 2  Ibid. BIS Review 78/2008 1 
receive less health care than those who are insured and that their health suffers as a consequence. Per capita expenditures on health care for uninsured individuals are, on average, roughly half those for fully insured individuals.3 People who are uninsured are less likely to receive preventive and screening services, less likely to receive appropriate care to manage chronic illnesses, and more likely to die prematurely from cancer – largely because they tend to be diagnosed when the disease is more advanced.4 One recent study found that uninsured victims of automobile accidents receive 20 percent less treatment in hospitals and are 37 percent more likely to die of their injuries than those who are insured.5  Quality The second key challenge is improving the quality of health care. The quality of medical research, training, and technology in the United States is generally very high. However, the quality of health care is determined not only by, say, technological advances in preventing and treating disease but also by our ability to deliver the benefits of those advances to patients. For maximum impact, advances in medical knowledge must be widely disseminated and consistently and efficiently implemented. But evidence suggests a disturbing gap between the quality of health services that can be provided in principle and the quality of health services that actually are provided in practice. For example, in 2000, the Institute of Medicine issued a landmark report that concluded that up to 98,000 Americans died each year in hospitals as a result of medical errors.6 Many of the errors identified by the report – for example, errors caused by adverse drug events, improper transfusions, wrong-site surgery, and mistaken patient identity – could have been prevented if hospitals had adopted appropriate safety systems. Although hospitals have implemented a number of new safety practices since the time of that report, the scope for improving patient safety remains large.7Inconsistent use of best practices by doctors and hospitals is also surprisingly widespread. For example, numerous studies have pointed to the lack of adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of heart attacks. In particular, it has long been well established that restoring blood flow to the heart and using aspirin, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors at the appropriate times significantly reduce deaths resulting from heart attacks.8 Yet studies show that the dissemination of these treatments occurred only slowly.9 More widespread application of evidence-based medicine could help health-care workers make better use of the medical knowledge they already have to improve patients' outcomes.  Although some patients do not receive the care they need, others receive more (and more expensive) care than necessary. Research on geographic variation in health-care practices and costs confirms this point. For example, Medicare expenditures per eligible recipient vary widely across regions, yet areas with the highest expenditures do not appear to have better health outcomes than those with the lowest expenditures; indeed, the reverse seems to be true.10                                                 3  Hadley and Holohan (2004). 4  Institute of Medicine (2002). 5  Doyle (2005). 6  Institute of Medicine (2000). 7  Leape and Berwick (2005). 8  Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors are drugs that relieve stress on the heart. 9  Joint Commission (2007). 10  Skinner, Staiger, and Fischer (2006). 2 BIS Review 78/2008 
Cost This observation brings me to a third important challenge for health-care reform: controlling costs. The problem here is not only the current level of health-care spending (U.S. spending exceeds that of most other industrial countries) but, to an even greater degree, the continued rapid growth of that spending. Per capita health-care spending in the United States has increased at a faster rate than per capita income for a number of decades. Should that trend continue, as many economists predict it will, the share of income devoted to paying for health care will rise relentlessly. A piece of wisdom attributed to the economist Herbert Stein holds that if something cannot go on forever, it will stop. At some point, health-care spending as a share of GDP will stop rising, but it is difficult to guess when that will be, and there is little sign of it yet. Although the high cost of health care is a frequently heard complaint, it is important to note that a substantial portion of the cost increases that we have seen in recent decades reflects improvements in both the quality and quantity of care delivered rather than higher costs of delivering a given level of care. Notably, new technologies, despite greatly adding to cost in many cases, have also yielded significant benefits in the form of better health. People put great value on their health, and it is not surprising that, as our society becomes wealthier, we would choose to spend more on health-care services. Indeed, although quantifying the economic value of improved health and greater expected longevity is difficult, most researchers who have undertaken an exercise of this type find that, on average, the health benefits of new technologies and other advances have significantly exceed the economic costs.11That said, the evidence also suggests that the cost of health care in the United States is greater than necessary to allow us to achieve the levels of health and longevity we now enjoy. I have already mentioned research that finds large regional differences in the cost of treating a given condition, with high-cost areas showing no better results. The slow diffusion of the use of aspirin and beta blockers for treating heart-attack patients shows that cheap, effective treatments are not always used, potentially leading to higher costs and worse outcomes. Moreover, because insurance companies and the government play such prominent roles in financing health care, patients and doctors have far less incentive to consider the extra costs of optional tests or treatments. But, as we all know, although testing and treatment decisions may be undertaken on the presumption that "someone else will pay," the public eventually pays for all these costs, either through higher insurance premiums or higher taxes. The effects of high health-care costs on government budgets deserve special note. In the United States, a large and growing portion of both federal and state expenditures is for subsidized health insurance. In 1975, federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid was about 6 percent of total non-interest federal spending. Today, that share is about 23 percent. Because of rising costs of health care and the aging of the population, the CBO projects that, without reform, Medicare and Medicaid will be about 35 percent of non-interest federal spending in 2025.12 This trend implies increasingly difficult tradeoffs for legislators and taxpayers, as higher government spending on health-care spending will, of necessity, require reductions in other government programs, higher taxes, or larger budget deficits.  Rapid increases in health spending also portend increasingly difficult access to health services for people with lower incomes.13 As health spending continues to outpace income,                                                  11  Cutler and McClellan (2001). 12  CBO (2007). 13  For the purposes of this speech, "low income" means those in the bottom 20th percentile of the income distribution. BIS Review 78/2008 3 
health insurance and out-of-pocket payments will become increasingly unaffordable.14 One way that society has addressed this problem in the past has been to expand government subsidies for health spending. The Medicare Part D program, which assists seniors with the costs of prescription drugs, is an example. However, to continue limiting the effects of rising medical costs on household budgets, the government may have to absorb an increasing proportion of the nation's total bill for health care, putting even greater pressure on government budgets than official projections suggest. Taking on these challenges will be daunting. Because our health-care system is so complex, the challenges so diverse, and our knowledge so incomplete, we should not expect a single set of reforms to address all concerns. Rather, an eclectic approach will probably be needed. In particular, we may need to first address the problems that seem more easily managed rather than waiting for a solution that will address all problems at once. Thinking about solutions In health-care reform, it is certainly easier to pose questions than to provide answers. Moreover, even putting aside the scope and technical complexities of the problems we face, the types of reforms we choose will depend importantly on value judgments and the tradeoffs made among social objectives. Such choices are appropriately left to the public and their elected representatives. Consequently, I will have little to say here regarding specific proposals. However, I will suggest a few questions and considerations that those seeking reform might wish to keep in mind. Regarding access, one important consideration is that people who are uninsured are not all alike. They include people who have low incomes, people who may not be poor but have costly pre-existing health conditions, those whose employers do not offer group health insurance and who cannot afford to buy insurance in the more-expensive nongroup market, and people who are eligible for Medicaid or other programs but for some reason have not enrolled. Some people who can afford health insurance do not purchase it, presumably because they do not anticipate having significant medical expenses. Broadening access to health care may thus require us to consider a mix of policies. The following are some of the questions with which we will have to wrestle. First, should enrollment in a health insurance program be mandated, or at least strongly encouraged, for example, through tax incentives? Supporters argue that mandates lead to better risk pooling and prevent those who could afford insurance but choose not to buy it from "free-riding" on the public safety net. Opponents argue that mandates infringe on what should be an individual choice and may require a substantial government budgetary commitment to help those who cannot afford insurance on their own to meet the mandate. Second, should we continue to rely on employer-provided health insurance as the key element of our system? The employees of large companies in particular typically constitute a good risk-sharing pool, allowing insurance to be provided at a lower overall cost. But the dominance of the insurance market by employer-provided plans means that the market for individual and small-group policies is underdeveloped and that the cost of such coverage is very high. Employer-based systems also reduce the portability of health insurance between jobs, which reduces labor mobility and the efficiency of the labor market as well as creating a burden for those changing jobs. Third, to help people with costly pre-existing conditions, should we impose requirements on insurance companies to accept all applicants and mandate the conditions that must be                                                  14  For example, a recent study estimated that, without increases in the share of health spending that is publicly financed, the budget share of health spending for low-income elderly households would increase from about 25 percent of their income today to about 35 percent by 2040 (Follette and Sheiner, 2007). 4 BIS Review 78/2008 
covered? Doing so would help some people obtain coverage, but the resulting increases in insurance premiums might exclude others. An alternative approach would be to promote bare-bones, high-deductible policies that are affordable and attractive to healthy people while offering government help to those who need coverage for costly conditions. Finally, to what extent are we willing to use public funds to reduce the number of those who are uninsured, for example, by providing subsidies to low-income people not covered by Medicaid or to people, such as the self-employed, who find it difficult to obtain affordable coverage in the non-group market? How would we finance additional spending? For instance, would we consider limiting the employers' tax exemption for the cost of employee health insurance? The issue of access to health care, though difficult politically, is in some sense the technically least complex of the three challenges I have identified; it is mostly about financing, and possibly regulation, rather than about medicine. Of course, access to health care is closely entwined with the other issues, notably the issue of cost. In particular, restraining the growth of health-care costs would increase the number of people who can afford insurance coverage. On the second challenge, improving the quality of health care, a number of private and public initiatives have been undertaken in recent years. These include programs to monitor hospitals' performance in ensuring patient safety and adherence to best practices; greater efforts to identify and disseminate best practices, as determined from clinical trials; and public and private initiatives to increase the use of information technology in health care. Researchers are also examining how the structure of health-care delivery systems affects the quality of care. For example, some evidence suggests that vertically integrated systems like that of the Veterans Administration are quicker to adopt health information technology and have been more successful in applying it. Some instances of initiatives that aim to encourage quality through financial incentives or disincentives – so-called pay-for-performance – have begun to emerge. Examples include accreditation practices that require hospitals to comply with established standards and best practices, and the recent decision that Medicare will not cover costs caused by certain medical errors.  Efforts to improve the quality of health care are a vital component of comprehensive reform and are likely to yield high social returns. Additional research and experimentation can help us address difficult questions such as how best to measure quality and cost-effectiveness in health-care delivery and how to give doctors and hospitals incentives to adopt best practices and improved information technologies.  The solutions we choose for access and quality will interact in important ways with the third critical issue – the issue of cost. Greater access to health care will improve health outcomes, but it almost certainly will raise financial costs. Increasing the quality of health care, although highly desirable, could also result in higher total health-care spending. For example, increased patient screening may avoid more serious problems and thus be cost-saving, but it could also identify problems that might otherwise have gone untreated – a good outcome, certainly, but one that increases overall spending. These are certainly not arguments against increasing access or improving quality. My point is only that improving access and quality may increase rather than reduce total costs. From the economist's perspective, the question of whether we are spending too much on health care cannot ultimately be answered by looking at total expenditures relative to GDP or the federal budget. Rather, the question, whatever we spend, is whether we are getting our money's worth. In general, good information and appropriate incentives are necessary to allocate resources efficiently. In health care, the necessary information should include not only the clinical effectiveness of certain tests or courses of treatment but also their cost-effectiveness. As the regional comparison of health-care costs illustrates, cost-effective approaches may be at least as useful as more costly approaches in delivering good health outcomes.  BIS Review 78/2008 5 
Knowledge of the costs of alternative approaches is likely to be insufficient by itself. Patients, doctors, and hospitals must also be given incentives for choosing cost-effective approaches. However, the questions of how to structure incentives and monitor performance are hotly debated. For example, advocates of "consumer-driven" health care argue that, given appropriate information and incentives, patients – or in some cases, private insurers acting on their behalf – can effectively impose at least some degree of market discipline on health-care providers. Others see an inevitable role for government in setting standards of care and in measuring performance. Professional associations, hospitals, medical researchers, and other stakeholders may also have a role to play. At the heart of the debate are the fundamental social questions of how we determine when various medical services are worth their cost and how we measure and reward good performance by providers. Rising health spending increases stress on both private and public budgets, and thus stakeholders in both spheres are aiming to reduce costs. Cost-saving reforms in the private sector will inevitably reverberate in the public sector and vice versa. For example, the shift toward managed care in the private sector also resulted in more managed care in the public sector. Similarly, innovations in public insurance programs, such as the introduction of reimbursement by diagnosis-related groups in Medicare, changed the way private insurance payments were structured.15 Our health-care system is, de facto, a private-public partnership; as a result, governments should not view health-care costs narrowly as a budgetary issue. Rather, they should consider how the totality of government intervention in the health-care market – including tax policies, insurance regulation, and the structure of Medicare and Medicaid – affect the sector as a whole. The best way to reduce the fiscal burdens of health care is to deliver cost-effective health care throughout the entire system. Conclusion Let me conclude by restating a point I made at the beginning: As we focus on the problems of our health system, it is easy to forget that much is good about it. Our health system has produced innovations in basic science, in the understanding and diagnosing of disease, and in pharmacology and medical technology. These advances have resulted in more-effective treatments and significant reductions in mortality across a wide spectrum of diseases. In devising policies to reform our health-care system, we must take care to maintain the vitality and spirit of innovation that has been its hallmark.  References Congressional Budget Office (2007).

Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: Supervision and central banking – improving the exchange of information Remarks by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Workshop “Financial turmoil and missing risks: new challenges for bankers and regulators”, Milan, 12 June 2008. *      *      * 1.  Introduction1Ladies and gentlemen, It is an honour and a pleasure for me to speak today at this event. As the title of the session indicates, this is a time when both bankers and authorities need to think hard about the lessons to be drawn from the financial market turmoil, and even challenge conventional wisdom if necessary. In the last few years, the relationship between supervision and central banking has evolved. Following the example of the UK, supervisory responsibilities have been allocated in some countries to independent authorities, separate from the central bank. In other countries, such as the Netherlands, prudential supervision of all financial institutions has been fully integrated in the central bank. I do not want to repeat here all the arguments for or against the separation of supervision from central banking (they have been thoughtfully analysed by Charles Goodhart and Donato Masciandaro, among others). But I do recall that the ECB took a position in 2001 on the fundamental role of central banks in prudential supervision, stressing the importance of confidential supervisory information in the conduct of central banking functions.2  The recent financial market turmoil has confirmed the importance of a smooth and efficient relationship between the central banking and supervisory functions; it has also led to a debate about a reform of the current supervisory structure in some countries such as the UK and the US. The report by the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) entitled “Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience” presented to the G7 last April includes a number of policy recommendations to help prevent any recurrence of financial stresses similar to the ones experienced during the current turmoil. Among its many recommendations, the FSF refers to the need for supervisory authorities and central banks to improve cooperation and their exchanges of information. It calls in particular for such exchanges to be rapid during periods of market strain.  Today, I will focus my remarks on why supervisory information is relevant for central banks in general, and for the ECB in particular, in three core central banking functions: monetary policy, liquidity policy and financial stability assessment. I will consider each of these in turn. 2.  Monetary policy Let me start by considering the usefulness of supervisory information in the conduct of monetary policy. I will analyse, in particular, two points. First, the possible role of supervisory information to gain a better understanding of the behaviour of monetary and credit aggregates. Second, the potential usefulness of such information in understanding banks’                                                  1  The views expressed are those of the author. I thank C. Kok Sørensen, C. Beuve, C. Ohlerich, S. Kerjean, N. Valckx and F. Recine for their input into the preparation of these remarks. 2  See ECB, “Recent developments in supervisory structures in the EU and acceding countries”, October 2006, available on the ECB's website.

lending behaviour, the transmission of monetary policy through the banking system and financing conditions for households and firms. Since its inception, the European Central Bank has regularly utilised a wide array of banking data in its monetary analysis. The data are mainly based on the aggregate balance sheet statistics of euro area monetary and financial institutions (MFI) collected and compiled by the ECB/Eurosystem. Another important source of information on the situation of the euro area banking sector compiled by the Eurosystem is the quarterly Bank Lending Survey, which provides qualitative information about changes in banks’ credit standards and loan demand, and describes the factors contributing to these changes.  Supervisory information is used to a limited extent. Let me make four general points about the usefulness of supervisory information in monetary policy decision-making. First, the ECB strongly encourages the ongoing efforts conducted under the aegis of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) to achieve greater convergence in supervisory reporting by banks across the EU; second, supervisory data, by providing information about the distribution of key balance sheet and profit ratios across different groups of banks, can point to developments in specific areas of the economy not detectable by aggregate statistics; third, access to bank level-based supervisory data would allow central banks to more clearly identify empirical regularities and to better understand the interrelation between the various factors affecting and driving banks’ activities; fourth, and finally, I would like to stress the mutual benefits arising from an enhanced dialogue between banks, supervisors and central banks. From a monetary policy perspective, a more direct interaction with banks and supervisors would clearly enhance the scope of analysis and decision-making by giving the central banks a better feeling (in real time) for the underlying drivers of monetary and credit developments.  As you will surely know, the ECB’s monetary analysis consists of extracting information about the risks to price stability from the analysis of developments in the monetary aggregates and their counterparts, in particular credit to the private sector, and it does so by exploiting the long-run link between money and prices. The Eurosystem MFI balance sheet statistics were designed with the monetary analysis in mind, and hence fulfil most of the requirements for conducting such an analysis. However, in some cases, supervisory information, such as that embedded in the so-called COREP (“Common Solvency Ratio Reporting”) and FINREP (“Financial Reporting”) templates, which bring together harmonised information about solvency ratios and other financial statement data of EU banks, could add substantial value to the analysis. In particular, supervisory-based information provides a more detailed breakdown of bank asset and liabilities than in the MFI balance sheet statistics, thus making it easier to interpret monetary and credit aggregates. For example, supervisory information on banks’ securitisation activities can help to improve the analysis of credit developments by avoiding the bias that would be incurred by not including assets transferred from the banks’ balance sheets. In addition, having access to supervisory information about the distribution across banks of key bank ratios, such as the capital position or write-downs and losses, would help to detect whether certain groups of banks (catering to specific types of borrowers) are more or less likely to cut back (or increase) their lending, in particular following changes in policy rates. The need to understand the reasons for the recent strong corporate loan growth is a clear example of how a regular dialogue with banks and their supervisors might contribute to improving the monetary analysis of the ECB. Indeed, supervisory information might lead to a better understanding of the relative importance of pre-committed credit lines and the precautionary nature of recent corporate lending. Hence, in certain cases supervisory information can help to improve the analysis of “special factors” influencing money and credit demand.  The value of supervisory data on the euro area banking sector can arguably be even greater with respect to the ECB’s economic analysis. Consider the various channels through which banks may affect the way in which monetary policy actions are transmitted to the real side of the economy. In the euro area, banks are the major source of financing for firms and 2 BIS Review 77/2008 
households. The extent to which banks adjust their lending and the pricing of loans in response to monetary policy actions influences the various channels through which monetary policy affects the economy.  One transmission channel affected by bank behaviour is the degree and speed with which banks pass on changes in policy rates. Banks tend to adjust their lending rates only sluggishly in response to changes in monetary policy rates.3 The stickiness of bank rates hinges among other things on financial structures and competition within the banking sector as well as on competition from market-based sources, including securitisation.4 Supervisory information on banking activities, such as the use of credit transfer instruments and the relative importance of assets and liabilities held for trading, can be useful in enhancing this analysis. Another transmission channel often cited in the literature which has received increasing attention over the past two decades is the credit channel. Owing to informational asymmetries and principal-agent problems between banks and their borrowers, monetary policy may impact on the supply of loans. This can happen through the narrow or broad credit channel.5 In the narrow credit channel, a monetary policy tightening may mean that some banks face balance sheet constraints, such as lower liquidity or capital holdings, and hence they may choose to restrain lending. Supervisory information about the health of the banking system can provide valuable input to any assessment of potential loan supply constraints. This analysis would be based on data on solvency and liquidity ratios, capital buffers, securitisation and credit risk transfer instruments. Whereas, for example, the Eurosystem Bank Lending Survey provides input into disentangling loan supply and demand effects, and thus helps to identify relevant supply-side effects, the survey remains qualitative in nature. Supervisory information based on a direct dialogue between the banks and supervisors can provide more enlightening evidence on these issues. This type of information may prove particularly relevant in times of turbulence. In the broad credit channel, monetary policy influences the creditworthiness of bank borrowers, for example, through changes in asset and hence collateral values, leading to a change in their external financing premium. This, in turn, may induce banks to alter their supply of loans to these borrowers. Supervisory information that could bear on these questions and that cannot be derived from either MFI balance sheet statistics or market-based sources are the extent to which banks hold collateralised exposures and the size of their exposures to the small and medium sized enterprises.  All in all, while stressing that information currently available to the ECB/Eurosystem provides a very good basis for the economic and monetary analyses, the quality of the assessment of economic and monetary developments could in certain areas be further improved by accessing supervisory information. This would be particularly beneficial in times of bank distress. In particular, access to euro area-wide bank-level data is a key element in understanding empirical regularities and in projecting developments in monetary and credit aggregates. Research in the US has shown that bank supervisory information can help the central bank in forecasting macroeconomic variables and in guiding monetary policy.6                                                  3  For the US, see e.g. Hannan and Berger (1991), Berger and Udell (1992), Mester and Saunders (1995), Berlin and Mester (1999).

Likewise, research based on euro area banks has illustrated the usefulness of supervisory information in exploring the links between macroeconomic developments, monetary policy and the banking sector.7 For example, drawing on individual bank data on variables such as the risk characteristics of loans, non-performing loan ratios, solvency ratios and other measures of bank distress, many studies find a relationship between monetary policy actions and banks’ risk-taking and lending behaviour. Importantly, bank-level supervisory data would also make it possible to detect whether such relationships differ across banks of different type and size.  3. Liquidity policy  I will now examine why supervisory information is important in assessing the credit risk (e.g. quality of collateral) that the central bank faces, especially in times of financial turbulence. Let me start by stating a general principle: to be effective, monetary policy implementation has to lie on sound financial institutions. If financial institutions are not sound, it will be harder to evaluate not only their demand for central bank money, but also the risks in supplying it to them. In the euro area, the main demand for central bank money is imposed by the Eurosystem on banks via reserve requirements, which need to be fulfilled by commercial banks on average over a so-called maintenance period, i.e. on a monthly basis. The ECB supplies the amount of central bank money that enables banks to smoothly fulfil their reserve requirements. Through its operations, the Eurosystem provides liquidity to a large group of banks, which then redistribute the liquidity to other institutions across the euro area. This is why, according to our procedures,8 counterparties for Eurosystem monetary policy operations must fulfil certain eligibility criteria. First and foremost, counterparties must be financially sound. Therefore, up-to-date and constant supervisory information is absolutely critical in order to identify any distortion in the smooth functioning of the money markets, which then may impair monetary policy implementation. Indeed, the eligibility of our counterparties is under constant review. Such information has been crucial especially since the start of the financial turmoil. It allows us to identify the root causes of the tensions in money markets and to choose the appropriate remedies. As you know, substantial changes have affected the size, the composition and the funding of the asset side of banks’ balance sheets since August 2007. The size of banks’ balance sheets has increased because banks have had to retain assets initially intended for securitisation or sale and because they have had to transfer the underlying assets from their off-balance sheet vehicles back into their balance sheets. The sources of funding have also changed since securitisation has stopped and the repo market for non-government bonds has dried up. As a result, banks have raised their liquidity buffers by reducing their funding maturity gaps and by applying larger liquidity shocks as stress scenarios. As a result, banks have hoarded cash and cut back on their lending activities by reducing their counterparty limits and the range of collateral accepted for their repo operations. This type of behaviour is based on information asymmetry, namely the fact that one counterpart (the borrower) has more or better information on its own creditworthiness than the other counterpart (the lender) owing to the lack of transparency about the true valuation of its own assets. In a way, banks try to protect themselves against the dangers of increased adverse selection, i.e. a high probability of selecting the most risky counterpart.                                                   7  For a few examples, see e.g. Quagliariello (2006, 2007); Jimenez, Ongena, Peydro and Saurina (2007); Jimenez and Saurina (2005); and De Graeve, Kick and Koetter (2008). 8  See General Documentation attached to the Guideline of the ECB on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem (available at www.ecb.europa.eu). 4 BIS Review 77/2008 
On top of that, the traditional group of investors, suppliers of liquidity for the banking sector, have altered their investment strategies. There is some evidence that money market funds and central banks (in the management of their foreign reserves) have shifted their investments from the banking system to safe-haven assets like Treasury bills or overnight repo transactions. These developments and frictions have inhibited a smooth distribution of liquidity through the inter-bank market, leading to a segmentation of the euro cash money market. This segmentation has led to a dramatic widening of the spreads between the unsecured (Euribor) and secured (OIS) markets. Against this background, a number of banks feel that they must secure their bids at the Eurosystem’s tender operations in order to get the liquidity they need from the Eurosystem, whom they see as the (almost) unique provider of euro liquidity. They are thus ready to bid very aggressively, in particular if they are “excluded” from the inter-bank and repo markets. In addition, banks have been very eager to pledge assets as collateral with us for which the private repo market continues to be at a standstill.  The ECB normally collects this type of information through its Money Market Contact Group and in bilateral contacts with bank treasurers. Supervisory information could provide useful additional information, particularly on any change in banks’ funding conditions. Since mid-March, banks have shown their ability to enhance their balance sheets by raising capital, issuing long-term debt and selling portfolios of leveraged loans. At the end of May, USD 276 billion of capital had been raised by banks, which may be compared with the approximately USD 387 billion of write-downs and losses that had already been announced. This type of news, combined with the various actions taken by central banks, has contributed to a recovery in the prices of risky assets.  Overall, supervisory information would be an important input into the ECB’s efforts to ensuring an effective implementation of monetary policy. It has proven to be particularly crucial during the turmoil. Looking ahead, cooperation between supervisors and bodies responsible for monetary policy implementation could be enhanced through a more frequent transmission of information related to the composition and the funding of the balance sheets of financial institutions (like the change in the so-called funding gaps). 4.  Financial stability assessment  I turn now to assess to what extent supervisory information may help the financial stability monitoring and assessment conducted by central banks, including the ECB. The ECB has in fact developed this activity in line with the Treaty, which stipulates that the ESCB “shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system” (Art. 105.5).9With respect to financial stability, I will address two questions. First, what precise information do we need for carrying out our financial stability assessment function? Second, what would we do with this information, if we had it? The ECB regularly monitors the stability of the financial system – comprising financial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures – in the euro area and has published since December 2004 its assessment every six months in its Financial Stability Review. The Review draws attention to the main sources of risk and vulnerabilities, and assesses whether the euro area financial system is capable of withstanding shocks and disruptions which are severe enough to significantly impair its intermediation function.  This periodic assessment is based on information stemming from manifold sources, including of supervisory nature. In particular, regular aggregate information on the solvency and                                                  9  This provision is replicated in Art. 3.3. of the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank. BIS Review 77/2008 5 
profitability of the banking sector as well as ad hoc information on specific exposures of the banking sector are collected by the ECB in cooperation with the Banking Supervision Committee. There is certainly room for enhancing the access to supervisory information for the ECB’s financial stability assessment. In normal times, a wider access – in terms of the timeliness and frequency of information on banks’ exposures and risk concentrations – would improve the identification of potential risks to the stability of the euro area financial system as well as the assessment of the potential impact on the system of the possible materialisation of the identified risks. As Fed Chairman Bernanke recently said: “For risks to financial stability to be successfully managed, they must first be identified and measured. Recent developments have revealed deficiencies in this respect”. Before the outbreak of the market turmoil in mid-2007, conventional wisdom held that banks had successfully removed credit risk from their balance sheets, thanks to financial innovations such as mortgage-backed securities, collateralised debt obligations and the use of structured investment vehicles (SIVs). Relatively little was known about the role and activities of SIVs and the exact nature of their relationship with banks. One could argue that, if more in-depth supervisory information had been available on these aspects, central banks, including the ECB, could have seen that banks’ credit risk transfer to SIVs and investors was in many cases incomplete and that banks remained liable for SIVs’ liabilities. Of course, it’s easy to say this with hindsight but we should now learn from this experience.  In a situation of financial stress, supervisory information remains essential is the central bank financial stability assessment is to be effective. However, the nature of each financial stress is likely to differ from the previous ones. Therefore, the information needs have to be identified on a case-by-case basis. In the context of the current turmoil, a key supervisory information is that on bank direct exposures to the US sub-prime sector and to structured financial products as well as to the effects of write-downs on banks’ capital position.  Overall, a wide access by central banks, including the ECB, to supervisory information would render their financial stability assessment more effective both to monitor and prevent financial stresses. At the same time, the outcome of the central banks’ financial stability assessment can be of use to supervisory authorities, for instance, by helping them focus their monitoring activity on certain categories of risk. This is the rationale behind the specific FSF recommendation which I mentioned at the beginning, namely, to enhance the interplay between central banks and supervisory authorities.  5.  Legal and institutional aspects Coming closer to the end of my remarks, let me now turn to institutional arrangements.  The task of contributing to the smooth conduct of supervisory policies, mentioned in Art. 105.5 of the EU Treaty, was given to the ESCB on several grounds. Central banks have a large body of inside knowledge which may help in the exercise of prudential supervision, and measures to counter financial market fragility may, on the other hand, have monetary aspects which should be discussed by central banks.10 Moreover, information held by the ESCB, for instance, in the context of its role in the oversight of payment systems may be of great use for supervisory authorities. Payment systems oversight and prudential supervision focus on avoiding systemic risks and safeguarding the soundness of financial institutions. At the same time, it should be stressed that the flow of information from (instead of to) the supervisory authorities and a mutually fruitful cooperation between supervisory authorities and central banks are crucial, with the latter being entrusted with a contributory task in the field of macro-prudential supervision.11 The ECB has pointed out in various opinions that                                                  10  See R. Smits, The European Central Bank, Institutional aspects (Kluwer International, 2000), p.340. 11  R. Smits (Ibid), p.342. 6 BIS Review 77/2008 
“central bank access to prudential information and cooperation between financial supervisory authorities and central banks are essential for the conduct of macro-prudential monitoring, the oversight of payment systems and the safeguarding of other market infrastructures, which are in turn essential for the smooth conduct of monetary policy”. If we examine closely the current EU legal framework applicable to the exchange of information between central banks and supervisory authorities, we note that the EU Treaty is “asymmetric” since it does not contain any provisions requiring the banking supervisory authorities to contribute to the performance of the tasks under the responsibility of the ECB or the ESCB, in the same way that the ECB and the ESCB contribute to the smooth functioning of supervisory policies. This may have historical roots: the national supervisory authorities, unlike the ECB or the ESCB, are not Community law bodies and do not have a European mandate enshrined in the Treaty. However, this entails some limitation in the ability of the ECB and the ESCB to perform their tasks. One has to take into account a series of facts that make this problem less acute. First, a number of central banks in the euro area perform supervisory functions and therefore have easy access to supervisory information. Second, European secondary legislation, namely a number of Community directives applicable to the financial sector – and, for instance, the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) – addresses the issue of the cooperation and exchange of information at EU level between supervisory authorities themselves but also between banking supervisory authorities and central banks. The CRD identifies a number of exceptions or “gateways” through which Member States may authorise confidential information to be disclosed, in most cases subject to conditions of professional secrecy. This Directive provides in particular that exchange of information should be authorised between supervisory authorities and central banks in their capacity as monetary authorities. Third, in previous Opinions on draft national laws, the ECB has observed that virtually all Member States that have adopted supervisory models based on an independent financial supervisory authority have included provisions stipulating a duty of cooperation and authorising the exchange of information between central banks and supervisory authorities.12Against this backdrop, it is essential to eliminate all legislative obstacles that prevent supervisory authorities from providing information to the ECB and Eurosystem central banks on specific banking and financial institutions as well as to guarantee more generally a duty of cooperation between central banks and supervisory authorities, whose ultimate purpose is to put in place effective and practical arrangements for cooperation and information-sharing. This should be a priority in the European Union. The European Commission has recently launched a public consultation on possible targeted amendments to the CRD13 which includes aspects relating to cooperation and exchange of information between banking supervisory authorities and central banks. More specifically, the proposed amendments to the CRD include two new provisions. First, “ in an emergency situation, Member States shall allow competent authorities to communicate information to central banks in the EU when this information is relevant for the exercise of their respective statutory tasks, including the conduct of monetary policy, the oversight of payments and securities settlement systems, and the safeguarding of financial stability”. Second, the consolidating supervisor should alert the relevant central banks and communicate to them all information that is essential for the pursuance of their tasks should an emergency situation,                                                  12  See, for instance, the Opinion of the ECB of 5 November 2007 at the request of the Austrian Ministry of Finance on a draft law amending the Law on banking, the Law on savings banks, the Law on the Financial Market Supervisory Authority and the Law on the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (CON/2007/33), paragraph 2.4.1 or the Opinion of the ECB of 9 March 2006 at the request of the Polish Minister of Finance on a draft law on the supervision of financial institutions (CON/2006/15), paragraph 2.2.2. 13  European Commission, ‘Public consultation on possible changes to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD, consisting of Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC)’ (available at www.europa.eu). BIS Review 77/2008 7 
including adverse developments in financial markets, arise within a banking group which potentially jeopardises the stability of the financial system in any of the Member States where entities of the group are located. 6. Conclusions  In 2001 the Eurosystem highlighted the importance of the role played by central banks in supervision. The experience gained by central banks during the financial market turmoil confirms the fundamental appropriateness of the Eurosystem’s position, which is also shared across the Atlantic.  In the US, a discussion has already started on how to improve coordination between the various authorities and on how to put the Federal Reserve in a position to better contribute to financial market stability. Tim Geithner has recently called for more powers to be given to the Federal Reserve in the field of oversight.  In the European Union, the European Commission has launched initiatives to further reinforce the legal underpinnings for the cooperation and the exchange of information between supervisory authorities and central banks, and to build a consistent institutional framework for such an exchange. These initiatives are strongly supported by the ECB and should be implemented soon. Improving the institutional framework is necessary, but not sufficient. It has to be followed by an effective implementation of the provisions and the activation of the available channels of communication between supervisors and the central banks, including the ECB. A substantial amount of work is already underway. It is up to us to make sure that it is finalised in time to address any challenges that global financial markets may pose to stability.

Caleb M Fundanga: Growing investor confidence in Zambia’s economy Opening remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the Afreximbank/PTA Bank Financing Agreements Signing Ceremony, Lusaka, 10 June 2008. *      *      * • The President of AFREXIM Bank • The President of PTA Bank • Chief Executives and representatives of Financial Institutions Present • Distinguished ladies and gentlemen I am greatly honoured to be given an opportunity to make these brief remarks at this signing ceremony of two important financing agreements. I wish to extend a warm welcome to all of you gathered here today, particularly those who have travelled from outside the country. I hope that you will not only have a pleasant ceremony today but also have fruitful deliberations at the Euromoney Conferences starting tomorrow at this same venue. I also hope you will find time to explore the beautiful scenery and experience the warm hospitality that Zambia has to offer. Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, over the recent past, the Zambian economy has performed relatively well. This is reflected in the overall macroeconomic stability which has been underpinned by positive growth rates in real Gross Domestic Product, low inflation, relative stability in the exchange rate of the Kwacha against major currencies, stable financial sector and improved banking services. However, although incomes have generally increased, the challenge that still remains is that of meeting the basic needs of the majority of Zambians in order to uplift their living standards. This ceremony is therefore more than timely as the Government is working tirelessly towards empowering its citizens economically and at the same time increasingly diversifying the economy and promoting export led growth. It is for this reason, Mr President that the Government established the Citizen’s Economic Empowerment Fund under the Citizens Economic Empowerment Act of 2006 in order to promote empowerment of citizens in various economic activities. This signing ceremony is yet another indication of the growing investor confidence in Zambia’s economy. You will be glad to note that the country’s total investment pledges rose more than ten times over to US $1.9 billion in 2007 from US $115.6 million recorded in the year 2001. This is an indication of the vast investment potential and improving investor confidence due to the macroeconomic stability particularly lower inflation and the sound fiscal polices that the Government has put in place. Institutional capacity has also been enhanced with effective supervision of the financial system to promote efficient operations of the banking sector. Mr President, the mining sector continues to be the major economic activity in the country. Following the liberalisation of the sector and subsequent privatisation of the mines, Government has continued to facilitate mineral exploration by the private sector and created an attractive investment environment through the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. This has sustained renewed interest in mining, reflected in a complete rebound in the mining sector on the Copperbelt and North Western province start up of new mines. New projects such as the Konkola Deep Mine, Lumwana Mine and Nickel Mining in the Southern Province have come on board in addition to other mining initiatives going on in most provinces of the country. Another key development in the sector has been the revival of zinc production, once, one of Zambia’s metal exports in the 1970s. Sable Zinc of Kabwe (owned by Metorex) has commenced processing the mining dumps in Kabwe. Ladies and Gentlemen, although investment in the mining sector requires massive capital by large conglomerates, the majority of our citizens are increasingly involved in the sector BIS Review 77/2008 1 
through the supply of goods and services to support the mines. However, the main challenge to the growth of this sector has been the availability of finance. Most companies struggle to find finances to meet their contract obligations. The need for financing is immense especially as the mining sector is growing year on year and will need to acquire new equipment and spare parts as the mining companies invest heavily in the development of new mines. It is gratifying to know that the USD 50 million facility in favour of the Zambian Mining Services Companies being signed today, is expected to assist major players in the supplies and services sub-sector of the mining industry to execute contracts with mining companies. I am also reliably informed that the facility will allow eligible companies access financing by assigning receivables for execution of contracts such as extraction and transportation of waste materials, transportation of copper ore from the pits to the smelting plants and contract mining. I have no doubt that the facility will go a long way in supporting Zambian companies grow and actively participate in the economic development of the country. The Fund will not only augment the supply of goods and services to the mining sector but also introduce important institutions that are critically needed to ensure that the supply system in the sector is efficient and sustainable in the long run. The USD 80 million in favour of the Export Fund of Zambia has come at a time when the Government is increasingly promoting the diversification of the economy through export led growth. Strengthening of the external sector performance has continued as evidenced by an improved balance of payments position. This has been on account of higher foreign exchange inflows emanating from increased metal and non-traditional exports earnings coupled with investor confidence in the Zambian economy. The nontraditional exports have continued to record unprecedented growth over the past couple of years. For instance, NTEs rose by 63.4% to US $924.4 million in 2007 from US $564.7 million in 2005 with commodities, such as, sugar, copper wire and tobacco, coupled with receipts from tourism making notable contributions. The growth of this sector is expected to be further bolstered by the establishment of the Multi-Facility Economic Zones in Lusaka and Chambishi to further diversify the economy and promote trade, stimulate export activities, technology, skills transfer and job creation. In pursuing an export-led growth strategy, the economic zones would actively promote value addition in identified specific products, such as, copper, vegetables, tobacco, gemstones, cotton yarn, leather products, sugar and oil cakes, of which the country has a competitive advantage. For instance, there has been a large increase in tobacco production, which has led to increased export earnings. Unfortunately, much of the tobacco is exported in a raw form with very little treatment or processing in the country. Significant investments in plant and machinery for value-addition will therefore be needed to offset this scenario. Thus, with expected large investments in Economic Zones and Export Fund facilities like the one we are witnessing today, Zambia’s competitiveness through value addition is expected to improve. Mr President let me also commend all the institutions involved in the two syndicated loans. It is gratifying to note that these facilities have been made possible due to the partnerships between the local financial institutions and international ones. I commend such partnerships and challenge other local institutions to enter into similar arrangements to reduce the cost of borrowing and promote growth in Zambia. Congratulations should be extended to the Zambia National Commercial Bank, ALS Capital and Calag Capital, AFREXIM, PTA Bank and Loita Capital to name but a few for the initiative. The Bank of Zambia has continued to encourage local banks and other financial institutions to partner with international financial institutions and other banks in Africa, Europe and Asia. In this regard, in December 2007, the Bank organised a forum to exchange information on sources of finance in Lusaka. The forum was well attended and the international institutions showcased their products to their local counterparts. I am happy to note that institutions present here today such as Zambia National Commercial Bank, AFREXIM Bank, PTA Bank, ALS Capital and Loita Capital were all represented at the forum. I imagine that such fora are 2 BIS Review 77/2008 
instrumental in structuring tangible financing agreements like the ones we are witnessing today. Finally, I would, like to request all parties involved in the management of these facilities to ensure that the funds reach the intended beneficiaries and that controls are put in place to avoid abuse. The beneficiaries should also ensure that their projects are implemented effectively and expeditiously without any delay. In this regard, may I request the Zambian Mining Services Companies and the Export Fund of Zambia to take necessary measures in a timely manner to fulfill the requirements for declaring these loans effective and for starting implementation. I would like to wish all those involved success in their management of the funds and implementation of the projects so that we can ensure that the development impacts expected from these important initiatives become a reality for the intended beneficiaries and the country at large. I thank you for your attention. BIS Review 77/2008 3 
Glenn Stevens: Economic conditions Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia Business Luncheon, Melbourne, 13 June 2008. *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to address you in Melbourne today. I read that AmCham is the largest international chamber of commerce operating in Australia, and has been working to promote trade, investment and general business links between the United States and Australia since 1961. Over that period of nearly five decades, the US and Australia have enjoyed a mutually beneficial trade relationship, enshrined most recently in the Free Trade Agreement. During that time, a lot of other shifts have occurred, of significance to us both. In 1961, nearly a quarter of Australian exports went to the United Kingdom, our number one trading partner. Trade with China was of inconsequential size. Japan had become a prominent destination for exports by then, but would go on to become by far our largest trading partner by the end of that decade, due to the expansion in the mining sector. In 2007, the UK was number six as a destination. The US was number three (little changed from 40 years earlier). China equalled Japan in first place for two way trade, and will easily outstrip Japan this year. Of course, the United States is still far and away the largest economy in the world, and will remain so for quite a while. Nonetheless, the change in the trade experience of Australia – and we are hardly alone in that – is an indicator of the way the weight in the world economy is gradually shifting to the Asian region. On the financial front, in contrast, Asia remains in many respects underdeveloped, especially in terms of the prominence of its local-currency capital markets. US capital markets remain the largest, deepest and most influential, driving developments in stock, bond and money markets, and their various derivative offshoots, around the world. That contrast – the increasing economic weight of Asia and the continuing dominance of American behaviour in financial markets – is in many ways at the centre of the set of challenges facing Australia, and I suspect other countries, right now. Before coming to that, however, it is fitting to begin with some remarks about the US economy. I will then talk about the global economy more broadly, and particularly the effects of the US slowdown on the rest of the world before focusing particularly on Australia and the current challenges of economic management that we face. The United States economy As you well know, the US economy is struggling with a period of weakness at present. Growth has slowed to a very subdued pace, and confidence is well down. There continues to be debate as to whether or not what we are witnessing can be called a recession. In some respects, this is a rather silly preoccupation because there is no doubt that conditions are weak, and it is not worth spilling much ink over whether the growth rate is just above or just below zero. That said, the US economy has, thus far, done a little better than many people had feared. Of course the episode is not yet over; a period of adjustment still lies ahead. The epicentre of this adjustment is the housing sector, where deteriorating lending standards and a speculative boom in parts of the country a few years ago led to a build-up of excess physical stock and over-stretched borrowers. Subsequently, the need to work off this overhang has seen construction rates for new homes fall by half, and prices for established homes in many major cities decline for the first time in many years. Rising defaults and foreclosures are likely to dampen prices further. The non-recourse nature of mortgages in some US states is BIS Review 77/2008 1 
potentially a destabilising factor as well, since even people who can service a loan have an incentive to walk away once their equity falls to zero. Tighter credit conditions are a dampening factor for the US economy more generally, as lenders work to limit risk in order to repair their own balance sheets. So the real question is when the preconditions for a renewed expansion will come into place. It is perhaps a bit soon to conclude that we have reached that point. There are certainly some helpful dynamics at work: the worst fears of a serious financial collapse have abated somewhat over the past couple of months, the process of balance sheet repair for key institutions is well under way, macroeconomic policies have been put into expansionary mode and initiatives to offer some modest support to the housing market are in train. Considerable uncertainty, nonetheless, surrounds the outlook for the United States over the next year or so. The global economy What is the effect of this on the rest of the world? In a previous response to this question,1 I suggested that there are two key channels to consider. The first is trade spillovers, as the fall in US income means that the US demands less in the way of products from other countries. The decline in the US dollar also works in this direction. The second potential channel is financial contagion, with the possibility that other countries may experience the same financial dynamics as those which have been at work in the United States. My view was that this second channel was likely to be the more important one in this episode. The trade channel certainly is working – lower US demand is being felt in weaker exports to the United States from most parts of the world. But other forces are also at work, and the strength of some other regions has meant that many export-driven economies, certainly those in Asia, have continued to record quite solid growth into the early months of 2008. Some of these countries have also developed a good deal of momentum in domestic demand. So to date, trade per se has not been the major issue. But financial exposures to the problem assets were spread around the global system. Credit-related losses that have been disclosed by financial institutions around the world to date amount to something approaching US$400 billion, of which about half is in institutions domiciled outside the United States. More losses reside in entities outside the core financial system. So the pressure on balance sheets arising from the decline in credit standards in the middle of the current decade has extended beyond the US itself, at least to Europe and the UK. Given the integrated nature of financial markets in the developed world, moreover, pressure on term borrowing costs for banks has been seen in many places over the past nine months, even if in a less acute way than observed in the countries at the centre of the crisis. These forces are contractionary in nature, and so global growth is widely expected to be lower in 2008 than the very strong result in 2007. According to the IMF, global GDP growth will moderate to about 3¾ per cent in 2008 and 2009, with slowing concentrated among the developed economies of North America, Europe and Japan. This forecast embodies a mild US recession during 2008. But while this outcome for global growth would be well below the exceptional pace of about 5 per cent seen in 2006 and 2007, it is actually in line with the average rate of growth for the world economy over the past 15 years. And although the IMF suggested in April that the short-term risks surrounding this forecast were concentrated on the downside, with a 25 per cent chance of global recession (which it defines to be global growth at or below 3 per cent),                                                  1  ‘Economic Prospects in 2008: An Antipodean View’, January 2008 (available at http://www.rba.gov.au/Speeches/2008/sp_gov_190108.html). 2 BIS Review 77/2008 
recent developments do not suggest that those risks are any more likely to be realised than was the case a couple of months ago. To date, in fact, the financial developments that have so occupied the minds of developed world policy-makers have not been as big an issue for many countries in the emerging world, at least not those most important to Australia. Banks in those cases have not had serious funding problems, perhaps in part because their own exposures to the bad assets were minimal. Capital markets, which are less important as avenues of funding than in many developed economies, have not been a source of significant disruption. Admittedly, share markets in the emerging economies have declined noticeably, but credit expansion has continued unimpeded and, as I indicated a moment ago, economic growth appears to have remained pretty solid. In fact, around much of the emerging world at the moment, the bigger problem seems to be neither the near or actual recession of the United States, nor the credit crunch about which we hear so much in the discussion of the major countries, but inflation. From Asia to Latin America to Africa, as well as in many of the industrial countries, we are hearing a lot more about inflation now. Food price rises loom large in developing countries’ consumer basket, so the big rises in grain prices over the past year have been very prominent. Several potential drivers of these increases have been nominated. One is the change towards a more protein-intensive diet as developing countries’ incomes rise, which increases demand for grain to feed animals kept for meat. This is no doubt a factor, but it is a long run trend and there is no evidence that meat consumption has exploded just in the past year.2 Another is the diversion of some grains towards production of bio fuels, with up to half the increase in the consumption of some crops in 2006-2007 going to this source, thus constraining supply available for additional food production.3 But while this has played a role at the margins, supply disruptions have arguably been the most important cause of big price rises in the past year. In particular, supply has been disrupted by adverse weather conditions in key production areas, for example, the drought in Australia. To the extent that those effects are temporary, it could be expected that food prices will not continue to rise at the same pace.  Temporary supply factors may, at the margin, also have been at work in pushing up oil prices of late. In addition, the inflow of financial capital into energy derivatives markets as funds have expanded their asset universes to include commodities has been a source of demand. This seems to be what people have in mind when they suggest that oil prices have been subject to speculative pressure. But it is surely impossible to avoid the conclusion that most of the trend rise in oil prices over a number of years now has been due to rising demand by end users. Supply has risen too, in contrast to what occurred in the OPEC shocks of the 1970s, but it has struggled to keep pace and the cost of supplying the marginal unit has risen. The same can be said, moreover, about other resource commodities, including thermal and metallurgical coal and iron ore – commodities that are very important to Australia as a producer. Chinese demand for these resources to construct first-world standard cities has been extremely strong, and has accounted for a large share of the increase in demand over the past several years. Anyone who visits a Chinese city can see the results. Such visitors also tend, more often than not, to get a sense that this demand could continue, as a structural phenomenon, for quite a long time.                                                  2  Indeed, food demand in emerging economies began to increase strongly in the 1990s, long before the current run-up in prices, see IMF World Economic Outlook, October 2007 (available at: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/02/pdf/text.pdf). 3  See IMF World Economic Outlook, April 2008 (available at: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/01/pdf/text.pdf). BIS Review 77/2008 3 
At present, there is a strong sense of overheating in the Chinese economy. It would be even clearer in the statistics were it not for the administrative controls over many prices. As it is, China’s official CPI is rising at close to 8 per cent per annum. The effect of China on the rest of Asia, moreover, is expansionary. Coupled with fairly easy monetary policy settings in much of the region, which tends to occur in many emerging economies when US policy rates are very low because of the importance of exchange rate considerations to Asian policy-makers, this is likely to limit downside risks to growth in the short term. It does pose the risk, though, that inflation will continue to pick up. This is not confined to Asia, either: inflation pressures are evident in much of Latin America and South Africa, both regions where higher resource prices have delivered a terms of trade gain of substantial proportions. I would venture a guess, in fact, that the number of countries where inflation is the major problem greatly exceeds, at present, the number where the predominant concern is inadequate growth. It may be that the slowing in growth in train in the major countries will lead to energy prices and some other commodity prices moderating. On the other hand, the forecast moderation in global growth is taking it back only to about average pace. With the bulk of new demand for energy and resources coming from countries which are yet to show much sign of cyclical slowdown, and whose energy intensity of demand is continuing to increase secularly, any near-term softening in these prices might only be modest. Hence the fact that the low level of interest rates in the major countries results, de facto, in the setting of monetary conditions being pretty easy in many developing countries as well, is starting to raise warning flags among observers who can see inflation pressures already building. This could pose some quite difficult choices for policy-makers, particularly in the emerging world, over the next year. Longer term, of course, the likely ongoing growth in demand for energy by developing countries will surely pose major adjustment challenges for the rest of us. The Australian economy The external environment certainly poses some big, and very immediate, challenges for an Australian economy which has experienced a long expansion and largely used up its reserves of spare capacity. The forces at work from abroad pull in different directions, to an extent seen on few occasions in the past. On the one hand, the seriousness of the sub-prime credit crisis, and the associated weak outcomes being experienced in the US, and thought to be in prospect in the UK and some parts of Europe, are well understood by Australian households and businesses. The financial turmoil of the past nine months has also seen a market-driven tightening of financial conditions in addition to that which resulted from the tightening of monetary policy.  Combined, these developments are having a dampening effect on demand. Households have, over recent months, adopted a more cautious attitude to borrowing and spending, the evidence for which is a string of flat results for retail sales, and a significant decline in the flow of new loan approvals for housing. Credit approvals to businesses have also declined significantly. While this partly reflects the winding down of a process of rapid reintermediation that had been occurring as businesses turned to their banks and away from capital markets around the turn of the year, total business funding has slowed. In short, things are happening that suggest a moderation in growth in domestic demand is occurring, signs of which were beginning to appear in the national accounts data released last week. At this stage, inevitably, the extent and likely duration of the moderation remains uncertain. There is not much uncertainty, though, about the need for a moderation. Inflation increased over 2007, and in underlying terms reached the highest rate for 15 years or more. It is true that it was boosted by the international rise in oil and other commodity prices, but Australia’s inflation rate has risen more than most of those in our usual peer group when measured on a 4 BIS Review 77/2008 
comparable basis. It is also pretty clear that strong domestic factors were at work, with growth in local demand at a pace exceeding, by a large margin, any plausible estimate of the economy’s long-run potential growth rate for output, at a time when capacity was already tight. Had not the rise in the exchange rate occurred over the past couple of years, moreover, the Australian dollar prices of energy and other raw materials (as well as other tradeable goods and services) would be even higher.  So inflation has picked up, and needs, over time, to be reduced. Reductions of inflation usually require a period of slower demand growth, and this episode is no different. At the same time as we are seeking this moderation in domestic spending, the rise in resource prices that is occurring courtesy of strong demand abroad has complex effects on the Australian economy. Since Australians pay world prices for their petroleum products, the rising global oil price adds to costs for businesses and consumers. This is inflationary in its immediate impact, though it also acts as a brake on spending on other goods and services, unless people are prepared to reduce saving or borrow to sustain that other spending at previous levels. Other things equal, this brake dampens inflation impulses in those other areas.

But other things are not equal. Australians also receive higher incomes as a result of higher resource prices. As shareholders they experience higher profits. Employees in the resource sector, as well as in the construction sector or the various areas that supply goods and services to mining, are receiving larger pay packets. Governments are receiving higher revenue flows, which in some cases they will spend, at least in part. So in net terms, this terms of trade effect is expansionary. In the normal course of events, it would add more to demand than the higher commodity prices would take out. With the rises in bulk commodity prices taking effect now, Australia’s terms of trade will rise by about 20 per cent, on top of the very substantial lift that has occurred over the past several years. Since 2002, the total rise in the terms of trade will, by the end of this year, be of the order of 65–70 per cent. Some other countries are also experiencing significant terms of trade rises. But few will have seen anything bigger than Australia’s over a five-year period.  There is an obvious contrast with the United States, whose terms of trade have fallen by about 6 per cent over the same period, owing to the importance of energy imports to that country. The strongest contrast, though, is with countries such as Japan or Korea, which, unlike the US, have no significant resource endowments of their own. Turning back to Australia, the effect of the 65–70 per cent increase in the terms of trade over five years has been to lift the purchasing power of our GDP by around 13 per cent. In the terminology of the national accounts, this is the boost to real gross domestic income or real GDI. Of course, our resources sector has significant foreign ownership, so a significant part of the gains accrue to foreigners and the boost to the real income of Australian residents is not as large. Over 2008, the boost to real GDI is estimated at around 4 per cent, with the boost to national income somewhat less than this, but still substantial. The expansionary terms of trade shock occurring now obviously would have the potential, absent some other adjustment, to be seriously destabilising. By design, certain features of our macroeconomic policy framework help to handle the shock. A higher exchange rate plays a very valuable role in dampening the expansionary impact, lowering prices for traded goods and services and spilling some demand abroad. In the year ahead, the Government has said that the so-called “automatic stabilisers” in the Federal Budget, which refers to the feature that the tax system withdraws more income from the economy the faster it grows, will be allowed to operate, which is also helpful. It falls to monetary policy to play its proper restraining role as well, dampening private demand not only because inflation has already picked up, but seeking to head off further problems that could easily emerge given the expansionary effects of the terms of trade. This is why a tight monetary policy setting is essential. It is why the Reserve Bank has lifted interest rates, even as the Federal Reserve was reducing them. Not only does the overall pace of demand growth need to slow, but we are having to accept a change in its composition. There is a major process of investment going on, by businesses as well as by governments. Business investment is at very high levels relative to GDP, and businesses in aggregate say they intend to increase investment further next year. Governments at the State level intend a substantial infrastructure spend as well, though the experience of the current year is that they are having trouble implementing their plans because of the demands already being made on the engineering construction sector.  In most economies, it is usually not possible, and certainly not prudent, to try to have a consumption boom at the same time as an investment boom. Of course, Australia can and does access the savings of foreigners to fund additional investment – a process of running a current account deficit – so we do not have to finance the totality of the additional investment ourselves. This is something not unknown to the US economy either (in fact, it has been a common feature of most of the Anglophone market economies over the past decade). But even so, there are probably sensible limits here. Practically speaking, domestic consumption, together with housing demand, and some areas of business investment not 6 BIS Review 77/2008 
linked to the resource sector, is being asked to make some room, for some period of time, for the rise in other forms of investment that will sustain higher incomes and living standards in the future. Given that the economy is pretty fully employed, total investment levels are already high, the nation’s call on net capital inflow from abroad is over 6 per cent of our GDP and inflation is already 4 per cent, it is difficult to see any serious alternative to an adjustment of this nature.  To try to absorb the expansionary terms of trade impact without any macroeconomic policy restraint is not really an alternative at all. In such an inflationary scenario, I expect that we would still find that the resources sector and the parts and regions of the economy that benefit most directly from its flow-on effects would attract additional labour and capital, and become proportionately larger in the national economy over time. Other sectors and regions would, proportionately, still diminish in size. The process would simply be less efficient: the price signals for resource allocation that are pretty clear at present would be more difficult to detect under conditions of higher inflation. Indeed, that is one of the problems high inflation brings. This course would also leave the rest of the economy with the legacy of embedded high inflation, commensurately higher nominal interest rates and so on. That would be harmful for living standards over time. As such, allowing it to occur would be a policy mistake. Conclusion Both the United States and Australia face significant economic challenges. For the US, dealing with the fall-out of the financial excesses of the earlier years looms large at present. This is not made any easier by the simultaneous lift in global commodity prices, which raises consumer prices but, in the US, also dampens economic activity. For Australia, the financial fall-out has been less severe, mainly because participation in the earlier excesses was so much smaller, while the very large change in prices for mineral and energy resources is the most expansionary external shock to affect the economy for 50 years or more. It has occurred at a time when the productive capacity of the economy has already been stretched by the long expansion. Hence, the prospect of inflation has presented a larger and more immediate danger to us than it has, thus far, to the US. One way or another, the near term continues to present challenges on both sides of the Pacific, as the two respective economies adjust to the shocks hitting us. But both of these economies are pretty adaptable. There is no reason why, with sensible policy frameworks, competitive and innovative firms, and capable and industrious workforces, they should not continue to prosper over the long term.

Jürgen Stark: Lessons for central bankers from the history of the Phillips Curve Speech by Mr Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s Annual Economic Conference “Understanding Inflation and the Implications for Monetary Policy: A Phillips Curve Retrospective”, Chatham, Massachusetts, 11 June 2008. *      *      * It is a great pleasure for me to be here today at this conference.  I will try to look at the historical evolution of the Phillips curve and its interaction with macroeconomic outcomes from a slightly eccentric angle. Forty years ago it suddenly became very difficult even for navigated policymakers who had been raised in the revered intellectual tradition of monetary orthodoxy to resist the revolutionary notion of a stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Some rejected this notion – out of common sense and practical experience – and did it before scholars in universities could prove that it was theoretically fragile and empirically elusive.  I view this episode – in which honest civil servants were ahead of their times in rejecting faulty propositions – as highly symbolic. The episode is representative of the key but swinging and ambivalent relationship between cutting-edge economic research and long established central banking principles. At the end, I will submit few reflections on how that relationship ought to be governed in modern policy-making institutions and how the ECB – for its part – has insured against major policy failures that revolutionary ideas can inflict if applied untested.  1.  The evolution of the Phillips curve: the interplay between ideas and macroeconomic outcomes The two top panels of Figure 1 show the kind of evidence A.W. Phillips had available when he published his ground-breaking paper fifty years ago.1 The two panels show the rate of unemployment and annual wholesale price inflation in the United Kingdom, during the Classical Gold Standard, and during the period between the two World Wars, respectively. In line with Phillips (1958), the clear impression emerging from the figure is that of a relatively stable relationship between the two variables, which is especially noteworthy when you consider that the second sample period comprises the Great Depression.  Just two years after the publication of Phillips’ paper, the eponymous curve was made the centrepiece of cutting-edge macro-economic thinking by two future Nobel prize winners, Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow.2 Although Samuelson and Solow were careful in conjecturing that changes in inflation expectations might shift the unemployment-inflation trade-off upwards or downwards, such care was ultimately lost in the fast-growing industry of macro-analyses that was spawned by their article. Samuelson-Solow’s followers took the Phillips curve as literally offering a “menu” of combinations of inflation and unemployment from which policymakers could choose at will – that is, an exploitable trade-off. In February 1963, three years after the publication of Samuelson and Solow’s paper, Federal Reserve Chairman William McChesney Martin openly rejected the notion of an exploitable                                                  1  In fact, Phillips’ (1958) paper was based on annual data, whereas the two top panels of Figure 1 are based on monthly data downloaded from the NBER Macro History Database on the web (see at: www.nber.org). 2  See Samuelson and Solow (1960). BIS Review 76/2008 1 
trade-off between inflation and unemployment in his statement before the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress.3 Disapprovingly, he pointed out that: “[…] there was even serious discussion of the number of percentage points of inflation we might trade off for a percentage point increase in our growth rate. The underlying fallacy in this approach is that it assumes that we can concentrate on one major goal without considering collateral, and perhaps deleterious, side effects on other objectives.” In December 1965, two years before Milton Friedman’s Presidential Address to the American Economic Association, which (re-)introduced the notion of the long-run vertical Phillips curve into macroeconomics,4 Chairman Martin discussed the role of inflation expectations in shifting the unemployment-inflation equilibrium along the very same lines Friedman and Edmund Phelps5 would then expound in analytical terms:6  “If labor had had reason to fear a persistent substantial rise in the cost of living, it would have felt compelled to seek compensatory increases in wages; and if management had had reason to expect a general increase in the price level, it would not have felt compelled to resist such demands. In that case, wages would certainly have risen faster than productivity; prices would have been raised in consequence; and the feared inflationary spiral would have become actuality.”7  Subsequent developments are well known. On the theoretical front, 1967 and 1968 saw the independent enunciation of the “natural rate hypothesis”, both in Friedman’s Presidential Address to the American Economic Association – which I mentioned already – and in the work that ultimately won Edmund Phelps the Nobel Prize. Underlying the natural rate hypothesis are two key concepts. • First, monetary neutrality: in the long run, the Phillips curve is perfectly vertical, which is another way of expressing Robert Lucas’s famous dictum that “You can’t buy a permanent economic high just by printing money.” • Second, temporary departures from the natural rate of unemployment can take place only to the extent that agents’ expectations are, for some reason, out of line with the economy’s authentic dynamics. When, in 1972, Robert Lucas applied to the Phillips curve the hypothesis of rational expectations, the notion of an exploitable trade-off was banished from frontier research. Lucas (1972a), in particular, showed that the traditional “Solow-Tobin” test of the natural rate hypothesis – based on the simple regression of inflation on lags of itself and on the rate of unemployment – was flawed in principle, as its results crucially depended on the nature of the monetary policy regime, and could therefore not be used to validate or invalidate the natural rate hypothesis. Rerunning history is obviously impossible. It is my conviction, however, that these theoretical developments, by themselves, would most likely not have succeeded at displacing the old consensus of an exploitable trade-off with the swiftness we have seen in reality, if it had not been for a dramatic, concomitant real-world development: the Great Inflation.                                                  3  See Martin (1963). 4  See Friedman (1968). Although published in 1968, Friedman’s Presidential Address was delivered to the American Economic Association on December 29, 1967. 5  See Phelps (1968). 6  See Martin (1965). 7  He later summarised his position on the issue in the following terms: ‘ My view of inflation is clear. To those who believe that full employment requires inflation, my answer is that unless inflation is restrained full employment is impossible.’ See Martin (1971). 2 BIS Review 76/2008 
Indeed, the Great Inflation episode was associated with the breakdown of empirical Phillips curves, as equations estimated over the previous, more stable period lost predictive power and had to be adjusted judgementally by forecasters in policy institutions.  The shifting nature of the unemployment-inflation relationship around the time of the Great Inflation is clearly apparent even to the naked eye from the bottom-right panel of Figure 1. Whereas from the second half of the 19th century up until mid-1960s inflation and unemployment had systematically negatively co-moved in both the United Kingdom and the United States, around the time of the Great Inflation they started to move upward in lockstep. As pointed out by Lucas and Sargent in a paper presented in 1978 at a conference organised by the Boston FED,8 the inflation of the 1970s represented, under this respect, a sort of large-scale experiment for the old consensus. For Lucas and Sargent the verdict of this experiment was clear: the “halcyon days”9 of post-Keynesian macroeconomics, with its belief in the exploitability of the Phillips trade-off, were gone for ever. Over subsequent years, and until mid-1990s, the Phillips curve essentially disappeared from frontier research. Alienated by the disappointing performance of the Phillips curve, and following the lead of Kydland and Prescott,10 frontier researchers were preoccupied with building flexible-price general equilibrium models driven by technological impulses. Within the new framework, there was indeed no place for a Phillips curve to speak of.  The revival of interest in the Phillips curve started in the 1990s, and was driven by two separate developments. From an empirical standpoint, work concentrated on the forecasting performance of “generalised Phillips curve models’ comprising, in lieu of unemployment, activity indicators extracted from dynamic factor analysis. Compared to traditional benchmarks, this line of research has shown that generalised Phillips curve models exhibit a remarkable improvement in forecasting ability.11  On the theoretical front, there was a growing realisation that the research program launched by Kydland and Prescott was facing fundamental problems. Notably, the absence of nominal rigidities in a real business cycle setting implied – among other things – that the new paradigm was fundamentally incapable to reproduce the key macroeconomic facts uncovered by the structural VAR literature: first and foremost the sluggish and drawn-out response of key variables such as inflation and output growth to monetary policy innovations. The DSGE research program, which started around mid-1990s,12 was motivated by the need to reproduce key macroeconomic stylised facts within otherwise standard general equilibrium business cycle models. The introduction of various nominal and real frictions in such models has spawned a modelling effort and a flourishing of an econometric work which is, to this day, continuing unabated. The best testimony to the importance of this line of research is that DSGE models have breached the walls of academia, and are today being increasingly used at central banks as key input in the policy process.  A key building block of this class of models is the “New Keynesian Phillips curve”, which in its original incarnation relates current inflation to its expectation next period and to current real marginal cost. For several years this purely forward-looking Phillips curve specification has been regarded as producing implications for inflation dynamics that are at odds with the high                                                  8  See Lucas and Sargent (1978). 9  See Lucas and Sargent, cit. 10  Kydland and Prescott (1982). 11  See e.g. Stock and Watson (1999). Further, although, as the bottom-right panel of Figure 1 shows, the inflation-unemployment correlation clearly appears to have broken down around the time of the Great Inflation, as shown by King and Watson the relationship does not appear to have experienced major instabilities once one focuses upon the business-cycle frequencies, i.e. those relevant for monetary policy. 12  See Hairault and Portier (1993) and Yun (1996).

inflation persistence that is typical of most of the post-WWII era. Several solutions have been proposed to introduce persistence in the model-implied time process for inflation, the best known being the idea that prices that are not reset optimally each period are somehow “indexed” to past inflation.13 Formulations along these lines suffer however from several problems.  • First, except in labour markets, there is little evidence in our economies documenting price-indexing practices of the type described by theory.  • Second, and fundamentally, even conceding that such practices might be wide-spread in high-inflation regimes, it is hard to believe that they would survive under more stable monetary conditions.14  And recent research, indeed, shows that the backward-looking Phillips curve component disappears under stable monetary regimes, i.e. under regimes in which inflation is strongly mean-reverting around the quantitative definition of price stability entertained by the central bank.15 Further, once controlling for fluctuations in trend inflation, the Phillips curve appears indeed to be purely forward-looking.16 Although this line of research is very recent, and its results ought therefore necessarily to be regarded as tentative, these findings reinforce the notion of the fundamental power of monetary institutions in permeating economic behaviours profoundly, direct expectations and – ultimately – determine the intimate fabric of market economies.  The history of the Phillips curve that I just briefly summarised suggests to me several reflections. The fact that prominent central bankers wedded to classical principle of monetary neutrality were ultimately vindicated bears a degree of significance that transcends the confines of central banking chronicles. I view this episode as a highly symbolic manifestation of a fundamental problem that central bankers continually face: namely, how to govern the relationship between policy-making and cutting-edge economic research. Let me turn to this point next. 2.  The relationship between economic research and economic policymaking Before a new medicine is launched on the market, it has to be extensively tested. Introducing new drugs on the market without extensive testing, and without further government vetting, would be considered a kind of social hazard that would undermine the very foundations of modern collective life. Beyond and after precautionary testing, the application of the medicine on large numbers of patients provides a source of ongoing information-gathering that expands knowledge of its healing properties. So, from time to time we learn that the Food and Drug Administration interrupts the sale of drugs that have been on the market for years, on the grounds provided by new evidence concerning previously unknown deleterious side effects.17  Compared with medical research, economics – and notably the economics and econometrics of Phillips curve relationships – present the additional, insurmountable problem that new                                                  13  See Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), and Smets and Wouters (2003). 14  See Woodford (2007). 15  See Benati (2008a). 16  See Cogley and Sbordone (2008). Trend inflation is, according to this line of research, what ultimately imparts inflation its persistence. 17  There is a clear parallel between the risk of side effects of pharmaceutical means and Chairman Martin’s words on the ‘ collateral, and perhaps deleterious, side effects on other objectives’ in his testimony in front of the U.S. Congress in February 1963, when he flatly rejected the idea that it could be possible to permanently trade-off a few percentage points of unemployment for a few percentage points of inflation. 4 BIS Review 76/2008 
theories cannot even be tested before application. To be sure, history has offered a few “natural experiments”: for example, the hyperinflations that swept Europe after the First World War were a prominent collective test, whose lessons have been absorbed, and are today deeply entrenched into the collective psyche of many European peoples. But the fundamental irreproducibility of controlled experiments in social sciences remains. True, in recent years, a very limited number of theories in the field of social science have been subjected to experiments. And, a recent strand of macroeconomic literature18 has even argued that in the presence of uncertainty about the structure of the economy monetary authorities should “experiment”, by running monetary policy in such a way as to create sufficient variation in the data. By standard econometric arguments, this will indeed allow better identification of the relevant, unknown deep parameters for future policy conduct.  When presented with this line of arguments, however, a policymaker’s instinctive reaction is that they cannot possibly be right.  • First and foremost, any experimenting with the economy would inevitably and fatally run the risk of destabilising expectations. Indeed, the result that it is optimal to experiment with the economy was originally obtained within models in which the public played a purely passive role and the behaviour of the policymaker could not alter the public’s beliefs and expectations. • Second, when this assumption has recently been relaxed in models in which the public is allowed to learn from the behaviour of the policymaker,19 the result was overturned. Optimal policy becomes distinctly conservative, in the sense that policymakers should be wary and respectful of the fundamental fragility of the macroeconomic equilibrium to any perturbation that policy experiments could introduce.  In a nutshell, the initial, radical result in favour of monetary policy experimentation has been reversed. The fragility of the earlier result – and the transience of many such results, in the history of the theory of economic policy, which had appeared rock-solid at first sight – is a memento to policy practitioners.  This, of course, poses an issue concerning the right balance between creativity and pragmatism in our policy-making institutions. Isn’t it the case that an excessive intellectual conservatism might end up leaving our policy-making institutions “behind the curve”, clinging to dead theories, and unable to cope with the new challenges of an ever-changing world? To be sure, highly innovative ideas will not systematically be proven wrong: heliocentrism – a revolutionary paradigm when it was first expounded – finally and definitely displaced previously dominant geocentrism. We should be careful not to censor research just for the sake of intellectual conservatism. However, the intrinsically entrepreneurial nature of research, whatever the specific field of endeavour, means that the incidence of failure is bound to be high. Failure in economic policy means potential for economic damage.  A safe principle that has always worked in the past is that the introduction of new ideas and concepts into a central bank’s monetary policy framework should be evolutionary, as opposed to revolutionary. Historically, a typical example of this has been the introduction, towards the end of 1999, of an explicit numerical objective for inflation on the part of the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Since its foundation, in 1907, the SNB has been a bulwark against inflation, delivering an annual inflation rate that, over the entire century – excluding war years – was just 2.1 per cent on average. Further, back in the 1970s, around the time the Great Inflation plagued many countries, the SNB – together with the Bundesbank –                                                  18  See e.g. Bertocchi and Spagat (1993). 19  See Ellison and Valla (2001) and Rosal and Spagat (2006). BIS Review 76/2008 5 
“showed the way” inflation could be resisted – amidst international turbulences – by appropriately restrictive policies. In no way the introduction of an explicit numerical objective for inflation did therefore radically alter its monetary policy framework: rather, by providing a “focal point” for inflation expectations, the only goal of such innovation was to improve the framework’s performance, and to facilitate the central bank’s task within the framework.  This naturally leads me to the final part of my speech. In recent years, an amended Phillips curve – which shifts with the state of expectations – has been made the modelling centrepiece of innovative proposals to conduct monetary policy without explicit reference to monetary aggregates. Part of the academic community, in particular, has advised the European Central Bank to abandon the prominent role it assigns to a careful analysis of monetary aggregates. Based on my previous discussion, the key question then becomes: “Is such a radical extent of innovation justified”? I will offer my thoughts on this question in the remainder of my remarks.  3.  Money and the Phillips curve based model of inflation There is no role for monetary analysis in the model of inflation determination that is centred around the New-Keynesian Phillips curve. The announcement of an inflation target together with a promise to move the real interest rate sufficiently forcefully in response to deviations of observed inflation from target is a necessary and sufficient strategy for price stability in the model. The real shocks that buffet the economy will cause time variation in monetary aggregates, but such movements will be uninformative: real shocks will manifest themselves in other variables in the system as well, and those other variables will be sufficient statistics for the underlying state of the model economy. Conversely, shocks originating in the money market are often un-modelled within the framework, because they are inconsequential. In the model, a monetary authority setting an interest rate as a function of inflation deviations from target will automatically offset those shocks and insulate the economy from their potentially malign influences on real variables and inflation. A Taylor rule can do the job and thus make monetary shocks completely uninteresting from a monetary policy stabilisation standpoint. The question is whether a central bank can content itself with such a stylised representation of the economy. There are two issues.  • First, can this model be trusted to get the facts right in the long run?  • Second, can monetary shocks be ignored even at business cycle frequencies?  The first issue concerns the long-run behaviour of the model. In the long run, the model can replicate the statistical association between money growth and inflation. But it does not reproduce the lead-lag structure that links the two variables. The model assumes a given inflation target defined in numerical terms. By simulating the model, one can prove that – provided some mild conditions on the Taylor rule are satisfied – inflation will consistently fluctuate around the objective over the business cycle and money in the long term will grow at a rate consistent with the objective as well. Only exogenous innovations to the numerical objective will – after some time – result in lasting changes in inflation and, as a consequence, in persistent changes to money growth.  However, this lag structure implied by the model – where changes to the inflation objective precede changes in inflation, which in turn precede changes in money growth – is at odds with the empirical evidence. One extremely robust feature that is possible to detect on the statistical association between money growth and inflation across diverse monetary regimes and historical periods is that persistent changes in (trend) money growth precede – rather than follow – changes in trend inflation. This can be interpreted as money having a leading 6 BIS Review 76/2008 
role in signalling future changes in inflation, and even an active role in determining such changes in the medium term.20  I extract one lesson from this observation. Money growth might indeed have something to do with making the price stability objective credible. In the model, credibility of announcements is not at stake. In reality, that credibility needs to be buttressed – in the eyes of the economic agents – by mutually reinforcing “strategic instruments”. I interpret the evidence as suggesting that money can indeed act as the second “strategic instrument,” on a par with a clear announcement of a quantitative definition of price stability, supporting that definition in the long run.  For what concerns the behaviour of the model at business cycle frequencies, as I mentioned already the model does not feature a money market or a financial sector. Consequently, it simply assumes away the shocks that, even in the short run, can originate in those sectors. This has two main implications: one on the demand for money side, the other on the side of liquidity and credit provision.  On the demand side, the model does not substantiate money’s role as the principal vehicle for settling transactions and providing a “store of value”, for example, in face of heightened uncertainty. However, it is precisely in such conditions that we see money play an active role as a primary attractor for investors and financial intermediaries alike in search for portfolio security and liquidity. In the mainstream model, all eventualities can be hedged in advance, so there is no need to maintain a liquid portfolio even in the face of major shocks. In reality, money can act as a primary determinant of portfolio allocation and spending decisions in conditions of major and sudden shifts in risk perceptions. By monitoring money and liquidity preferences a central bank acquires a first-rate indicator of the state of confidence. The second implication works through the provision of liquidity. In the main-stream model there is no borrowing or lending activity. However, these “missing” activities are important, as we all realise when credit markets become dysfunctional. Shocks hitting, for example, financial intermediaries’ changing perceptions of credit and aggregate risk can drive variable wedges between the interest rate that the monetary authority can control and at which banks can borrow – in fact, the only interest rate that is defined in the model – and the interest rate at which banks lend, which is relevant for aggregate demand. Observation and empirical tests tell us that the latter spectrum of market rates, applying to borrowers with different degrees of creditworthiness, is linked in various ways to liquidity. But the absence of liquidity makes the mainstream model unable to provide relevant insights into the determination of credit spreads, of term premia and, in one word, of asset prices, which are the principal link in the chain of propagation of monetary policy through the economy.  The strategic assignment to expand our view beyond the real sector has been instrumental in developing two avenues of analysis that would have remained atrophic otherwise. • First, we can count today on a first-rated system of real-time monitoring of monetary facts which we can resort to instantly especially in times of emergency. The financial shocks which became apparent in August 2007 posed – and continue to pose – delicate interpretation issues: Is the soaring growth of credit that we observe yet another manifestation of market participants’ anxiety about future credit access? Is it due to forced re-intermediation? Or, rather, is it to be taken as a sign that the                                                  20  Benati (2008b) shows that, over the last two centuries, the low-frequency components of money growth and inflation have exhibited an extraordinarily close co-movement, with a consistent lead of trend money growth over trend inflation by 2-3 years, in the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Australia, and Canada. He argues that the resilience of both features to dramatic changes in the monetary regime naturally suggests that they are both structural in the sense of Lucas (1976). Finally, he shows that traditional New Keynesian models in which money plays a purely residual role are incapable of replicating such a lead-lag structure, as they typically imply that money growth lags inflation, or is, in the best of cases, contemporaneous with it. BIS Review 76/2008 7 
financial turbulence is not severe enough to dent firms’ and lenders’ confidence in the future prospects of our economy? If the first two cases were true, some monetary policy action would be warranted. If the last interpretation were true, however, the monetary policy implications would be different, possibly opposite. Monetary analysis has assisted us to interpret events that were crucial for the design of policy. • The second avenue of analysis that the monetary side of our strategy has encouraged is the macroeconomic modelling of the monetary sector. As a result, currently we can use large-scale estimated DSGE models with a developed credit market that permit informative simulation experiments around baseline forecasts. We exploit the active channels of transmissions from credit and money to activity and inflation which are built into these models to quantify more precisely the risks to the projections which one could associate with the financial turmoil. This would have been impossible if we had contented ourselves with economic models in which inflation and output move only because of innovations to consumption, investment, or cost-push forces.  In summary: I assign money two functions. The first is that of a reinforcing strategic instrument that in the long term buttresses our determination to preserve price stability. It complements and reinforces our announcement of a quantitative definition of price stability. The “inflation objective” term that appears in many version of the new Phillips curve is a proxy for central bank credibility. However, its connection with the deep strategic foundations of a central bank is what is missing from the model and it is what the ECB has tried to make firm and clear with its monetary pillar when our strategy was first announced in 1998.  The second function of money is that of a privileged monitoring device that can help explain facts and shocks even at a shorter horizon. These are shocks that originate in the market for funds and liquidity and can disturb from time to time the workings of the transmission of monetary policy. The mainstream model of inflation determination, organised around the new-Keynesian Phillips curve, is inhospitable to liquidity and risk considerations. But this is no reason for abandoning monetary analysis. It is a reason for refining the model and bringing it to a stage where it can provide help to central bankers in all the tasks – be it the anchoring of inflation expectations or the identification and deflection of monetary shocks – in which they daily engage.  5.  Concluding remarks After years of Keynesians/Monetarists controversies over the sources of inflation, a consensus has emerged and is now dominant in macroeconomic theory and practice: inflation is a monetary phenomenon. In the long term, monetary policy can only influence nominal variables. The consensus model centred around a reconstructed Phillips curve – unlike its infamous predecessor – grants no free lunch to policymakers. So, there is more than a sense in which we all can say that the new Phillips curve encapsulates fundamental tenets of prudent monetary policy-making: the inflation process is forward-looking and will inexorably and quickly incorporate and perpetuate any deviations from price stability, if and when central banks were to start experimenting with the economy. But inflation formation is a complex phenomenon in which expectations interact with current and past shocks – to the cost structure of firms as well as to the monetary and financial fabric of the economy – in ways that a Phillips curve cannot fully account or describe. Failure to adopt an all-encompassing view of the inflation process will lay down the potential for economic damage.  8 BIS Review 76/2008 
The ultimate lesson that I draw from the vicissitudes of the Phillips curve in the half of a century behind us is that we should all beware of models that short-circuit the workings of a complex market economy in a single equation.

Nout Wellink: The interaction between economic science and policy making Speech by Dr Nout Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, on receiving an Honorary Doctorate at Tilburg University, Tilburg, 12 June 2008. *      *      * I would like to congratulate CenTER with its 20th Anniversary, but also with its academic record. I consider it an outstanding achievement that you are in the top three economics faculties in Europe and number 24 in the world. I can only hope that you achieve your objective of entering the top 20 soon. As for me, I am especially grateful to receive an Honorary Doctorate from this renowned Catholic University. Being a Roman Catholic myself, I deem it appropriate to start with a confession. At the start of my professional career, I was asked to become an academic here at the Tilburg University. I hesitated for a while, but eventually I declined the job. At first, I therefore sensed a slight feeling of guilt concerning the honour that is being conferred upon me today: to receive academic recognition exactly from this university, where with a little twist of fate I could have spent my working life, contributing to scientific knowledge. But then, on further reflection, I started to like the idea. Although I did not become a full time academic, I have always kept a strong interest in scientific research. In fact I believe that throughout the years my policy work has benefited greatly from scientific input. The organisers have interpreted this fact the other way around, when they emphasize my contribution to the application of scientific insights in solving real world problems. I thank them for this. I accept my Honorary Doctorate with delight. I would like to dedicate it to the interaction between economic science and policy making. Tensions between economic science and policy? In my view, the interaction between science and policy has brought tremendous progress in both fields. We should be careful to maintain and improve this interaction when possible. Although this point may seem to be self-evident at first sight, it is questioned by some. Several observers notice an increasing gap between highly formalised theory and the practical needs of policy making. An illustration of such a perceived gap in my own field of monetary economics is given in a recent overview paper by Gregory Mankiw, who himself has been an academic as well as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors in Washington. On the basis of a thorough review in a highly-ranked journal, he concludes that recent developments in macro economic modelling have had “close to zero impact on practical policy making”. Another example has been given by my British colleague Mervyn King with respect to modern communication strategies. He argues that the success of such strategies in stabilising inflation expectations at a low level is not yet fully understood from a scientific perspective. His claim is, therefore, that monetary policy is ahead of economic science in that respect. Let me be clear on these points. There are indeed limits on the extent to which policy judgement can be based on science. In almost any policy decision, experience, intuition, “Fingerspitzengefühl”, or whatever name we can put to it, plays a crucial role. Perhaps the role of these elements has even increased in recent times. The outside world has become increasingly international and the economic system has become more complex. Let me give you just one example. At DNB, it is our job to assess the pass-through of the credit market crisis of the past year onto the real economy. The scientific approach would be to rely on model estimates. But unfortunately, the degree of uncertainty that always surrounds such BIS Review 76/2008 1 
estimates jumps to even higher levels in times of financial stress. This illustrates that our judgement cannot be based on science alone. But does this imply that there is a gap between science and policy? I do not think so. After all, our research department has responded to the gap in our knowledge by shifting its attention to economic interactions under extreme events. I would therefore rather stress a natural interaction between science and policy than the existence of a gap. Fostering the interaction between science and policy On the interaction between science and policy, a first thing to note is that macro-economic science actually emerged from the need to address practical policy issues related to the Great Depression in the 1930s. Science and policy perform complementary tasks. Without any understanding of how the real world operates, it would be rather difficult to influence it. Similarly, it seems less relevant to understand what is going on, if these insights are not used for better policies. Scientists and policy makers therefore need to make efforts to understand each other. Policy makers can learn from structuring their thinking and ensuring its consistency. Scientists can learn from incorporating the flexibility and practical relevance that is needed for solving real world problems under political constraints. I therefore do not believe in a model in which universities focus exclusively on science while policy making institutions abstain from any role in scientific research. The potential synergies between both functions are large, but it takes continuous efforts to realise those. In The Netherlands we have a strong tradition of basing policy on scientific insights, thanks to the efforts made by Tinbergen and the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB). As for central banks, I believe that the worldwide movement towards independence has been one of the driving factors of a greater orientation towards a scientific foundation of policies. Being free from political influence and preferences, our legitimacy partly depends on it. As such, we have found practical ways for fostering mutual understanding between science and policy. One is the direct way. Several central banks have appointed renowned academics in top positions. Ben Bernanke is at the FED, Mervyn King at the Bank of England, Athanasios Orphanides at the central bank of Cyprus and Stanley Fischer at the Bank of Israel. It is not only that policy discussions benefit from contributions of these people; they also use their networks for bringing topical policy issues into the scientific debate. Another way for bringing science and policy closer is by hiring specialists in central banks who understand the language of a specific discipline. This is what we do at DNB. We employ researchers in all fields that relate to our core tasks. For example, research in recent years has focused on Mervyn King’s point about why modern monetary policy strategies may work in stabilising inflation expectations. But it has also dealt with decision-making within committee structures, economic modelling, payment systems, behavioural finance, the efficiency of banks, financial conglomerates and so on. Researchers at DNB actually have a challenging job in bridging science and policy. They have to keep themselves up to date with scientific developments in their field; they work independently; on policy-relevant topics; and they are asked to translate their findings into practical policy advice. This last element is probably what distinguishes research at central banks from research at universities, where the incentives for specialising in a more fundamental type of research are stronger. Impact of economic science on policy I have argued that science and policy perform complementary functions, and that central banks perform a key function in fostering mutual understanding. Let me now address the impact of science on policy. I very much believe in the maxim that “most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone”. This is not something that I have made up myself, but is actually a quote by Einstein. In my own field of monetary policy the fundamental ideas of 2 BIS Review 76/2008 
science have indeed been intuitive and simple. They have had a tremendous impact on policy. I guess that most of you are familiar with many of the key insights. On the relevance of price stability; on the costs of inflation; on the inability of monetary policy to raise the structural growth rate of the economy; on the importance of central bank independence from political influence. The point here is that these essentially simple insights were distilled from a huge and often very complicated body of research. I am thinking here about contributions in the 1960s and 1970s on the shape of the Phillips curve, research on time inconsistency that emerged from the late 1970s onwards, research on central bank independence in the 1980s and 1990s, and recent discussions on central bank accountability and communication. Perhaps current researchers can take comfort in the fact that one day the outcomes of current scientific debates may also become glaringly obvious. But in the meantime we need to struggle on before science reveals the answer to us. Conclusion Let me conclude with a forward looking perspective. It seems obvious that globalisation and financial innovations will continue, so that complexity in the economic and financial system will continue to increase. Take the financial turmoil of the past year, to which I referred already. Obviously there is a need to tailor our policies, for example financial supervision and monetary policy, to the dynamics that we have witnessed in the financial sector. But in order to do so we need a thorough understanding of what is going on. With a more complex and dynamic financial system, our demand for high quality analysis and research can only increase. At the same time, while demands are increasing, resources are under pressure. The efficiency operations of the current government that apply to the ministries and the CPB also apply to DNB. While I fully support the need for an efficient government and an efficient central bank, I also see a risk that knowledge-intensive functions could be under disproportionate pressure. A key characteristic of research is that it requires relatively long time horizons, and that its pay-off emerges in the medium rather than in the short run. As a result, it can easily be crowded out by the many policy issues that continue to require immediate attention. The challenge is to protect key research areas from such pressures, and to maintain the human capital base in our institutions. The need for research will always remain, whether policy makers immediately like the answers or not. For each question that we answer, new ones arise. I truly believe that the interaction between science and policy has brought tremendous progress in both fields. We should continue our efforts to foster mutual understanding. Let me once again show my gratitude for the honour that you have conferred upon me and thank you for your attention. BIS Review 76/2008 3 
Ben S Bernanke: Dedication of the new Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Building Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, 12 June 2008. *      *      * It is my pleasure to be here today to help dedicate this state-of-the-art facility. President Hoenig, I commend you and your staff, as well as the designers and builders, of this impressive structure. It will serve Kansas City and the entire 10th District well.  Permit me to start with a bit of history that I hope will underscore the crucial role played by the regional Reserve Banks. When the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, it was the nation's third attempt at a central bank. The First Bank of the United States, chartered in 1791, and the Second Bank of the United States, chartered in 1816, did not last. They both failed to gain the trust of a public fearful of concentrated power. To address this concern, the creators of the Federal Reserve crafted a plan for a central bank with a unique structure: what some have called a decentralized central bank. An independent federal agency in Washington, D.C., the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System oversees 12 regional Banks, which serve as the operating arms of the System and blend public and private elements. Importantly, the presidents of the Reserve Banks participate, along with the Washington-based Board members, in the monetary policy deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee. The presidents bring a wealth of knowledge acquired from their regional contacts. Thus, in making policy, we are able to view the economy not just from a Washington perspective, or a Wall Street perspective, but also from a Main Street perspective. This system has served the central bank and the nation well for nearly a century. Last night I attended a dinner with the Bank's current directors as well as many former members of the Bank's board. Nationally, 278 private citizens – including business people, bankers, nonprofit executives, and community, agricultural and labor leaders – serve on the boards of our 12 Banks and their Branches. These individuals provide us with extensive and current information about economic conditions from a unique local perspective. Often, they provide an early warning of shifting economic conditions before they show up in official government statistics. I commend them for their service to both the central bank and our nation. Here in Kansas City, and in all of our Districts, the Bank and Branch directors have played an important role since the Federal Reserve's inception. As you might expect, at last night's dinner, we talked to some degree about the Bank's history, our current challenges, and the future. In preparing for this event, I read a little bit about the dedication ceremony for the previous Kansas City Fed headquarters at 925 Grand Boulevard. One of my predecessors as Chairman, William P.G. Harding, spoke at its dedication on November 16, 1921, and I am happy to follow in his footsteps. Considering the Federal Reserve's history, this location is a most appropriate site for a Federal Reserve Bank, with its new neighbor being the National World War I Museum at Liberty Memorial. Those who have an appreciation of U.S. history know that the Federal Reserve played an important role in support of the funding of the First World War and that the war forced the early Federal Reserve to contend with an uncertain global environment with wide-ranging monetary and economic ramifications. The Federal Reserve has faced many such challenges since its founding, and the System has evolved in response. Ours must be a dynamic institution if it is to successfully fulfill its mission in a changing financial and economic landscape. BIS Review 76/2008 1 
When the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City opened in 1914, it operated out of leased office space before moving to the building it is now vacating. In the more than nine decades since, the world has changed dramatically, especially in the areas of banking and finance; however, the Federal Reserve's purpose, mission, and goals remain unchanged. And while the Bank's former home on Grand Boulevard served it well, today we celebrate the opening of a building that will well serve this country, and this region. Looking at the Federal Reserve more broadly, while we must continue to change, we also must recognize that one of the Federal Reserve's key strengths continues to be the strong regional connections fostered by the Reserve Banks. To quote from the Federal Reserve Board's first annual report, published on January 15, 1915: "It should never be lost to sight that the Reserve Banks are invested with much of the quality of a public trust. They were created because of the existence of certain common needs and interests, and they should be administered for the common welfare – for the good of all." In that spirit, let us use this ceremony to recognize the Federal Reserve's unique structure with roots that are broad and deep in the region. To echo comments Tom Hoenig made at the groundbreaking on this site three years ago, let us dedicate this Bank to the service of our nation, this great city of Kansas City, and the other important cities, towns, and rural regions in the heart of America that define the 10th Federal Reserve District. 2 BIS Review 76/2008 
Axel A Weber: Financial markets and monetary policy Speech by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the CEPR/ESI 12th Annual Conference “The Evolving Financial System and the Transmission Mechanism of Monetary Policy”, co-organised by the Bank for International Settlements, Basel, 25-26 September 2008. *      *      * 1 Introduction  Let me start with a disclaimer: Since we are one week away from a monetary policy decision my speech today will not make any reference to the actual monetary policy stance or monetary policy decisions. Rather my remarks are of a more fundamental nature.  The financial market developments of the past 12 months and the culmination of events in the last fortnight have attracted a lot of interest from the general public. These events have highlighted the interlinkages between the financial and the real sphere and the implications these linkages have for monetary policy. Understanding developments on financial markets is a cornerstone for monetary policy making. This is true in normal times, and even more so in the extraordinary times we live in today. An analysis of the monetary transmission process is therefore of the utmost importance for central bankers. And a thorough understanding of the ways in which financial market developments might influence the impact of monetary policy measures is a cornerstone of recent research efforts.  However, financial markets are also a very important information pool for monetary policy decision-makers. The current tensions on the financial markets also complicate the task of deriving the information embedded in financial markets. In the following I will try to elaborate on these two related aspects – financial markets and monetary policy transmission, and the information content of financial markets for decision-making.  I will attempt always to relate to the experiences of the past 12 months in order to give real-world examples to illustrate the more general aspects of both topics. In order to do so, I will give a brief outline of the underlying causes of the recent financial market tensions. 2  The underlying causes of the recent financial market turmoil When looking at the underlying causes of the recent tensions in the global financial system, no one particular development can be clearly identified as the root cause. Numerous culprits have been put forward: securitisation, quality of risk management, credit rating agencies, compensation schemes, accounting standards – to name just a few. But I am extremely sceptical of monocausal explanations. Instead, I believe that a cocktail of various ingredients triggered the shock waves that have rocked the financial system. Many of these factors are related to financial innovations or, to be more precise, from a combination of new and complex instruments to transfer credit risks and the “originate and distribute” business model. The disruptions of the past few months have highlighted the heightened complexity of credit risk transfer (CRT) instruments. This would have been less problematic had the risk management systems of financial intermediaries kept pace with the changing characteristics of the financial landscape. However, not all of them did. At the same time, the investor base has become more diffuse, with some participants only recently having entered the CRT markets, maybe not sufficiently familiar with the instruments at hand. All of this suggests that several investors may not have fully appreciated the higher-risk nature of CRT products and were therefore overly optimistic in their assessments of the risks involved.  BIS Review 116/2008 1 
Securitisation activity was fostered by the “originate and distribute” model in place at large banks and securities firms. On a positive note, the securitising, tranching and trading of credit risks has led to a fairly broad risk dispersion – a feature which most market participants and observers deemed to be purely positive. However, it has become clear now, that the “originate and distribute” model can actually improve the resilience of the financial system only if a high-quality standard is maintained at all levels of the transfer process and no new concentrations of risk arise. The past few years, however, have been characterised by a series of distorted incentives, which has manifested itself in lax origination standards for products such as subprime mortgages and an excessive reliance on credit ratings by some investors. As a final point, let me add that, at the end of the day, the “originate and distribute” model led – rather unexpectedly – to a huge reintermediation of credit risks on to banks’ balance sheets; in some sense, therefore, the clock is turned back. In other words, the financial market turmoil has demonstrated that (1) risks disappear and that (2) removing assets from bank balance sheets does not mean that banks are no longer exposed to the risks associated with them. Hence, the designers of risk management systems should reconsider their view of credit guarantees and credit lines to off-balance-sheet entities such as structured investment vehicles and conduits and the reputational risk associated with them. In a nutshell, securitisation, as Claudio Borio aptly put it in 2008, has, ultimately, “distributed fear rather than risks”. However, while financial innovation has undoubtedly increased vulnerabilities in the global financial system, there is more to the present financial market turmoil than the proliferation of structured finance products. The “originate and distribute” model would arguably not have been possible without the benign economic and financial backdrop notably robust global economic growth, low inflation, a low level of interest rates, low default rates and rising asset prices in many countries, not just in the USA. This Goldilocks economy, where conditions were neither “too cold” nor “too hot”, had – as a side effect – masked the gradual build-up of financial imbalances; a development many of us have seen already before the turmoil. And the BIS is one very prominent example that made this very clear already at an early stage of the process. Hence, while lending and risk-taking experienced rapid growth, words of warning from central banks and other institutions largely went unheeded with the argument that “this time, developments are surely different from the past”. The fact that minor financial market tensions in the spring of 2005 and 2006 had left financial markets more or less unscathed only served to reinforce that impression. However, once the vulnerabilities in the global financial system were revealed in August last year and financial imbalances started unwinding, we all witnessed that the environment had changed considerably since then.  3  Recent financial market tensions: lessons for monetary policy The list of lessons to be learnt from the current financial turmoil covers many areas. I do not want to discuss in any detail the many proposals that are currently being debated in different national and international bodies. As the G-7 finance ministers and governors have recently stated, it is important to recognise the need for more effective regulation. In that context we remain fully committed to the recommendations of the Financial Stability Forum to improve the resilience of the international financial system. While I do not deny the importance of these aspects, in the following I would like to focus on an aspect that is more related to the general theme of today’s conference, namely the lessons to be learnt by monetary policy makers in their core business of setting short-term interest rates to safeguard macroeconomic stability. I therefore do not intend to describe the reactions of central banks to the current turmoil in terms of money market operations, but take a step back from this sort of crisis management to the more general issue of conducting monetary policy in the face of a procyclical behaviour of financial market participants.  2 BIS Review 116/2008 
In the first half of this decade, monetary policy was expansive in most industrial countries. This is true of interest rate based measures of the monetary policy stance, and it is also evident in indicators such as money and credit aggregates. The expansive monetary policy stance after the New Economy bubble burst has been well documented for the United States. But traditional indicators also signal an expansionary policy stance for a prolonged period of time for the euro area. At the same time, risk premia on financial markets have been historically low for reasons we could not explain with the aid of traditional macroeconomic factors.  As there is empirical evidence that protracted low interest rates may have fostered financial market participants’ grog risk appetite and contributed to the dynamic growth of credit aggregates worldwide via this risk-taking channel in the monetary policy transmission, the events of the past 12 months also throw up some serious questions on the role of monetary policy. The debate about monetary policy and financial markets is too often slanted towards the question of how to deal with asset price bubbles. Here, the current majority view is: a) monetary policy cannot and should not target asset prices; b) monetary policy should not prick asset price bubbles; c) monetary policy should focus on limiting the fallout from bursting bubbles ex post. In my opinion, this view of monetary policy and asset prices is too narrow. A more fruitful debate on appropriate monetary policy reactions to developments on financial markets would be possible if the focus were redirected from financial bubbles to the issue of procyclicality. Monetary policy makers should not view boom and bust episodes on the financial markets as unrelated events. In the medium term, the monetary policy reaction to downturns on the asset markets influences market participants’ risk perception in the following upturn. This is especially evident where monetary policy makers apply a risk management approach that asymmetrically lowers rates in times of severe financial market downturns, over and above what would be deemed necessary given the baseline outlook on prices and growth.  A more symmetric approach would treat boom and bust episodes not as isolated events but would try to look through the financial cycle in order to steady policy. To be more specific, a more symmetric policy would also realise implicit risks in times when money and credit growth is dynamic, asset prices go up and risk perceptions decline, possibly creating the need to act despite sufficiently low current inflation rates. This, however, does not mean that monetary policy should downgrade the price stability objective for the sake of other objectives. Rather, it means that central banks should take a longer-term perspective which takes into account the future inflationary consequences of such unfavourable developments.  And indeed, empirical work pioneered by the BIS has found that excessive money and credit growth has significant leading indicator properties for sharp corrections on asset markets and severe repercussions on the rest of the economy. As financial crises increase the volatility of macroeconomic variables such as inflation and growth, and given that monetary policy operates under the traditional loss functions, these results indicate that a more symmetric policy would improve welfare and macroeconomic stability. Moreover, it could be argued that the variance of macroeconomic variables itself is not independent of the monetary policy strategy chosen. A more symmetric monetary policy approach to financial cycles therefore has an additional endogenous impact. Given the macroeconomic relevance of financial crises, we have good reason to widen our monetary policy time horizon and give low-frequency movements in credit and monetary aggregates more weight in our analytical frameworks and our monetary policy decision-making processes. That is not to say that such an approach would eliminate financial cycles altogether. However, in the medium to long term, a monetary policy that followed a more symmetric course would do more to dampen damaging financial cycles than a monetary BIS Review 116/2008 3 
policy that merely tries to limit damage after the event using aggressive interest rate measures.  Given that the eye of the current storm is the US real estate market and that the US Federal Reserve is well known for actively pursuing a risk-management approach, it comes as no surprise that most debates currently focus on US monetary policy. But given the prolonged period of low interest rates in the euro area over the past couple of years, these issues must also be addressed by monetary policy makers in the Eurosystem.  Here, the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy already possesses, in the shape of its monetary analysis, such a stabilising element, which is especially suited for the analysis of long-term developments. The recent financial turmoil has shown that the often criticised monetary and credit analysis has a valuable role to play in monetary policy analysis.  4  MTM and financial developments The relationship between monetary policy and financial markets, however, is by no means one that is of interest to policy makers only in the face of a crisis. Developments on financial markets have the potential to modify core economic relationships and are therefore of utmost interest for monetary policy. Let me therefore move away somewhat from the recent stress episode to discuss other structural issues related to financial innovations and monetary policy transmission. The remarkable financial developments of the past decade brought with them a wide range of new financial products, greater competition, a notable increase in securitisation activities, disintermediation, and a consolidation process in the banking sector. This has broadened the range of financial market participants’ activities and possibly also changed their reaction to shocks, e.g. to monetary policy innovations. A priori, the overall impact of such changes caused by financial development is unclear, but the empirical literature provides us with some useful hints:  Increased competition in banking together with enhanced availability of alternative capital market-based instruments for financial investment has likely amplified and/or accelerated the effects of monetary policy changes on bank interest rates (and, ceteris paribus, on output and inflation). The bank lending channel is generally thought to have lost importance, because  • … banks’ flexibility to react to interest rate hikes has increased and …  • … financial development has broadened borrowers’ financing options, reducing their dependency on bank loans.  • With the growing use of derivative instruments, banks’ lending policies might also have become less vulnerable to monetary policy tightening (e.g. Purnanandam (2007)).  The additional funding opportunities entail a larger share of market-based (rather than bank-based) products; as these are more standardised and less idiosyncratic, collateral may play a more important role now, potentially increasing the importance of the balance sheet channel.  However, there is not much evidence for the euro area on whether and how financial development has changed the overall monetary policy transmission process in terms of output and inflation (and not just specific transmission channels). We in the Bundesbank have recently taken an aggregate look at the data without imposing too many a priori restrictions and estimated a series of canonical VARs in order to capture the overall monetary transmission process in the euro area. More specifically, we have checked whether there have been notable changes to the general way in which monetary policy affects output and inflation. Using a data-driven search based on aggregate data, we found that euro-area 4 BIS Review 116/2008 
transmission did indeed undergo notable changes in the mid-1990s; specifically, there is evidence of a structural break around 1996 and possibly a second one around 1999. Interestingly, these changes to the monetary transmission process do not seem to have altered the long-run responses of real output and inflation to monetary policy: notably, long-run neutrality still holds, and monetary policy is able to control inflation in the long term. But, maybe surprisingly, monetary transmission in the period 1980-1996 is not significantly different from that in the period 1999-2006. We interpret this as evidence of an “atypical interim period” characterised by “fluctuations” or “perturbations” lasting from 1996 to the end of 1998. During this period, the monetary transmission process in the euro area differed significantly from the periods before and afterwards. However, this result does not necessarily mean that financial development left monetary transmission unchanged: Financial development may have had offsetting effects on different transmission channels, e.g. speeding up the interest rate channel, lessening the importance of the bank lending channel and boosting the role of the balance sheet channel. Moreover, it could well be that other influences were at work as well, possibly mitigating the effects of financial development on the transmission process, such as the creation of the euro area or, as a secular trend, globalisation.  To sum up: Since a good knowledge of the monetary transmission process is essential for monetary policy, central banks must monitor developments in the financial markets closely because they have the potential to seriously affect the monetary transmission process. This conference adds a great deal to this issue. At the same time, the existing evidence must be “processed” in order to obtain a reliable empirical assessment of possible changes to the transmission process as a whole. For the time being, monetary policy has to be based on a broad range of different indicators to avoid running the risk of misreading important information. 5 Financial market indicators and monetary policy decision making 5.1  Financial market indicators as information variables for monetary policy The previous section examined the possible effects of financial market developments on monetary policy transmission. Although the ongoing development of financial markets may have induced changes in monetary policy transmission, I – as a central banker and monetary policy decision maker – would like to point to another link between monetary policy and financial market development. That is – as it were – the reverse causation: How does financial development affect (the) monetary policy decision making (process). Important information for monetary policy decisions can undoubtedly be derived from financial market indicators. When considering the usual monetary policy transmission from a change in central bank interest rates to the ultimate monetary policy objective, information derived from financial market indicators as part of regular monetary policy preparations can be divided into the following categories.  First, information on market expectations about interest rates, including central bank interest rates as expected monetary policy moves. E.g., we derive the interest rate path expected by financial markets using EONIA swaps. In addition to this path, we assess financial markets’ uncertainty surrounding their interest rate expectations. To this end, we derive the risk-neutral density from the options on the three-month Euribor future. Second, information on financing conditions in the private sector (including risk premia in the financial markets) as well as market expectations concerning the development of major real economic indicators – such as the real interest rate, economic activity or commodity prices. Third, information on financial markets’ expectations about future price developments, especially as an indicator of the credibility of monetary policy and, hence, as an indicator for BIS Review 116/2008 5 
second round effects. Here, we use information derived from inflation-indexed bonds and inflation swaps.  All these indicators proved to be very important for assessing the current economic situation and for monetary policy decisions. Consequently, financial market are not just important for the transmission of monetary policy, they also supply us with important information for monetary policy decisions.  Furthermore, financial development has increased the number of instruments from which such information can be derived. However, the financial market turmoil has made an analysis of financial market indicators even more important – while at the same time making interpretation much more difficult – an aspect I would like to illustrate in the following section. 5.2  Current difficulties in interpreting financial market indicators 5.2.1 Interest rate expectations Financial market expectations concerning future short-term interest rates constitute an important input in assessing the possible impact of monetary policy measures on economic developments. Short-term interest rate expectations derived from financial market data show whether or not a possible interest rate step is already priced into the financial markets. Thus, a change in key interest rates causes market interest rates to react more strongly, the more unexpected the interest rate step is. Precise knowledge of interest rate expectations also helps to counteract any undesired developments, perhaps using communication policy instruments to bring market interest rate expectations more into line with the central bank’s own view. E.g., the financial market’s interest rate expectations for the euro area can be calculated using EONIA swaps. This exercise yields an expected interest rate path for the one-month interest rate. The key interest rates expected by the financial markets can be deduced under the assumption of a fixed interest rate spread between the one-month rate and the minimum bid rate. Based on this expected interest rate path one can, e.g., calculate the probability financial markets attach to an interest rate change of 25 base points at the next Governing Council meeting. It should be clear, however, that this probability is critically dependent on the assumption of a fixed interest rate spread between the expected one-month rate and the deduced expected minimum bid rate. A one base point change in the assumed spread would lead to a change in the probability of a 25 base point hike by 4 base points.  Given the current money market distortions, however, considerable fluctuations in the spread between the one-month rate and the minimum bid rate cannot be ruled out. One reason could be tensions on the swap market owing to a decline in market participants’ willingness or ability to take risks. Our assessment of financial markets’ uncertainty regarding their interest rate forecast could also be distorted by the current financial market turmoil because of variations in the risk premia contained in the three-month money market interest rates: In order to estimate market participants' uncertainty regarding their interest rate forecast, we derive the risk-neutral density from options on the three-month Euribor future. The more certain market participants are about their point forecast on the three-month Euribor, the smaller the standard deviation of the estimates should be. We therefore usually interpret a change in the expected three-month Euribor distribution as indicating a change in financial markets’ expectation of Eurosystem policy rates. However, currently we cannot rule out the possibility that the financial market turbulence has caused volatility in the risk premium which is currently contained in the interest rate for unsecuritised three-month-money (Euribor). In order to obtain an answer to the question of what factors are driving an expected change, we continuously analyse the development of the Euribor-Forward three-month EONIA swap spreads. That is the difference between an implied three-month interest rate derived from Euribor rates and one derived from EONIA swaps. In general, this spread provides information on liquidity premiums for different maturities in the money market. Financial market expectations of a steady decline in money market uncertainty would imply not only an 6 BIS Review 116/2008 
ongoing drop in liquidity premiums but also lower premiums for time periods further in the future compared to less distant time spans. 5.2.2  Financial-market-based expectations on important economic indicators In addition to this money-market analysis, we monitor the development of capital market-oriented measures of risk premia. Assuming freedom from arbitrage in capital markets, affine term structure models can be used to determine to what extent macroeconomic factors, such as the inflation rate or potential output utilisation, can explain the current term structure. Conversely, such models show the contribution of latent or undetermined factors to the current term structure. In Germany, for example, historical data show that, the longer the term to maturity, the smaller the amount of interest rate variation attributable to macroeconomic factors is.1  Information about factors driving term structure is important for assessing whether the yield curve is influenced by shocks to the term premium. In this case, a monetary policy impulse may affect long-term interest rates in a different way than in previous periods. This aspect has been particularly important in the recent past when it proved difficult to explain the low level of long-term rates in the United States despite increases in short-term rates. This information is particularly relevant when looking at the current financial market turbulence. On the other hand, however, the current turmoil complicates the derivation of the risk premia because upwardly “distorted” money market rates are usually included within the set of chosen interest rates.  5.2.3  Financial-market-based inflation expectations It is extremely important for central bankers to know the level of inflation expectations. They provide information on what inflation rates are taken into account in wage negotiations, for example, and whether there is a risk that temporary inflation shocks will lead to a permanent increase in the inflation rate which could not be tolerated by monetary policy. Long-term inflation expectations are therefore a good indicator for the credibility of monetary policy. Information on economic agents’ inflation expectations is gained mostly from surveys. Within the euro area, Consensus Economics and the ECB regularly ask for such information. The plausibility of this survey-based information can generally be verified using the inflation premiums contained in financial market prices. To determine financial-market-based inflation expectations, we use the breakeven inflation curve as well as information from inflation swaps. The resulting BEIR term structure is the difference between a nominal and a real interest rate curve. The latter is derived from the returns on inflation-linked bonds of AAA rated euro-area countries. Looking at the long-term risks to price stability the fact that both survey-based and financial-market-based long-term inflation expectations are now noticeably higher than they were before the outbreak of the financial market turbulence is cause for concern.  Current financial-market-based indicators for inflation expectations may, however, be distorted by the turbulence. Like the market for interest rate swaps, the market for inflation swaps may be suffering from a smaller supply of inflation protection. While banks usually supply inflation protection, a decrease in their willingness or their ability to take risks – i.e. given less room for manoeuvre in liquidity-absorbing asset swap activities – could have increased the inflation swap premium. This could be one reason why the difference in the long-term measures of inflation expectations using inflation swaps and using the BEIR-curve has widened substantially over the last couple of weeks.                                                   1  See ”The determinants of the term structure of interest rates – approaches to combining arbitrage-free models and monetary macroeconomics”, Bundesbank monthly report, April 2006, pp 15-28. BIS Review 116/2008 7 
On the other hand, however, strong safe haven effects in nominal AAA-rated government bonds may have caused the term premiums of the respective securities to shift, resulting in a downwards distortion of the BEIR curve. It is consequently not immediately clear whether long-term inflation expectations based on swaps or long-term inflation expectations based on the BEIR curve are currently more reliable. Our reaction to this finding has been to increase the weight we attach to survey-based indicators of long-term inflation expectations – although, of course, they too have disadvantages. 6  Conclusion I have tried to illustrate some aspects of the close relationship between monetary policy and financial markets. In so doing, I have tried to strike a balance between focusing on recent events in financial markets and more general aspects. Financial developments have the potential to change the transmission process. Financial markets provide valuable information for decision-makers. However, during episodes of financial turmoil, the information embedded in asset prices is distorted and requires careful interpretation. Monetary policy should react to the financial cycle in a more symmetric way in order to reduce low-frequency volatility in important macro variables. All these points illustrate the growing influence of financial market developments on monetary policy. However, they by no means alter the ultimate goals of monetary policy.  8 BIS Review 116/2008 
Ajith Nivard Cabraal: The role of productivity improvement in achieving economic prosperity Keynote address by Mr Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the Annual General Meeting 2007/08 of the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka, Colombo, 17 September 2008. *      *      * Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Invitees, Ladies and Gentlemen, I consider it a unique honour to be invited to deliver the Key Note Address at this Annual General Meeting of International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICC Sri Lanka). I also consider it a great privilege to share my thoughts and views on a very timely topic, “The Role of Productivity Improvement in achieving Economic Prosperity” since productivity improvement is essential from both a micro and macro perspective. Therefore, at the outset, I wish to thank the ICC Sri Lanka for inviting me to deliver the keynote address on a vital theme at this important forum and giving me an opportunity to plant a few seeds in your distinguished minds so that such seeds may be nurtured by you in your future endeavours positioning the country at a higher level in the global environment.  As we all agree, as individuals, our main objective is to experience a better life and we think, act and react aiming to achieve this. At the same time, the main objective of economic management is to enhance standard of living of the people. Hence, relevant stakeholders in the country formulate, implement, revise and re-implement economic and other policies to achieve such goals. Whatever the policy we formulate and pursue, the ultimate aim is to raise living standards of the nation.  At the same time, we are all aware that it is compulsory to have higher economic growth and fair distribution of benefits of growth for achieving higher standards of living. The issue is, how can we achieve higher rates of economic growth? Theory will say savings, investments, diversification, technology, hard work, attitudes and perceptions. Yes. All these are important and they have certain importance in a country’s overall performance. However, in a highly competitive, globalized environment with a limited resource endowment all of these factors would be second to productivity. For sustained prosperity, productivity is the key.  Why is the productivity so important? Economists agree that, in the long-run, productivity growth is the principal means of improving living standards. The rate of productivity growth influences the economy in important ways, even in the short run, by affecting key variables such as output growth, employment growth, and the rate of inflation. So, as a first step, let us examine the need of productivity improvements in the current global and domestic economic context and the lessons of success by emphasizing on productivity, so that we could deal with this topic in a wider perspective.  In my view, our economy should focus on productivity due to two important reasons. First, limits in expanding agriculture and industry sectors and the resultant hindrance of economic expansion. Second, in the current economic context, a greater emphasis has to be placed in not only expanding the services sector, but also improving its productivity in order to achieve higher economic growth. Let me elaborate on these two reasons in a broader manner.  The economic history of countries clearly shows that there is a set pattern of the transformation of the structure of economies, typically from agriculture to industry and then to services. It happens due to two major reasons. First, in the first stage, the economic value was entirely created by agriculture, which is called the pre-industrial era. Thereafter, the source of a country’s economic value shifted to industry with fast BIS Review 116/2008 1 
industrialization. However, the value creation through agriculture and industry was constrained at a certain point as the performance in both the agriculture and industry naturally depends mainly on the natural resource endowment. Therefore, when the natural resource endowment of countries limits further expansion of agriculture or industry, a greater need for improving productivity arises.  Second, when growth is limited due to constraints in agriculture and industry, the vacuum has to be filled with some other more efficient economic activity. Otherwise, the economy would be stagnant. Hence, the existence of an efficient and vibrant services sector has become a necessity for further growth of the economy as a whole and the agriculture and industry sector in particular. Although the services sector was often criticized as a sector that does not create real wealth, both the theory and evidence prove that the wide-spread development and also the saturation of agriculture and industry has led to the creation of a new source of wealth through a more dynamic growth sector in the form of services.  The services sector is currently the largest and fastest growing economic activity in most of the developed and developing world. The World Bank estimates that the share of services in the Gross Domestic Product of developed countries is typically between 60 and 70 percent. While these figures are generally lower in emerging and least developed countries, they have steadily been increasing over the years. However, it is equally accepted that existence of expanded services sector alone cannot generate wealth. It has to be dynamic, vibrant and it should add high values to the economy. The services sector should be more productive and efficient. Today’s customer not only demands services, but demands more productive, efficient and reasonably priced services.  Let’s take a closer look at Sri Lanka now …. Undoubtedly, Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector has made its greatest contribution to create wealth and employment in the past. As we all are aware, we have been self sufficient in rice production over the millenniums. We have been producing and exporting agriculture commodities for centuries. At the time of independence, the agriculture sector was dominating with a share of 47 per cent of GDP. However, keeping with the global and domestic economic trends, the relative importance of the agriculture sector has been shrinking. Accordingly, the share in agriculture reduced to about 12 per cent of GDP by end 2007. What has been the impact? It has not been able to create sufficient value or wealth with the reduced share of sectoral importance. While recognizing the historic importance of the agriculture sector we should recognize the fact that it has a limitation in the form of low contribution to the national output and low productivity in the current context. Notably, as about one third of the labour force is engaged in agriculture, its total output is distributed among a large number of workers. According to the World Development Report 2006 of the World Bank, the agricultural value added per agricultural worker in Sri Lanka, measured in 2000 US dollars, has been US dollars 696 for the period of 1989-91. This has increased only marginally to US dollars 737 in 2001-03. However, the comparable figures for other countries, even in emerging countries, have been much higher than these figures. What is the result? As a result, the income of agricultural workers in Sri Lanka has been very low, keeping them below the poverty line.  At the same time, underemployment has been the natural consequence since employment in agriculture is seasonal and there is a higher concentration of a large farm-based work-force on limited extents of cultivable land. Even disastrously, the under-employment in agriculture in Sri Lanka is not only the highest but also on the increase. According to the Consumer Finances and Socio-economic Survey of the Central Bank, the underemployment in the agriculture sector in 1996/97 stood at 31 per cent of the employed and it rose to 36 per cent by 2003/04. In contrast, the underemployment in the services 2 BIS Review 116/2008 
sector fell from 20 per cent to 18 per cent between the two reference periods and that in the industry remained unchanged at 20 per cent.  This has to be seen as both a weakness and an opportunity. We know that food prices have recorded an unprecedented increase in recent times. Hence, there are immense opportunities arising from increased prices and resultant increase in production. At the same time, food security has to be ensured in order to avoid adverse consequences of increased food prices and also undue declines in stocks. Given these limitations, the obvious strategy is to increase productivity. Accordingly, attempts need to be made to concentrate on land, water, agricultural methods, seeds, harvesting, credit to agriculture, transport, harvesting storage, stable prices, value addition etc. to raise productivity in agriculture.  If the growth is constrained by limited expansion in agriculture, can’t we focus more on the industry sector? Of course, we can. Unlike the agriculture, which is constrained with limited land availability, industry does not have capacity or demand limitations. Even the non-availability of raw materials or essential inputs or the domestic demand for the output no longer does inhibit industrial growth in view of globalization of trade and services and the advancements in information and communication technology. Although the importance of the agriculture sector in Sri Lanka is reducing, the share of industry has been improving. By end 2007, the share of industry remained at around 30 per cent of GDP compared to 20 per cent in 1950.  However, there are still risks and weaknesses in industry sector as well. The higher reliance of imported raw material, increased cost of economic infrastructure, higher wages per unit of output, overall increase in cost structure, intense global competition and possible abolition of various concessions certainly tells us there is an urgent need to improve productivity in the industry sector as well. The demand for the country's industrial goods will always depend on its comparative and competitive advantages. This requires local industries to raise productivity and efficiency in production so as to successfully compete with the rival producers in other parts of the world. Since Sri Lanka does not have an unlimited natural resource base it would be difficult to enhance growth through industry or agriculture alone. As mentioned above, services sector is important for both industry and agriculture sector performance. Hence, we need to focus more on services sector.  However, the focus should be placed on a “more productive” services sector. Although we always stress the importance of improving productivity in agriculture and industry sectors, a similar significance should be assigned to the services sector as well. Despite the growing weight in services in economies, productivity growth in services has been slow in many countries and the share of the working-age population employed in services remains low in many countries. If we wish to strengthen economic growth and improve the foundations for the future performance of our economy, the services sector will need to do better. But strengthening growth performance is not the only challenge that we are facing. We are also confronted with the growing globalization of services and with rapid technological change posing the huge challenge of keeping the momentum in the services sector. Addressing such challenges and strengthening the potential of services to foster employment would be definitely through increased productivity and innovation. Certainly a productive services sector would deliver more benefits in a highly competitive environment. Sri Lanka’s telecommunication sector is a good example.  In which areas have we been below par? Although Sri Lanka has a huge potential in services such as education, health and tourism, we haven’t done enough. So, also, has it been in the case of ports, financial services, including banking. We have not been able to reduce prices and charges through increased productivity.  We may need to open domestic services markets to create new job opportunities and foster innovation and productivity. Further regulatory reform of services markets will create fresh opportunities for firms to develop new services, meet emerging global demands and increase BIS Review 116/2008 3 
employment. It will also increase the incentives for companies to innovate and improve productivity growth. With all these, country would reach higher level of economic growth.  Before I conclude, I would like to address three broader issues based on three important macroeconomic fundamentals. First, unemployment; second, exchange rate and the third is inflation.  What will unemployment reduction do? The declining trend in unemployment to its lowest recorded level in Sri Lanka brings to focus the need for more efficient use of labour through productivity improvements. Precisely, lower unemployment indicates a potential hindrance to future higher growth prospects unless labour productivity is improved substantially. It has been encouraging to observe the continuous improvements in labour productivity over the years, especially in the industry and services sectors, which have contributed well to higher economic growth. However, an increasing mismatch in labour supply and demand is reflected by the high rate of youth unemployment, including graduates, and their desire to join the already expanded public service, while certain sectors in the private sector are finding it difficult to recruit necessary skilled labour. This together with declining labour force available for agriculture employment indicates the need of improving productivity as a prerequisite to achieve the envisaged higher growth targets and a more balanced regional development.  What will the Exchange Rate do? Under the floating exchange rate regime, the Sri Lankan currency can no longer be regarded as a steadily and continuously depreciating currency. With the maturing domestic foreign exchange market, the exchange rate is now more responsive to, and determined through, market forces of supply and demand, while the intervention by the Central Bank is limited to mitigate excessive volatility in the market and to build up official external reserves. The stabilization of the Sri Lanka rupee utmost underlines the need for the export and import competing sectors to focus more on productivity improvements and market access in order to maintain external competitiveness. Instead of waiting for the exchange rate to depreciate and then for our businesses to become competitive, it is time for all of us to improve our productivity in whatever manner we can. The garment sector, I hear is trying to gain from higher productivity and also through cost efficiencies.  How does inflation and productivity affect each other? Increased productivity is an important prerequisite to achieve low and stable inflation levels in the long-run. The lower productivity allows cost increases that flow through to product prices and thereby raises inflation. Therefore, the lower productivity growth thus represents a negative supply shock that generates inflationary pressures. In such context, it is necessary to pay due attention to improving the productivity in order to prevent potential inflationary pressure associated with high income arising from faster nominal growth and cost-push factors that raise the cost of production. The long run containment in inflation necessarily relies on containment of monetary expansion and increase in production in the country, particularly by improving productivity.  As the Central Bank, what we can do? Obviously we cannot produce goods or services for the consumption of the economy, but certainly we can create the right conducive environment enabling the country’s economic performance.  Why should the Central Bank be interested in productivity? Our role is to maintain economic and price stability and financial system stability. We also provide necessary payments and settlement infrastructure. We advise the government in economic affairs and policy making, and we provide important agency services such as exchange control, public debt management, provident fund management and regional development activity. In all these functions, our Mission is to “contribute to Sri Lanka’s prosperity”. At the same time, the Central Bank widely pronounces the theme of “success through productivity”.  4 BIS Review 116/2008 
But, obviously this cannot be done by ourselves… The success through productivity needs a consolidated national effort. That is why we all have to push ourselves to a greater productivity level. We have to,  • work smarter, • combine better, • deliver results, • get it right. It should be noted that the private sector has continued to make commendable efforts in order to improve productivity in the country. What can the ICC Sri Lanka do? ICC Sri Lanka too can play a prominent and essential role. Since your organization establishes the business stance on broad issues of trade and investment policy as well as on vital technical or sectoral subjects including financial services, information technology, telecommunication, marketing, environment, transportation and etc., a vital role can be played in articulating the need for improving productivity. Do it now. This will be a major contribution that you make to our country. BIS Review 116/2008 5 
José Manuel González-Páramo: Central banks and the financial turmoil Speech by Mr José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Eleventh Annual International Banking Conference “Credit Market Turmoil in 2007-08: Implications for Public Policy”, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Chicago, 25 September 2008. *      *      * 1.  Introduction1  Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here in Chicago on the occasion of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s Eleventh Annual International Banking Conference. Since its inception, this conference series has aimed to gather prominent academics, policy-makers and market participants to discuss issues of major importance for our banking industries, financial systems and economies at large, such as asset price bubbles, systemic financial instability, cross-border banking, or financial globalisation.  Over time, a permanent concern of the organisers has been to focus on the implications for monetary and regulatory policies and, more generally, for public policies of such phenomena. It is fair to say that a great deal of knowledge has accumulated over time thanks to this series of conferences. It is also reasonable to reckon that the foundations of this body of knowledge have been put to the test by the financial market turmoil over the past year. When the Tenth Annual International Banking Conference took place in September of last year, the market turmoil had already broken out and central banks were already engaged in interventions aiming to minimise the disruptions to money markets and to preserve the implementation of their desired monetary policy stance. While market data on future interest rates suggested that we were in for a rather protracted period of tensions in money and credit markets, it was not obvious at the time that the financial turmoil would turn out to be one of the most challenging events of the last century for our financial systems.  Indeed, the international financial landscape looks today very different compared to one year ago and almost every day new events contribute to re-shape it further. In particular, over the past two weeks adverse events occurred almost on a daily basis and led to increased uncertainty and significant financial market volatility. A large bank failed, while several financial institutions had to be partly or entirely taken over by others. In response to the renewed tensions, public authorities announced a number of measures and initiatives to address problems at both stressed markets and troubled individual institutions. In particular, central banks stepped up their efforts to inject liquidity in global money markets in order to guarantee their smooth functioning. As I mentioned earlier, one of the main objectives of this series of conferences is to discuss the main lessons for public policies arising from developments in the international banking and financial sector. The continuation of the market turmoil does not allow me to talk to you with the benefit of detachment and the comfort of an ex-post assessment. However, I should like to take advantage of the occasion to share with you some considerations on the ECB’s response to the market turmoil drawing on the experience of the past year.                                                  1  I am very grateful to Cornelia Holthausen for her valuable contributions. BIS Review 116/2008 1 
2.  The separation between monetary policy formulation and its implementation Central bankers have, naturally, eyed the developments of the past year of financial turmoil –and, particularly, their recent intensification – with great concern, as they have the potential to influence adversely the ability of central banks to steer monetary policy rates, affect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and, more generally, may pose a threat to financial stability. Once the credit concerns that had built up in the sub-prime mortgage market segment started to affect interest rates and traded volumes in the euro area money market, the ECB responded to these highly unusual market events by timely and forcefully adjusting its liquidity policy. I will not deal with the specificities of the ECB’s liquidity management over the past year – this will be carried out by the ECB staff in tomorrow’s session on “The Experience with Crisis Management” – but I would like to stress one fundamental principle underlying our response to the turmoil: “the separation principle”. This principle relates to the dichotomy between the ECB’s monetary policy and its liquidity policy or, in other words, between the formulation and implementation of monetary policy.  During the turmoil, the separation principle proved to be very effective. Supported by the flexibility of its operational framework, the ECB was able to react in a flexible and quick manner to a changing market environment, and it allowed the steering of interest rates close to the policy rate by means of temporary quantity adjustments, albeit without increasing the aggregate supply of euro liquidity to the banking sector. The main objective of the ECB’s immediate and lasting responses to tensions in the money market was to keep under to control the very short-term interest rates as the first step in the transmission of monetary policy. Broadly speaking, the ECB’s liquidity policy response consisted of three elements: First, it changed the timing of the liquidity provision within the maintenance period (the so-called “front-loading policy”), and thereby allowed banks to build up temporary liquidity buffers. Second, it lengthened the average maturity of its tender operations: before the turmoil, the bulk of liquidity was supplied through one-week operations, and only about 30% was auctioned for three months. As the turmoil unfolded, the ECB gradually increased the share of the three-month operations and moreover introduced a six-month maturity operation. Finally, it participated in the joint coordination effort of an increasing number of central banks around the world within the context of the Term Auction Facility.  More specifically, in collaboration with the Federal Reserve, the ECB offered US dollar liquidity to European banks at various maturities in order to satisfy the exceptional demand for those funds. I believe that all of these actions proved to be effective in easing the tensions at the short-term end of the global money markets and in maintaining control of short-term interest rates in the euro area. I am sure that global money and funding markets will continue to benefit from our very close cooperation in the times to come. Still, term interest rates in the money market continue to be strongly influenced by credit concerns and, not surprisingly, have proved to be only marginally sensitive to changes in liquidity policy.  As a result, the transmission of monetary policy for the economy at large is affected by the ongoing turmoil. I will now turn to this very question. 3.  The impact of the turmoil on the monetary transmission mechanism During the current turmoil, the role of banks in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy has been brought to the forefront. In Europe, as you know, universal banks continue to be important players in the financial landscape. This is why they also play a crucial role for the transmission of monetary policy, as upheld by several theories, notably the bank lending 2 BIS Review 116/2008 
channel, and supportive empirical findings.2 According to this theory, the pass-through of changes in monetary policy interest rates to the real sector of the economy is influenced by banks’ ability to provide credit to firms. This applies, in particular, to banks with less liquid balance sheets, often the smaller banks.3 With a bank lending channel, the effects of monetary tightening on the supply of credit becomes more pronounced.  The European banking sector has undergone a phase of some structural changes over the past years. In particular, as in other parts of the world, the European market for structured financial products, such as asset-backed securities or Collateralized Debt Obligations, has grown rapidly over the last decade. For instance, the quarterly issuance of euro-denominated asset-backed securities increased from just under €20 billion at the beginning of the present decade to above €150 billion in the second quarter of this year.4 These developments potentially influence banks’ ability to grant credit.5  Such changes are important for the conduct of monetary policy because, first, they affect monetary analysis (one of the pillars of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy), and second, because they are likely to affect the monetary transmission mechanism. On the one hand, increased securitisation is expected to weaken the effects of the bank lending channel by dampening the effect of monetary tightening on the supply of credit. Indeed, some evidence points to the fact that the supply of loans is positively affected by securitisation.6 On the other hand, a more developed and efficient financial system can contribute to a more effective and smooth transmission of monetary policy.7  At the root of the problems that led to the current financial turmoil is precisely this growing segment of the financial industry. As valuations of asset-backed securities and other assets declined rapidly, and, in fact, the whole securitisation model was shaken, the outstanding amount of structured products decreased significantly. Obviously, this affects bank credit: according to the latest bank lending survey conducted in the euro area, more than 80% of banks judged that difficulties in raising funds via securitisation have had a negative impact on bank lending.8  Overall, the financial turmoil may have affected the efficient working of the banking sector and might have an impact on the supply of credit to the non-financial sector. In light of the fact that bank lending remains strong (the annual rate of growth of loans to non-financial corporations in August 2008 was a still robust 12.6 per cent), it is too early to quantify the extent to which the turmoil may influence the provision of loans. Needless to say, the Eurosystem, and undoubtedly other central banks, will continue to closely monitor the situation.                                                  2  See Bernanke, B. and M.

BIS Review 116/2008 3 
4.  The role of uncertainty One of the most relevant features of the current turmoil has been the high degree of asymmetric information and the enormous increase in general uncertainty in the financial sector. I would like to distinguish between the two in the following way:9  Uncertainty owes mainly to imperfect information in relation to credit valuations. Uncertainty generally increased during the summer of 2007, because market participants realised that the current practices used for valuations – often based almost solely on ratings – were no longer valid. With this type of uncertainty, market participants have difficulty in modelling the expected occurrence of defaults. Credit spreads can widen, also at the short end.10 Another typical effect is the flight-to-quality phenomenon: as in previous episodes of high uncertainty, during the turmoil savers have shunned equity and credit risk products in favour of government bonds and commodities as well as cash and bank deposits. As a result, bank deposits increased significantly. The term asymmetric information, on the other hand, applies to an adverse selection problem, notably in the interbank market, where market players can no longer distinguish solvent from insolvent borrowers. Such a “lemon’s problem” induces banks to demand high risk premia of their creditors and lead to a general increase in interbank market rates. Moreover, it can lead to the rationing of credit provision. Indeed, during the turmoil, a general tightening of credit standards has occurred and has been intense and wide-spread. Counterparty credit risk and uncertainty about the development of entire segments of the financial market – notably of more complex instruments such as collateralised debt obligations and other related products – were important elements in the development of the turmoil. Central banks have to deal with this increase in uncertainty on several accounts. First, monetary policy needs to take into account the heightened uncertainty: central banks need to refine their monetary and financial analysis, and monitor extremely closely the developments in the financial system and their impact on the pass-through of policy rates to the economy. Second, and to turn to the beginning of my remarks, liquidity management has become more active. Counterparty credit risk as well as uncertainty about the development of own liquidity needs have led banks to hoard liquidity and impaired the normal functioning of money markets. As a consequence, the liquidity provided to the market does not circulate as smoothly as it does in normal times. Moreover, the nervousness of market players sometimes implies stronger than anticipated interest rate reactions.  5.  Conclusion I would like to conclude by saying that monetary policy implementation has certainly become a more challenging task as a result of the current financial turmoil. At the same time, the flexibility of the ECB’s operational framework has very much helped us in coping with the turmoil. The ECB has been able to maintain control over the short end of the money market, though – not surprisingly – our influence on longer maturities, where prices are driven mainly by credit concerns, remained limited.  At the ECB we believe that the separation principle, i.e. the separation of liquidity policy measures from any considerations about the monetary policy stance, has served us well.                                                  9  On this subject, see Cassola, N., M. Drehmann, P. Hartmann, M. lo Duca, and M. Scheicher (2008): “A Research perspective on the propagation of the credit market turmoil”, ECB Research Bulletin No. 7, June 2008. 10  This has been modelled formally by Duffie and Lando (2001): “Term structure of credit spreads with incomplete accounting information”, Econometrica 69, pp. 633-664. 4 BIS Review 116/2008 
Indeed, the liquidity policy aided the transmission of monetary policy even in the turbulent times experienced over the past year, while monetary policy was left free to focus on its overriding objective of ensuring price stability. I strongly believe that especially at times of high uncertainty and rising inflationary pressures like the present, a stable and predictable central bank policy and the firm anchoring of inflationary expectations are of particular importance. There is no doubt that these are very challenging times for our economies. Some scientists argue that wildfires can be in the long run beneficial to wildlife as over time barren burned areas are covered by healthier new growth. Without pushing too far the analogy, let’s hope that the equivalent applies to the weakest segments of our financial systems. This will very much depend on the ability of all concerned parties – both public and private – to draw the right lessons and thoroughly implement them.  Bearing this in mind, I look forward to the second day of this conference, during which the regulatory implications of the ongoing events shall be discussed. I wish you all a pleasant evening.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Interview with Hospodárske noviny Interview with Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, conducted on 21 September 2008 in Bratislava by Ms Ľubomíra Raková (Hospodárske noviny), and published on 23 September 2008. *      *      * How will Slovakia’s entry to the euro area change your decisions about interest rates? We are working our monetary policy for the full body of the euro area. We are, as you know, presently 15, and we will be 16 as soon as Slovakia enters on the 1st January next year. We are presently 320 million and we will be 325.5 million. So it is for the sake of 325.5 million that we are taking our decisions. And on the bases of the integrated analysis that we have on the full body of the euro area, exactly like the Federal Reserve itself is looking at absolutely all the USA with Alaska, as well as Florida, California and Massachusetts. So, as soon as you are in, you are integrated in this overall assessment of what is appropriate for again 325,5 million fellow citizens, for whose, this fellow citizens, we have exactly the same definition of price stability, as we had since the very beginning. We started with eleven, then twelve, then 13, then 15, and so we clearly have the same definition of price stability in the medium term, which is less than 2%, close to 2% at the level of euro area as a whole. My colleagues and myself, Governor Šramko with all the other members of the Governing Council – we will be 22 to take the decision, not 21 as we are now – we will again make a judgement of what is good for 325,5 million citizens. People in Slovakia are afraid of rising prices after January 2009. Even ECB describes some doubts about sustainability of inflation in Slovakia in the convergence report. What should our government do against the inflation? The ECB is responsible for price stability at the level of the euro area. Price stability means in the medium term less than 2 percent, close to two percent as an average for the euro area. We have encouraged Slovakia, and all economies and countries before entering into the euro area, to care for price stability to be sustainable in the medium and long run. This is our strong message. And we have always given that message not particularly to Slovakia, but to all countries. We always insist on the sustainability of price stability. So we would call upon the authorities to prepare the changeover in the best fashion possible, with extreme care. We would also tell the people, the customers, the households: be vigilant, in a market economy prices depend on supply and demand. They depend on the vigilance of the consumers, who must have the maximum level of vigilance at the moment of the changeover, this is truth.  What should our government do against the inflation? Again, structural reforms are absolutely of the essence, because they improve competition and competition is necessary to care for stable prices. It is a crucial element which permits to have stable prices. So we would encourage the government of Slovakia to pursue reforms. We would also ask all governments, not particularly in Slovakia, but including Slovakia, to strictly respect the stability and growth pact. It is essential for the coordination and solidity of the euro area. It also permits to avoid inflationary pressures.  BIS Review 115/2008 1 
As you look back on the two years of our current government, do you think it does enough in fiscal policy and structural reforms to fight against inflation? One should always encourage governments to go in this direction, so I would say yes, number of structural reforms has been made and that is encouraging for the future, but this is not a reason for complacency and it has to continue very actively. Slovakia just adopted a law which allows the government to regulate the prices in some cases. Do you think it is necessary to have such law for Slovakia because of the euro? It has to be examined very carefully. I have to say, at this stage I do not have the complete analysis of this legislation, we will look at it very carefully. Again, what counts essentially in a market economy is the level of competition, that you have between the producers, and the vigilance of the consumers themselves so that they exert maximum pressure on competition to work well. There was a suspicion about insider trading in Slovakia before second change of central parity. Did you hear about it and what do you think? I heard about it because it was public. I have no opinion on that. We considered in the ECB that it was a matter to be examined by the authorities in Slovakia. What impact could have the financial crisis on eurozone and what impact it would have on Slovakia after entering euro area? Slovakia is part of the global economy and Slovakia is in the global economy, as is the euro area and of course the USA. So I don’t think, that the financial turbulences that we are observing have to be analysed in connection with the transition with the entry into the euro area. All what I would say at this stage is that probably Slovakia, which is already in the eyes of all market participants in the euro area, doesn’t feel the turbulences as perhaps others, that are not yet considered as being in the euro area. The euro area is certainly a protection against too much turbulences in the present universe. But that being said, we are looking very carefully in the ECB at the situation. We have said since the very beginning of the financial turbulences that we would have the monetary policy stance, that would be designed to deliver price stability in the medium term and we would implement that monetary policy and refinance the banks on the money markets in order for the short term interest rates in the money market to be as close as possible to our policy rates. This is what we have been doing since the very beginning. We just published recently staff projections and they are incorporating all information that was coming, not only from the USA but also from Asia, from Latin America, from the emerging markets of the other continents and from Central and Eastern Europe in order to have the best possible projections. We have to take into account absolutely everything at a global level when we are doing our own staff projections. Some analysts say the crisis may be over in one year. What would you think about it? I would say that it is an ongoing process. It is a market correction of great dimension which is ongoing with this episode of turbulences, of hectic behaviour of the markets. You mentioned already your definition of price stability, but the inflation in euro area is higher. What are the dangers? The present headline CPI is at a level which incorporates the price of oil, the price of commodities, the shocks at the global level we have to cope with. And we have to deliver 2 BIS Review 115/2008 
price stability in the medium term, which means less then two, close to two percent. That being said, in order to deliver price stability in the medium term, in line with our definition, we must avoid any second round effects of both price setting as well as wage negotiations. To the contrary, we will do all what is necessary for inflation to go down, back to our definition of price stability. As our mandate is requiring, and as our fellow citizens are asking us, and they are very keen on asking us to deliver price stability. This is necessary for sustainable growth and sustainable job creation. And that is the reason why we recommend not only towards the social partners but also price setters to strictly avoid those second round effects. BIS Review 115/2008 3 
Ardian Fullani: The banking system – promoter of economic development Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the regional meeting “The banking system – promoter of economic development”, Kukës, 12 September 2008. *      *      * Dear Governor, Dear Mayor of Kukës Municipality, Dear Mayor of Prizren Municipality, Dear Mr. Uldedaj, Dear Mr. Basha, Dear participants, I am delighted to be here today and there are many good reasons why I was looking forward to this gathering.  For the second time within a relatively short period of time I see this gigantic engineering work growing every day and taking its final shape. Every single person visiting the road segment Rëshen – Kalimash understands that what they have in front of them is an extraordinary engineering, civil, useful, far-sighted and patriotic work.  Similarly, my return to Kukës after quite a long time has surprised me. There is now a completed airport, cross-border activity has intensified, the climate is extraordinary and soon this town will turn into a city with modern infrastructure. Numerous opportunities are ahead of you. Your cleverness stands in perceiving them and making use of them cleverly in order to enhance the opportunities of the Kukës community and the North-East region.  The other reason for making me feel delighted is the presence of my Kosovar counterpart, Mr. Hashim Rexhepi. This meeting is of special significance. The Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo is now growing and consolidating day after day under the management of an Albanian professional unlike some time ago when the management of the central bank was the task of a foreign central banker.  Meetings of this kind are now turning into a tradition. After holding similar meetings in Korça, Gjirokastra, Shkodra and Saranda we are now being introduced with a new reality of the North-East region, and I believe that the town of Kukës plays a key role in this area. Through these regional meetings we aim to be in touch with the economic and financial reality of different regions in Albania. Given the weather, cultural, social, geographical, demographic, objective and subjective characteristics, each region has different economic and social development opportunities and levels. From this viewpoint, we aim to fully be acquainted with these specific characteristics, identify all the financial and natural resources, formulate “recipes” and other advice which would help in making more rational use of them.  Beyond what I previously stated, I would like to clarify that the exploration of the potentials that the different regions have to offer and the identification of their level of use is also essential in terms of the banking system’s activity, in particular of the geographic expansion and financial intermediation.  Another major reason motivating the Bank of Albania to organize these meetings relates with the establishment of a more effective communication channel between the Bank of Albania and the public. We believe that the direct contact with various social groups in different geographic regions (that is to each and every family), in addition to the traditional means of communication, press conferences, monetary policy or financial stability reports, is a very efficient tool and frequently determinant.  BIS Review 115/2008 1 
I would like to dwell today on some matters of interest to the entire audience. First I would like to make a brief outline of the Bank of Albania’s latest analysis of the economic and financial situation in Albania: In brief, three are the main developments of greatest interest to the audience:  With regard to the international developments, the economic and financial situation has been very complex in the last months. Inflation has turned into a point of concern in most foreign economies, mainly driven by the high prices of raw materials, oil and food. In addition, economic activity in developed economies has experienced sharp turns. Euro area economy is at present in front of many questions, while the US and some Asian economies have shown slow rates of economic growth. Credit crisis has caused many reputable international institutions to experience large financial losses and its contamination process is still present. Recently, the two US mortgage giants, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which were on the verge of collapse, were subject to an unprecedented and costly rescue plan designed by the US Treasury Department. All these issues have triggered uncertainties in the markets, causing the future forecasts to be more challenging and the participants’ exasperation to peak.  I would consider the immunity shown by our economy in terms of price stability as the most outstanding development. Albania’s economic activity is progressing in line with our previous expectations. A few days ago, INSTAT published the inflation figure for August 2008, according to which annual inflation marked 2.5%. Following a 12-month period of inflation rates standing at around 4-4.5%, in line with our forecasts, it is assessed that inflation will fluctuate in the next few months at around 3%, which is our quantitative objective.  Worth to note, however, is that the risk for its upward deviation is still present and it mostly relates with the international developments mentioned above. The main risks stemming from the internal environment relate to any possible deterioration of the energy situation and the plausible implications with the fiscal situation in the future. For the moment, the main risk stems from the lagged effects (otherwise referred to as second round effects) of certain developments such as the rise of wages beyond an acknowledged logical level. Any similar rise would generate new inflation, to later impose another rise in wages, which in turn would again and again trigger inflation. I do not think this is the right path. Wage-inflation spirals have been studied relatively early and they represent the least appropriate recipes to offset the inflation effects.  I would like now to move to the latest performance of the banking system, with both its good sides and the risks associated with them. The Albanian banking system is going through a phase of swift development and promotion of new products. I believe you have noticed that many banks have been engaged in aggressive marketing strategies which promote different types of household loans and terms and attractive interest rates for deposits collection. In addition, banks’ branches and agencies have constantly expanded. Only during the present year, 73 new branches and agencies have been opened and 15 others are in the process of being opened.  The same characteristics more or less apply to the District of Kukës as well. Currently, six private banks perform their banking business in Kukës, while two other banks are in the process of commencing to operate. As of end June 2008, the banking system has extended a total of about 1.2 billion leks of new credit (around 15 million USD) of which 66% to households and the rest to the businesses in the area. It is nice to notice that this figure accounts for about 66% of deposits collected in this region, providing evidence for a relatively high financial intermediation level.  The rapid development of the banking system, the high competition in the banking market and banks’ eagerness to win their market shares requires greater prudence. The Bank of Albania has taken a number of measures to increase prudence in view of attaining the banking system stability. In its last meeting, the Supervisory Council of the Bank of Albania took the following decisions:  2 BIS Review 115/2008 
• Some amendments to the regulation “On risk management in the activity of foreign banks’ branches”;  • Some amendments to the regulation “On capital adequacy ratio”;  • Some amendments to the regulation “On credit risk management”;  • Approval of the regulation “On minimum requirements for information disclosure from banks and branches of foreign banks”;  • Approval of the regulation “On transparency of banking and financial products and services”.  The entire package of regulations was launched in the open forum we had this spring with the banking system. This package aims to better discipline the banking system in terms of assessing credit risks, setting penalties for banks when non-performing loans increase, encouraging lending in lek and enhancing transparency with bank clients for each product and service.  Dwelling further on the issue of financial stability, I would like to underline that the Bank of Albania is scrutinizing cautiously the developments in the external sector of the economy, which for the moment remain a concern in terms of long-term developments in economy. The stable growth of imports in goods and services and the current deficit deepening require special attention. The main implications relate among others with the financial stability at home while they have their roots in the imposed correction of long-term imbalances within a very short period of time.  Triggered by the increase of real estates prices, the steady appreciation of the lek, workers’ remittances and the rapid growth of credit and budget expenditure during the present year, the high current deficits have become a dominant phenomenon in the external sector of the economy. Their automatic and abrupt adjustment would prompt the correction of exchange rates to the rapid and strong depreciation of the lek, drop in private and public consumption and reduced economic activity which could generate crisis in the external sector and spread to economy, hence, jeopardizing the financial stability at home. Availing myself of this opportunity to address to the audience I would like to explore this issue further. Skipping the theoretical arguments, I would note that the high current deficits mainly originate from the consumers’ behaviour. In plain words, what I am trying to say is that in a general economic level we consume more than we produce. This extra consumption, which is mainly financed by borrowing, is mainly driven by our expectations for higher income in the future. That is, in a household level, there is deficit, triggered by the insufficient income to cover household consumption.  The international financial crisis and the negative consequences on the global economic and financial activity stem from household consumption beyond the sources (providing additional financing from banking loans) and the rise of real estates prices. This consumption approach was followed by the increase of current deficit and long-term liabilities for households.  When these liabilities exceeded the long-term equilibrium level, the household sector could no longer pay off the accumulated debt.  What were the consequences?  An extreme and constrained adjustment of consumer behaviour and approach. Households could no longer pay their debts to banks and maintain the same level of consumption. These individual imbalances altogether appeared in a macro level, mainly in the form of abrupt fall of demand, slower economic activity and depreciation of the exchange rate (US dollar depreciation). Naturally, the financial system could not escape from being affected by this challenging contagion.  BIS Review 115/2008 3 
What I have stated above points out the necessity of making thorough analysis at a micro level in addition to the macro ones. That is, the recipes for attaining a stable macroeconomic situation should begin and be sustained by prudent analyses at a micro level.  It is for this reason that I would like to dwell on and explore one of the indicators that affects the structure and modelling of household budget. I refer here to workers’ remittances which have played a key role in smoothing consumption and at a lower level, meeting investment needs, mainly for real estates and small household businesses. Remittances have somehow offset the low productivity and the negative effects triggered by unemployment. In addition, they have helped to preserve financial stability, by establishing more balanced ratios between income and expenditure.  Given the importance of workers’ remittances, one would rightly raise the following question: What is their perspective? How can they be managed more effectively?  For a relatively long period of time, they have been vital to our country. According to a Bank of Albania survey on the first quarter of 2008, about 26% of Albanian households living in the territory of the Republic of Albania are recipients of remittances from abroad. Households’ geographical distribution indicates that 59% of recipient families live in the rural areas while the rest in the urban ones, receiving about 66% and 34% of total workers’ remittances, respectively. Remittances represent the most important component of rural families’ monthly income, accounting for about 40%.  The largest part of workers’ remittances (about 70%) for the first quarter of 2008 was used for non-productive purposes. About 48% was used for consumption, which entails meeting households’ everyday needs for food, clothes, furniture, etc., 16% for construction and reconstruction and 10% for education and medical purposes.  Around 19% of remittances are used for investment and savings, providing evidence for their economic impact on Albania.  Despite these figures, their future prospective is yet unclear. The integration of Albanians into their host countries, their economic and financial situation and other similar reasons have a negative impact in the long term. Our analyses and assessments show that the difficult economic situation the developed economies have been experiencing, expressed in the economic slowdown, unemployment growth and increase of inflation, has also provided its impact on the performance of remittances which have grown less this year relative to the previous years. Empirical studies of the Bank of Albania show that the cease of these flows would put our consumption model and the long-term balance of the external sector of the economy in the difficult position.  Our concern related to the household budget stands in the fact that the behaviour model we adopt at a household level can also affect the behaviour model of given regions.  The Albanian economy has by and large made evident progress, detaching itself from the IDA country group. Macroeconomic indicators have for a relatively long period been positive and stable. However, beyond the nationwide average indicators, detailed statistics by regions indicate that welfare in mountain areas has progressed at slower rates relative to the other regions. According to World Bank assessments, an average resident in the mountain area has 12% less per capita real consumption than the average resident in Tirana, while in 2002 this figure was 9%. According to the same source, the average rural coast resident has 34% higher per capita consumption than the average mountain rural resident. Generally, poverty has a strong positive relation with the family size and a negative relation with age and education.  In contrast, the District of Kukës has great potentials for more prosperity in this area. First, your district is distinguished for its rare natural beauty and diversity from the mountain and ethnographic tourism viewpoint. The opening of the border with Kosovo in particular has provided us with real opportunities to perceive the Northern Alps as a single complex with their continuity to Kosovo and why not to Montenegro. I think the completed airport, which 4 BIS Review 115/2008 
could very well be used for the transportation of winter sports fanatics, is another strong point. It is the local authorities’ task, to undertake in co-operation with the local stakeholders projects and feasibility studies, which in a later time may be submitted and presented to the central authorities or the specialized international operators. I would like to inform you that at the moment, their interest is overwhelming and concrete. Time is ripe for you to increase the marketing of these potentials and point out their strong advantages accurately.  Second, your district is well-known for being rich in minerals. I do not know if you have any geological inventories or maps which accurately identify the mineral resources. If you don’t, this is too late. The current price structure is very favourable and I believe that any reactivation of existing mines and the opening of new mines implies more employment, more hope for this region and fewer migratory movements.  Third, your district, in particular the town of Kukës, finds itself in a crucial economic crossroad, not only in terms of roads but also of air. Unfortunately, statistical information related to cross-border economic and financial activity is missing. Nonetheless, I have to admit that the potentials are not being rightly handled. We are the same people, speaking the same language and sharing the same customs, hence, there is no point for us to be held back by the absurd barriers of time. The completion of the new road and its stretch to the largest harbour in the country create the proper grounds to turn the Kukës town into an extraordinary transit point for passengers, goods, services, art and culture.  Fourth, your district should make clever and great use of the presence of a university in this town. My call is just plain: invest in mobilizing a professional and specialized teaching team. Spend on education, on knowledge and the culture it produces. In this context, the local government could set financial stimuli. The final goal will be to establish a national educational centre, which serves to the local community living on both sides of the border. I honestly hope the future managers grow and be a product of this university.  Fifth, I believe you should pay your utmost attention to the presentation and spreading out of information on the potentials your district has to offer. Pretending you possess something that is worth it is only one side of the coin. The other is how able you are to find buyers, to get them buy what you want to sell. In this context, the complete identification, regulation, presentation and promotion of these great potentials are of prime priority. For analogy purposes, I would like to bring an example: It is now for two years that the Bank of Albania has been organizing the yearly competition “The Governor’s Award for the best diploma thesis”. Last year, the third prize went to a student of the University of Shkodra for a very original thesis which introduced the potentials and opportunities of the Puka Region, the development of mountain tourism and the positive macroeconomic impact it will bring to the region. This paper was assigned a prize for the originality of the topic chosen to be explored and the economic impact its presentation may have. The thesis did not only seek to present a profitable business opportunity, but also make an assessment of the positive impact this investment would have on the life of the community. The positive influence on the latter is crucial for important strategic investors. We awarded this paper not only for its original exploration by a passionate student from Puka, but also to increase public awareness and promote this new and modern mentality. When a single student manages to produce this much, a university, a local community and all of us together have great potentials to achieve even more. I brought with me today a copy of this thesis.  Dear participants, I tried to briefly discuss some issues that I personally find vital and benefiting for you and the Bank of Albania. Perhaps my speech may have sounded somehow provoking; however I believe this is the right time for us to put a halt to some transition phenomena or impairments. Although I am aware of the numerous and complex problems, I can clearly see some light at the end of the tunnel. The chances are right there. Our duty is not to waste them. On behalf of the Bank of Albania I assure each institution, individual, company, BIS Review 115/2008 5 
undertaking or initiative that we are open to collaborate for the best of future progress and prosperity of this community.  Thank you once again for your attention and hospitality. 6 BIS Review 115/2008 
Nout Wellink: Responding to uncertainty Remarks by Dr Nout Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the International Conference of Banking Supervisors 2008, Brussels, 24 September 2008. *      *      * Introduction Good morning and welcome to Brussels for this fifteenth International Conference of Banking Supervisors. I would like to begin by thanking Governor Guy Quaden of the National Bank of Belgian and Chairman Jean-Paul Servais of Belgium’s Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission for graciously hosting this conference. The organisation of this conference began shortly after the ICBS in Mexico ended. Despite the extensive preparation of our Belgian hosts, I do not think any kind of planning could have prepared us for what we are now experiencing in the financial markets. The events we have witnessed in the past two weeks are nothing short of extraordinary. Some of the world’s largest financial institutions have declared bankruptcy, have been purchased or have been thrown a government lifeline. Considerable uncertainty and market volatility persist and will likely continue for some time to come. The official sector, including the supervisory community, are working to promote a deleveraging process that limits as much as possible the spillover from the financial to the real economy. As supervisors, central bankers and policy makers – what are we to make of all of this? Just as we caution bankers during the good times to prepare for the rough times that inevitably lie ahead, we too must use this opportunity to assess the lessons learned to better prepare for the future. This morning I would like to share with you some of my views on the lessons the crisis has taught us and, more importantly, how we can use this experience to better prepare for the future. Clearly, we are still in the midst of this process and more lessons are likely to arise. As you know, both Belgium and my home country, the Netherlands, are on the shore of the North Sea, which can be extremely stormy at times. In the past, people were at the mercy of these storms. For instance, in 1570 more then 20,000 people died during one of the worst storms in history. So how did people react? They built dikes to protect against the floodwaters. Despite these buffers, a bit more than 50 years ago, the Netherlands as well as Belgium, the UK and Germany were caught again by an enormous flood, which flowed over the dikes – the buffers – that had been built up during the good years. I believe this story is a good metaphor for what has recently happened to the global financial system. From time to time we witness financial storms. As supervisors we learn from these experiences and build dikes, or buffers, to protect against future floods. Nevertheless, the land beneath the dikes – our financial system and economies – can erode due to the passing of time or the battering from a tremendous storm. As the builders of the dikes, it is our role to continually monitor the strength and condition of the dikes; to assess the damage caused by each storm and try to anticipate the next storm. Bankers too have an important role in preserving the soundness of the dike – supervisors by themselves can not have sole responsibility. Origins of the storm As with almost any financial crisis, leverage and risk concentrations have played a central role in the current situation. I will be quick to add, however, that leverage in and of itself was not the problem. Indeed, risk taking and leverage are essential elements in banking. Instead, what I will focus on is the manner in which these elements are managed and controlled. As in BIS Review 115/2008 1 
other financial storms, it is poor execution of the basics that are at the root of today’s problems.  Complacency – on the part of bankers and supervisors – certainly played a role. The banking industry is exceedingly optimistic during times of benign economic conditions – when the seas are calm. It is difficult to keep a proper perspective and to exercise prudent judgment when all of your competitors are generating huge volumes of business. As one banker famously said last year “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance”. Well, if it is the role of the central banker to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, perhaps the role of the supervisor is to silence the band so the bankers stop dancing.  Supervisors – for our part – tend to focus on bank-specific issues. But, as we have learned, we must also pay attention to the broader aspects of financial stability. For example, excessive leverage, risk concentrations and maturity mismatches – whether on- or off-balance sheet – are examples of destructive forces that, especially in combination, can have severe consequences for entire sectors and economies. One of the main lessons from this turmoil is clear: bankers and supervisors need to remain focused on the big picture and the longer term horizon. Risk management and oversight Let me give you a few examples of some fundamental aspects of risk management and oversight that were violated by many. As supervisors, we have seen time and time again that financial crises are characterised by the failure to adhere to basic risk management principles, especially during times of financial innovation. This crisis is no different. Weakness in fundamental underwriting principles, among other factors, was a key contributor to asset quality problems. So was poor risk management, which at some firms allowed the build-up of massive risk concentrations across the firm that further compounded already shaky asset quality. Some banks were caught completely unaware by concentrations to subprime loans that they had in their loan portfolios. Others did not fully understand their full exposure to subprime mortgages, particularly when they purchased an exposure that contained dozens of other exposures – I am of course referring here to CDOs of ABS. Poor asset quality and risk concentrations are at the heart of the turmoil involving subprime mortgages which has led to the exceptional uncertainty and volatility that we see today. These problems have been further compounded by uncertainties relating to valuation practices. What should we take away from this? That banks – and supervisors – must redouble their efforts to ensure that sound underwriting standards are in place and that there are adequate, systematic procedures for identifying firm-wide risk concentrations. Originate-to-distribute business model What other factors – aside from complacency – have hindered adoption of such basic principles? Perhaps one of the stumbling blocks has been the expanded use of the originate-to-distribute model. Managing this model’s associated risks poses significant challenges and, in some cases, has led to large risk exposures and concentrations that firms’ senior management failed to detect.  The recent problem with the originate-to-distribute model has been one of incentives. Instead of the traditional focus on a borrower’s ability to repay a loan, many banks focused instead on generating a high volume of loans, and booking as income the fees received to originate the mortgages. Many firms chose not to invest the necessary time and resources in thorough credit analysis and underwriting since someone else would be purchasing the mortgage. 2 BIS Review 115/2008 
Investors did not perform their own due diligence. Instead, they relied on the due diligence of originators and packagers, who lacked interest in exercising this due diligence. They also placed undue reliance on the judgments of the credit rating agencies, and the capacity of modern technology and diversification to manage financial risks.  What can we draw from this? The combination of excess lending with an obvious failure to adhere to fundamental and sound risk management standards not only produced significant losses in mortgage portfolios; it also tainted an asset type that was key in the broader securitisation and credit distribution process. The reckless use of the originate-to-distribute model increased uncertainty regarding credit quality, where risk resides and the impact of deterioration. This heightened uncertainty suggests that in maintaining their capital buffers – the dikes – banks need to do a better job capturing the risks related to this business model. We have to build higher dikes but must not forget the importance of building on a sound foundation, which is high quality capital. Basel II provides the necessary framework within which to achieve these enhancements. I will return to the capital issue in a moment. Liquidity Liquidity was another victim of the current storm and its demise holds valuable lessons for supervisors. Increasing banks' liquidity cushions and improving liquidity risk management and supervision has been an area of sharp focus for the Committee. We have seen massive illiquidity in certain market segments (especially complex structured products) for a much longer period than any market participant would have predicted. Complex and illiquid investor-specific instruments, such as resecuritisations, have experienced significant market-value losses, which has led to the loss of confidence in their financial worthiness and the drying up of liquidity in the short-term interbank market.  The recent turmoil has shown that banks must strengthen their liquidity buffers. One way to do this is to increase their holdings of high quality liquid securities – in particular, liquid central government securities. The Committee’s guidance on sound liquidity risk management and supervision and vigorous supervisory follow-up will help raise the bar in this area. We will continue to examine the topic of liquidity with a focus on cross-border aspects of liquidity supervision. While liquidity risk cannot be mitigated with capital, capital is itself a form of liquidity since, unlike other liabilities, it does not have to be repaid. Furthermore, a strong capital buffer enhances a bank’s creditworthiness and, from the market’s perspective, reduces its counterparty risk. This helps to ensure continued access to funding.  Capital adequacy And this brings me to the issue of capital adequacy. After several years of high profits, often record profits, we know that the level of risk was grossly underestimated by many financial institutions. This latest storm has therefore revealed cracks in the dikes and the supervisory community is in the process of patching up those cracks. High losses have put pressure on capital cushions and many banks have been forced to go to the market to replenish their capital base. This is critical if a contraction in lending and credit are to be avoided. Of greater importance, though, are the cracks in the dike that are not yet evident. While we do not know the nature and strength of the next storm, we can take measures today to strengthen the dike so it could withstand the battering. One of those measures is to significantly strengthen banks’ capital buffers. In addition to moving ahead aggressively with Basel II, the Committee has issued a proposal to strengthen the capital treatment for risks not captured under Basel II’s existing trading book regime.  In this context, the Committee is also carefully considering the topic of procyclicality, especially as it is influenced by bank capital issues. There are many dimensions here, such BIS Review 115/2008 3 
as the level and quality of capital; provisioning, capital buffers and the ability of banks to dip into those buffers. We will continue to review these and other issues related to procyclicality and are in the process of developing a work programme to address both near term and longer-term issues.  The Committee is also developing enhanced guidance under Pillar 2, the supervisory review process. Here, our focus is on improving risk management practices, such as stress testing and the management of risks arising from complex instruments, among other things. We are also developing proposals to strengthen Pillar 3 disclosures, especially for securitisation activities. Conclusion We have learned much from the severe storm that is currently raging. I have outlined some of the measures that banks and supervisors must take to better prepare for the next storm. But what is becoming increasingly clear is that, over time, the banking system needs to strengthen capital and liquidity buffers to withstand prolonged periods of stress in the financial system and the broader economy. This will be done in a manner that does not aggravate the current stress in the system. Enhancements to risk management and market transparency will help, but we must enhance banks’ buffers to reflect the increased degree of uncertainty in the system. The need for increased margins to protect against uncertainty will also become apparent as rapid financial innovation continues and uncertainty increases about how new products, valuations, markets and the real economy will interact in times of stress. This will better reflect the risks that already are inherent – but perhaps not easily recognised – in banks' portfolios, either in regulatory or internal metrics. Finally, enforcement by banks and supervisors of the basics of sound risk management and underwriting practices are key to promoting a return to financial stability. 4 BIS Review 115/2008 
Jean-Claude Trichet: The entry of Slovakia into the euro area Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the “Slovakia Euro Changeover Conference”, Bratislava, 22 September 2008. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be with you here, in Bratislava, at this conference taking place a few weeks before Slovakia joins the euro area in January 2009. Let me first congratulate all the parties who have been involved in the preparation and implementation of the euro adoption strategy since 2004. Today, we are looking forward to the launch of the single currency in Slovakia next January. This country will become the 16th member of the euro area.  1.  Slovakia’s economic achievements on its way to the euro I would like to stress that the transition to the euro of any national economy is a challenge that needs to be prepared for carefully. Slovakia, after some early difficulties, has proved to be a real success story in recent years, enjoying strong economic growth and a marked increase in employment. Average annual real GDP growth reached a remarkable 8.5% between 2005 and 2007, and average annual employment growth was close to 3% in that period. Slovakia has made notable progress in both nominal and real convergence. In respect of nominal convergence, inflation was rather volatile in the first half of this decade. But recently, the economy has seen a gradual decline in HICP inflation, reaching 1.9% in 2007, although in the first half of 2008 it rose to 3.7%. As the ECB has always stressed, low-inflation environment attained in the recent past will need to be confirmed and sustained over the years to come. The convergence of long-term interest rates has been even more dynamic, as they are now at around 5%, more than a third less than they were earlier this decade. It’s a change that reflects the confidence of financial markets participants in the policies pursued by the authorities. Some progress has also been achieved with regard to the consolidation of public finances. However, the ECOFIN Council brought the excessive deficit procedure for Slovakia to an end as recently as June this year. Looking ahead, an ambitious additional consolidation effort appears necessary if Slovakia is to reach its medium-term objective for the structural deficit of 0.8% of GDP in 2010.  The vitality of the country’s economy can be seen by comparing its real GDP growth with that of the euro area. Between 2000 and 2007 average economic growth in Slovakia was 5.6%, significantly above the average economic growth in the euro area. This resulted in real economic convergence as the GDP per inhabitant in purchasing power parity terms as a percentage of the GDP per inhabitant of the “euro area” increased from below 44% in 2000 to above 62% in 2007. The good times for the Slovak economy are exemplified by rising real incomes. Importantly, the gains in prosperity have also spread beyond the country’s economic heart in Bratislava, even though considerable disparities between regions still exist. Slovakia has experienced only limited external economic imbalances in recent years. The current account deficit remained relatively contained in the past few years and, due to increasing export capacities, it has in fact been shrinking lately. Unit labour costs have until recently favoured the competitiveness of Slovak producers.  The koruna has participated in the exchange rate mechanism II since November 2005. The underlying strong macroeconomic performance has led to a gradual appreciation of the BIS Review 114/2008 1 
nominal exchange rate against the euro, without impairing the competitiveness of Slovak exporters. Reflecting strong macroeconomic fundamentals, the central parity of the Slovak koruna against the euro was revalued by 8.5% and 17.65% in March 2007 and May 2008, respectively.  Economic progress in Slovakia has been based on a series of structural reforms. The substantial reforms of taxes and social benefits together with a greater flexibility in product and labour markets have brought Slovakia to the attention of foreign investors. The ensuing inflow of foreign direct investment has boosted the economy and promoted rapid real GDP growth.  And these days, more than ever, the pace of reforms from earlier years has to be maintained in order to reap all the benefits of euro adoption.  2.  Sustainable convergence is key  Euro adoption by Slovakia implies that the benefits of the Single Market will be further enhanced by the single currency. The euro offers a credible framework for price stability as it removes exchange rate uncertainty within the euro area. Slovakia will benefit from the stability-oriented policy of the ECB, which will help to anchor inflation expectations. Furthermore, euro adoption may help to shield Slovakia, a small and highly open economy, against the effects of international financial turbulence, which often has disproportionate effects on smaller economies.  However, for the euro to remain a success story in Slovakia, the national authorities will need to be very alert and pursue ambitious economic policies on all fronts. Our main concern is that Slovakia, being a catching-up economy, is likely to face inflationary pressures that could derail the economy from a sustainable convergence path after euro adoption. Top priority must therefore be given to the sustainable economic convergence of the Slovak economy towards the more mature countries of the euro area. This certainly cannot be seen as an automatic outcome of joining the euro area – indeed, it will require major efforts in the years to come from all parties concerned.  We appreciate the fact that the Slovak authorities have firmly committed themselves to pursuing appropriate supportive policies – ones which aim in particular to maintain sustainable convergence, underpin external competitiveness and strengthen economic resilience. Fulfilling these commitments is vital for the Slovak economy to function smoothly within the euro area.  Let me stress three areas that we consider crucial for preserving sustainable convergence in Slovakia.  Firstly, after euro adoption, when monetary policy is no longer autonomous, a rigorous and credible implementation of fiscal policy in line with the Stability and Growth Pact commitments is essential to contain inflationary pressures in the economy. To this purpose, the fiscal adjustment in structural terms must be at least 0.5% of GDP per year until the medium-term objective is reached in 2010.  Secondly, the functioning of Slovakia’s labour market must be further improved and the high structural unemployment reduced. While the reform of the educational system might help to reduce unemployment in the medium term, making labour legislation more flexible as well as eliminating existing wage rigidities would help to alleviate pressures in the labour market more rapidly. Any temptation to introduce wage indexation schemes should be resisted; social partners should focus on labour productivity growth and competitiveness as the main factors in any wage adjustments. Refraining from any kind of mechanical wage indexation is particularly important today to avoid any spillovers from the recent more elevated levels of inflation to wages and salaries.  2 BIS Review 114/2008 
Thirdly, the authorities must also focus on further improving the business environment in Slovakia in order to enhance productivity growth and continue to attract foreign capital. The strengthening of the competitive environment should be seen as a prerequisite for any further initiatives.  Commitment by all policy actors is key. Only a decisive approach by the government and social partners in these areas would, in our view, help to keep Slovakia’s inflation on a sustainable track in the future.  The Slovak authorities must be ambitious in pursuing sound economic policies that, jointly with the stability-oriented policy of the ECB, will bring sustainable economic growth, job creation and social cohesion for the people of Slovakia.  3.  Preparations for the changeover The ECB values the fruitful cooperation that has developed with Národná banka Slovenska over the last couple of years. The Governor of the National Bank of Slovakia has been a member of the General Council of the ECB since May 2004 and an observer at the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB since mid-July 2008.  On 1 January 2009 the euro will become legal tender in Slovakia. Great efforts have already been made, and even greater ones will be made, to ensure that the people of Slovakia are well-informed about euro coins and euro banknotes, and in particular their security features. The European Central Bank and the Eurosystem have helped in the preparations for the introduction of the euro in Slovakia.  188 million euro banknotes will initially be needed, and these will be taken from the Eurosystem stocks. The Oesterreichische Nationalbank, as the closest euro area neighbour, will be arranging the delivery of the cash, on behalf of the Eurosystem.  While euro cash is already being used to some extent in Slovakia due to its proximity to the euro area, the pre-launch distribution of euro cash to banks – the “frontloading” – and its subsequent “sub-frontloading” to retailers and other businesses remains important in order to make banknotes and coins widely available as quickly as possible. The frontloading has just begun. In addition, 1.2 million coin mini kits will be sold to the public as from 1 December. The Eurosystem will continue to support the campaign informing people about their new currency and its introduction. As part of this joint campaign, many seminars and training sessions have been held, and over seven million copies of various publications – that’s more than the country’s population – have been produced by the ECB. Over two million leaflets and four million conversion cards, which show the most important security features of the €20 banknote, will shortly be sent to all households in the country by the National Bank of Slovakia. The bank wants to be certain that everyone is well prepared for the changeover.  One symbol of the excellent partnership between Národná banka Slovenska and the ECB is the Euro Exhibition, which I had the honour to open yesterday. It will give the public a chance to learn more about their new currency. It’s one of many joint efforts that will lead to the successful launch of the euro in Slovakia. I’m confident of this.  Ladies and gentlemen, let me again congratulate you all on your achievements during the run-up to the euro in Slovakia. I’d also like to take this opportunity to urge the Slovak authorities to continue with their prudent economic policies. In other words, to remain on the path of fiscal consolidation so as to improve the sustainability of public finances and also to keep working on structural reforms. These policies should address the real challenges that lie ahead.  Even though it is a little while until the euro becomes a reality in people’s wallets, I am looking forward to welcoming Národná banka Slovenska to the Eurosystem, and Slovakia to the euro area. Vitaj Slovensko! Welcome, Slovakia! BIS Review 114/2008 3 
Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile: Bank of Uganda’s 5-Year Financial Markets Development Plan Speech by Prof. Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile, Governor of the Bank of Uganda, at the launch of the 5-Year Financial Markets Development Plan, Kampala, 9 September 2008.  *      *      * Your Excellencies, Honourable Members of Parliament, CEOs, Invited Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank you for honouring my invitation to attend the launch of the 5-Year Financial Markets Development Plan. The decision to prepare this Plan was made in 2005 at a meeting of the Monetary Affairs Committee (MAC) of the East African Community, which at that time consisted of the three Central bank Governors of the Bank of Uganda, the Bank of Tanzania and the Central Bank of Kenya. I am glad to add that the MAC has since been expanded to include the Governors of the Central Banks of Rwanda and Burundi, after their countries became members of the East African Community in 2007.  The process of developing the 5-Year Financial Markets Development Plan took some time, as the Central Banks had to come up with a harmonised common planning framework with the active participation of the various stakeholders in the financial sector in all the five countries. Therefore, this plan has been developed through an extensive consultative process involving stakeholders in Uganda and the rest of the East African Region.  At the 2005 MAC meeting, it was noted that the Governments of the East African countries had made significant progress in promoting the development of financial sector, in areas of regulation and supervision; monetary and fiscal policies; infrastructure development such as payments and settlement systems, and trading platforms. The above efforts were aimed at fostering price stability and sound and competitive financial systems.  While macroeconomic stability had been achieved, deepening the financial sector and increasing the efficiency in the financial markets remained a challenge. To address these deficiencies, the MAC decided to adopt a strategy of formulating a comprehensive five-year Financial Markets Development Plan for East Africa.  To spearhead the development of the Plan in Uganda, the Bank of Uganda established the Financial Markets Development Committee (FMDC) and its dedicated Secretariat, and Sub-committees comprising various stakeholders from the financial sector. I would like to thank the members of these committees for a job well done. Without their commitment and dedication, we would not be here to launch this framework that is mapping out a grand programme for transformation of financial markets in Uganda. I would also like to thank our development partners, GTZ/Sida, for their assistance in the process of formulating the 5-Year Financial Markets Development Plan, as well as the consultants who facilitated the process.  The major goals that the Plan will seek to achieve are; harmonisation of regulatory frameworks in the financial sector, infrastructure development, increase in investor base, deepening the financial market, capacity building, supporting regional integration, promotion of cost effective financial intermediation and promoting market information dissemination.  The specific areas of emphasis will include; to bring the unregulated market participants into the regulatory ambit. This will involve reforms in legal and regulatory frameworks as well as liberalisation of the pension sector, to foster competitive, long term financing. Another challenging area that the Plan is expected to address is extending financial infrastructure beyond the urban areas, so that the rural areas can also enjoy the benefits that financial markets offer. Extending financial outreach will be enhanced by the introduction of new institutions, products, services and payment systems in the rural areas, to ensure that the rural population is enabled to save and to participate in investments in the financial markets. BIS Review 114/2008 1 
The Bank of Uganda is already contributing to this effort by licensing new banks, in order to introduce greater competition, with the hope that this will encourage the banks to extend their presence to the unbanked rural areas. I expect many other non-banking financial institutions such as insurance companies, microfinance institutions, securities exchange, etc. to follow suit. Government will also be encouraged to divest its interests in the remaining parastatals in which it maintains ownership through public offerings in the stock exchange in order to widen the ownership of these institutions to the majority of Ugandans.  The other crucial aspect which the 5-Year Financial Markets Development Plan is expected to address, is financial literacy. It will be difficult to see through the various initiatives proposed in this Plan, if the population remains financially illiterate. The FMDC, through its sub-committees, is expected to educate and sensitise the public about the various financial markets programmes, in order to make the Ugandan financial market vibrant, so that Ugandans can benefit from regional and global integration.  In order to realise the objective of transforming and modernising the Ugandan financial markets, I urge the FMDC and its subcommittees to rededicate and commit themselves to the achievement of the objectives enshrined in this Plan. I realise that what lies ahead of us is no mean task, however, since we have already taken a positive step in the right direction, what remains to be done is to mobilise the support of all the stakeholders for the successful implementation of this programme. I am confident that this Public Private Partnership approach that we have adopted for developing our financial markets will bear fruit.  The 5-Year Financial Markets Development Plan brings in a well coordinated approach towards developing the financial markets in Uganda. This is devoid of the fragmented approaches of the past. This programme will ensure that efforts are not be duplicated, hence, avoiding wastage of both financial and human resources. The financing arrangements are progressing very well, with prospects from the World Bank and GTZ/Sida being the most promising. Some of the activities such as designing and development of new products and services shall also be funded by the implementing institutions themselves.  I believe that we are firmly on course towards bringing the desired changes in the transformation of financial markets in Uganda. I request all of you to take up the challenge and play your part.  I hereby launch the 5-Year Financial Markets Development Plan. 2 BIS Review 114/2008 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Inauguration of the “Euro exhibition” hosted by National Bank Slovakia Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the inauguration of the “Euro exhibition”, hosted by National Bank Slovakia (Národná banka Slovenska), Bratislava, 21 September 2008. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you here today. This is a historic moment for Slovakia, which will become the 16th country to join the euro area on 1 January 2009, exactly ten years after the euro was set up. Slovakia is the fourth country to join the euro area since the cash changeover in 2002: we have so far seen the entry of Slovenia in 2007, followed by Malta and Cyprus in 2008.  When the euro banknotes and coins were first introduced on 1 January 2002, they became one of the most visible symbols of Europe. They are now an important and natural part of our daily lives and will soon be so for Slovak citizens.  In preparation for this historic moment, the ECB has greatly appreciated its cooperation with the National Bank of Slovakia over the last couple of years. Governor Šramko has been a member of the General Council of the ECB since January 2005 and from mid-July 2008 he has also participated as an observer to the Governing Council of the ECB. The good cooperation between the National Bank of Slovakia, the European Central Bank and the Eurosystem will make the introduction of the euro in Slovakia a success.  188 million banknotes from Eurosystem stocks will be delivered to Slovakia by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in Austria, given its close proximity. The pre-launch distribution of euro cash to banks – what we call “frontloading” – and its subsequent sub-frontloading to retailers and other businesses is essential to make banknotes and coins widely available within a short timeframe. In fact, the frontloading of the euro has just begun and I understand that an additional 1.2 million coin mini-kits will be on sale to the public from 1 December 2008. The ECB has been providing support to the euro campaign in Slovakia by helping Slovak citizens to become acquainted with the visual aspects of the euro and how the changeover will work. As part of the joint euro campaign, many seminars and training sessions for bank staff and cashiers have been held and over seven million copies of different publications have been produced by the ECB. Over two million public information leaflets and four million conversion cards, which show prices converted into euro as well as the most important security features of the 20 euro banknote, will be sent to all Slovak households in December. The National Bank of Slovakia will be able to ensure that everyone will be well prepared for the euro changeover. I am confident that all of these efforts and activities will make the euro introduction a success in Slovakia.  As I arrived in Bratislava I was most impressed with the façade of the National Bank of Slovakia and its banner showing the euro banknotes and coins, which is clearly visible from all over the city. Governor Šramko, it now gives me great pleasure to invite you to symbolically unveil what I believe is the biggest banner ever displayed in Slovakia! To mark this festive moment, I am also very happy to hand over the traditional euro star to Governor Šramko to symbolise Národná banka Slovenska’s joining of the Eurosystem. I feel most honoured to open the Euro Exhibition, which houses a presentation of the euro banknotes and coins and contains interesting information about the euro for people of all ages. There are also many interactive games for children. BIS Review 113/2008 1 
I now declare the Euro Exhibition open! We very much look forward to welcoming Slovakia into the euro area. 2 BIS Review 113/2008 
Radovan Jelašić: Payment card business in Serbia  Speech by Mr Radovan Jelašić, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, at the Round Table Discussion on Payment Card Business, Belgrade, 17 September 2008. *      *      * Distinguished members of the press, colleague bankers and hosts to this event, I would like first of all to warmly thank the organizers of this Round Table on payment card business for the invitation to give introductory speech and to take part in the discussions during this event. Payment card business, together with the overall system of payment operations, represents the backbone of a stable and efficient financial industry of any market. Supervision of these operations in Serbia, however, is under the remit of the National bank. Recently, we have been witnessing major, both technological and regulatory changes in the domain of payment card business equally in Europe and worldwide. Its significance in some economies has met and even exceeded that of payments in cash and has consequently grabbed the attention of financial market regulatory authorities and central banks. Perhaps the most significant decision in this domain is the one taken by the Master Card (under supervision, not to say pressure, of the European Antimonopoly Commission) to cut down cross-border interchange fees down to the zero level, and hence open up a new era in the relations between payment card systems, financial market regulatory authorities, banks and traders in Europe and worldwide. Besides, the initiative of the European Commission and the European Central Bank to develop a new European payment card system within the implementation of the SEPA agreement (if you’ll permit me to boast a bit, following in the footsteps of our “Dina Card”) and to do so now when VISA and Master Card have already established strong positions for themselves, shows how important payment cards have become for the stability of payments systems, not only from the financial, but also from the social point of view. Today, we shall also attempt to discuss current issues prevailing in our economy. One of the topics of discussion (and often a bone of contention) between the NBS and commercial banks in the course of several recent years has been the treatment of payment cards and debit card overdrafts. I sincerely hope we shall see further discussions on this matter as they strongly contribute to the improvement of the quality of the system. On our part, I wish to reaffirm the position of the NBS to continue its best efforts begun six years ago to promote further intense development of the card business in Serbia. Let me remind you that the number of transactions processed through the Dina Card system (set up by the NBS five years ago) averages over 25 million per year, of which almost one million are initiated by the mobile telephone. Our projects in the Dina Card system in cooperation with banks, traders and telecom operators comprise:  • Mobile telephone top up via SMS messages (available since April 2006)  • Transfer of remittances from abroad to Dina Cards (available since December 2007)  • Payment by Dina Cards via Internet (expected to be available from 25 September 2008)  • Payment of state taxes and duties in the Treasury Administration of the Ministry of Finance using payment cards (expected to be available from May 2009)  What further steps should be taken in the domain of card business is the question which keeps coming up, but, contrary to other issues, not from the point of view of profit maximization, but from the aspect of socially optimal costs of payment cards, i.e. more BIS Review 113/2008 1 
efficient payment card business. One thing is for sure, the development of card business in Serbia should not match that in the USA where payment card frauds have been cut by 70%, number of payment cards issued has quadroupled, number of card issuers increased by 50% and the reference rate trimmed to a quarter of its value since 1990s to date. Now guess whether the costs of interchange in those circumstances were decreased by the oligopolies, VISA and Master Card? The answer is no – costs of interchange have been increased. To me, the main issue is no longer whether the NBS does or does not need to take administrative measures to enable faster development of the card business in Serbia. The answer is yes, administrative measures need to be taken by the NBS, but the question remains as to in which area and in what way as any measure has its advantages and disadvantages. Should it be a measure relating to the maximization of the interchange fee on payments via debit or on payments via credit card, or a measure to encourage traders to charge higher fees on payment card operations if they feel payment card business cuts too deep into their profits, or some altogether different measure.  The main role of the NBS is to secure the efficiency of the payment card business over the medium and long run, and in order to do so we have been analysing measures taken worldwide, from the EU countries to Australia. We welcome any support we can get in this effort and are certain that it will pay off even for banks in the medium and long run. 2 BIS Review 113/2008 
Barbro Wickman-Parak: Some reflections on the current situation Speech by Ms Barbro Wickman-Parak, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Handelsbanken, Stockholm, 19 September 2008. *      *      * Hawks and doves – opinions may differ on this way of trying to characterise me and my colleagues on the Executive Board of the Riksbank, but it cannot be denied that it has had a major impact. How often the terms are used in the media varies somewhat over time depending on how great the difference of opinion among the Executive Board members is assumed to be at the moment. Prior to the most recent repo rate decision, the terms were used quite frequently and it was claimed that there was a fight between the hawks and doves on the Board about the direction the interest rate should take.  The minutes of the latest monetary policy meeting, which were published the day before yesterday, reveal that I am one of the doves – if I myself should now lapse into this ornithological terminology. This time, I would like to add – it is not my intention to characterise myself as a permanent dove, no more than I intend to become a permanent hawk. As a monetary policy decision-maker you cannot sit in a predetermined rut, even though this would make life easier for those who like to express themselves in clichés.  The minutes also reveal that the Board was divided right down the middle, as was indeed speculated on beforehand. It was the Governor's casting vote that decided the issue and that led to the repo rate being increased rather than being left unchanged. Before I explain what lay behind the decision and present my own view, I would like to say something more general about the even result of the vote. There are a number of observations and reflections that can be made and that I feel are worth highlighting. I intend to conclude by saying something about the new statistics that have been presented since our meeting. A great deal has happened recently, not least on the financial markets.  An entirely divided Executive Board is unusual A first observation is that if we look to the past it is very unusual for the Board to be split down the middle. During the almost ten years that the Board has existed and the approximately 85 monetary policy meetings that have been held, this has in fact only happened four times, counting the latest meeting. The most usual result, not surprisingly, is that the Board has been unanimous. Fairly frequently, however, at about a third of the meetings, at least one member has entered a reservation against the interest rate decision.  As an aside it may be worth pointing out that for some time now it has perhaps been more noticeable than before if we are in disagreement. These days, we also have to decide on a forecast for the repo rate. At the meeting in July, for example, all of the Board members agreed to increase the interest rate. But three of us felt that the forecast for the repo rate path in the period ahead should be some-what lower. This disunity attracted a lot of attention in the media and also provided some clues that made it easier to forecast what the vote would be at the latest meeting.  Previously, before we began publishing interest rate forecasts, there were also different opinions among the Board members about how the interest rate should develop in the future. But as no forecast for the repo rate was published and there was nothing concrete to enter a reservation against, any differences of opinion were not visible to the outside world. It is probably also the case that the future development of the repo rate was not discussed as much internally then as it is today. BIS Review 113/2008 1 
Disagreement a healthy sign Another thing that I feel is worth pointing out is that disagreement among the members of the Board should not be seen as a sign of weakness. This would perhaps be a reasonable interpretation if you held the view that the Board members should be so wise that we can simply "calculate" which decision is the only possible correct one and agree on it. Unfortunately, the world is far too complicated for this to be possible. And if it were possible there would be no real reason to let the monetary policy decisions be made by a Board with six members. It would be enough to have a single wise decision-maker.  In recent decades, however, the trend has been in the opposite direction. All over the world, it has become more and more common to let monetary policy decisions be made by a group of individuals – a committee or board – rather than by a central bank governor alone. Probably the most important explanation for this is that many central banks have become more independent in this period. This has made it seem more natural to delegate the right to make decisions to a group of people rather than to one individual.  This development has meant that research on monetary policy decision-making in groups has accelerated.1 One result that has emerged is that groups tend to make better decisions than individuals.2 This may be because the members of the group have different backgrounds, knowledge and experience that they can bring to the monetary policy discussion. These differences mark the decisions that the group makes in different ways so that these decisions tend to be better than the decisions that an individual would have made alone – the whole becomes greater than the parts. This applies irrespective of how the decision is made – by voting, as at the Riksbank, or in some other way. So, the fact that we disagree should be seen as a sign that everything is working the way it is supposed to. It would in fact be surprising if the entire Board supported every interest rate decision made. Unusually difficult to assess the situation  The third thing I would like to point out is perhaps the most important. This is that the even vote is of course more than anything else a sign that it is unusually difficult to assess the current situation – there is a fine balance to be drawn. I think that it is important to say this as this is not really the picture that has emerged from the debate. Instead, an unchanged repo rate has most often been portrayed as the only reasonable and self-evident alternative. Even though I myself eventually came to the conclusion that the interest rate should remain un-changed, I must say that I did not feel that this was an entirely self-evident decision. The Executive Board thus decided by the smallest possible margin to increase the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points. Three main reasons were given for this. First, inflation has continued to increase. In July it reached the highest level measured since the mid-1990s and was far above the inflation target. The much-publicised revision of the CPI by Statistics Sweden last week does not significantly alter this picture, by the way, even though the figure for June is now higher than that for July.  Secondly, inflation expectations are also still high. Different measures paint slightly different pictures, but all of the measures are above the inflation target. Thirdly, cost pressures have                                                  1 For a review of current research see, for example, Blinder, A., ”Making Monetary Policy by Committee”, an essay presented at the conference ”International Experience with the Conduct of Monetary Policy Under Inflation Targeting”, 22-23 July, 2008, Bank of Canada. 2  See, for example, Blinder, A. and J. Morgan, ”Are Two Heads Better than One? An Experimental Analysis of Group versus Individual Decision Making”, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 37, 2005, 789-811. 2 BIS Review 113/2008 
increased. This is largely related to the fact that growth in productivity has been surprisingly weak for some time. The assessment made by the majority was that an increase was needed to prevent price rises for energy and food from spreading to other areas – to prevent the high level of inflation from becoming entrenched. The increase is expected to help bring inflation back to a level close to the target within a couple of years. Resource utilisation is also expected to fall but to be roughly normal at the end of the forecast period.  At the same time as the repo rate was increased, the repo rate path for the period ahead was adjusted downwards compared to the decision taken in July. This is partly because growth has slowed down more than expected in Sweden and abroad and partly because the price of oil and the prices of other commodities have fallen.  The increase may be a way of safeguarding the real economy in the long term A common reaction to the decision to increase the interest rate was that the Riksbank pays too much attention to inflation and too little attention to the real economy. I would like to comment on this claim. One reason for increasing the interest rate was that an increase was needed to prevent the high level of inflation from becoming entrenched. This could happen if the price increases for energy and food begin to spread to other areas. This could ultimately lead to a risk of the Riksbank's ability to hold inflation in check being called into question and of inflation expectations remaining at a consistently high level. This is what happened in the 1970s in many parts of the world, although inflation at that time became entrenched at much higher levels than would be the case today. But even though the levels are much lower today, it could still be relatively costly to get inflation back to the target. It cannot be ruled out that this could require quite a long period with high interest rates and restricted demand.  There is thus a risk that conducting too expansionary a policy today would sooner or later give rise to costs in the real economy that, furthermore, could be quite considerable. I do not feel, therefore, that it is correct to say that the increase in the interest rate is an indication that the Riksbank does not care about the real economy. It is rather the case that by focusing clearly on the inflation target we will be able to avoid considerable costs to the real economy in the slightly longer term.  I should perhaps add that the forecast in the Monetary Policy Update, as I just mentioned, is that resource utilisation will be roughly normal, rather than low, at the end of the forecast period. So from this perspective too we can question the claim that the Riksbank pays too little attention to the real economy.  In my view, all the arguments for an increase in the interest rate that were put forward by the majority are reasonable. So even though I voted to leave the repo rate unchanged I respect the majority's view. But this does not mean that I share it. It is possible to have different views of how great the risk of contagion effects is, and here I have a different view than the majority.  My own view So, what was my thinking at the time? As I said in the minutes, I already saw clear signs of a slowdown in the Swedish economy at the time of the monetary policy meeting in July. The outcome figures and indicators that have been presented since the July meeting also clearly indicate a weakening of economic activity. Resource utilisation, as calculated by the Riksbank using various measures, is currently estimated to be higher than normal, but is falling rapidly. Capacity utilisation according to Statistics Sweden and the National Institute of Economic Research, is still at a high level but is moving downwards. The downswing in the BIS Review 113/2008 3 
Swedish economy has come sooner and been more pronounced than was expected only a few months ago. It covers the manufacturing industry as well as the retail and service industries. Households have clearly become more pessimistic, not least with regard to the national economy and the labour market. For example, the survey conducted by the National Institute of Economic Research at the end of 2007 showed that an excess amount of 40 per cent of the households believed that unemployment would be lower in a year's time. Now, however, an excess amount of 50 per cent of the households believes that unemployment will be higher one year ahead. This deterioration in general sentiment has been accompanied by a fall-off in private consumption. This applies mainly to capital goods, which is common at the beginning of an economic downswing. But it is not only private consumption that has declined; investments and exports have also weakened. GDP growth has been revised downwards for both 2008 and 2009, although the forecast predicts a recovery in 2009 in line with developments abroad and it is believed that Sweden's exports will be an import driving force in this context. However, I am far from sure that such an upswing in economic activity will actually take place. Developments in the USA play a key role here and the recovery that is expected to begin next autumn presupposes that the housing market there has stabilised, that the repercussions of the financial crisis have faded and that employment has begun to increase again. As the international forecast is highly uncertain, this also applies to the recovery that is predicted to take place here in Sweden next year.  When it comes to inflation, it is of course impossible to deny that it is uncomfortably high today. However, I do not believe that the outcome figures contain evidence that shows that the price increases for oil and other commodities have spread to other areas. The repo rate increase in July was also intended to prevent such contagion effects. The risk of these effects has also declined recently, partly due to the fall in the price of oil and other commodities and partly because economic activity is declining. The development of productivity has been a disappointment and we do not have a really good explanation of why it has been so weak. Weak productivity also helps to keep cost pressures high. However, I was more worried about this earlier when economic activity was higher and the pressure on the labour market was stronger. In the current economic situation it is probably difficult for the companies to pass cost increases on to the consumers.  There is every reason to continue to keep a close eye on inflation expectations as they are still some way above the inflation target. My assessment is, nevertheless, that they will decline as economic activity weakens and the actual rate of inflation falls. To sum up it can be said that the Executive Board agreed on a great deal – that economic activity is weakening, that inflation is declining and that it will be possible to reduce the interest rate in the period ahead. Our disagreements related primarily to our different assessments of the strength of the processes and of how much monetary policy would need to help to reduce inflation. My final assessment was that inflation in the period ahead will move towards the target, in roughly the same way as illustrated in the Monetary Policy Update, without the need to increase the interest rate. I thus voted to leave the repo rate unchanged. Nor did I support the repo rate path presented in the Monetary Policy Update. The path had been lowered compared to the assessment made in July. But I felt that the force of the economic downswing may easily make it necessary to reduce the interest rate more than is indicated in the new path.  4 BIS Review 113/2008 
New statistics and developments on the financial markets  Some important statistics have been published since we made our decision on the interest rate. These include the inflation figures for August which showed that the CPI increased by 4.3 per cent over the last 12 months. This was 0.2 percentage points lower than our forecast in the Monetary Policy Update. Everyone who produces inflation forecasts knows that it is difficult to exactly assess monthly changes and there is nothing remarkable about a forecast deviation of 0.2 percentage points. A factor that contributed to the forecast error was that Statistics Sweden, when it published the new figures, also downwardly revised the inflation figures for the period January to the end of July this year. It is of course unfortunate that miscalculations are made in a variable that is of such central importance to the Riksbank and many others, but it should be pointed out that this is very rare. The revision attracted a lot of media attention and there was speculation that the Riksbank would have decided differently if this miscalculation had been known at the time the decision was made. The July figure for the CPI was then 4.4 per cent, while the revised figure is 4.1 per cent.  Allow me therefore to comment briefly on this. It need hardly be said that my decision, and that of the two colleagues who also entered a reservation, to recommend an unchanged interest rate would not have been effected. Whether it would have affected the decision of the majority I cannot of course say. But it should be remembered that it is the processing and analysis of a great quantity of information that leads to the overall assessment of economic development and inflation prospects. And it is the forecast derived from this information that largely determines the interest rate decision. In our latest assessment this was based on the belief that inflation was somewhat higher than now proves to be the case. But monetary policy does not have such a degree of precision that it can control inflation to a tenth of a degree. And, moreover, inflation in July was high and far above the inflation target even after the downward revision of the figure.  In the discussion ahead of the interest rate decision, I and other members of the Executive Board highlighted the weak labour market indicators which uniformly pointed to a weaker development of employment, which is also in line with the Riksbank's forecast. After the decision, the Labour Force Survey for August has been presented. This shows that employment increased by a moderate 0.5 per cent on a 12-month basis, which is marginally lower than the Riksbank's forecast.  At our September meeting, we had access to the initial version of the National Accounts for the second quarter. These showed that GDP did not increase at all compared to the previous quarter and increased by only 0.7 per cent on a calendar-adjusted12-month basis. Now that the revised version of the National Accounts has been published, we can see that growth in the first two quarters has been marginally adjusted downwards in both cases. This means that growth in the first quarter was 2 per cent on a 12-month basis and with calendar effects taken into account. The corresponding figure for the second quarter was 0.6 per cent. The new figures thus confirm that there has been a sharp downturn in the growth rate and completely support the picture that could be discerned at our latest meeting. Increasing cost pressures have been an important factor behind the series of interest rate increases introduced by the Riksbank. The new figures from the National Accounts show that the figures for hours worked have been revised up-wards compared to the version available to us in September. Together with the marginal downward revision of the figures for growth, this means that productivity declined more than indicated by the preliminary figures. As the figures for labour costs per hour worked have also been adjusted upwards, the new figures show that unit labour costs increased by 5.3 per cent on a 12-month basis in the second quarter. This was almost a percentage point more than in the preliminary version of the National Accounts.  The fact that productivity is weak may be because companies have not had time to adjust their workforce as the downturn in economic activity has been so sudden. We can now see that the number of vacancies is falling and that plans to recruit new personnel are being BIS Review 113/2008 5 
toned down. An adjustment is underway which will be followed by a recovery in productivity, in line with the Riksbank's forecast. Rising costs are of course a factor that the Riksbank has every reason to monitor and analyse carefully. But as I mentioned earlier, my view is that given the down-turn in economic activity that is now becoming apparent it is difficult to see how the companies would be able to pass on increased costs.  At our latest meeting, the price of oil had fallen from its peak level in July, and it has fallen further since then.  Let me say a few words about developments on the financial markets. We are now seeing a new wave of unrest sweep across the international financial markets. This is nothing new but something we have had to live with for over a year now. From time to time it has appeared that things may have calmed down somewhat, only for the unrest to return in other forms. Over the last few days, major American investment banks and a number of other players have experienced acute problems.  It is difficult to say at the moment where all this will end. We are of course following developments closely. So far, we can note that financial stability in Sweden is satisfactory. Swedish banks are only marginally involved as their exposure to the US market is limited. Nevertheless, the Swedish market is significantly affected by events on the international stage. The costs of borrowing are increasing and some financial markets are working less efficiently than normal. Yesterday, the National Debt Office, in consultation with the Riksbank, took steps to facilitate the functioning of the market. The National Debt Office will now issue short-term treasury bills in a number of extra auctions. This is very positive and will alleviate the shortage on this market that has arisen in the wake of the global financial turmoil. The Riksbank's assessment is that the unrest on the financial markets is not affecting financial stability in Sweden. We can note that the Swedish banks have made very good profits in recent years and are financially robust. However, if the banks were to experience liquidity problems that could threaten financial stability we are ready to take measures to provide liquidity assistance.  It will take time for the uncertainty on the financial markets to abate and for the situation to stabilise in a lasting way. We have already seen how the financial unrest has left its mark on the development of the real economy, and uncertainty about how it will affect growth prospects in the period ahead remains. At the end of October, the Executive Board will once more make an overall assessment of the growth and inflation prospects.  Exaggerated focus on the current interest rate decision I would like to conclude with a final reflection. It is natural and important that monetary policy is debated. Sometimes, however, it feels as though a little too much focus is placed on the current interest rate decision. To say that a lot has been written about the latest interest rate increase would be somewhat of an understatement. The discussion conducted in certain quarters almost gives the impression that this increase will throw Sweden into a bottomless pit of recession. Opinions may differ on the value of such prophecies, but I still think it is difficult to see how an interest rate increase of 0.25 per cent could have such a decisive impact. In this context there is an important point that has fallen into the background a little. It is not individual interest rate decisions but a series of decisions – an interest rate path – that determines the effects that monetary policy will ultimately have on inflation and the real economy. If we look back in, say, three years time, the development we will see will not of course depend solely on the fact that the Riksbank raised the interest rate in September 2008 but also on what happened with the interest rate thereafter, and to a certain extent before this too. And in the forecast that the Riksbank presented a couple of weeks ago the repo rate path was lowered and the interest rate is lower than in the July forecast for the entire forecast period. 6 BIS Review 113/2008 
If, moreover, it turns out that economic activity weakens even more and that inflation falls more rapidly than the Riksbank now predicts it will of course be possible to adapt the policy in line with these developments. It is naturally not possible to withdraw an interest rate increase "retroactively". One can, on the other hand, if it becomes apparent that economic activity is declining, reduce the interest rate more rapidly than was originally intended. There is, in other words, a degree of flexibility in monetary policy, both upwards and downwards of course, that should not be underestimated.  With this comforting thought in mind I would like to thank you all for your attention. BIS Review 113/2008 7 
Mario Draghi: How to restore financial stability Lecture by Mr Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy and Chairman of the Financial Stability Forum, at the 5th Bundesbank Lecture, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin, 16 September 2008. *      *      * As this crisis hits its first anniversary, it has evolved into an even more complex combination of rising inflation, declining growth, tightening credit conditions, and widespread liquidity tensions pervading the global financial industry. Banks have raised a significant amount of capital to partly offset writedowns and credit losses. But they are now moving into a phase where credit losses in the banking book will begin to rise. And banks are entering this phase with weakened balance sheets. Alongside a rise in credit related losses, the outlook for bank profitability is poor.  The aggregate amount of capital in the system is great enough, under reasonable scenarios, to prevent the system as a whole from falling below regulatory thresholds. But the distribution of that capital obviously matters. And, for larger banks, the capital levels demanded by the market have gone up in response to the greater uncertainty and reduced transparency about their balance sheets.  We estimate that banks are likely to need to raise at least once again the amount of capital raised since the crisis began. There are various reasons why some banks will be struggling to reach those levels. That is especially the case for the banks that ran the debt-financed, highly leveraged and maturity mismatched business model that provided steady fee income over the last several years. Now their profitability looks impaired, and their desired de-leveraging is likely to be happening through a reduction of new lending. Capital increases are especially difficult in a situation of deteriorating stock markets where falling equity prices nullify the still significant efforts undertaken to delever banks’ balance sheets. This has spurred increasing recourse to hybrid capital instruments, but these may raise in the future concerns about the quality of the capital raised. Let me finally observe that the situation of the banks in the Euro area is so far better than the one we are witnessing in the US and in other jurisdictions. As the crisis unfolds policies are taking a variety of shapes that can be grouped within two broad categories: emergency and structural responses. Until now, the first remained typically national since each crisis was unique to the financial structure of the country and so were the remedies. However, if the crisis were to become systemic – and the past weekend has shown just how sudden and dramatic the turn of events can be – I believe that an internationally coordinated effort will be necessary. On the other hand, it was immediately clear that the structural response that would lay out the foundations for a more resilient financial system in the years to come could not be other than internationally coordinated. It is primarily to this effort that the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) has been called to respond by the G7. The FSF – brought into being by Hans Tietmeyer in 1999 – brings together national financial authorities (central banks, supervisory agencies, and finance ministers) from large international financial centres as well as bodies such as standard setters and international financial institutions, giving it a unique capacity to give impetus to and facilitate coordination among these bodies.  Our conviction is that misaligned incentives in several areas of the financial services industry weakened lending and underwriting standards, particularly but not exclusively in the United States. At a more general level, innovation and complexity outstripped banks’ capacity to manage key risks – including funding and liquidity risks, concentration risks, reputational risks, legal risks and warehousing risks. Investor due diligence was poor and reliance on credit ratings unquestioning. Institutions accumulated a level of leverage that was both BIS Review 112/2008 1 
misperceived and excessive. The initial spark set off by the U.S. subprime downturn fed on these much broader weaknesses, causing the dramatic loss in confidence and liquidity in financial markets that we have seen. This explains why initial losses that might have been insignificant are having such meaningful consequences on the real economy in both Europe and the U.S. The financial system that will emerge from this crisis will be one that operates with less debt and more capital, should be immune to the set of perverse incentives that are at the root of the crisis, and should be such that the risks are better assessed and identified. In the end, while avoiding over-regulation that would stifle innovation, the reform process will re-draw the balance between market discipline and regulation. The FSF report, which was endorsed by the G7 ministers and central bank governors in April this year and has been made public, draws on an extensive body of work by national authorities and the main international supervisory, regulatory, and central bank bodies. A key strength of this report is that it contains recommendations that have been agreed by those that have the authority and commitment to implement. Another key strength is that it aims at correcting the identified weaknesses while preserving a level playing field across countries. A well-defined process is in place for following up on implementation, comprising who does what and by when, and how progress is to be monitored and reported. A comprehensive follow-up report will be presented to the G7 next month. Our recommendations were in the following key areas: • Strengthening the prudential framework for banks, including with regard to capital, liquidity, risk management and market infrastructure; • Strengthening the framework for transparency and valuation;  • Changing the role and uses of credit ratings; and • Enhancing the authorities’ responsiveness to risks and our co-operation in dealing with weak banks. Progress in taking forward implementation of these recommendations has been remarkable. To name a few examples: • Supervisors proposed in July new capital requirements for credit exposures in banks’ and securities firms’ trading books and will set out later this year adjustments to capital requirements for “re-securitisations” and the short-term liquidity facilities that funded off-balance sheet conduits.  • In May, the Basel Committee issued revised guidance on liquidity risk management that materially raises standards for sound liquidity risk management and measurement – including requiring banks to maintain a robust cushion of unencumbered, high quality liquid assets as a safeguard against protracted periods of liquidity stress.  • Over summer, IOSCO and the SEC set out fundamental changes to their requirements on credit rating agencies to address the quality of ratings, to expand the information they provide, as well as proposals concerning how ratings are used in regulatory guidelines.  • Regarding transparency, the larger banks have implemented our recommended disclosures to provide expanded information on their risk exposures and valuations of problem assets, on and off the balance sheet.  • And the IASB is making good progress on new guidance and revised standards for fair valuations when markets are illiquid, and for consolidation of off-balance sheet entities, which we expect to see in the next few months.  2 BIS Review 112/2008 
On the private sector front we welcome the recommendations that have been set out by the Institute of International Finance (the IIF), the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group III, and the American and European Securitization Forums. The industry’s involvement in drawing lessons from events has heightened the understanding of market participants of the need to redraw the balance between unfettered markets and regulation.  Some of the regulatory changes that I have discussed will need to be phased in over time to avoid adding to the adjustment challenges the system faces now. However, there should be no uncertainty about the authorities’ determination to implement the program of actions that has been internationally agreed. And there should be no stretching of timetables for enhancing disclosures, including of off-balance sheet positions, as this is essential to repairing market confidence.  No financial system will be free from crisis whatever the rules of the game. The fundamental task for authorities is therefore to enhance the resilience of the financial system to shocks and disruptions whatever their source, with a view to minimising the knock-on effects elsewhere.  At the level of the financial system as a whole, a critical element is the infrastructure of payment and settlement systems, and the body of contract documentation and market practices that underpin financial activity. A resilient infrastructure is one that is capable of withstanding the effects of the failure of a large financial institution. As we speak this objective is being tested by reality. By reducing the centrality of any one institution to the system’s stability, a stronger infrastructure also contributes to reducing moral hazard. A critical priority in this area is to address weaknesses in the operational infrastructure of over-the-counter derivatives markets. The work undertaken by the NY Fed to this end should be commended by all the jurisdictions. The objective of this work is to move the OTC derivatives markets on to a platform where trades can be captured and settled in an orderly way.  It is also imperative that we strengthen national and cross-border crisis resolution frameworks so that we can allow weakened financial institutions, including large ones that operate across borders, to be wound down in an orderly manner. This is an area where the mismatch between what we need to have in place, and what is in place, is large. In addition to important national reform efforts in a number of countries, work is underway in the FSF and the Basel Committee to strengthen cross-border cooperation and contingency planning among authorities in responding to crisis.  At the level of individual institutions, improving resilience means ensuring that capital and liquidity buffers are large enough to enable firms to resist external shocks – without mandating buffers at a level that impedes efficiency and encourages regulatory arbitrage. The issue is quite complex because both the actual and the appropriate size of a buffer shifts over time depending on the market and systemic environment. Both the markets and regulatory authorities affect the level of capital and liquidity buffers institutions maintain.  A key issue, which is particularly relevant in the current period of adjustment, is the ability of banks to use capital levels above the regulatory minimum during adverse conditions. What we have seen is that higher cushions above the regulatory minimum become a new de facto market requirement. Indeed, banks’ efforts to raise new capital in the past year have been not just to meet regulatory minima but also to respond to the need to reassure markets. This is, at least in part, because of festering uncertainty over risk exposures, valuations and earnings prospects. Some of this uncertainty is inevitable – for example, terminal values for securities backed by US housing loans cannot be determined as long as the US market continues to fall. But it is clear that we need a much more robust ex ante framework of transparency to reduce the tendency that market reaction lead banks to raise capital (or reduce exposures) to possibly inefficient levels in a systemic crisis. If banks can credibly assure markets that risks to their asset values and earnings prospects are being soundly managed and contained, then they may be able to survive a temporary decline in capital levels when needed, while still remaining above their regulatory minimum. BIS Review 112/2008 3 
As the above illustrates, the recent turmoil has raised fundamental questions about the nature of procyclicality, its impact on financial stability, and the feasibility of policies to address it. This brings me to two areas that I believe merit further attention on the part of policymakers going forward:  • First, is there a role for the official sector to address procyclicality as a source of financial instability?  • And second, should monetary policy embody in its objective function the health of the financial system? Reviewing our experience of the past two or three decades, one is struck by the repeated tendency of financial systems to build up risk and leverage in good times, then shed it rapidly when conditions change. While the assets and agents involved and the triggering mechanisms differ from one cycle to the next, the cycles have tended to produce significant deadweight costs and distortions in the real economy, both during the upswing and during the subsequent retrenchment. This is especially significant the more the financial system is leveraged, as we have seen in the past year. While we cannot and would not want to eliminate the bouts of optimism and pessimism that are part of human nature, we must address some of the pro-cyclical implications of our own policy making. We decided not to address procyclicality per se in our April report (although some of the recommendations touch on it) because of the urgency of making concrete recommendations in other areas. But now it is time for us to return to this topic. As in the areas that I described earlier, the goal will be to strengthen the resilience of the system without hindering the process of market discipline and innovation that are essential to the financial sector’s contribution to economic growth. There is no shortage of ideas around for which aspect of procyclicality is most relevant for financial stability, and for the range of policy options that could help dampen procyclicality. Some of the areas that we in the FSF have decided to look at include: • The capital regime: the Basel II framework ties required capital more directly to the perceived riskiness of an asset, which is likely to increase during downturns and fall during expansions. This is not new, but because Basel II itself is new there is more we need to know on the mechanics – it is not clear yet, in particular, how required, desired and actual capital levels will evolve over a full cycle under Basel II (although a framework is now in place for tracking and assessing this). As we consider how to strengthen the regime, more thought needs to be given to how to promote higher buffers above the regulatory minimum in good times, which can then be dipped into more flexibly during cyclical downturns. To a degree, this is already possible in a discretionary way, although too much divergence in national implementation of Basel II would raise issues of transparency and consistency in international regulatory arrangements and should therefore be constrained. Ad hoc, uncoordinated reductions in required minima could be viewed as forbearance and could give the wrong signal about authorities’ judgement as to the overall strength of the system. How we can best dampen procyclicality in bank capital is an inquiry we are now engaging internationally and in the European context in a coordinated fashion.  • A related issue is sound loan-loss provisioning: these are useful tools to counter the effects of procyclicality, especially on new lending. However, our banking systems came into this crisis with historically low levels of provisions. To a degree, this can be attributed to the benign recent default environment. But it also reflects new accounting principles and prudential rules, the effects of which we need to assess in the light of experience. Our aim must be to create scope to promote more through-the-cycle provisioning techniques that place institutions in a position to absorb losses rather than curtail credit during a downturn.  4 BIS Review 112/2008 
• Compensation issues – these have been much in the public eye recently: do bonus-based pay systems, for both traders and senior and top management of financial firms, reward short-term risk taking with little penalty for the longer-term risks taken to achieve profits? What are the elements of a sound compensation scheme? On this issue, the interests of regulators and shareholders broadly align but banks face a collective action problem. If there is a role for regulators and supervisors in this area, is it ex ante (to adjust risk taking incentives), and/or ex post (to adjust capital to the risks taken)? • Valuation and leverage: the interplay between these has become more important over time for a number of reasons, including more marketable assets (especially credit) that need to be marked to market, more market-based collateralized funding, more leveraged position-taking. But here too there is more we need to know about the mechanics involved. What effects have valuation practices and leverage had on the cyclicality of the financial system? Acting through which channels? Is there a possible or desirable course of action for the official sector? Coming to the issue of monetary policy and financial stability – If the market turbulence tells us anything, it is that the pace of financial innovation in recent years, the volume of transaction in certain markets, the amount of embedded leverage in the system, and the global nature of finance, have transformed the functioning of the international financial system. These transformations were not fully appreciated in their implications for monetary policy making.  Central banks are inherently concerned with the health of the financial system. Because of the critical role it performs – that of allocating capital and risk to the economy – a well-functioning financial sector is key for the achievement of primary macroeconomic objectives, such as stable prices and sustained growth; for central banks, it is also fundamental for the effective transmission of monetary policy decisions to the real economy. Contributing to the health of the financial system is, in a sense, encoded in the genes of central banks: one of the historical reasons for establishing a central bank was indeed to reinforce financial stability by having an institution that could act as a lender of last resort.  The policy followed by the European Central Bank since the start of the turmoil is very much in line with this historical role. The ECB has not remained passive. It has used the tools at his disposal, in particular its liquidity operations, to support the smooth functioning of the money market in periods of acute stress. Its operational framework has proved to be robust and flexible to effectively respond to the challenge posed by the drying-up of market liquidity. However – and this is a crucial aspect of the ECB policy – we have operated under the principle of strict separation between the liquidity provision policy and the stance of monetary policy. Monetary policy, the setting of the level of interest rates by the ECB, has been directed at fulfilling its primary goal: maintaining price stability. This principle is crucial. Charging monetary policy with additional objectives, such as a direct responsibility for financial stability, would risk blurring responsibilities, increasing moral hazard and creating a trade-off where there is none. I fully agree with the remark often made by Otmar Issing that there is no lasting trade-off between price stability and financial stability.1 Even if, as he acknowledges, some short-term conflicts may occasionally arise, this can be easily accommodated by a monetary policy strategy that focuses on an appropriate medium term horizon, as the one chosen by the ECB. Over such horizons, price stability and financial stability are mutually reinforcing, rather than alternative, goals. We should not forget that some of the most damaging and prolonged periods of financial distress (such as the Great Depression, the Japanese experience in the 90’s and many of the currency crises in                                                  1  O. Issing (2003), “Monetary and financial stability: is there a trade-off?” BIS paper No. 18. BIS Review 112/2008 5 
emerging markets in the past century) have been associated with – and sometimes aggravated by – the inability to control the inflation process.  Relying on a clear separation of roles and a correct assignment of instruments to objectives is particularly important at the current juncture, as we face inflationary pressures combined with weaker economic activity and financial turbulence. It is precisely in these difficult situations that the benefits of a sound monetary framework become apparent. Only by ensuring a return to price stability in a reasonable time frame we will be able to control inflation expectations, reduce uncertainty and risk premia, sustain longer-term financing and purchasing power and thus reinforce the prospects for real activity and financial stability. The risk that a prolonged period of high inflation may destabilize expectations and become entrenched in wage and price setting requires a resolute stance in monetary policy. It is essential that other economic actors too adopt a responsible behaviour. It is also quite obvious that should current financial instability aggravate and threaten to lead to a deflationary situation, monetary policy would have to take this into account.  While the role of monetary policy in the current circumstances should be clear, it is nevertheless wise, also in this field, to draw lessons from the recent experience. An important one, which relates to the topic of procyclicality I just mentioned, is on the role that unusually easy global credit conditions over many years had in the build up of the current turmoil.  There is a clear asymmetry between the two phases of boom-bust cycles. While the effects of the bust phase are very visible, the building-up of imbalances in the boom phase is not easily detected. This is because there are of course many other factors – not necessarily related to imbalances – that contribute to changes in asset prices and balance sheet positions, and not all booms end up in busts. Central banks are thus easily forced into a situation where they may need to intervene after the crash, injecting liquidity to avoid a financial crisis, or even at times loosening monetary policy to avoid deflation, but remain passive during the previous phase. The problem however is that a monetary policy that limits itself to such a passive role – the so called “mop up after” policy – may increase moral hazard and plant the seeds for further and more acute imbalances in the future.  The key challenge is therefore to understand whether monetary policy can or should be more proactive and “lean against the wind” also in periods of growing financial imbalances in a pre-emptive manner, even in the absence of immediate threats to price stability. This is an open issue on which opinions diverge. I will limit myself to the following observations. First, risk premia in equity, housing, government bonds and corporate debt markets had reached over the past ten years – with different timing – a historical minimum. They had consistently declined since the mid-eighties. There are structural reasons behind this trend: the deepening and broadening of global financial markets; and more stable policy regimes, in particular for monetary policy, leading to lower macroeconomic volatility – and therefore risk – in the last two decades (a phenomenon also known as the Great Moderation).2 But there have also been transient, and thus less comforting, factors at work: lower volatility in the economy may have been due to “good luck”, i.e. a historically unprecedented decline in the vigour of exogenous shocks. This may have generated a false perception of safety. Most importantly from the point of view of monetary authorities, protracted low interest rates at the global level may have favoured an excessive appetite for risk, reinforcing the flawed incentives in risk management that have played a pivotal role in the recent turmoil. Indeed, the existence of a “risk taking” channel – an impact of monetary policy on either risk perception or risk tolerance – appears to have some ground in both theoretical arguments                                                  2  A detailed exposition of this topic can be found in J.-C. Trichet (2008), “Risk and the macro-economy” keynote address at the conference “The ECB and its watchers X”, Frankfurt am Main, September. 6 BIS Review 112/2008 
and empirical research.3 Again, all this is not new. From a historical perspective, accomodative monetary policy has been found to be a key factor in many cycles that ended up in crises.4 The underestimation of risk is particularly worrying when it involves the housing markets, as participants are likely to be on average less informed and less protected against changing conditions than is the case in other markets. Protracted low interest rates associated with asset price booms – especially in housing – very low risk premia and buoyant credit growth should ring a bell to policy makers. Second, the thorough analysis of intermediaries’ balance sheets and monetary and credit developments, which the Bundesbank has championed and is now an essential part of the ECB strategy, is crucial in this field. Besides supporting the assessment on the outlook for price stability, this analysis could be an indispensable ingredient of a monetary policy aiming at a higher symmetry of response to boom-bust cycles, reducing procyclicality and moral hazard in the financial sector. Monetary analysis may be all the more important in situations of potential financial distress when it is necessary to lengthen the horizon of policy, but it is very hard to do so by means of forecasts given the complexities involved. This may be even more true if we allow for the possibility put forward by some observers, that when monetary policy is highly credible, excessive liquidity expansions may find their way first in fuelling asset price and credit booms, rather than in creating inflationary pressures.5 The analysis of credit and money has also permitted us to form a balanced opinion on the effects the financial turmoil. While we do see a slowdown in credit growth in the euro area, this appears to be in line with the regular impact of slower economic activity and tighter policy conditions. Up to now, we have seen no signs of additional effects coming from financial tensions, and so far the capital position of banks overall in the euro area remains sound. Of course, if the crisis were to become systemic, counterparty risks could always spread all over the world. Third, I do not think that central banks possess a superior knowledge, relative to the private sector, to be able to judge whether a deviation from fundamentals is occurring in the pricing of any individual asset. Having said that, central banks – with their strong technical skills, independent judgement and system-wide, longer-term perspective – are perhaps better placed to assess systemic risks emerging from financial markets. This can prompt informed communication to the financial system and to the wider public and, at times, also monetary policy action. As it is the case in general when confronting low-probability but high-cost events, it may be optimal to choose to err on the side of caution if this helps to reduce the likelihood of future crises.6Fourth, as recently recognized by Adrian and Shin among others, in a market based financial system, banking and capital developments have become inseparable.7 Through the impact it has on capital market conditions, monetary policy may have become more important in influencing the size of financial intermediary balance sheets. In this respect it could play an important role in dampening fluctuations that may lead to potential disorderly unwinding of                                                  3  See, among others, G.

leverage. Given the interlinkages existing in the global system, today this is true not only in the Anglo-Saxon systems, but also in the more bank-oriented European context.  Therefore, while monetary policy should continue to focus on delivering price stability, it should aim at a greater symmetry throughout the cycle and cannot afford to neglect the modifications and innovations affecting the structure of the financial system.  We should not, however, underestimate the enormous informational challenge we have to confront. We need to improve our analyses and tools to be able to better assess the risks of a systemic crisis, quantify the effects that our actions may have to mitigate those risks and develop a deeper understanding of the two-way linkages between the financial and real sectors. In this respect, a closer interaction between macroeconomic and macroprudential analyses is essential. This requires stronger cooperation and information sharing among authorities both domestically and cross-border. Moreover, greater transparency and improved disclosure practices in the private sector are necessary to be able to fully assess the conditions of the financial system and formulate the appropriate monetary policy. In this sense, monetary policy and policies to achieve financial stability are closely linked. The crisis we are facing is one of the most severe and complex of our times. The challenges will be substantial: restore price stability that would support growth, and ensure that the needed adjustments in bank and households balance sheets and in internal and external macroeconomic imbalances take place in an orderly manner. This will require action on the monetary, fiscal, and regulatory front. It will also require decisive action by the private sector to repair balance sheets, strengthen corporate governance, and improve the functioning of markets.  History has repeatedly shown that needed reforms are ignored until a crisis forces action, and that the will to reform quickly dissipates after the crisis has passed. This crisis is no different, and this is an opportunity to strengthen the structure of the financial services industry. 8 BIS Review 112/2008 
John Murray: Measuring inflation – methodology and misconceptions Remarks by Mr John Murray, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Certified General Accountants of Ontario, Toronto, 18 September 2008.  *      *      * These past few months have been busy for central bankers, to say the least, and the past few days are certainly no exception. While developments on Wall Street have garnered much attention, the cost of living has also been an issue for us all, whether we're buying gas at the pumps, booking an airline ticket, or just picking up a loaf of bread at the grocery store. Of course, the cost of living is always front and centre for us at the Bank of Canada, where our primary monetary policy objective is to ensure that inflation remains low, stable, and predictable over the medium term. Some periods, however, are clearly more challenging than others in terms of meeting this objective. To set effective policies in both tranquil and turbulent times, we must understand what drives inflation and be able to anticipate its future movements.  So tonight I'd like to talk in some depth about inflation: exactly what it is, how we measure it, and how we gauge the underlying economic pressures that cause it to rise or fall. I'd particularly like to discuss the Bank of Canada's "core measure" of inflation, and explain why and how it is used by the Bank as an operational guide for monetary policy. I've chosen this topic because of its timely nature, as we now see rising price pressures in various forms. Along the way, I'd like to use this examination of core inflation to highlight for you just how important the Bank's research is to the conduct of Canada's monetary policy. Innovative research and analysis related to core inflation, like all our research efforts, underpin the Bank's policy formulation and implementation of monetary policy, and contribute significantly to our understanding of how the economy operates.  At this point, I should emphasize that the Bank consistently aims for low and stable inflation – not for its own sake, but because it enhances the economy's performance. Aiming for an explicit 2 per cent inflation target not only helps stabilize prices, it also helps stabilize real output and employment, allowing the economy to grow at its maximum sustainable rate. Experience has shown that this is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to the economic welfare of Canadians. Developments in inflation around the globe  Before I go into detail about particular Canadian measures and experiences with inflation, let me take a step back to look at the larger, international picture. As I mentioned a moment ago, Canadians have become increasingly aware of price pressures, but this is, in fact, a global phenomenon. Indeed, sharp increases in inflation have been reported in both advanced and emerging-market economies in recent months. It is true that world prices of oil, natural gas, many minerals, and food products have eased in the past few weeks. Nevertheless, earlier dramatic increases in the prices of these same commodities accounted for sharp increases in inflation. In many cases, these have been some of the highest rates of inflation observed in the past 10 to 15 years. It is important to note that inflation performance varies widely across countries. In some cases, excessively loose monetary policies, implemented in an attempt to push economic growth higher than the sustainable limits of a country's production capacity, have also been an important contributing factor. In many countries, the recent surge in inflation has been coupled with a dramatic slowing in real economic growth, rekindling memories of the 1970s and concerns over stagflation – the uncomfortable combination of high inflation and slow or negative growth. Most observers BIS Review 112/2008 1 
believe it would be too great a stretch to draw parallels between the current experience and that of the 1970s. Still, recent developments do pose a serious policy challenge for central bankers, especially when combined with the dislocation and difficulties evident in global financial markets. Conventional monetary policy reactions might not be appropriate in circumstances where we see a combination of rising inflation, slowing GDP growth, and concerns about financial instability. Rising inflation, for example, often leads to calls for tighter monetary policy. Yet, would that be wise if a slowing economy and other developments were expected to reverse these inflation pressures in the future? Slower economic activity often leads to calls for easier monetary policy. But would that reaction be wise if inflation pressures were believed to be rising rather than receding?  Around the world, monetary authorities are determined not to repeat the policy errors of the 1970s, when overly stimulative measures led to double-digit inflation and rising inflation expectations. We all seek reliable indicators with which to gauge how serious and long-lasting the current inflation pressures might be. This kind of information can materially affect the stance of monetary policy. This illustrates why monetary policy-makers must gather and weigh as much information as possible in their decision making – and why inflation research is so important. Defining and measuring total and core CPI inflation Before I describe some of our inflation research, let me give you some background on the measures of inflation that we use at the Bank of Canada: measures based on Statistics Canada's consumer price index (CPI). Inflation is, of course, defined as a persistent increase in the average price of goods and services; in other words, a trend increase in the cost of living. In the broadest terms, this is measured by the total, or headline, CPI, which tracks the retail prices of a representative "shopping basket" of goods and services over time. It is also the rate that the Bank of Canada officially targets for its monetary policy. Here I would remind you that the Bank and the federal government have a formal agreement that sets out a target of 2 per cent for the annual rate of increase in the CPI. As I said earlier, we pursue low and stable inflation because it enhances the performance of the economy.  Yet, as much as we aim for low, stable, and predictable inflation, there will always be sharp movements in total or headline inflation. These are generally driven by volatile price changes in a small number of goods and services. In Canada, for example, fully 90 per cent of the observed monthly variations in the CPI are linked to price changes in just 8 of the 54 major goods and services categories included in the CPI. Further, these price changes are often volatile and are often quickly reversed. They therefore add considerable "noise" to total CPI, making it difficult to discern genuine movements in trend inflation. For this reason, many central banks calculate core inflation measures, which are designed to minimize the influence of the most volatile components of the CPI. Although opinions differ among central bankers concerning the usefulness of core inflation measures, many monetary authorities – including the Bank of Canada – find these measures helpful for two important reasons. First, by focusing on the more stable components of the CPI, policy-makers are able to get a better fix on the underlying trend in inflation. This is important, because monetary policy operates with long and variable lags. It can take as long as two years before the full effect of a policy change is felt on inflation. Monetary policy must therefore be forward-looking, focusing on a one- to two-year horizon. Any attempt to control short-term movements in inflation is likely to prove to be counterproductive and will simply destabilize both inflation and real economic activity. Core inflation can, therefore, serve as a useful operational guide for policy by looking past these short-term price movements. The second reason core inflation measures can be useful is that they can help anchor the inflation expectations of businesses and households. Having an explicit 2 per cent target for 2 BIS Review 112/2008 
inflation, coupled with a strong commitment to achieve it, goes some distance towards realizing this objective. But providing a reliable measure of core inflation that the public can readily use to track trend movements in the CPI can strengthen the anchoring of expectations by providing assurances that the Bank will not allow the rise in volatile components to spread to other prices. The Bank of Canada's core inflation measures Now, let me talk about our core measures in detail. Measures of core inflation are usually calculated in one of two ways. The "exclusion method" is the most straightforward and, as the name suggests, involves excluding the prices of those goods and services that typically display more than a predetermined amount of variability. The "reweighting method," in contrast, doesn't exclude the prices of any goods and services. Instead, it assigns a weight to each component that is inversely related to its volatility. In other words, more volatile price series are given a lower weight. The core inflation measure that the Bank of Canada currently uses is called CPIX and is based on the exclusion method. It removes eight of the most volatile components of the total CPI, as well as the effects of changes in indirect taxes such as the GST. The excluded items in CPIX are fruit, vegetables, gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, mortgage-interest costs, intercity transportation, and tobacco products. It is important to note, however, that the Bank calculates and monitors several different measures of trend inflation, not just CPIX. It uses these, along with many other sources of information, as checks against its preferred core measure. While all of the measures of trend inflation tend to move in a similar fashion, the differences can be informative.  It is also worth noting that the Bank has changed its definition of core inflation over time, to improve its reliability. When the Bank first began targeting inflation in 1991, the core inflation measure it adopted was similar to that used by many other central banks and excluded all food and energy prices. As a result, it was less inclusive than the current measure. After gaining more experience, and through a process of extensive research and analysis, the Bank refined its core inflation measure, as well as the set of additional measures that it currently follows. In 2001, the Bank moved to CPIX because of its demonstrated superiority on both empirical and theoretical grounds. Its advantage was confirmed by additional research when our inflation targets were renewed again in 2006, and it has recently been retested as part of a more comprehensive international study looking at a range of measures of total and core inflation. Clearly, this process of refinement and retesting never ends. This is because it is crucial that we be able to determine the most effective indicators of underlying inflation and how these might be further refined and improved upon over time. So the next question becomes: how can we distinguish between good and bad measures? An effective core measure must have four key properties. First, and most obviously, a core measure should be less volatile than total inflation. Second, it must be unbiased. By this we mean that the core inflation measure must track long-run movements in the total CPI very closely. Third, a good core measure must also be a reliable predictor of future trend movements in the total CPI. Fourth, a good core measure must be easy to understand and to explain to the public.  When all four requirements are considered together, CPIX has been shown to be as good as, or better than, all of the alternative measures that the Bank might use. Other measures may outperform CPIX when they are judged on just one or two of these four criteria. CPIW, for example, which is calculated using the reweighting method, can give slightly better predictions of the total CPI and bears a somewhat tighter relationship to the long-run trends in the total CPI. These differences are very minor, however, and are offset by other considerations such as ease of understanding. For this reason, CPIX is still the Bank's preferred core measure. Nevertheless, given the demonstrated strengths of CPIW and one BIS Review 112/2008 3 
or two other trend measures, the Bank continues to monitor a set of indicators rather than relying on any single one. Popular misconceptions about core inflation Our choice of CPIX as an operational guide for monetary policy has, at times, been a source of controversy and has led to several popular misconceptions. Journalists and other interested observers frequently question the use of CPIX and other measures of trend inflation as operational guides. They argue that such measures give an overly sanguine picture of true inflation, especially during episodes of sharply rising food and energy prices. Critics say that CPIX inflation is frequently lower than total CPI inflation because, they claim, the Bank has stripped out the fastest-rising prices. These critics of CPIX argue that it doesn't relate to the real-life experiences of typical households. "After all," they point out, "what household doesn't buy food, drive a car, or have a mortgage?" I'll respond to these criticisms with three related points. First, and most importantly, the Bank's official target of 2 per cent inflation is based on total CPI inflation, not on CPIX. The latter is only one of several indicators used to judge where the total CPI is likely to go in the future. It is an important indicator that we use to judge what the inflation trends are, but it is not our target. Second, the Bank's decision to use core inflation as a policy guide is based exclusively on empirical considerations. CPIX is used only because it has been shown to track future movements in total CPI better than the past movements of the total CPI itself. If this were to change, and if CPIX no longer outperformed the total CPI in this regard, we would stop using it. Finally, as noted earlier, it is critical that the Bank continue to focus on the future trend of CPI inflation, as opposed to its current level, because monetary policy operates with such long and variable lags. If the Bank were to react to every observed change in total CPI, it would destabilize both inflation and real economic growth. It would be reacting to volatile changes in a small subset of prices that would likely reverse course in the near future. Is core always a better predictor than total CPI inflation? Experience in Canada has shown that core inflation does outperform total inflation as an operational guide for policy. When the two series deviate, total CPI inflation tends to converge on core inflation rather than the reverse. Core inflation is therefore a better guide as to where total inflation is going. This phenomenon might reflect the success that the Bank has enjoyed over the past 17 years in keeping total CPI inflation close to its 2 per cent target. When total inflation temporarily moves higher or lower than the target, households and businesses know that it will probably return to target within a relatively short time. Some countries haven't enjoyed the same positive experience. They've found that core inflation tends to deviate persistently from total CPI inflation and is not a very reliable measure of underlying inflation pressures. These differences have been documented recently by researchers at the Bank, but they are not well understood.1 They appear to be systematic in nature, as opposed to chance occurrences, and Bank researchers suspect that they reflect differences in the way core inflation is defined, as well as structural differences in                                                  1  Serious research at the Bank of Canada on alternative measures of core inflation began with the work of Laflèche (1997), Crawford et al. (1998), Hogan et al. (2001), and Macklem (2001), who built on the efforts of Canadian academics such as Parkin (1984) and U.S. policy-makers such as Cogley (1998). It continued with contributions by Armour (2006) and has been extended more recently through the innovative analysis of Hoddenbagh et al. (2008) and Martel (2008). 4 BIS Review 112/2008 
the various economies. Such a situation isn't so surprising in less-developed countries and in emerging markets; however, long-standing differences between core and total inflation have also been observed in advanced countries. Core inflation measures tend to perform very well in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, for example, but they perform poorly in the euro zone, Japan, and the United Kingdom. More research will be needed to understand these differences.2  The Bank's successful use of core CPIX has helped anchor Canadian inflation expectations which, in turn, has helped dampen movements in total inflation. If households and businesses are convinced that inflation will soon return to 2 per cent, they are less likely to form extrapolative expectations based on movements in current headline inflation. Consequently, they are less likely to push prices higher or lower. This self-reinforcing cycle makes the Bank of Canada's job much easier and is clearly beneficial for the economy as a whole. Canada's strong performance on the inflation front over the past 17 years is a testament to the usefulness of our inflation targets, our timely monetary policy actions, and the supportive role played by core inflation measures. Implications for Canadian inflation So what is CPIX telling us about current price pressures in Canada? On the face of it, it would seem to suggest that the underlying, or trend rate of inflation has recently been at about 1.5 per cent. Although this measure is likely to rise modestly towards the end of this year, it is still well below the headline or total CPI inflation rate, which has been running at about 3.4 per cent. Because that 1.5 per cent core rate is also below the Bank's 2 per cent target for inflation, can we assume that inflation in Canada is not much of a problem? I wouldn't want to go that far, but the relatively low level of CPIX does provide at least some reassurance that inflationary pressures are reasonably contained. Further, as we said in our 3 September interest rate announcement, we anticipate that certain temporary factors now affecting both the total and CPIX measures of inflation should dissipate over the coming quarters and that both measures will converge on 2 per cent in the second half of 2009. In the interim, total CPI inflation is likely to continue rising, as past energy-price increases push it higher. However, the recent decline in both spot and futures prices for energy commodities means that the spike in total CPI inflation expected between now and the first quarter of 2009 will be lower than projected in July. Seen from another perspective, does the current 1.5 per cent CPIX rate suggest that inflation is too low, implying underlying economic weakness? I wouldn't want to make that assumption either, because other trend measures suggest that underlying inflation is a touch higher than 2 per cent. Further, there is reason to believe that, over the most recent period, CPIX has shown a very slight downward bias in its estimate of trend inflation. This is due to the higher weight that it assigns to automobile purchases than some of the other trend measures do, plus its exclusion of mortgage interest costs. This has been particularly apparent recently, as auto prices have been falling over the past 12 months, while home-finance costs have been rising faster than many other items in the CPI basket. I don't think this means that the CPIX measure is no longer reliable; rather, this is likely a temporary situation. But it serves to demonstrate why it is important to look at a range of indexes and to understand why they may be moving differently.  Finally, I want to say a few words about inflation and monetary policy in the context of the recent market turmoil in general, and the events of the past few days in particular. We know from experience that inflation control works much more predictably when there are well-                                                 2  One cause of the poor performance of core inflation measures in the United Kingdom and euro zone is that these jurisdictions use a harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) that excludes shelter costs – an important piece of the cost of living.

functioning financial markets operating within a sound and stable financial system. While markets in Canada have certainly been volatile in recent weeks, it is worth noting that strains in Canadian credit markets have been considerably less intense than those seen in the United States and elsewhere. The Bank is committed to supporting the efficient functioning of financial markets, and earlier today, announced that it will enter into a $2-billion, 28-day term purchase and resale agreement. The case for further operations will continue to be reviewed in light of conditions in financial markets. Canadian banks have healthy balance sheets and absolute leverage that is significantly lower than many of their international peers. They are less exposed than their U.S. counterparts to the subprime-mortgage market that is at the root of the market turmoil, and are less dependent on securitization for their financing and on capital markets for their revenues. Throughout this period of market turmoil, the Bank of Canada has remained in close contact with policy-makers both in Canada and abroad, including colleagues in other major central banks. We are closely monitoring global market developments, and will continue to provide liquidity as required to support the stability of the Canadian financial system and the functioning of financial markets. Conclusion There are four main messages that I would like you take away from this evening's presentation. First, core inflation continues to be a useful operational guide for monetary policy. Second, it is always combined with other information as a check on the current state and future direction of trend inflation. Third, CPIX has not replaced the total CPI as our official inflation target. It is simply a tool that helps us achieve our 2 per cent objective for total CPI inflation. Finally, our continued research on this and other critical policy issues makes a vital contribution to the Bank's ability to successfully carry out its responsibilities. As I said off the top of my remarks, our research at the Bank has been crucial to the effective conduct of Canada's monetary policy. Of course, our researchers continue to make a contribution today as they explore the feasibility of new and innovative ways to calculate core measures, as opposed to the standard exclusion and reweighting methodologies. Of course, our researchers are working on many issues, which I don't have time to discuss now, but I do encourage you to visit the Bank's website for more information.3References Armour, J. 2006.

Nout Wellink: Wim Duisenberg, financial turmoil, fit and proper, need for financial education Speech by Dr Nout Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the Opening of Duisenberg School of Finance, Amsterdam, 15 September 2008. *      *      * Introduction Allow me to start with a short anecdote regarding Wim Duisenberg. As you know, Wim was professor in macro-economics at the University of Amsterdam. He obtained his PhD in 1965 on “The economic consequences of disarmament”. The evening before the promotion ceremony his friend Jan Pen called him. After having a general discussion on the topic, he pointed out that Wim had made a rather severe mistake on page so and so. As Pen had spotted the mistake, he informed Wim that he would question him during the day to come. Pen persisted and indeed, the next day, during the ceremony he pointed out the mistake to Wim and asked him what he was going to do about it. Wim was summoned to answer to this accusation – and calmly replied: “Thank you, we will take this into account in the next print”. Wim Duisenberg Wim was, as this story points out, a man of science AND of practicality. He cherished the high arts of financial theory as an IMF advisor, but simultaneously relished the speed and actions that the financial system demanded, as Minister of Finance and as Central Bank President. It was in his position as President of De Nederlandsche Bank that Wim made clear statements on his ambition to combine theoretical knowledge with practical expertise. He adamantly supported the transfer of the Bank’s research department out of the dark and dusky vaults, shaping it into a more vibrant and policy oriented department. Wim wanted to have the best minds within the Bank at the disposition of those that had to take stands on practical policy decisions. The forged alliance could tackle any issue at hand. This was few decades ago, but Wim was ahead of his time and quickly came to realize that having the best minds does not offer a singe packet solution to financial institutions, including to De Nederlandsche Bank itself. Keeping your best people rooted in financial practice and education – one not without the other – was his core policy. Current events & black swans Wim was not on his own in wanting to have the best minds for his organisation. Nowadays, many companies keep stressing that they themselves have the “best and brightest”, taken from high class universities all over the world. Yet, the turmoil in financial markets spurs me to occasionally ask a board member of any of these institutions if they do not feel too big to be managed. The general reply is that simply because the “best and brightest” are part of the company, there is no further need to enhance the management structure, or even look into additional safeguards. It is these companies that tend to ignore that knowledge needs to be applied sensibly. If anything, it is exactly the current turmoil which stresses not to single-handedly focus on those among us that excel in their financial, theoretical skills, if this implies that we fail to open our eyes to external developments. Developments such as risk management, corporate governance and social responsibility, all of which shape the way the financial system works on a day to day basis. BIS Review 111/2008 1 
“Our blindness with respect to randomness”, as skilfully narrated by Taleb in his Black Swan, clearly underlines this point. As all of us tend to have limited to no knowledge at all of unexpected events, the proposition “we know” is an illusion. Science of risk management, for instance, adds knowledge, but does not uncover the full veil of the world and its events, which leaves us with Knightian uncertainty. As such, the value of experts can also be questioned, if this implies that experts do not take empirical evidence into account, but base themselves merely on their own, by nature limited, expertise. What a globalized world requires is continuous education, discussion and peer to peer stimulation to keep up with the pace of exactly these unexpected events. Fit and proper This emphasis on up-to-date financial knowledge is also reflected in our own focus on fit and proper requirements of financial institutions in the Netherlands. Starting at the top, knowledge and expertise at a board level is a prerequisite. The Bank as supervisor has the task to monitor and uphold these. To ensure the proper discharge of their responsibilities, it is important that board members have the skills to run the company. They should have personal qualities such as honesty, diligence, independent-mindedness and fairness, in order to ensure that the company is run ethically, in compliance with relevant legislation and in a manner that treats its customers fairly. “Propriety” requires that they are of good repute and integrity. “Fitness” requires that a person appointed as a director or manager has the necessary professional qualifications, knowledge and experience to enable sound and prudent management. In Dutch law regarding pension funds – Pension Fund Governance – further elaboration has led to extensive overviews from within the pension sector on specific fitness issues. The ability to manage an organisation is an obvious one, as is having knowledge of applicable laws and regulations. Financial education Having said that, even if at the board level these issues are tackled properly, this is not sufficient enough. It is throughout the organisation that adequate knowledge and expertise has to be available; the capacities of a board member on its own cannot be used to sign off for an organisation as a whole. Financial education provides the means to realize fitness and propriety on every essential level in financial organisations and having a clear understanding of risks involved, of the need of integrity, structure and governance. Conclusion Concluding, this brings me back to Wim Duisenberg. Wim was, as I mentioned, ahead of his time. His wish to combine financial theory and practice is reflected even more than ever in the current times, where uncertain events of differing magnitude force us to reconsider our own validation methods. The Duisenberg school of finance bares witness to that. Our partners, as we have seen and heard today, have given the clear commitment to invest in financial education, in future students and in a manner of education and research that outstretches the current limitations on financial knowledge. I cannot imagine anyone more suited than Wim to lend his name to the institution that is officially opened here today. 2 BIS Review 111/2008 
Glenn Stevens: The director’s cut – four important long-run themes  Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Australian Institute of Company Directors Luncheon, Sydney, 17 September 2008. *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. We are living through challenging times for decision-makers in both private and public roles. The past year has seen a major change in international economic and financial conditions. Global economic growth, having been well above average for a string of years, has slowed noticeably, especially in the major industrial countries – yet inflation rates remain a concern. Large losses have been incurred by major international financial institutions. Several household names in global investment banking have disappeared. Appetite for risk – which had been strong to the point of recklessness in some areas – has given way to risk aversion. Credit is harder to obtain, and more expensive. Australia has been affected by these forces, but much less than the countries at the epicentre. Our financial system is weathering the storm well. Amid all that excitement, it is useful occasionally to step back from the high-frequency detail to focus on the bigger picture. Today, I propose to talk about four low-frequency, big-picture themes – all of which are nonetheless amply demonstrated in the course of events over the past year or two. The themes are: • the emergence of China; • the economics of a fully employed economy; • the end – perhaps? – of the long period of households leveraging up their finances; and • shifting perspectives about the regulation of the financial sector in the economy. China I am not talking here about the notion of “de-coupling” and so on. That term is actually unhelpful – nothing is ever really de-coupled; everything is connected. But the connections are complex, various forces are at work and reasonable people will have differing opinions about how things will play out over a year or two. At present, China is slowing, partly as a result of the slowdown in the United States and Europe, but partly by design of domestic policy. The Chinese policy-makers have been seeking some slowing because of evident overheating, and are now in the position to be removing some of that restraint. But the emergence of China as an industrialised economy is a fundamental long-term change to the economic, financial and political landscape whose full consequences I suspect we can barely appreciate as yet. This has been happening for a couple of decades now, but the nature of its impact is gradually changing. For some years, it was too small to notice – even a country with a lot of people is small economically if their per capita incomes and productivity are very low. Then, some time in the 1990s, China became quantitatively important enough for the rest of the world to enjoy the disinflationary effects of added Chinese production capacity, as millions of low-cost workers turned out manufactures, in the process lowering global prices. More recently, we have been experiencing a new effect of that growth, namely the effect of higher Chinese living standards on the price of energy and natural resources. f course, this is BIS Review 111/2008 1 
not confined to China – it is happening around the developing world to a greater or lesser extent. But China is the biggest example. Commodity prices are coming off their peaks at present, though key prices for Australia are still very high. Even if this marks a cyclical turn for such prices, in the longer term this new claim on energy and other resources will not go away. Other countries are having to adapt to that. The rise in prices for energy and raw materials has made it harder for those countries to combine the steady growth and low inflation that had characterised the period from the early 1990s until about the middle of this decade. At the same time, this extraordinary increase in the demand for natural resources and energy has raised Australia’s terms of trade by close to two-thirds in the space of five years – the largest shock of its kind for five decades. So the economics of this for Australia are therefore a bit different from those for the “average” industrial country. Like others, in the energy-using parts of the economy, we find it more difficult to combine steady growth and low inflation. But in addition, we have had to absorb a massive income boost.1 Of course, there are worse problems to have! Nonetheless, significant adjustments are occurring – to the structure of the economy, to where the population lives and how the national income is earned and distributed. Unless resource prices reverse a long way, these trends will continue. China’s emergence is surely far from complete. China, like all economies, will have cycles. But its average growth rate is likely to be pretty high for years ahead, even if not as high as it has been recently. This is an opportunity and a challenge for Australian business and policy-makers, and not just in the resource sector. Economics of full employment Over recent years, the Australian labour market has been as tight as at any time seen in a generation. The rate of unemployment in the past 12 months, at about 4 per cent, has been as low as at any time since 1974. In surveys and our discussions with firms, difficulty securing labour has been a common problem. The term “capacity constraint” has been a part of the Australian economic lexicon over recent years in a way not seen for a long time. Survey measures of capacity utilisation have been very high, and fixed investment to increase capacity is running strongly. Let’s be clear that full employment is a good thing. It is one of the statutory objectives given to the Reserve Bank in our Charter (though interestingly the authors of the Act never quantified what they meant by full employment, nor for that matter, by “stability of the currency”). But the economics of full employment are different from the economics of trying to get to full employment. This is a simple point, but an important one. When the economy has too much spare capacity – say, in the aftermath of a business cycle downturn – the aim of macroeconomic policies is to push up demand so that it catches up to supply potential. There may be several years in which demand growth exceeds the normal pace as it eats into the spare capacity. Once the spare capacity has been wound in, however, actual growth in demand and output has to slow, to match the growth rate of potential supply. That growth in potential supply is given by the growth in the labour force, the capital stock and the productivity of those factors of production. Typically we think of “potential GDP” in Australia rising by something like 3 per cent a year, give or take a bit.                                                  1  For those of you who are interested, I have set out my views on this in an earlier address.

This, as my predecessor Ian Macfarlane remarked a few years ago, means that once the reserves of spare capacity are pretty much used up, we should expect to be accustomed to growth rates for GDP starting with a 2 or a 3. There will not be many with 4s or 5s, as we had for some years through the 1990s and earlier this decade. Periods of growth noticeably above about 3 per cent will be roughly matched in frequency and duration by periods below – as we are having now. If we set our aspirations higher than that – if we try for above-average performance all the time – we will just get inflation. That is the economics of full employment. Now you may feel that a growth rate for real GDP of something like 3 per cent on average is not that high. Is that the best we can do? Can’t we lift it? The only way the potential growth rate can be lifted is by adding more factors of production – more labour and capital – or raising the growth rate of productivity. Over the long term, the key is productivity. On that front, productivity growth does seem over the past several years to have settled at a lower average rate than we had seen since the early 1990s. This may have several causes, and the experts debate them. But over the years ahead, as a community we must be sure not to let up on our efforts to keep productivity growing. I have no specific policy prescriptions here – only general ones – trying to sustain competition, to keep markets open, to maintain flexibility and so on. But those general values are worth recounting from time to time. Household balance sheets A feature of the economic landscape of the past decade and a half has been the long gearing up of households. In the early 1990s, household gross debt in Australia was equal to about 50 per cent of average annual household disposable income. This year, it reached about 160 per cent. Households’ assets rose generally in parallel, though not quite as fast, with total assets rising from about 460 per cent of income in 1990 to over 800 per cent at the end of 2007. (Assets have fallen somewhat since then, with the decline in the share market and some softening in housing prices.) The ratio of debt to assets rose from under 10 per cent in 1990 to about 18 per cent in 2008. The ratio of housing debt to housing assets reached about 27 per cent. Very similar trends have been seen in a number of comparable countries around the world, so in thinking about the causes, we should not look exclusively for domestic causes. But in summary, the main factors behind this big increase in the size of the household sector’s balance sheet were: • the general tendency for financial activity and wealth to grow faster than income, which has been a feature of most economies since at least as far back as the 1950s; • an increased pace of financial innovation – and, in particular, a lot more credit has been available, particularly over the period since the mid 1990s, to households. In recent years around the world, anyone who was creditworthy – and some who were not – have been able to access ample amounts of credit;  • the big decline in inflation. This lowered nominal interest rates dramatically.2 This happened in all countries, though the timing differed. In Australia it was a big factor after 1992;                                                  2  With the fall in nominal interest rates, a big front end loading problem in servicing the conventional mortgage was eliminated. See http://www.rba.gov.au/PublicationsAndResearch/Bulletin/bu_oct97/bu_1097_6.pdf. BIS Review 111/2008 3 
• a period of pretty low long-term interest rates globally, which encouraged borrowing around the world, though this was a bigger factor in the United States than here. This had a lot to do with the build-up of savings relative to investment in Asia; • a desire to devote a higher share of a rising income to acquiring housing services. As people’s income increases, certain goods and services will take a declining share of total spending – food, for example, or products, such as electrical goods or clothing, which have large falls in their relative prices over time. But other types of products take an increasing share of income. Housing has tended to be in that category. As we have become wealthier, our aspirations for housing in terms of position, quality and size have naturally enough increased. But for various reasons the supply is not very elastic – there is only so much well-located land, and other factors have affected the supply price of dwellings more generally. In the end, a lot more of our income is devoted to housing, acquired by servicing mortgages, than was once the case. The question is whether this long period of gearing up by households might now be approaching an end. Certainly household credit growth is much slower at present than it has been for some years, running roughly in line with income growth. Might we see this conservative approach to debt among households persist? It is hard to know the answer to this question. There is much more of the household balance sheet that could, in principle, be turned into collateral, so gearing up might resume once the current turmoil has passed. But there is also a good chance that households will for some time seek to contain and consolidate their debt, grow their consumption spending at a pace closer to income, and perhaps look to save more of their current income than in the recent past. It is possible that we are witnessing the early part of a new phase where the household spending and borrowing dynamic is different from the past decade and a half. Time will tell. But if that is the trend of the next several years, the growth opportunities for businesses and financial institutions will be different. And whereas the household balance sheet has been the big financial story of the past 15 years, some other financial trend will probably be the bigger story of the next decade. There are some developments that suggest the balance sheets of governments might well be expected to expand a good deal. The need for support of the finance sector in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom is one. The build-up in public infrastructure in Australian cities and regions may point in the same direction, though to a lesser extent. If the sudden aversion to these sorts of assets by private investors continues for any length of time, governments may have to choose whether to fund the projects themselves, or defer them. Fortunately, public balance sheets in this country are in a very much stronger starting position than those in most other countries. Financial stability and regulation All the issues surrounding the use, or not, of the government’s balance sheet to support the financial system have been on prominent display over recent months. We have seen the actions by the US Treasury to take over the running of the two large entities known as “Fannie” and “Freddie”. As Secretary Paulson commented, the ambiguity about who was bearing risk in these entities has been a problem for a long time, and it needed to be resolved. The US Government has shouldered the burden that investors always assumed it would, but has, quite appropriately, done so in a way that minimises the extent of bail-out for private shareholders who had been profiting from the risk-taking behaviour. Facing up to these problems where the entities concerned were regarded as effectively guaranteed by the government was one thing. The question of support has also arisen for entities which have always been seen as purely private, and hitherto not, at least explicitly, 4 BIS Review 111/2008 
regarded as so central to systemic stability that failure could be costly. The events of the past few days illustrate how difficult these issues have become. In all these cases though, in the final analysis there was not enough capital behind the risks that were being taken. The sophisticated financial system of the 21st century was supposed to spread risk, but a lot of the risk ended up being concentrated on the books of highly leveraged institutions. High risk and high leverage proved to be a fatal combination. It always does. Some significant questions arise from all this. The main one, put at its broadest and simplest, is whether something can and should be done to dampen the profound cycles in financial behaviour, with associated swings in asset prices and credit, given the damage they can potentially do to an economy. This debate has been going on for quite some years. There are several points of view. One is that counter-cyclical regulatory measures using the power of the prudential regulator should be taken to dampen the so called “financial accelerator”. This is the process where confidence boosts asset prices, which then provides additional collateral for further borrowing, which then boosts asset prices further and so on – until at some point the whole process goes into reverse and there is a fall in asset values and de-leveraging, as is occurring now. Use of prudential tools to work against these tendencies would be a departure from the way prudential supervision is conducted at present, where the goal is soundness of individual institutions, rather than managing the dynamics of system stability through time. A counter view is that it is not feasible to do this, for various reasons. One is difficulties with tax and accounting rules. Another is that some of the key players are outside the regulatory net – hedge funds for example. This view holds that an effective response against the financial cycles almost certainly involves monetary policy. This would mean raising interest rates in times of booming asset and credit markets, even if goods and services price inflation was contained, in order to provide a stabilising influence over the swings in financial behaviour. Some argue that this could be reconciled with standard inflation targeting, though only if the central bank had a very long time horizon or a great deal of flexibility. A third view is that it is not possible, with policy-makers’ current state of knowledge, to know whether it is correct to lean against such booms, and that in fact it could turn out to be destabilising to try. On this view, the only thing that can be done is to respond to asset and credit collapses if and when they occur, protecting where possible the financial system and the economy generally. That is, to clean up the mess afterwards, so to speak. This has tended to be the US official view, at least up until now. This debate was quite active in the period following the collapse of the dot-com boom in the early 2000s. But those in favour of policy action aimed at moderating financial cycles did not carry the day, I think mainly because the US economy recovered pretty quickly from what was a quite mild downturn in 2001. I sense now, however, that among many thoughtful people this question is once again up for discussion. It will be fascinating to watch how the debate unfolds. Conclusion In the barrage of information with which we must all cope day by day, it is often hard to stand back and see the big forces at work. But those forces – and our responses to them – will ultimately do more to shape the course of our economy and financial system than the short-term news. Hopefully, we can still find some time for reflection about such matters, even in the volatile conditions in which we all find ourselves at present. It is in that spirit that I offer these remarks today. Thank you. BIS Review 111/2008 5 
Bandid Nijathaworn: How strong are Thai banks to weather the turmoil? Keynote address by Dr Bandid Nijathaworn, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the Fitch Thailand’s 2008 Annual Conference, 10 September 2008. *      *      * Thank you, Chairman. First, let me thank Fitch Thailand for the invitation to address this year’s conference as a keynote speaker. Our topic this morning is “How strong are Thai banks to weather the turmoil?” My answer is short and simple: Thai banks are strong enough to weather the current global turmoil. The sector is also well positioned to support the economy. This is the message I gave six weeks ago when we had a press briefing at the Bank of Thailand. Although conditions in the global economy and financial markets have changed somewhat since then, it is the same message of resiliency and strength that I want to echo to you this morning. I agree with the two previous speakers that global financial market conditions and growth prospects have further weakened especially in the past two months. In financial markets, we continue to see falling share price indices and increased spreads in a large number of US dollar products, including high-quality US corporate bonds, money market spreads, and bank credit default swaps. Doubts about additional losses by banks in major economies also persist and this has made it more difficult for banks to raise capital. As a result, funding costs for households and businesses in the major economies have risen as banks continue to tighten credit standards, which is not positive for growth. On account of this, global growth prospects seem to have further weakened, while the decline in oil price have helped ease concerns about global inflation. Future direction of the oil price, however, is still very much uncertain. The global economy and conditions in the global financial markets, therefore, have become more challenging, and they are likely to have important implications for emerging markets through the usual trade and financial channels. This is, therefore, an important area that we need to pay close attention to in the next few months.  Under the current global setting, a decline in oil price will be positive for emerging markets like Thailand, and as a group, the growth prospect of emerging markets should remain satisfactory given their abilities to support domestic demand. But questions remain about individual economies on how resilient they would be in the face of such shocks, including the banking sector. In the Thai case, our assessment is that the Thai banking sector is strong enough to weather the current turmoil. This conclusion is supported by the following five important reasons. First and foremost is the low direct exposure that the Thai banking sector has to sub-prime credit and CDO. CDO exposure of Thai banks at the second quarter of last year was less than 0.3 percent of total asset. Banks with CDO exposure have already made full provision and recognized losses in line with IAS 39, and presently all sub-prime related CDO positions have been unwound. More importantly, Thai banks also do not have investment in US GSE securities. This is another positive point that will help insulate the banks from any further spillovers. Reflecting this, the direct impact of the turmoil so far, on the Thai banking sector, has been limited. Second, on the issue of liquidity and financing, banks in Thailand are predominantly domestic-owned. Hence, they rely more on deposit funding rather than external funding. Domestic funding is a more stable source of funding and is not affected by the turmoil. This feature will help cushion Thai banks from the effects of the global credit crunch. BIS Review 111/2008 1 
Third, fundamentals of the Thai banking system have improved and the key fundamentals are sound and resilient. As a sector, banks in Thailand have enjoyed good profits for the past seven years and are well capitalized with the BIS capital adequacy ratio at 15.2 percent at end of June this year. Over the years, better risk management, improved asset quality, greater provisioning coverage against losses, and the regulatory and supervisory frameworks that meet international standards, have significantly improved the overall risk profile of the sector. As for the most recent quarter, net profit of 57 billion baht was registered in the second quarter of this year. Loan growth in July increased to 11.8 percent while deposits including bill of exchange grew by 1.9 percent. Liquidity in the system remains adequate, with loan/deposit ratio excluding interbank transactions at 90.1 percent in July. On asset quality, gross NPL ratio edged downward to 6.4 percent in June. These numbers show that the performance of the Thai banking sector is quite robust, and is well positioned to support the economy. Fourth, a more difficult picture to assess is the impact of the turmoil on the economy and how this would translate into the impact on the banking sector. So far, notwithstanding the less helpful global environment, the Thai economy has performed relatively well, with growth averaging 5.7 percent in the first half of this year. But going forward, market participants expect the economy to become more affected by the slowing global economy. Our own forecast also sees growth to be less buoyant in the second half of the year, reflecting a more adverse impact on exports. But overall, the momentum of growth should not be too adversely affected given the support that growth could gain from domestic demand which is being supported by high farm income, continued credit availability, and supportive fiscal policy. Moreover, lower oil prices and monetary policy that focuses on inflation should provide a stable price environment conducive to domestic demand and to export competitiveness. Also, continued current account surpluses, lower external indebtedness, and high domestic savings have made the economy’s financial conditions more stable, by reducing its dependency on capital flows. In all, our view is that the improved economic fundamentals and the more flexible policy regime should place the economy in a better position to weather the current turmoil without too much impact on growth and economic stability. And with growth continuing, the performance of the banking sector will also benefit. My last point is that the ability of the Thai banking sector to weather the turmoil is also confirmed by our recent stress-testing exercise which covers credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, linked to a macroeconomic impact scenario. The result indicates that the Thai banking system is quite resilient. Thai banks can withstand sharp economic slowdown and unfavorable market volatility quite well. This is a result of strong profitability and capital accumulation, as well as prudent credit and investment policies over the years. And for our part, given the increased uncertainty in the external environment, the Bank of Thailand will continue to monitor our banking sector and financial markets closely, and to move forward in our regulatory reform to enhance the risk management and the efficiency of the banking system. In the near-term, what we have in the pipeline is a full implementation of Basel II by 2010, which includes the introduction of Pillar I by the end of this year, implementation of Pillar III by the middle of next year, and the introduction of Pillar II by 2010. In addition, to strengthen supervisory framework in line with financial and risk structures of financial groups, consolidated supervision will be phased-in in two steps: first is to introduce qualitative measures this year which have already been done, and the second is the implementation of the quantitative measures by 2010. To conclude, conditions in the global economy and global financial markets have become more challenging. So, this calls for a time of greater caution as we move forward. Also, this means the ability of the banking sector to withstand shocks will be an important prerequisite for any economy in managing the spillovers from the slowing global economy and volatile 2 BIS Review 111/2008 
financial markets. In the Thai case, the strength and the resiliency of the banking sector is with us, and thus they should be well placed to weather the turmoil, without adverse effects on their roles in supporting the economy and in maintaining financial stability. Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 111/2008 3 
Svein Gjedrem: Asset prices and economic policy Address by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the Centre for Monetary Economics (CME)/BI Norwegian School of Management, Oslo, 12 September 2008.  The text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. *      *      * Inflation targeting Inflation targeting was introduced in Norway by Royal Decree in March 2001, after it had been applied for a period in many other countries. Our experience so far has been that inflation targeting has provided a sound basis for stabilising inflation and inflation expectations. In the period from 2003 to the beginning of 2008, inflation was below target. Ever-cheaper goods flowed into Norway from Asia, and with solid productivity growth in Norwegian enterprises, the rise in prices for domestically produced goods and services was also subdued. In an environment of low inflation, the interest rate was also low. At the same time, it was stated that when inflation picked up, the interest rate level would again return to a normal level. Solid growth in output and demand for goods and services gradually led to prospects for higher inflation. Since summer 2005, the interest rate has gradually been raised again to prevent inflation from becoming too high. The interest rate was raised well before inflation moved close to 2.5 per cent. In 2007, the key policy rate reached what we consider to be a normal level. From 2003 and up to the end of 2007, growth in the Norwegian economy was high and gathered momentum both more quickly and more markedly than in the business cycles in the1980s and 1990s. The interest rate has by and large curbed the effects. The interest rate was low in the years between 2003 and 2005 while activity in the economy was still moderate, and has gradually been raised since then. Because inflation was low, the interest rate was kept low in a period of high growth and increasing capacity utilisation. Three factors were important: First, labour has flowed into Norway from other countries. The opening of the labour market to the new EU countries has provided us with access to a reserve of labour. Inward labour migration rose towards the end of the cyclical upturn and has contributed to sustaining the high level of growth. In 2007, the population expanded by more than 56 000, with net immigration at 40 000. This is the highest population growth ever recorded in Norway. Second, businesses in Norway have become increasingly efficient, resulting in lower costs. It has been profitable to hire more employees despite the high wage level in Norway. The business sector has made use of new technology and businesses have been restructured. The many sweeping reforms of the 1980s and 1990s – the fundamental shift in the Norwegian economy1 – resulted in more efficient markets. Over the past few years, we have reaped the benefits of the measures implemented then.  Third, Norway’s terms of trade have improved. Sales of Norwegian exports have been high, and we can import more goods in exchange for the goods and services sold by the business sector. Lower import prices have led to low inflation and a strong increase in employees’ real                                                  1  Jon E. Dølvik, T. Fløtten, G. Hernes and J.M.

wages. High export prices have resulted in solid corporate earnings. Norway’s disposable income increased in real terms by more than 35 per cent in the five years to 2007. Owing to the growth in productivity and improved terms of trade, enterprises have been able to increase their share of value added in spite of higher real wages for employees. At the same time, employment rose sharply and unemployment fell to the lowest levels recorded since the beginning of the 1980s. These factors are now becoming less prominent. It is not likely that developments in Norway's terms of trade will be as positive in the years ahead. Productivity growth seems to be declining – at least cyclical. Wage-earners’ share of value added is rising again, and this restrains labour demand. At the same time, inflation has quickened. High energy and commodity prices are fuelling global inflation. Food and energy prices are also rising in Norway, even though the import share is low. The shift towards imports from low-cost countries has moderated. After falling for several years, prices for imported goods are now beginning to rise.  Looking back, inflation has varied somewhat. The three supply-side shocks reduced inflation while boosting production capacity. Low interest rates, favourable economic conditions internationally and substantial investment in the petroleum sector increased demand for goods and services. High capacity utilisation gradually pushed up inflation. Now that interest rates have risen to a more normal level and the global economic situation is deteriorating, growth is slowing and capacity utilisation may again seem to be approaching levels that are more sustainable. The impact of the downturn abroad on the Norwegian economy is uncertain, but on balance it now seems that inflation will gradually stabilise near 2.5 per cent without unnecessary wide fluctuations in output and employment.   By and large, we must then be able to assert that inflation targeting has served us well during these years.  There have been surprises. The growth potential of the Norwegian economy has been very high. It took a long time for employment to rise after the recovery started, and in 2006 – well into the upturn – inflation fell markedly. Over the past year, import prices and food prices have increased, and against this background the monetary stance may have to be on the tight side for a period. Prevention of systemic risk  At the same time, developments in other countries, and probably also in Norway, have shown that financial and property markets can be a source of instability in prices, output and employment. The US is facing a deep crisis in its financial system. Extensive intervention on the part of the government authorities and the central bank, most recently by placing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship, has probably mitigated the effects, but confidence in banks and financial undertakings has not been restored. European financial markets are also marked by turbulence and uncertainty. Even in Denmark – after nearly 25 years of a highly successful economic policy – a medium-sized bank has failed.2These problems have prompted many countries to review regulations and the functioning of financial and credit markets. Financial and credit markets in Norway have changed considerably over the past 10-20 years, resulting in substantial welfare gains. Enterprises now have access to credit at a more correct interest rate. Households have greater opportunities to smooth saving and                                                  2  See statement by Governor Nils Bernstein, Danmarks Nationalbank, at the press conference about Roskilde Bank, 25 August 2008. (www.danmarksnationalbank.dk). 2 BIS Review 110/2008 
consumption over a lifetime. Less rationing and higher required returns have boosted the growth potential of our economy. Since the end of June 2007, money and credit markets in other countries have been characterised by sharp fluctuations, tight liquidity and reduced risk appetite. The problems started in the US mortgage market, but quickly spread to other financial market segments. Banks, funds and financial undertakings had to bring bonds back onto their own balance sheets, they began to doubt the financial position of their counterparties and held on to their money. As a result, premiums on interbank loans rose markedly. Norwegian banks rely heavily on international markets for their funding. The rise in money market premiums in the US and Europe therefore rapidly spread to Norwegian interest rates, even though Norwegian banks are profitable, enjoy confidence and have limited loss exposure. When banks would no longer lend to each other, many central banks provided liquidity with a longer maturity and lower collateral requirements than usual. Norges Bank has also, in periods, increased the volume of lending to Norwegian banks. We have provided extra short-term liquidity, for example through currency swaps. We have also offered banks loans with longer maturities than earlier.  We have not changed the collateral requirements for loans. This is because we already accepted a broad range of collateral than those central banks. This is because – for reasons we appreciate – the Norwegian government bond market is very thin. For a long time, nor did we have a well developed market for other bonds. At the same time, bank demand for loans from Norges Bank is considerable in some periods of the year. In this decade, we have been able to tighten the collateral requirements somewhat, most recently in 2005, when we among other things restricted access to using bank securities as collateral. At that time, we announced that we would later go a step further. This promise remains intact.   Central bank measures have curbed the fluctuations in interbank interest rates, but only for loans with short maturities. For longer maturities, premiums have continued to rise, and the premium on 12-month money market rates is now more than one percentage point.  The turbulence has particularly affected banks with low deposits and considerable money market loans. Both Roskilde Bank, recently taken over by Denmark's Nationalbank, and Northern Rock, which had to be bailed out by the Bank of England last year, had fairly low deposit-to-loan ratios. Combined with large exposures in the property and construction sectors, this made them vulnerable. Norwegian banks generally have higher deposit-to-loan ratios, although there are differences. Banks and investors, both in Norway and abroad, are now charging higher premiums and higher prices for providing capital for acquisitions, restructuring and investment, and highly leveraged enterprises must pay high risk premiums when they borrow. It has become more difficult to obtain funding. Norges Bank’s survey of bank lending indicates that banks are gradually tightening their lending standards. Household debt growth has recently edged down. At the same time, consumption growth has slowed, but consumption is still higher than disposable income. Corporate credit growth remains high, at least for the time being.  The experience of the financial crisis has prompted governments and others to put liquidity risk higher on the agenda. In June, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision.3                                                 3  See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Bank for International Settlements, June 2008. BIS Review 110/2008 3 
Norges Bank has a role as lender of last resort. This means that Norges Bank can provide an individual bank or the banking system with extraordinary liquidity when demand for liquidity cannot be satisfied by other sources.4 Our view is that the provision of extraordinary liquidity should be restricted to situations when financial stability may be threatened without such support.  Experience shows that the seeds of financial instability are sown during periods of rapidly rising debt and asset prices, including house prices. Over the past 15 years, house prices have surged, and particularly in 2006, even though Norges Bank had at that time already raised the interest rate on several occasions. High household income growth and bank competition for lending and market shares are contributing factors. Nor can we disregard the possibility that in periods developments have been driven by the conviction that prices would only continue to rise.  Unusually low long-term interest rates have probably also fuelled house price inflation in recent years. Norwegian households primarily finance home purchases with adjustable-rate mortgages. Nonetheless, long-term interest rates are important because they provide information about developments in short-term rates that borrowers can expect over time. Now that the interest rate has moved up to a fairly normal level, the rise in house prices has come to a halt, and prices are now falling. We have seen that when the interest rate is raised to curb the rise in prices for goods and services, interest-rate setting also contributes to stabilising asset prices. Moreover, we believe that our communication, where we emphasise that the interest rate is set with view to stabilising inflation, and with forecasts for the interest rate ahead, has contributed to dampening fluctuations.   It is nevertheless important to be aware that in a small open economy like Norway there is little room for setting the interest rate at a level that diverges from that of other countries with the aim of influencing property prices and credit growth. The task of steering inflation is in itself demanding. With Norway’s balance-of-payments position, the effects on capital movements and the krone exchange rate may be considerable. Pursuing a very firm approach to steering property prices and credit will easily lead to a krone out of balance and result in adverse effects on inflation and inflation expectations.  Monetary policy contributes to stabilising developments in the economy. Nonetheless, in some areas, the framework may lead to a situation where business cycles may be self-amplifying. In the following, I will focus on aspects of the functioning and regulation of the housing market and banking activities.  The interplay between developments in the housing market and the credit market is important for stability in our economy. Prices, investment and home sales show considerable swings. Homes are important forms of collateral and price developments influence household borrowing and give rise to credit cycles. Housing loans account for 40 per cent of Norwegian bank balance sheets.5 The framework conditions for the housing market are thus important for how wide fluctuations in output and employment are and for the risk of financial shocks and instability. The experience of the banking crisis in the early 1990s did admittedly entail limited bank losses on loans to households, and substantial losses on loans to business and corporate customers, which were affected by a fall in household consumption. Banks may certainly refer to this when they assess the credit risk of their loans, but they should perhaps not be as certain that people will stand by their creditors in the future as they did 15-20 years ago. Household debt is very high. Attitudes may change and debt servicing discipline may also be influenced by the debt settlement scheme that has gradually become less                                                  4  See Financial Stability 2/2004, p 36, Norges Bank. 5  Including branches of foreign banks, subsidiaries and housing loans in mortgage companies. 4 BIS Review 110/2008 
restrictive.6 Banks should make ample allowance also for this risk in their loan disbursement and interest rate premiums.  It is important for stability in the housing market that the supply of housing reacts rapidly to changes in demand. On this score, our experience has been fairly positive with a high level of residential construction in recent years.  The tax system should treat investment in residential property neutrally and on a par with other investments. Several official studies in recent decades7 – from Sekse to Skauge – have shown that the tax system favours residential property consumption and investment. This leads to overinvestment in residential property, displacing other types of investment. At the same time, the tax system makes it more advantageous to own a home instead of renting.  Through the years, the tax on the advantage of homeownership has been gradually reduced. In 2005, it was removed. Tax deductibility of debt interest was maintained. In practice, this implies a housing investment subsidy. Homeowners benefit from an income deduction for expenses for income acquisition, but do not pay taxes on the income. In central areas where available sites are scarce, the tax advantage will result in a higher level of house prices.  A more neutral taxation of residential property – for example as proposed by the Skauge Commission in 2003 – would also have a stabilising effect on the price level in the housing market. A tax that is based more on market values will increase when house values rise and fall when house values decline. This will curb the willingness to pay when purchasing homes during upturns and sustain it during downturns.  The exemption for residential property tax is a source of more unstable house prices and credit cycles. Interest rate setting cannot remedy this.  Banks primarily rely on lending funds that they have borrowed, either in money and securities markets or from depositors. Norwegian bank equity capital only accounts for about 6 per cent of bank balance sheets. By way of comparison, Norwegian limited companies have an equity ratio of close to 40 per cent. Since banks manage customer deposits and because they have low equity capital, it is important they have effective risk management systems. Banking activities are also subject to regulation and supervision by the authorities. The law establishes minimum levels of capital for banks.  Banking activity is pro-cyclical. During an upturn, the value of assets increases more than debt. This strengthens bank earnings and solidity. Increased equity capital provides room for additional lending. During a downturn, securities values fall and loan losses rise. Banks will then tighten up. Banks state financial assets at market value.8 When value changes rapidly come into evidence in the accounts, bank owners and creditors are provided with better insight into a bank’s financial position, and banks can then rapidly act to maintain their capital adequacy.   The new capital adequacy rules – Basel II – are designed to strengthen the stability of the financial system. The capital requirements seek to ensure that a bank’s capital is commensurate with its risk profile. For Norwegian banks, which have a large proportion of                                                  6  The Act relating to debt settlement (Act 99/1992), which came into force in 1993, shall provide individuals with serious debt problems with a possibility to regain control of their finances.

A new proposal to amend the act is now being circulated for comment. 7  NOU 1973:3 Taxation of dwellings (headed by Tor Sekse) and NOU 2003:9 Tax Commission (headed by Arne Skauge). 8  The IFRS, or a simplified application of the IFRS, applies to banks belonging to a listed company.

housings loans in their loan portfolios, Basel II entails a substantial reduction in capital requirements after a transitional period. This is because highly secured housing loans have a low risk profile. Bank equity ratios have fallen in recent years. At the same time, Tier 1 capital, which is a risk-weighted measure of financial strength, has been stable. This reflects a sharp increase in bank lending secured by mortgages on residential property in this period.  The Basel II framework offers limited experience so far. It presupposes that risk assessments consider the prevailing macroeconomic environment. There is still a risk that banks give excessive weight to recent years’ experiences in their assessments and models. The supervisory authorities can help remedy this by ensuring that banks’ assessment of risk in internal models is based on data from at least on complete business cycle. The supervisory authorities also have the possibility of imposing an extra capital requirement on a bank if the bank has large risk exposures. Banks must therefore perform stress tests to demonstrate that they have sufficient capital to weather a downturn.  Regulatory changes can probably reduce fluctuations in banks’ eagerness to lend. Banks could be required to accumulate additional reserves. One example is that in a favourable economic situation banks could be required to make additional provisions for future losses, as is the case in Spain.9 Another proposal10 is that the capital requirement should be raised when lending growth increases. Banks may be forced to sell large volumes of assets in a crisis situation. Three US academics11 have recently proposed a supplement to the capital requirements in order to reduce this selling pressure. They propose that banks acquire a form of insurance that is paid out when the banking sector as a whole has losses over a certain level. When a crisis occurs, banks will then be assured of a supply of fresh capital.  Foreign-owned branches and subsidiaries have a market share in Norway of close to 35 per cent in terms of total assets. Most of them are chartered in the other Nordic countries. Rules or practices in Norway that diverge from other countries will influence the competitiveness of Norwegian-owned bank and is in practice hardly feasible.12 Other countries will be of the same mind. It is therefore easy, particularly in an upturn, to be drawn into a negative spiral that culminates in a least common multiplier for capital requirements. It is my view that it is important to strengthen cooperation in this area, particularly between Nordic finance ministries and supervisory authorities. We must aim at a common approach to preventing systemic risk.13Nordic cooperation is already extensive, but primarily focuses on crisis management of a potential crisis in cross-border banks. Crisis simulation exercises with the participation of finance ministries, supervisory authorities and central banks – 15 participants from 5 countries14 – illustrate that interests may easily conflict and that coordination is very                                                  9  See Ordonez, M.F. “Speech by the Governor. 2008 International Monetary Conference – Central bankers panel, Banco de Espana, 2008. 10  See article in Financial Times, 4 June 2008, “ A party pooper’s guide to financial stability”. 11  See Kashyap, A.K., R. Rajan and J.C. Stein, “Rethinking Capital Regulation”, 2008. www.kansascityfed.org. 12  In 2006, the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway recommended that the highest loan-to-value ratio for home mortgages with the lowest risk weight using the standardised approach under Basel II be lowered from 80 to 75 per cent of sound mortgage lending value. The Ministry of Finance did not follow the recommendation. Norges Bank agreed with the Ministry of Finance, referring to the effect on competition. 13  See “Can the authorities manage crises in the financial system?” by the Governor Stefan Ingves, Sveriges Riksbank, www.riksbank.se. 14  In the crisis simulation exercise in autumn 2007, all the Nordic countries participated. In addition, the Baltic central banks were observers. 6 BIS Review 110/2008 
demanding. Perhaps above all, the exercises show that we must double our efforts to prevent any further crises in the Nordic banking system. It is also possible that the authorities' hands are tied to a further extent that during the Nordic banking crisis under the EU rules on state aid. It is my impression that the rules are practiced in a way that limits the scope for recovering government funds. If this is the case, government will be more reluctant to intervene in the event of a crisis. Norway has a generous guarantee scheme. Deposits are guaranteed up to NOK 2 million per depositor per bank – an amount that is substantially higher than the statutory minimum of EUR 20 000 in the EU, i.e. about NOK 160 000. Of the other Nordic countries, Denmark has the highest amount at around NOK 325 000. In the UK, the amount has recently been raised to a good NOK 350 000, and a further increase to about NOK 500 000 has been proposed. Other EU countries generally have lower guaranteed amounts.  Since 2007, many branches of foreign banks have become members of the Norwegian scheme to increase their deposit to loan ratio. This is not purely coincidental. The Norwegian scheme is probably slightly naïve in its design. As mentioned, the amount guaranteed is very high, and there has been a period without fee payments. At the same time, the competition for deposits has intensified at home and abroad.  There is an element of moral hazard associated with any insurance scheme. In Norway, even depositors with very large deposits do not have to assess the financial strength of a bank. Our deposit guarantee scheme has a flypaper effect, and under the protection of the scheme the banks have bid up deposit rates to strengthen their liquidity. This will eventually have an effect on lending rates as well.   Norges Bank has reviewed the Norwegian guarantee scheme and in a submission to the Ministry of Finance recommends the following revisions15: • Member banks must always pay a fee  • The membership fee is differentiated more clearly according to the banks’ risk exposure  • … and thus becomes counter-cyclical by using growth in banks’ activities as a supplementary measure of risk exposure  • A reduction in the guaranteed amount per customer  • An increase in the notice of withdrawal for voluntary members of the Norwegian Banks' Guarantee Fund from one to two years  • Branches of foreign banks pay to the extent possible a membership fee according to the same rules that apply to Norwegian banks We have constructed a simple example of how such a fee system could be designed. Our example shows what banks’ total fee payments would have been since 1993 compared with actual payments. The fee rates depend on both the banks’ lending growth and bank’s core capital ratio. The chart also shows actual payments of membership fees. In our example, the fee payments would have been considerably lower early in the 1990s and large in recent years when lending growth has been high. This provides a better profile with small payments in periods of low growth in bank activities and high payments when growth is strong.                                                   15  In a letter of 27 June 2008, the Ministry of Finance has asked the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway to assess the need for regulatory revisions to the Norwegian Banks’ Guarantee Fund. BIS Review 110/2008 7 
Conclusion The experience so far is that inflation targeting has provided a good basis for stabilising inflation and inflation expectations. Interest rate setting and interest rate forecasts have also contributed to stabilising output and employment and prices in property markets.  In some areas, regulations and frameworks can result in amplifications of fluctuations in asset prices and credit flows. For example, tax subsidisation of homeownership can be a source of recurrent instability in house prices and credit. The turbulence in financial markets has prompted many countries to consider measures to improve regulation and the functioning of markets. In Norway, the authorities can also strengthen the work on preventing systemic risk. With our cross-border banks, broader Nordic cooperation, particularly between finance ministries and supervisory authorities, would be appropriate. But there is also work to be done at home. Norges Bank is proposing, for example, revisions to the Norwegian Banks’ Guarantee Fund with a view to reducing moral hazard.  Thank you for your attention.         8 BIS Review 110/2008

Usha Thorat: Financial inclusion and information technology Keynote address by Ms Usha Thorat, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the “Vision 2020 – Indian Financial Services Sector”, hosted by NDTV, Mumbai, 12 September 2008. *      *      * It is indeed very heartening to be here at this WIPRO-NDTV Convergence Conference on “Vision 2020 – Indian Financial Services Sector”. I thank the organizers for inviting me here today. Introduction The banking system has grown enormously in the last five years keeping pace with and in some cases leading the country’s remarkable economic growth. Simultaneously, the banking system has improved its strength, efficiency and resilience. There have also been significant improvements in the payments and settlements system and electronic payments and RTGS is now much more in use. IT has played a major role in these achievements. Today banks have centralised operations, more and more banks and branches are moving to CBS, network based computing, new delivery channels such as networked ATMs, internet banking, smart card based products, mobile access etc and are using IT for customer relationship management, customer transaction pattern analysis credit profiling and risk management.  At the same time, large number of households continues to be excluded from the formal banking system and as per some recent surveys their share has increased. The extent and reasons for exclusion are many and have been well documented in the Rangarajan Committee (RC) and more recently in the very comprehensive and analytical section on financial inclusion in RBI’s latest Currency and Finance (RCF) released a few days ago. The RCF points out that despite the broad international consensus regarding the importance of access to finance as a crucial poverty alleviation tool, it is estimated that globally over two billion people are currently excluded from access to financial services (United Nations, 2006).  Definitional issues No universally accepted definition of financial inclusion is available. Financial inclusion has generally been defined in terms of exclusion from the financial system. Broadly, financial exclusion is construed as the inability to access necessary financial services in an appropriate form due to problems associated with access, conditions, prices, marketing or self-exclusion. The working or operational definitions of financial exclusion generally focus on ownership or access to particular financial products and services. There is no single comprehensive measure that can be used to indicate the extent of financial inclusion across economies. Specific indicators such as number of bank accounts, number of bank branches, that are generally used as measures of financial inclusion, can provide only partial information on the level of financial inclusion in an economy. Measures of financial exclusion Whatever measure one may use for India, it is apparent that the financially excluded constitute a significant share of the population especially amongst the low income groups. Based on the AIDIS 2002 survey, RC showed that 111.5 million households had no access to formal credit. It also showed that 17 million households were indebted to moneylenders. The recent Arjun Sengupta Report on financing enterprises in the unorganized sector has BIS Review 110/2008 1 
pointed out that only 2.4 million out of 58 million units in this sector (with investment of less than Rs 25000 ) have got credit from commercial banks. The AIDIS 2002 also showed that lower the asset class or income, higher the degree of exclusion. These findings are corroborated by Invest India Incomes and Savings Survey (2007). The survey showed that 32.8% of households had borrowed from institutional sources and 67.2 % had borrowed from non institutional sources. The survey also found that 70 per cent of earners in the annual income bracket of more than Rs.400, 000 borrowed from institutional sources as compared with only 27.5 per cent in the case of earners in the income bracket of less than Rs.50,000.  Causes of increased indebtedness from non institutional sources A very interesting analysis by the RCF shows that the major reason for increase in the overall household debt and the increase in the share of households indebted to non-institutional sources between 1991 and 2002 was a significant increase in current farm expenditure and household expenditure, especially in rural areas. The “household expenditure” includes expenditure incurred on purchase of residential plot; purchase, construction, addition/alteration of building for residential purposes; purchase of durable households assets, clothes, among others and expenditure on medical treatment, education, marriages, and ceremonies. Thus, the “household expenditure” includes many items for which households may find it difficult to obtain loans from institutional sources. The IIMS Survey also suggests that a large portion of loan is taken by the households for meeting financial emergency, medical emergency and social obligations. These three purposes accounted for about 53 per cent of the loans availed of by indebted earners. Furthermore, more than 60 per cent earners, indebted to non-institutional sources, took loans for the aforesaid three purposes. In the case of emergencies, people may find it convenient to approach non-institutional sources for their credit needs. Financial emergencies, for instance, include unplanned expenditure on business, consumption and marriage, among others, which may not be financed by banks and other institutional agencies.  Some of the other causes for greater recourse to non institutional sources as identified by the RCF are deceleration in bank credit to households in the context of change in banks’ behaviour in the 1990s due to their impaired balance sheets and tightening of prudential norms and the slowdown in formal credit to households in the context of the slowdown in agriculture and allied activities that may have induced such households to approach non-institutional sources to meet their credit requirements. The RCF has however noted that the last round of NSSO survey related to the year 2002. Subsequently, several policy initiatives have been taken by the Government/Reserve Bank to improve the credit flow to agriculture and the needy sectors. These measures had a significant positive impact on financial inclusion as revealed by the data for subsequent period.  2 BIS Review 110/2008 
  Challenges in achieving FI for inclusive growth Looking at the findings of these surveys and analysis, it is quite clear that financial inclusion has to be an urgent national priority if we are to achieve inclusive growth. The major challenges in banks extending services to the excluded are large costs of covering the huge numbers (cost of enrollment), relative high maintenance costs for such accounts, small ticket size for each transaction, need for communication modes suited to the illiterate and in local language, affordability of the product or service, need for local acceptance and involvement of locally acceptable personnel, need for large scale coverage including over difficult geographic terrain and areas where there is no electric power or normal telecommunication facilities. Further, as is now very obvious from the recent surveys by AIDIS and IIMS, the challenge also lies in offering to low income households and unorganized enterprises a simple loan product which is not based on or linked to the purpose of the loan, the collateral BIS Review 110/2008 3 
or assets held or income earned by the household but is purely based on cash flow and credit record of the household.  Vision 2020 Looking to 2020, it is even more apparent that the task of banking the unbanked will be truly daunting. Nearly 600 million new customers’ accounts will have to be opened and serviced through a variety of channels leveraging on IT.  RBI initiatives for FI In the Annual Policy for 2005-06, for the first time the word financial inclusion was used and banks were asked to open “no frills” or a basic banking account to all those desirous of opening a bank account. Several other aspects such as simplified KYC, OTS for loans upto Rs 25000, offering a GCC/simplified overdrafts etc were also covered. A decentralized approach was advocated through targeting 100% financial inclusion district by district involving the DCC and bank and government officials to facilitate enrolment and identification. Another very important policy measure in January 2006 was to allow banks to adopt the agency model or what is known as the Business facilitator /Business Correspondent model for achieving greater outreach through intermediaries /agents. The results have been extremely impressive. In just two years the number of no frills accounts opened by banks has increased from around half a million accounts in March 2006 to 15 million in 2008. Going by the data from service providers offering smart card solutions, it may be assumed that smart card accounts probably account for 2 to 3 million of these no frills accounts. Evaluation by external agencies appointed by RBI has shown that while the first stage of opening no frills accounts has been quite impressive, due to inadequate f follow up, cost of transaction and access constraints, in many cases the accounts have not been operated upon at all after having been opened. In order to improve access and use of these accounts , banks will have to offer the services much closer to the customer either through mobile branches, satellite offices, extension counters or using intermediaries like SHGs/MFIs or through business correspondents using IT to increase scale, access and reduce cost. Also as is obvious from the results of these recent studies and surveys, the credit product that has to be offered, if the low income borrowers have to be brought into the formal system, has to be simple covering all the needs of small borrowers. I have absolutely no doubt that the simple overdraft or GCC based on cash flow/ track record is the way forward to meet the challenges of providing access to the large numbers currently excluded.   4 BIS Review 110/2008 
SHGs and MFIs role in FI The need for informality in credit delivery and easy access is demonstrated by the fact that SHGs and MFIs constitute the fastest growing segment in recent years in reaching out to small borrowers. These institutions are able to effectively address the small ticket and last mile issues. In the four years between 2003 and 2007, small borrower bank accounts (credit) i.e. upto Rs 25000 increased marginally from 36.9 million to 38.6 million, while SHGs’ borrowing members grew from 10 million to 40.5 million and MFIs’ borrowers grew from 1.1 million to 8 million. In 2007-08, MFIs have added 6 million clients increasing their outreach to 14 million as per data brought out by Sa Daan.  Role of ICT in FI To be able to ensure that the challenges of banking the unbanked are met effectively and converted into growing and sustainable business for banks, there is no alternative to adoption of ICT solutions on a very large scale and range. ICT solutions are required to capture customer details, facilitate unique identification, ensure reliable and uninterrupted connectivity to remote areas and across multiple channels of delivery, offer multiple financial products (banking, insurance, capital market) through same delivery channel while ensuring consumer protection, develop comprehensive and reliable credit information system so essential for efficient credit delivery and credit pricing, develop appropriate products tailored to local needs and segments, provide customer education and counseling, enable use of multi media and multi-language for dissemination of information and advice.  ICT for FI – RBI initiatives I now turn to the specific initiatives of RBI in regard to ICT for Financial Inclusion. The very first initiative was emphasizing the use of IT solutions while adopting the agency or BC model for financial inclusion. A paper placed on the RBI website has envisaged a scheme with RBI support for providing satellite connectivity for remote area branches. The reports of three working groups set up by RBI to consider support to RRBs and UCBs in computerizing their operations and adopt IT solutions for financial inclusion have been placed in public domain for comments. These groups have recommended that the IDRBT could offer interest free loans to UCBs and RRBs for adoption of IT. Based on comments and response RBI will be firming up these schemes. Recognizing the penetration of mobile phones (including amongst the low income population) and the enormous opportunities they offer in extending the banking outreach. RBI had placed a paper on mobile banking in the public domain and the guidelines are now being finalized. The NFS is able to offer nationwide networking of ATMs and can facilitate banking transactions including remittances through ATMs linked to the NFS. Effective from April 1, 2009 a customer will be able to use any ATM (including other bank ATMs) to operate his /her account at no cost. Other initiatives include those aimed at ensuring quicker, safer currency and funds transfer. In fact RBI has put on its web-site yesterday an approach paper on rationalisation of service charges for usage of electronic products, which would facilitate easier movement of funds at lower costs. Electronic benefit payments Recognising the several advantages of using bank accounts for disbursal of government benefits, many State Governments have decided to disburse NREGA payments social security benefits electronically through no frills bank accounts and in some States with such accounts operated through smart cards with bio–metric identification. A Committee set up by RBI examined the various models through which such payments can be made and has recommended a bank led model with sharing of costs between Government and banks. Appropriate support from the RBI or the Financial Inclusion Technology Fund could also be BIS Review 110/2008 5 
thought of in the initial stages. Such accounts that have been opened to receive government benefits/payments can become the base for a host of other financial services and facilitate the objective of financial inclusion.  Regulatory framework The regulations relating to IT solutions for banking services in general and financial inclusion in particular relate to ensuring integrity of banking system and ensuring customer protection. These cover customer identification/authentication, customer confidentiality/ privacy, KYC/AML issues, outsourcing, bank’s responsibility for their agents, ensuring inter–operability and open standards, imaging standards and adherence to payments system regulations. Way forward On the way forward the challenges are going to be banks using multiple channels for delivery of variety of financial services, developing synergies with MFIs and SHGs by introducing seamless ICT based models linked to such intermediaries, availability of skilled manpower to facilitate the adoption of IT on such large scale, use of IT for credit information and efficient credit delivery and risk management in a much bigger way, moving away from the use of cash and emergence of enough leaders in the banking system especially in the public sector banks/RRBs and cooperative banks to recognize the opportunities and take advantage of their specific strengths including location.  6 BIS Review 110/2008 
Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell: Priorities for EU infrastructures and prospects of transatlantic infrastructures Speech by Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the EUROFI Conference, Nice, 12 September 2008. *      *      * Question 1: What are the priorities to develop the competitiveness of EU securities infrastructures? Answer 1: Firstly, from a central bank perspective a clear priority for EU securities infrastructures is to overcome the current fragmentation which leads to unnecessarily high costs, especially for cross-border transactions.  I see T2S as a good example of this. T2S, as a neutral and borderless shared settlement infrastructure, will yield positive scale effects, and it will promote competition in asset servicing, as CSDs strengthen their offerings in services other than settlement. Secondly, harmonisation, harmonisation will lead to further cost savings, transparency and foster competition in the value chain. We will see significant initiatives in harmonisation efforts throughout the securities life cycle, assisted by the catalytic effect of T2S.  The Eurosystem, itself, will initiate work of the T2S advisory Group together with market participants to develop action plans for harmonising both settlement-related processes and processes related to corporate actions.  Thirdly, in order for securing the competitive market place of the single market and thereby maintain and attract issuers and investors to Europe, we need to re-think the risks to the robustness and resilience of the entire financial system, which includes securities infrastructures.  First of all we need a single set of standards consistently implemented in the European Union. In this respect, I welcome the request of ECOFIN to ESCB and CESR to finalise their recommendations. (this will also facilitate harmonisation and avoid regulatory arbitrages that can lead to the “race to the bottom”).  Second, the current financial crisis is showing how fast problems in one market can spread over to other markets. In consequence, the operational processes, risk management policies and procedures of each system are more related to those of other systems.  Therefore priorities should be made to obtain a holistic and systemic European (and maybe global) approach to widening our risk assessment concepts and our coordination with other market participants within the value chain, so that risk and crisis management procedures can be optimised.  After the publication of the CPSS report on interdependencies, central banks are currently investigating if and if so how there is a need to revise the regulatory framework consistently with the new challenges stemming from the growing interdependencies. Enhanced co-operation between the relevant authorities is surely one of the answers. Question 2: What are the main expected impacts of transatlantic infrastructures on the competitiveness of European markets and on EU stakeholders? Could global infrastructures emerge one day? Answer 2: At the trading level, significant changes in market structures are underway and several European and transatlantic cooperation and mergers have already taken place or are foreseen. Stock Exchanges and the new MTFs (multilateral trading facilities) are extending BIS Review 110/2008 1 
the range of instruments offered on their trading platforms to create genuine competition. This offers the potential for lower costs for intermediaries and all classes of investors.  It also improves the prospects for retail investors to diversify their securities portfolios across Europe, increasing the potential returns on investments and diversifying their exposure to financial risks. Issuers should also benefit from greater market depth for their fund raising.  I think we should carefully reflect on three issues: 1. How to draw a balance between regional and global needs? Or in other terms, is a transatlantic infrastructure the best (soundest and more efficient) answer to a “regional” market? Or will a network of interoperable regional infrastructure better fit? 2. A global market does not necessarily require only one global infrastructure. On the contrary competition among a few can be beneficial for the users. 3. So far transatlantic infrastructure has been a US-based infrastructure also serving European markets. The higher integration of US markets provided undoubtedly a competitive advantage to them in doing so.  But nothing prevents a transatlantic infrastructure offering services in Europe and then expanding to other regions. The first two questions are for all market participants and regulators. The last one is more for EU (potential) provider. [T2-S has the potential for being one of this – in the future – transatlantic infrastructure.] The impact of the transatlantic infrastructures also requires changes in the way national authorities operate, being it regulators, supervisory authorities or overseers, since systemic risks extend beyond national borders.  In this aspect, we need to establish effective co-operation arrangements among national and transatlantic supervisory authorities to develop common practices of supervisory structures in financial services, including common reporting and risk management standards without loosing sight of legitimate regional supervisory priorities.  We could make a parallel to the success of the CLS system, which indicates the possible benefits in reduced risk and increased efficiency in global financial services. CLS also suggests that we should not lose sight of the global dimension; in particular, Asia is a large and rapidly growing part of the financial markets.  I can understand that the market participants with global businesses would like to see progress towards a global infrastructure; but they have also been very clear in telling us that the major cross-border costs in securities markets arise from lack of harmonisation. It is for that reason the Eurosystem has pledged to engage with market users to start harmonisation efforts firstly within the field of settlement and corporate action processes. Market users were right to say that consolidation should not be attempted without harmonisation. Global – and transatlantic – harmonisation have to be achieved before single securities infrastructures can be introduced.  Question 3: What evolutions are required in post-trading arrangements to support the development of transatlantic trading infrastructures ie NYSE-Euronext, Nasdaq-OMX? Answer 3: The first area is harmonisation to ensuring transatlantic and global infrastructures are properly overseen and regulated while accommodating legitimate regional supervisory priorities. I see two challenges here: first, regulators and overseers generally tend to lag behind financial innovation and integration; and second, Europe currently still lacks a common regulatory and supervisory structure and framework, which would be an important pre-requisite in achieving a regulatory level playing field. In cases of transatlantic mergers 2 BIS Review 110/2008 
like the NYSE Euronext merger, the risk of a potential “regulatory spill-over” of existing or future US legislation and regulations would be smaller with the existence of a European SEC than without it. So I think the truism that we have to get the European house in order to be prepared for the global challenges is also true when it comes to securities infrastructures.  Furthermore, there will doubtless be work to enhance or develop relatively efficient settlement links or bridges between the two US settlement engines and various CSDs in Europe, to provide a degree of integration of post trading functionality.  The global challenges may be more profound in asset servicing than in settlement – however, I believe that T2S will be of value in simplifying and helping to produce safer and more efficient solutions as the core and central functionality of the financial system.

BIS Review 109/2008 1 Martín Redrado: Financial turbulence – impact on developed and emerging economies (closing address) Closing address by Mr Martín Redrado, Governor of the Central Bank of Argentina, at the Central Bank of Argentina 2008 Money and Banking Conference “Financial turbulence – impact on developed and emerging economies”, Buenos Aires, 1 September 2008. *      *      * When we started planning this event, by mid last year our goal was to exchange diagnoses and innovative ideas that, at the end of the day, would contribute to redesign global policies. And when I say “us”, I mean policymakers and academic economists merging the views of both the emerging and developed countries.  This is exactly what, in my opening address, I suggested we should aim for: taking advantage of this unique opportunity that the international financial crisis provides us in order to reflect on the efficacy of our policies and thus, based on experience, improve the quality of our instruments.  We also undertook to consolidate, in Argentina, an international scenario for debating international finance in these unique circumstances for the global economy. This contributes to our engagement with the world; very often we face many everyday challenges that prevent us from reflecting on more global matters which also affect us.  That is why I would especially like to thank my central banker colleagues and friends from the academic world, with whom I usually meet in various international fora, for promptly accepting my invitation to come to Argentina. Uncertainty persists about the duration and depth of the current global financial crisis. With recession increasing in the advanced economies, it remains unclear how it will continue to spread; what is clear is that the U.S. economy is not disconnected from the rest of the world, as Randy Kroszner stated yesterday in his very convincing remarks.  In this framework, developing countries are relatively stronger vis-à-vis other past events. This is reflected in financial assets that fluctuate less than, for example, comparable U.S. and European assets.  Countries with large fiscal and current account deficits mainly financed with short-term capital flows (e.g. Eastern European, unlike Latin American and Asian countries) are the hardest hit.  In fact, if we aggregate emerging countries with current account deficits above 5 points of GDP and compare them to the rest, we see a difference of almost 500 bp in CD spreads whereas, at the end of 2007, values were similar. Another recurrent theme during these days was the pervasive global inflationary scenario, which poses a challenge both for the developed and the emerging world. In his very interesting analysis of inflation levels in emerging vis-à-vis developed countries, Stephen Cecchetti wonders what these levels would look like if developed countries switched weights with emerging countries and used the consumption basket of the latter. Clearly, the impact of shocks and consumption patterns vary according to each economy and so do economic policy responses.  In the field of policies, another recurrent theme throughout the debate was that each economy has its unique characteristics. It is obvious that, in emerging economies, markets are less deep and instruments, more fragile.  A few minutes ago, Roberto Frenkel pointed out that in economies with a low degree of financial intermediation, the aggregate demand is not so elastic relative to the interest rate, making the fiscal policy more responsible for aggregate demand control.  
2 BIS Review 109/2008 For example, trade-offs between ensuring monetary stability and rebuilding at the same time the same transmission mechanisms are unknown to the developed world. In turn, innovative products arrive at our economies with some delay, at least in a massive way. That is why we insist on the need to have, at least, a good understanding of this problem when designing global policies and regulatory mechanisms. However, what was typical among emerging countries (that is, that bank runs turn into more widespread crises, which include attacks on currency, capital and credit flight, and decline in activity), now threatens developed countries.  This is nothing new, but it is especially relevant in the light of recent events in the global economy. As witnesses of the responses, we see that policy design and implementation also adapt to the different characteristics of each country in the developed world. Financial instability appears as a greater demand for risk rewards. On this matter, Professor Edmund Phelps remarks set us in the right direction.  The debate is complex in itself: there are those who favor ex ante preventive interventions and those who underscore the importance of a decisive ex post action to mitigate the effects of financial collapse.  In turn, some advocate for financial stability issues to be exclusively dealt with through prudential regulation (so that monetary policy may focus mainly on achieving nominal stability objectives) whereas others claim that monetary policy design must take into account the possible ex ante accumulation of trends towards financial imbalance.  Finally, some support a greater involvement of fiscal authorities when dealing with solvency issues, and emphasize the need to preserve monetary policy to address liquidity problems.  Yesterday, Tom Hoenig said that the current crisis is a great opportunity for debating the Federal Reserve’s mandate. Financial stability is a new objective that should be added to the traditional price stability and long term growth objectives. This brings about the question of the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments, such as interest rate or liquidity provision mechanisms, in achieving simultaneous objectives.  If there had been more comprehensive mechanisms to deal with cases like this, maybe it would not have been necessary to make such an intensive use of these instruments.  As Jacob Frenkel remarked in the opening session, “it is not about preventing the crisis but making financial systems more resilient”.  In emerging countries, it was clear that systemic stability had to be maintained, given our history of macroeconomic volatility and recurrent crises. But in the most industrialized countries, where capital markets are deep and highly integrated into the banking system, financial stability was traditionally regarded more as an instrument than as an objective in itself. However, we can now see the fiscal, monetary and financial instruments working “side by side” towards a common goal.  As Mario Blejer stated moments ago, “in times of crisis we need to adapt their action to prevent the crisis from spreading over the rest of the economy”. Current regulatory policies have a procyclical component that must be dealt with in upcoming reforms. José Antonio Ocampo’s proposals on countercyclical capital requirements have been subject to discussion for some time, and so have moving provisions in the Spanish case.  In my view, in order to achieve financial stability, we will probably need to reform existing regulations. In fact, several panellists, such as Viñals and Ocampo, paved the way for a debate on increased policy coordination given the increased interaction of financial markets and the difficulty this implies for independent action. As I see it, this will not stop the increasing financial innovation process but will strengthen the related risk management. In 
BIS Review 109/2008 3 this sense, the degree of interdependence of the global economy in general, and of financial markets in particular, increasingly requires joint international actions.  A greater harmonization of domestic and international regulation will prevent regulatory arbitrage from being used to obtain extraordinary revenues, which was one of the causes of the current crisis. Cecchetti also dealt with this issue and gave us something to think about — something we also emphasized in the opening address. The central bank interest rate is not a complete indicator of financial conditions. We need to improve financial stability measures.  In the case of developing economies, Madame Hu was in favor of using reserve requirements instead of interest rates to deal with the evolution of liquidity conditions. For many economists, she argued, this was “old-fashioned”, but for China it proved efficient. In fact, the use of the interest rate in segmented, shallow and unconnected financial systems has obvious limitations. This shows that the control of monetary aggregates can be appropriate under certain circumstances in many emerging economies. This underscores a point I usually make about monetary policy, which was developed by Marty Feldstein. The profession focused so much on rules that the reference to interest rate and to monetary policy appear to be synonymous. Marty just claimed that monetary policy will continue to lack the ability to strengthen the economy because of the unusual conditions in the housing sector and credit markets, and because the rates were very low and failed to keep the economy going. Central banks have other tools that are perhaps more traditional, but have fallen into abeyance in some countries, such as discount windows and reserve requirements. As you can see, the discussion agenda is long and complex and there is no single optimal approach that could be defined in a vacuum. The coexistence of different policy recommendations was confirmed this morning when two prominent scholars such as Bennett McCallum and Jan Kregel analyzed monetary policy from a theoretical perspective.  In our country, we saw an example of commitment to systemic stability in the past few months with the full implementation of the robust and consistent approach launched in recent years. All instruments were available. We focused all our efforts on restoring the money market equilibrium.  Our system was able to cushion the impact of external disruptions on macroeconomic performance, confirming that the central bank's prudential and countercyclical policies were right, both in the monetary and the financial fields.  Something similar occurs with the exchange rate channel. In my opinion, the current managed floating exchange rate regime is the most appropriate to weather financial turmoil at this time of our economic history.  Analyzing the Asian experience, Zeti has just stressed the importance of foreign exchange predictability for companies to focus their efforts on micro issues.  This reinforces my belief that a managed floating exchange rate regime is the only one possible for the current moment of Argentina signed by a history of volatility.  One of the most distinctive features of the aggregate operating dynamics in Argentina has been the recurrent macroeconomic instability episodes. It is no accident that, in the past 25 years, our economy spent over a third of the time off the dynamic stability path (defined as the range between two standard deviations of the long-term trend), against Australia’s 18 percent or Brazil’s 25 percent. Argentina has similar resources and position in the world to these countries, and should have some symmetry with them as regards the impact of external shocks. These phenomena have severely harmed long-term performance, and were not free of charge in terms of welfare: excessive volatility is probably the main reason for our country’s economic stagnation in the last three decades. 
4 BIS Review 109/2008 Furthermore, our economy is still on its way to its long-term path after exiting an unprecedented crisis, which simultaneously included an institutional breakdown, a huge devaluation, the destruction of the financial system and the default on the public debt.  In Argentina, the monetary policy transmission channels are just being rebuilt, since credit to the private sector accounts for 12 percent of GDP, still far below the Latin American average. Moreover, consumer credit reacts weakly to interest rate fluctuations.  Therefore, the hasty adoption of certain instruments would not only be useless but also hamper their future use. We cannot “take shortcuts”; rather, we must patiently rebuild the power of monetary policy tools. For this reason, comparing the situation of the various emerging countries may lead to wrong diagnoses and policy recommendations.  But it was the reinsurance policies (reserve accumulation and the construction of a solid financial system) that afforded us high liquidity cushions to be prepared for times like these. What would have happened under the same circumstances with a pure floating exchange rate regime in place? Are we prepared for the exchange rate to fluctuate in a short time, as it does in neighboring countries? I do not think so, not yet, given our long history of instability and dollarization. This is something we will learn over time.  It is against this background that Argentina made the decision to settle its debt with the Paris Club, which reflects the country’s willingness to pay and creditworthiness. This decision is part of a comprehensive strategy to access the debt markets voluntarily — not only for the government but also for the private sector. Furthermore, this is a clear proof of what this seminar aims at: an opportunity to turn over a new leaf which is, undoubtedly, a step forward in our country's international financial integration.  After paying the debt, Argentina will continue to maintain robust international reserve levels as a percentage of GDP, both in comparison with other countries and with its own previous historical levels. We are building up reserves thanks to a trade balance surplus which is expected to continue in the next few years. Even after debt repayment and without considering future trade surplus, the international reserve stock is well above its optimal level in terms of imports for the next months, short-term external liabilities and monetary aggregates.  In turn, the national public sector holds AR$30 billion worth of deposits, identical funding is guaranteed in the domestic market and there is a similarly sized fiscal scenario. This exceeds next year’s public debt maturities (capital and interest).  This decision is fully consistent with the monthly trade surplus of USD 1 billion expected for next year — which ensures one of the three basic pillars of the current monetary regime: the prudential international reserve accumulation strategy that also supports the monetary absorption instruments used to regulate the means of payment adjustment. Therefore, this decision is in keeping with our commitment to repeat in the next five years the fiscal performance of the previous period — a primary fiscal surplus of 3.2% of GDP —, and with an economic program fully engaged in the efficient and prudent coordination of various anti-inflationary policies. On the one hand, both the fiscal and the revenues policies should be consonant with the behaviour of primary spending and revenues, respectively. On the other, monetary policy should not only keep fostering the recovery of domestic money demand, but also attempt to consolidate the remonetization of the Argentine economy. The sound coordination of all these policies will most likely extend twin surpluses (fiscal and external). For our country, these surpluses have become the pillars of sustained growth with social inclusion. For the first time in decades, the Central Bank of Argentina has effective tools to protect our economy against any sudden changes. This is the best contribution we can make to ensure two essential public goods: monetary and financial stability, which were missing in the economic history of the past 50 years. Thank you all and see you next year. 
Mark Carney: Reflections on recent international economic developments Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Canadian Club of Montreal, Montréal, Quebec, 25 September 2008.  *      *      * As always, it is a great pleasure to be here in Montréal, and I would like to thank the Canadian Club for inviting me to address its members this afternoon. I would like to take this opportunity to speak in some depth about international economic developments. The events of the past few weeks in global financial markets have been dramatic. Money and credit markets seized up. There was a massive flight to the safety of the highest quality of government debt. Equity markets convulsed and some of the most storied names in finance succumbed. Fortunately, even this ferocious storm has a silver lining: its cathartic nature and the decisive policy response it is prompting could mark the beginning of the end of a 14-month crisis that has gripped the global financial system. A restructuring that for some countries took a decade is now likely to take only a few years in total in the United States. This will greatly reduce the cost in terms of lost output and employment in that country, as well as the negative spillovers to the rest of the world. Nonetheless, the months ahead will bring more financial losses, significant consolidation in the financial industry and further increases in the cost of capital. The eventual reordering of the financial system will be historic.1To some extent, we are experiencing the inevitable correction of a period of unbalanced growth. These are the famous global imbalances, which are characterized by excess savings and underconsumption in major emerging markets, and by negative savings, rapid credit expansion and asset-price booms in many western economies. This correction has not been pretty. The world is now grappling with three major shocks, which have had important effects on the Canadian economy. The U.S. economy is undergoing its first consumer-led slowdown in almost two decades. Global financial turbulence is increasing the cost of capital and decreasing its availability. Finally, commodities have been in a supercycle, with the prices of agricultural commodities nearly doubling, base and precious metals nearly tripling and energy products more than quadrupling since 2002. In the face of these developments, global inflationary pressures have risen even as the global economy has begun to slow. I would like to address each of the three in more detail. Commodity-price volatility The increase in a broad range of commodity prices over the past few years suggests a combination of very favourable and mutually reinforcing factors. These include robust global economic growth and the slow increase in supply of many commodities. Importantly, emerging-market demand has been strong, reflecting sustained growth in per capita income, rapid industrialization and a more intensive use of commodities in production. The outlook for commodity prices matters to Canada for a number of reasons. Primarily, higher commodity prices increase national income by improving our terms of trade. The roughly 25 per cent rise in our terms of trade since 2002 is responsible for about two-thirds of the 14 per cent gain in real per capita disposable income over the same period. Higher                                                  1  J. Lipsky, "The Global Economy and Financial Turmoil: Finding Our Footing" (speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington, D.C., 18 September 2008). BIS Review 116/2008 1 
commodity prices have other benefits, such as increased investment, portfolio gains for Canadians and our pension funds and a contribution to the appreciation of our currency, which in turn lowers the cost of imported goods and services. These benefits are felt across Canada – not just in resource-heavy sectors and regions.  Some of these effects are now being unwound owing to the recent sharp fall in some commodity prices, particularly those for energy. In our July Monetary Policy Report Update, we highlighted this possibility as a downside risk for the outlook for inflation in Canada. Slower economic growth in emerging markets, as well as in Europe and Japan, appears to be the primary factor behind declines such as the roughly one-third fall in the price of oil from its peak in the summer. Even with this decline, oil prices are back around levels of only six months ago and are still one-quarter higher than a year ago. With both supply of and demand for commodities highly inelastic in the short term, inventories remaining tight and emerging-market growth prospects more uncertain, we can expect continued volatility in commodity prices.  Let me turn now to the renewed weakness in the U.S. economy. Weakness in the U.S. economy As the effects of the U.S. government's spring fiscal stimulus package wear off, a fall in U.S. domestic demand seems likely. Household credit growth has slowed sharply and will likely slow further. Indeed, credit conditions faced by U.S. households have tightened despite the cumulative 3.25-percentage-point reduction in policy interest rates. The most recent survey of U.S. senior loan officers showed an expectation of still tighter credit conditions for business and consumers in the months ahead as banks reduce their tolerance for risk and react to the unfavourable economic outlook. Recent financial market events will reinforce these tendencies. The U.S. housing sector is central to that country's economic and financial outlooks. Housing has been contracting since the end of 2005, with steep declines in the construction of new homes, the sales of existing homes and the prices of both. There are reasons to expect that housing will continue to act as a drag on the U.S. economy for a few quarters yet. Inventories of unsold new and existing homes remain well above historical averages, both in terms of actual units and months of supply remaining, with existing-home inventories near all-time highs. At the same time, the availability of mortgages has become increasingly restricted, and mortgage costs have fallen only marginally despite the sharp reductions in policy interest rates. Most importantly, even if residential construction stops shrinking later next year, as we now expect, the usual sharp rebound in housing activity is unlikely. The overhang of inventories and tight financial conditions will restrain the housing recovery for some time. Any slowdown in the U.S. economy would have consequences for Canada, but the current situation poses particular problems. The prolonged housing slump has affected Canadian exports of lumber and building materials. In addition, the fall in U.S. motor vehicle sales – by 35 per cent at annual rates in the second quarter for vehicles assembled in North America – has adversely affected our auto sector. Even the spring fiscal stimulus package does not appear to have boosted consumption in the areas that matter most for Canada.2 We will continue to monitor closely both the composition as well as the rate of U.S. growth for its overall impact on Canada. The Bank is currently revisiting its projection for the U.S. economy as part of our preparations for our October Monetary Policy Report. In our interest rate announcement earlier this month, we identified the possibility of a negative feedback loop between a weaker U.S. economy                                                  2  Data for the second quarter show declines in areas that have a large impact on Canadian exports, including industrial production, investment in machinery and equipment and automobile sales. 2 BIS Review 116/2008 
and tighter credit markets as the main risk to a modest U.S. recovery next year. Subsequent events have further weakened the U.S. financial sector, making this risk more probable.  Global financial turmoil After 14 months of turmoil, global financial markets are at a critical juncture. Risk aversion across the system has risen to unprecedented levels, and an aggressive deleveraging process is under way. Many foreign financial institutions need to raise significantly more capital at a time when their ongoing earning power appears to have been permanently reduced. These dynamics could intensify the current global slowdown and will have an impact on the cost of capital in Canada, despite the relative strength of our financial institutions. In order to illustrate the potential magnitude of these concerns, I would like to emphasize three points. First, the deleveraging process in the global system is far from finished. There are only three ways for a financial institution to reduce leverage: raise capital, sell assets (at a price at or above their carrying values) or restrain the rate of credit growth. Over the past year, financial institutions in many countries have raised over US$350 billion of new equity, which covered only 70 per cent of announced losses. As a result, leverage has actually increased. With virtually all of these shares now trading below issue price, the ability of firms to raise capital appears very constrained. Similarly, private asset sales have been limited by the complexity of the underlying assets, the ongoing impairment of securitization markets, difficulties in supplying financing to leveraged buyers and the desire of investors to "time the market." In sum, banks have an increasing need for capital, but it has become more difficult to raise it. In this environment, the U.S. government's initiative to buy distressed assets is critically important. The plan announced by Treasury Secretary Paulson and being developed through discussions in the U.S. Congress is bold and timely. The size and breadth of support provided by this measure will help firms "rightsize" their balance sheets, re-liquefy closed markets and establish market prices for these distressed assets. This should eventually encourage private buyers to re-enter the market and complete the deleveraging process. A well-executed program will undoubtedly speed the resolution of this crisis and limit its economic cost. Asset sales alone will be insufficient, and additional capital will still be needed. Over time, acquisitions of the weak by the strong will play an important role. At the moment, valuation uncertainties, some accounting standards and investor caution are all restraining mergers and acquisitions in the sector.3 In the end, reflecting the likely scale of the shortfall, it is possible that, in countries other than Canada, public capital may be necessary to complete the deleveraging process in an orderly and timely manner.  The second point regarding the current financial situation is that while the Canadian financial system does not need to reduce leverage, we are not immune from the fallout from this process elsewhere. Canadian institutions are in considerably better shape than their international peers. Their losses on structured products have been relatively modest.4 More importantly, their absolute leverage is markedly lower. As a simple illustration, major Canadian banks have an average asset-to-capital multiple of 18. The comparable figure for U.S. investment banks is over 25, for European banks is in the 30s, and for some major                                                  3  For example, changes to purchase-accounting rules for goodwill would be welcome in the current unique environment. 4  Losses for Canadian financial institutions are roughly 10 per cent of total capital, compared with 28 per cent so far in the United States. BIS Review 116/2008 3 
global banks is over 40.5 While foreign banks are in the process of moving towards Canadian levels, our banks obviously face no such pressures. Indeed, Canadian banks could modestly increase leverage by growing their lending relative to their current capital base.  This flexibility gives our economy a rare advantage. Reflecting better domestic credit conditions, there are few signs that Canadian financial institutions are restricting the availability of credit to households. In fact, such growth has remained surprisingly robust to date. While growth in Canadian business credit has slowed in recent quarters to rates around historical norms, there is no evidence at this point that our corporations are facing unusual credit restrictions. That said, especially in light of the intensified global financial strains, we will continue to watch closely the evolution of credit availability in Canada, through analysis of monetary and credit aggregates, industry visits, and surveys. While the globalization of financial markets and services has led to a more efficient allocation of capital on a global scale, it has also made it easier for financial difficulties to spread across national borders.6 The absolute borrowing costs for U.S. and other financial institutions has risen significantly, and this has put upward pressure on borrowing costs for Canadian financial institutions.  All else being equal, this would have increased the financing costs for our businesses and households. However, all else is not equal. The stronger financial position of Canadian banks means that they now borrow at rates considerably lower than those of many of their international peers. In addition, the Bank of Canada has eased its overnight rate substantially since the onset of the crisis. As a result, the effective borrowing costs faced by banks, businesses and households are estimated to have fallen over the past year. This decline contrasts with the experience of most other developed countries.7 In its upcoming Monetary Policy Report and in light of recent events, the Bank will revisit its current assumption that borrowing spreads will begin to narrow in 2009.  My third point regarding the current financial situation is that market liquidity becomes strained during times of acute financial distress. The Bank of Canada has taken several actions over the past months to maximize the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. When necessary (such as on Monday of last week), we have reinforced our target rate through overnight operations. Over the past week, in response to exceptional circumstances, the Bank has also provided term liquidity and expanded our list of eligible collateral. The Bank will continue to provide additional term liquidity as long as conditions in financial markets warrant. We will then withdraw term liquidity as conditions normalize, as we did in the spring of this year.8  In addition, as part of an unprecedented US$180 billion coordinated action by the world's major central banks, the Bank of Canada entered into a US$10 billion reciprocal currency-swap arrangement with the U.S. Federal Reserve. This is a prudential move during a volatile                                                  5  One of the advantages of the Canadian regulatory system is that the banks' asset-to-capital multiple is generally limited to 20. 6  In the case of Canada and the United States, an IMF study found that "while trade linkages are sizeable, financial conditions – broadly defined as changes in U.S. bond yields, equity prices, and short-term interest rates – are the largest source of U.S. spillovers to Canada." See International Monetary Fund, "Canada: Selected Issues" (Country Report No. 08/70, 2008). 7  Since August 2007, absolute all-in borrowing rates are about 60 basis points higher for AA- and AAA-rated U.S. banks and about 250 basis points higher for BBB- and A-rated U.S. banks, while all-in borrowing costs for non-financial U.S. corporations are about 50 basis points higher. By comparison, effective all-in funding costs for major Canadian banks have declined by about 50 basis points, and all-in borrowing costs for non-financial firms are about 60 basis points lower. 8  A list of the types of indicators that the Bank will look at in deciding when to stop the provision of extraordinary liquidity can be found in M. Carney, "Principles for Liquid Markets" (speech to the New York Association for Business Economics, New York, New York, 22 May 2008). 4 BIS Review 116/2008 
period. The facility would be activated in the event of an acute shortage of U.S. dollars in Canada. The agreement provides the Bank with additional flexibility to address rapidly evolving developments in financial markets. Last week's coordinated action was a public demonstration of the extraordinary degree of communication and co-operation among the G-10 central banks that has taken place throughout this crisis. This is a testament to a shared recognition of the interdependence of the global financial system. I am convinced that this dialogue, and concerted action when appropriate, has led to better policy outcomes and helped contain the negative international spillovers from this series of financial shocks. I also believe that rapid implementation of the measures proposed by the Financial Stability Forum9 to enhance the resilience of the global financial system will help create a more stable international financial order. The message, as expressed in this week's communiqué of G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors, is clear: the G-7 is ready to take whatever actions may be necessary, individually and collectively, to ensure the stability of the international financial system. Conclusion The global economy is undergoing a difficult period. Moreover, in recent days, several articles of faith in the financial system have been shaken. These include: that good collateral can always be used to raise liquidity; that certain institutions are too big or too interconnected to fail; or that this was merely a liquidity crisis.  However, there is one constant on which Canadians can rely. The Bank of Canada will not deviate from its relentless focus on its monetary policy mandate to achieve low, stable and predictable inflation. Events beyond our borders have important influences on the outlook for inflation in our country. They must be considered in tandem with domestic factors, including the strength of domestic demand, the evolution of potential growth, and the health of our financial system. As we prepare to publish our Monetary Policy Report in October, we will continue to monitor carefully economic and financial developments in the Canadian and global economies, together with the evolution of risks. Most importantly, we will continue to set monetary policy consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term. This remains the best contribution that monetary policy can make to sustained growth.                                                  9  Available at http://www.fsforum.org/publications/r_0804.pdf.

Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: Celebrating 50 years of Europe Speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Project Europe 2.0, Institute of International & European Affairs, Dublin, 25 September 2008. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to be here today to celebrate Europe’s 50th anniversary.  It’s quite nice to see that in Ireland anniversaries are still a reason for celebration 18 months after the effective date, although I’m not sure – judging from some recent polls – that in this country late celebrations are particularly beneficial to Europe. On the day after their 50th birthday most people tend to fall into a depression. To avoid it, they first have a medical check-up. Then they go on a diet and take up some new sport. I know what it’s like. I did it myself in the last couple of years! One of the things I feared most, for my own future, was to be affected by so-called “cognitive dissonance”, a problem many people seem to develop as they grow older.1 You start reminiscing about the “good old days” – but in reality they weren’t so good. You tend to remember only the nice things from your past, and see it all through rose-tinted glasses. As for the rest, well, you forget or suppress it. This is where nostalgia comes in. People end up thinking that the past was much better than the present, and much more pleasant than the future will be. They’d like to return to the past, their past. They become afraid of change and turn increasingly pessimistic. It’s a terrible way to grow older! At 50, Europe might be affected by this same syndrome. It should come as no surprise, since about 36% of Europe’s population is over 50, and the proportion is rising. Europeans seem to be nostalgic about an irretrievable past and increasingly afraid of the future. They tend to see developments over the years in a way quite different from the reality. One of the victims of this syndrome is the European Union. The ultimate victims, however, might be Europeans themselves. I won’t elaborate on the theory of cognitive dissonance, but I will provide some examples of its symptoms and the potential implications for our common future. I’ll consider four symptoms. The first is amnesia; in other words, Europeans seem to have forgotten what the European Union is about (assuming they knew it in the first place). The second symptom, derived from amnesia, is lack of consistency, which induces to create a link between facts and events that occur at the same time but which in fact are unrelated. The third symptom is myopia, which gives people a distorted view of the world around them, and thus the impression that nothing changes over time. The fourth symptom is denial, in particular concerning people’s own vitality.  * * * Let me start with the first symptom: amnesia. People tend to forget what the European Union is all about. It’s not even clear they ever knew enough about it. This is a long-standing problem and has never really been tackled. The fact of the matter is that our citizens have little idea of what the EU is and how it functions. This lack of awareness can easily be exploited, and indeed has been exploited, to paint a distorted picture of the Union.                                                  1  Loosely speaking, cognitive dissonance is the uncomfortable feeling or stress caused by holding two contradictory ideas at the same time. The theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a drive to reduce this dissonance by modifying an existing belief, or rejecting one of the contradictory ideas. This can lead to confirmation bias and denial of discomforting evidence. BIS Review 116/2008 1 
The picture that people have of the EU shows the Member States and the Union almost as opposing forces, rather than the former coming together to make up the latter. When the Union takes a decision, it somehow looks as if it was a third entity – “Brussels” – who took it, rather than representatives of the Member States. In fact, the main decision-making body in the EU is the Council, which comprises representatives of the Member States, elected at the national level. The same can be said about the Parliament, directly elected by the people. And also the Commission consists of persons appointed by the governments of the Member States.  When the Union takes a decision, it is in fact the Member States which take it, through procedures established by the Union involving factors such as voting modalities and specific majority thresholds. When the Union fails to take a decision, it is ultimately the Member States which fail to do so, either because they don’t want to or because they don’t gain majority support for a proposal. The Union is often accused of excessive regulation and interference. Whose fault is it? It always seems to be the fault of Brussels’ bureaucrats, but they are not those who decide on regulations. They, at most, make formal proposals. It’s the governments and agencies of the Member States which ultimately are responsible for creating excessive regulation; they are the ones that add extra conditions to take into account national circumstances or create exemption or special regimes, which go beyond the requirements of EU directives when transposing them into national law.  The confusion is compounded when accusations of overregulation come from those who attended the Council meeting that led to a particular decision, sometimes just afterwards. Voting in favour of a measure in Brussels and then criticising that same decision once back home is a favourite sport. No surprise that European citizens are confused. The Union is also often accused of immobility, of not being able to decide. But if the Union doesn’t decide it is because the Member States don’t decide, or more often, because the Member States don’t want the Union to take decisions. I will come back to this issue later. The other misrepresentation is about the competences of the Union. They are much more limited than people generally think, but they are often at the heart of the misunderstandings and frustration that the Union creates. Let me be more concrete here, and give you some examples. I understand that one of the reasons for some people voting against the Lisbon Treaty in this country was the fear that Brussels, i.e. the other Member States, would decide on taxation in Ireland. It should have been clear that decisions on taxation cannot be taken without the unanimous consent of all the Member States. These fears, and similar ones about transfers of specific powers, were thus unjustified.  Overall, the range of the Union’s competences is quite restricted. In the economic sphere, for instance, with the exception of monetary policy, its competencies are limited to the coordination of the Member States’ policies. Again, one of the issues raised in Ireland by the opponents of the Lisbon Treaty seems to have been the EU’s inability to deal with the economic problems facing ordinary people, in particular income and employment. The motto would be: “Europe is doing nothing to help us out!”. But protecting people’s income and livelihoods is a competence of the Member States, not the Union. While it is certainly an objective of the Union to achieve high living standards and high employment, as the Treaty says, the instruments to achieve these objectives are in the hands of the Member States.  People should know more about the competences which have been transferred to the Union, like monetary policy which is conducted by the European Central Bank, and those that have remained in the hands of the Member States. The confusion, which is at times exacerbated by the Member States themselves, penalises the Union, which is perceived as being over-powerful. One example is in the energy sector. In the face of the recent increase in energy prices and the overdependence of European countries on a limited number of suppliers, numerous calls 2 BIS Review 116/2008 
have been made from all the corners of Europe in favour of a European energy policy. But nothing has happened. When it came to taking decisions, the Member States showed no desire to hand over their powers in this field. The lack of a European energy policy is nevertheless seen as a failure of the Union, rather than of the Member States. Europe is a complex construction, indeed. Its treaties, which are drafted as international legal documents rather than simple constitutional principles, are difficult to read. This is inevitable and we should not pretend that citizens can easily understand them, when even some politicians cannot. However, what is more difficult to accept is that, after 50 years, some of the basic principles of how the Union functions and what its competences are remain poorly understood by our fellow citizens. Whose task is it to explain the basic facts about Europe? Should it be the role of European’s institutions, such as the Commission? The Commission has small representative offices in each country, and most of the time they are busy trying to correct inaccuracies thrown in the national debates. The task of informing citizens about Europe can only be effectively undertaken by the Member States, which have well-established educational programmes. The results – unfortunately – speak for themselves. And this is not without consequences, also for the politicians of the Member States. If the people of Europe don’t understand the Union properly, they won’t necessarily understand their domestic political situation any better. Indeed, polls show that even when the trust in European institutions declines, it remains in most cases well above the national ones. In fact, some of the negative opinions expressed on the Union, including in electoral consultations, tend to reflect negative views about national politics. This is the worst of all worlds for the Union: being blamed for something it’s not responsible for. * * * Let me turn to the second symptom, which derives from the first one, i.e. inconsistency. Over the last ten years the world economy has undergone substantial changes. I won’t list them all, but, to be sure, there has been a massive transfer of resources between and within countries. The change in the terms of trade has led to a huge transfer of purchasing power from advanced economies to oil and commodity exporters while globalisation has brought considerable benefits to low-cost exporters of manufactured goods. Just to give an estimate, the transfer of purchasing power due to the increase in oil prices alone amounts to around 3 trillion US dollars over the last decade, about 7% of advanced economies’ GDP.2  The period between 2002 and 2007 saw the world economy grow at its fastest rate since the 1970s. However, this has masked notable differences between advanced and emerging economies. For the developing world, growth has been at its strongest since the Second World War. Advanced economies, on the other hand, have recorded a worsened performance. For the United States, in particular, the last decade has been the worst, in terms of per capita income growth, for over 100 years, with the sole exception of the 1930s. Growth in Europe has also been quite modest compared with previous decades.  A significant redistribution of income has also taken place within countries. In some advanced economies, notably the United States and the United Kingdom, the index of income inequality has risen.3 In general there has been a stagnation or even a tendency towards a reduction in purchasing power for the lower-income groups, as a result of weaker income growth and higher price increases for products such as food and energy. Income                                                  2  Based on the amount of net oil imports by advanced countries, comparing a scenario with oil prices unchanged at 1999 levels with actual data. I thank Michael Fidora for this back-of-the-envelope calculation. 3  For an extensive treatment see A. Brandolini and Smeeding (2007): “Inequality: international evidence”, prepared for the New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. BIS Review 116/2008 3 
growth disparities reflect increasing differences in human capital, access to technology and educational levels. Theory and past experience both suggest that competition from low-cost countries tends to penalise low incomes and employment advanced economies’ sectors with lower technological content.  The acceleration of technological change and the dismantling of barriers to trade have increased international competition and brought about adjustment in a much shorter time than expected. Advanced economies have thus felt severe strains in the last decade, and we can observe the political and social implications on a daily basis. The current US electoral campaign confirms that the issues are similar on both sides of the Atlantic. With one difference. In Europe, the last ten years have also been marked by the birth of the euro. And this is where the lack of consistency arises. The euro was created to bring about monetary stability in Europe. And this goal has been achieved. Inflation is low. Interest rates are low, reflecting low inflation expectations. The European Central Bank has acquired credibility by conducting a monetary policy aimed primarily at price stability. The euro has become the second international currency, trusted by investors all over the world.  The recent market turmoil should encourage us to think about what could have happened without the euro, in terms of speculative pressures within Europe, exchange rate variability and interest rate levels. We would certainly have been worse off.  Most Europeans tend to forget about the advantages they have acquired over the years, even those been gained only recently. Being a member of the European Union and the euro area isn’t considered a big deal. On the other hand, many of the problems of everyday life are blamed on Europe or the euro. The euro is sometimes considered responsible for problems that have affected our economies in the last few years, such as the increase in housing prices, higher food and petrol prices, especially at the time of the cash changeover, and relatively subdued growth. As I have just mentioned, these problems have been experienced not only in the euro area but in all advanced economies, including those that don’t have the euro. I would contend that some of the problems, such as inflation and income inequality, have been even greater outside the euro area. It is nevertheless difficult to explain to citizens that events taking place at the same time in a country are unrelated. The euro is an easy scapegoat. Attributing the fault to the euro is an easy way for individuals and governments to avoid taking responsibility.  The confusion as to who’s responsible for what in the Union and the simultaneous occurrence of the euro’s creation and other events that took place in our countries in the last decade have led many people to be inconsistent in their assessment of what the euro – and Europe more generally – has achieved in all these years.  * * * Let me turn now to the third symptom, myopia. The difficulty to fully understand the causal relationship between events affecting our societies and our own lives derives in part from a form of short-sightedness concerning the world around us. As we grow older we tend to think that the world is the same as it always was. Maybe it’s a natural reaction to growing older. But in fact the world around us is changing, in a way that affects our lives and our ability to act. Europeans in particular have a tendency to think that the world hasn’t changed much over the last 10 to 20 years. More worryingly, they tend to believe that things won’t change much in the future. In reality, change has been all around us and will accelerate further in many areas. I won’t dwell on this issue, but the bottom line is that Europe is getting smaller and smaller, while other continents and economies are growing. 20 years ago the EU represented 28% of world GDP. In 2020, if recent trends continue, the figure could be less than 18%.  4 BIS Review 116/2008 
Individual countries within Europe are also becoming smaller and less powerful. There is nothing new in this. 50 years ago, the first President of the European Parliament, Paul-Henri Spaak, noted that “Today, Europe consists solely of small countries. The only relevant distinction that remains is that some countries understand this, while others still refuse to acknowledge it”.  20 years ago France and Germany together represented close to 10% of world GDP. Today this percentage is 7.5%. By 2020, if recent trends continue, it will be reduced to 5%, less than Germany alone 20 years ago.  Other regions and countries are emerging as major players, their size comparable to that of the whole European Union. Individual European countries are bound to have each a lesser role to play on the global arena. This is already the case in trade, international finance, the environment, energy. How long will it take for European countries to realise that, in terms of power, they have become close to irrelevant? Paul-Henri Spaak’s words might lead one to think that this myopia affects only the larger countries of Europe. This might be true. But smaller countries can suffer from another type of short-sightedness. Smaller countries are used to having a more limited role on the international scene. They tend to leave major decisions to the larger countries, acting more as critical observers. They can afford to do so. Indeed, the post-Second World War world has developed in an environment largely dominated by the United States, with the cooperation of European countries. The US influence shaped relations in the field of international finance, world trade and macroeconomic policy. The rules and policies pushed forward by the United States, and its leadership in implementing them, were broadly accepted by Europeans. Even in the military field, the confrontation with the East took place under the protection of the US umbrella, even for countries that declared themselves neutral. In the coming years it will become more difficult for a single country alone, even the United States, to set standards and lead policies for the rest of the world. The emergence of other regions and countries with larger populations and soon similar income to that of the United States will challenge its leadership. International relations will have to be based increasingly on cooperation between equals rather than the leadership of one country, as they have been for the last 60 years. China, India and possibly also Brazil and Russia will play a greater role in global decisions.  The key question in this scenario is: what will Europe, and European countries individually, do? They can ignore these developments and continue to act as followers of a leadership which will have become more varied, accepting the balance of interests that will have been agreed between the United States and the other systemically important countries. They can continue to free-ride, but the outcome might be quite different and not quite as pleasant as it has been up to now. Alternatively, they can organise themselves and form a major player in the international community, possibly in partnership with the United States. All European countries, not only the largest ones, will have to make this choice. To make Europe a key player will require the will of all its members. My impression is that European citizens would be less frightened of the challenges of globalisation if they felt they could participate in its governance. The problem is that globalisation can’t be controlled at the level of national governments, at least in Europe. Europeans can participate in the governance of globalisation only if they stand united.  Let me give you an example. The current financial market turmoil will have to lead to new financial regulation and supervision. In an increasingly integrated financial market, the new regulation and supervision will have to be the result of coordinated action on the part of major economies. This will involve accounting rules, prudential regimes, the treatment of offshore centres and hedge funds, etc. The new rules will have to be discussed and agreed across the Atlantic. The experience of the past few months suggests that the European contribution BIS Review 116/2008 5 
can be particularly useful in designing a more stable and prudent financial system. To promote its views Europe has to organise itself to speak with one voice at the negotiating table. If Europeans are divided, unable to take decisions, they will have to accept what’s decided elsewhere.  Ultimately, speaking with one voice and taking decisions means deciding by (qualified) majority. It means that each member accepts being put in a minority by the others, as in a democracy. It means, ultimately, increased political integration in Europe. In other words, either European countries move towards increased political integration or they become irrelevant on major issues that are of relevance on the international scene. It may sound a bit blunt, but at least it’s spelt clearly! One objection to the choice of greater political integration is that some fundamental competences are inherent to nation states and cannot be given up without impairing the political integrity of those states.  * * * This brings me to the fourth, and for now final, symptom which seems to be affecting some Europeans, i.e. denial. As people grow older, the performance of certain functions – especially the more pleasant ones, which in some cases reflect power and potency – tends to be impaired. Science may to some extent help us to delay the slow but inevitable decay. On the other hand, it can also lead us into a dangerous state of denial.  The same seems to apply to political power. As Europe and European countries grow older, and also smaller, they continue to deny the fact that their effective power is shrinking, if not disappearing. For instance, many fora in which several European countries participate have lost relevance. And one of the reasons for this is that Europeans are over-represented in these fora, which reduces their legitimacy. Let me give you the example of the International Monetary Fund where EU countries are represented in ten different constituencies, out of 24. The euro area countries are spread over eight constituencies. Some are even in constituencies in which all other countries are non-European; Ireland, for example, is in the same constituency as Canada and Caribbean countries.  Given the way Europeans are organised, it’s no wonder the IMF is largely influenced by the United States and that Europeans tend to punch much below their weight. Furthermore, major decisions concerning the IMF are increasingly taken in other fora, typically the G7 or the G20, where only the four largest European countries are represented. The EU is also a member of the G20, but given the rotating EU presidency, it isn’t able to have a substantial impact on the discussion. The most logical thing to do would be to pool European representation in the IMF and thereby obtain a power of veto like that of the United States so as to play a greater role. This would of course require some organisation within Europe to define a common policy, as is done for trade issues for instance. As the IMF has become an institution focused primarily on surveillance of the world economy, I see no reason for European countries, especially those with a common currency, to have differing positions on the major issues discussed at the IMF. For example, I see no reason for a country such as Ireland to have positions more similar to those of Canada and the Caribbean countries than to those of other members of the EU.  If Europe had a single seat at the table, the national representatives that currently have a seat would have to leave it. And they seem to be very attached to their seats, because they believe – or want to believe – that from this position they have been able to substantially influence decisions. They often don’t understand – or don’t want to understand – that as long as they are seated at the table, while others who matter more are not, that table is not really worth sitting at. The main decisions will be taken elsewhere. 6 BIS Review 116/2008 
Again, to give an example, the recent reform of the voting shares of the IMF, which by the way reduced the overall voting power of Europe, wasn’t really decided in the IMF Executive Board itself but agreed in other fora, most notably the G7 and the G20.  Those who would have to leave their seat at the table are obviously in a state of denial, advancing quite absurd arguments. The oddest of all arguments against a single European seat is that it would create a polarisation in the governance of the Fund, with two major shareholders – the US and Europe – which would undermine its functioning. As if a unipolar governance, with only one major shareholder (the United States), is better from the perspective of any European country.  * * * I have talked enough today about symptoms and syndromes. Let me conclude. Like anyone over 50, Europe needs to make sure it doesn’t become a hypochondriac. As I mentioned at the start of my speech, Europe might need to go on a diet. And maybe get a new look.  The diet consists in streamlining activities. The EU seems much fatter than it really is. European institutions should stop continuously looking for new roles. The celebration of the 10th anniversary of the euro ended with a series of recommendations, in particular from the Commission and the European Parliament, for new roles, but with no resources and no powers. This gives the impression that the EU will have new competences, which is not true. The Union should instead clarify its role and show how slim it is. It should actually refuse to take on new tasks that Member States want to give it unless it explicitly receives the powers to conduct these tasks.  At 50, Europe also needs a new look. Any book or film about Europe starts with a sequence of black and white pictures of the founding fathers. Most Europeans – unfortunately – don’t even recognize the faces of Schuman, Monnet, De Gasperi or Adenauer. This shouldn’t be surprising. They’d probably also fail to recognise the national politicians of those days. History books are certainly useful, but pictures can be more effective than a thousand words. If I had to choose one picture to explain to current and future generations what Europe is about, I would take that of François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl joining hands in Verdun, in September 1984. Some younger people might not recognise the two faces, but their act is unequivocal. Joining hands in front of a coffin explains everything about Europe, where we come from.  But that’s clearly not enough. The people of Europe need a better understanding of what the European Union is about, what it has given them and where it is going. The Union should be seen not just as a grouping of states but as something helping the member states, and their citizens, to address the challenges of our times. The Union is not somewhere else – in Brussels or Strasbourg – it’s in every European town or village, whose prosperity depends on being part of a united Europe.  The future of Europe depends on each of its 500 million citizens. But, more importantly, the future of the 500 million citizens depends on the future of the Union. The best way to celebrate this 50th anniversary is to make sure that the best years are still to come.  Looking back on what has been done should strengthen our will and our confidence about what we can achieve in the future, together.  Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 116/2008 7 
Ben S Bernanke: Economic outlook Testimony of Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Joint Economic Committee, US Congress, Washington DC, 24 September 2008. *      *      * Chairman Schumer, Vice Chair Maloney, Representative Saxton, and other members of the committee, I appreciate this opportunity to discuss recent developments in financial markets and to present an update on the economic situation. As you know, the U.S. economy continues to confront substantial challenges, including a weakening labor market and elevated inflation. Notably, stresses in financial markets have been high and have recently intensified significantly. If financial conditions fail to improve for a protracted period, the implications for the broader economy could be quite adverse.  The downturn in the housing market has been a key factor underlying both the strained condition of financial markets and the slowdown of the broader economy. In the financial sphere, falling home prices and rising mortgage delinquencies have led to major losses at many financial institutions, losses only partially replaced by the raising of new capital. Investor concerns about financial institutions increased over the summer, as mortgage-related assets deteriorated further and economic activity weakened. Among the firms under the greatest pressure were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and, more recently, American International Group (AIG). As investors lost confidence in them, these companies saw their access to liquidity and capital markets increasingly impaired and their stock prices drop sharply.  The Federal Reserve believes that, whenever possible, such difficulties should be addressed through private-sector arrangements – for example, by raising new equity capital, by negotiations leading to a merger or acquisition, or by an orderly wind-down. Government assistance should be given with the greatest of reluctance and only when the stability of the financial system, and, consequently, the health of the broader economy, is at risk. In the cases of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, however, capital raises of sufficient size appeared infeasible and the size and government-sponsored status of the two companies precluded a merger with or acquisition by another company. To avoid unacceptably large dislocations in the financial sector, the housing market, and the economy as a whole, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, and the Treasury used its authority, granted by the Congress in July, to make available financial support to the two firms. The Federal Reserve, with which FHFA consulted on the conservatorship decision as specified in the July legislation, supported these steps as necessary and appropriate. We have seen benefits of this action in the form of lower mortgage rates, which should help the housing market. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury attempted to identify private-sector solutions for AIG and Lehman Brothers, but none was forthcoming. In the case of AIG, the Federal Reserve, with the support of the Treasury, provided an emergency credit line to facilitate an orderly resolution. The Federal Reserve took this action because it judged that, in light of the prevailing market conditions and the size and composition of AIG's obligations, a disorderly failure of AIG would have severely threatened global financial stability and, consequently, the performance of the U.S. economy. To mitigate concerns that this action would exacerbate moral hazard and encourage inappropriate risk-taking in the future, the Federal Reserve ensured that the terms of the credit extended to AIG imposed significant costs and constraints on the firm's owners, managers, and creditors. The chief executive officer has been replaced. The collateral for the loan is the company itself, together with its BIS Review 115/2008 1 
subsidiaries.1 (Insurance policyholders and holders of AIG investment products are, however, fully protected.) Interest will accrue on the outstanding balance of the loan at a rate of three-month Libor plus 850 basis points, implying a current interest rate over 11 percent. In addition, the U.S. government will receive equity participation rights corresponding to a 79.9 percent equity interest in AIG and has the right to veto the payment of dividends to common and preferred shareholders, among other things.  In the case of Lehman Brothers, a major investment bank, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury declined to commit public funds to support the institution. The failure of Lehman posed risks. But the troubles at Lehman had been well known for some time, and investors clearly recognized – as evidenced, for example, by the high cost of insuring Lehman's debt in the market for credit default swaps – that the failure of the firm was a significant possibility. Thus, we judged that investors and counterparties had had time to take precautionary measures. While perhaps manageable in itself, Lehman's default was combined with the unexpectedly rapid collapse of AIG, which together contributed to the development last week of extraordinarily turbulent conditions in global financial markets. These conditions caused equity prices to fall sharply, the cost of short-term credit – where available – to spike upward, and liquidity to dry up in many markets. Losses at a large money market mutual fund sparked extensive withdrawals from a number of such funds. A marked increase in the demand for safe assets – a flight to quality – sent the yield on Treasury bills down to a few hundredths of a percent. By further reducing asset values and potentially restricting the flow of credit to households and businesses, these developments pose a direct threat to economic growth. The Federal Reserve took a number of actions to increase liquidity and stabilize markets. Notably, to address dollar funding pressures worldwide, we announced a significant expansion of reciprocal currency arrangements with foreign central banks, including an approximate doubling of the existing swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank and the authorization of new swap facilities with the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada, among others. We will continue to work closely with colleagues at other central banks to address ongoing liquidity pressures. The Federal Reserve also announced initiatives to assist money market mutual funds facing heavy redemptions and to increase liquidity in short-term credit markets.  Despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and other agencies, global financial markets remain under extraordinary stress. Action by the Congress is urgently required to stabilize the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and for our economy. In this regard, the Federal Reserve supports the Treasury's proposal to buy illiquid assets from financial institutions. Purchasing impaired assets will create liquidity and promote price discovery in the markets for these assets, while reducing investor uncertainty about the current value and prospects of financial institutions. More generally, removing these assets from institutions’ balance sheets will help to restore confidence in our financial markets and enable banks and other institutions to raise capital and to expand credit to support economic growth.  I will now turn to a brief update on the economic situation. Ongoing developments in financial markets are directly affecting the broader economy through several channels, most notably by restricting the availability of credit. Mortgage credit terms have tightened significantly and fees have risen, especially for potential borrowers who lack substantial down payments or who have blemished credit histories. Mortgages that are ineligible for credit guarantees by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac – for                                                  1  Specifically, the loan is collateralized by all of the assets of the company and its primary non-regulated subsidiaries. These assets include the equity of substantially all of AIG's regulated subsidiaries. 2 BIS Review 115/2008 
example, nonconforming jumbo mortgages – cannot be securitized and thus carry much higher interest rates than conforming mortgages. Some lenders have reduced borrowing limits on home equity lines of credit. Households also appear to be having more difficulty of late in obtaining nonmortgage credit. For example, the Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported that as of July an increasing proportion of banks had tightened standards for credit card and other consumer loans. In the business sector, through August, the financially strongest firms remained able to issue bonds but bond issuance by speculative-grade firms remained very light. More recently, however, deteriorating financial market conditions have disrupted the commercial paper market and other forms of financing for a wide range of firms, including investment-grade firms. Financing for commercial real estate projects has also tightened very significantly.  When worried lenders tighten credit, then spending, production, and job creation slow. Real economic activity in the second quarter appears to have been surprisingly resilient, but, more recently, economic activity appears to have decelerated broadly. In the labor market, private payrolls shed another 100,000 jobs in August, bringing the cumulative drop since November to 770,000. New claims for unemployment insurance are at elevated levels and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in August. Households' real disposable income was boosted significantly in the spring by the tax rebate payments, but, excluding those payments, real after-tax income has fallen this year, which partly reflects increases in the prices of energy and food.  In recent months, the weakness in real income together with the restraining effects of reduced credit flows and declining financial and housing wealth have begun to show through more clearly to consumer spending. Real personal consumption expenditures for goods and services declined in June and July, and the retail sales report for August suggests that outlays for consumer goods fell noticeably further last month. Although the retrenchment in household spending has been widespread, purchases of motor vehicles have dropped off particularly sharply. On a more positive note, oil and gasoline prices – while still at high levels, in part reflecting the effects of Hurricane Ike – have come down substantially from the peaks they reached earlier this summer, contributing to a recent improvement in consumer confidence. However, the weakness in the fundamentals underlying consumer spending suggest that household expenditures will be sluggish, at best, in the near term.  The recent indicators of the demand for new and existing homes hint at some stabilization of sales, and lower mortgage rates are likely to provide some support for demand in coming months. Moreover, although expectations that house prices will continue to fall have probably dissuaded some potential buyers from entering the market, lower house prices and mortgage interest rates are making housing increasingly affordable over time. Still, homebuilders retain large backlogs of unsold homes, which should continue to restrain the pace of new home construction. Indeed, single-family housing starts and new permit issuance dropped further in August. At the same time, the continuing decline in house prices reduces homeowners' equity and puts continuing pressure on the balance sheets of financial institutions, as I have already noted. As of midyear, business investment was holding up reasonably well, with investment in nonresidential structures particularly robust. However, a range of factors, including weakening fundamentals and constraints on credit, are likely to result in a considerable slowdown in the construction of commercial and office buildings in coming quarters. Business outlays for equipment and software also appear poised to slow in the second half of this year, assuming that production and sales slow as anticipated. International trade provided considerable support for the U.S. economy over the first half of the year. Economic activity has been buoyed by strong foreign demand for a wide range of U.S. exports, including agricultural products, capital goods, and industrial supplies, even as imports declined. However, in recent months, the outlook for foreign economic activity has deteriorated amid unsettled conditions in financial markets, troubled housing sectors, and BIS Review 115/2008 3 
softening sentiment. As a consequence, in coming quarters, the contribution of net exports to U.S. production is not likely to be as sizable as it was in the first half of the year.  All told, real gross domestic product is likely to expand at a pace appreciably below its potential rate in the second half of this year and then to gradually pick up as financial markets return to more-normal functioning and the housing contraction runs its course. Given the extraordinary circumstances, greater-than-normal uncertainty surrounds any forecast of the pace of activity. In particular, the intensification of financial stress in recent weeks, which will make lenders still more cautious about extending credit to households and business, could prove a significant further drag on growth. The downside risks to the outlook thus remain a significant concern.  Inflation rose sharply over the period from May to July, reflecting rapid increases in energy and food prices. During the same period, price inflation for goods and services other than food and energy also moved up from the low rates seen in the spring, as the higher costs of energy, other commodities, and imported goods were partially passed through to consumers. Recently, however, the news on inflation has been more favorable. The prices of oil and other commodities, while remaining quite volatile, have fallen, on net, from their recent peaks, and the dollar is up from its mid-summer lows. The declines in energy prices have also led to some easing of inflation expectations, as measured, for example, by consumer surveys and the pricing of inflation-indexed Treasury securities. If not reversed, these developments, together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time, should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year. Nevertheless, the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. Indeed, the fluctuations in oil prices in the past few days illustrate the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices. Consequently, the upside risks to inflation remain a significant concern as well. Over time, a number of factors should promote the return of our economy to higher levels of employment and sustainable growth with price stability, including the stimulus being provided by monetary policy, lower oil and commodity prices, increasing stability in the mortgage and housing markets, and the natural recuperative powers of our economy. However, stabilization of our financial system is an essential precondition for economic recovery. I urge the Congress to act quickly to address the grave threats to financial stability that we currently face. For its part, the Federal Open Market Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. 4 BIS Review 115/2008 
Stefan Ingves: Financial turbulence, monetary policy and inflation Speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, to SACO, the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations, Stockholm, 24 September 2008. *      *      * When storms are raging in the world around you and the course is affected, it is important to keep focus on where you are heading. Take in as much information as possible and steer back towards the target in the way that provides the best journey home. In a way, this is how the Riksbank tries to conduct its monetary policy. The inflation target is to provide economic stability, in particular when there is turbulence in the world around us. The original idea was that I would come here today to talk about monetary policy. And I will do so. But the international turmoil, particularly in the financial markets, has escalated in recent weeks. I would therefore like to begin first by saying a few words about this, and about the measures taken by the Riksbank and others to counteract the effects of the financial crisis in the United States.  The financial turbulence One can say that the Riksbank is active in two main areas. One is monetary policy. The other is what is usually known as financial stability – promoting a safe and efficient payment system, as it is written in the Sveriges Riksbank Act. To simplify, this means ensuring that payments in the Swedish economy can be made securely and efficiently. For instance, the Riksbank monitors and analyses the financial system, identifies potential risks and influences participants that are important to financial stability. We shall work to prevent financial crises from arising, but if they should nevertheless arise, it is our task to manage the situation. What does this mean? For instance, we must be prepared to act in situations where our assessment is that financial stability is threatened. Let us assume, for example, that a Swedish bank which is under the supervision of Finansinspektionen, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, is solvent and has assets that are greater than its liabilities, but experiences serious problems with its liquidity and thereby difficulty in meeting its payments. If the Riksbank’s assessment in such a situation is that the stability of the financial system is at stake if the bank collapses, then we can intervene with measures to aid liquidity.  The United States is currently in the midst of a financial crisis, the backwash of which is sweeping through the global financial system. Although financial turbulence has been included in our analyses ever since last summer, the way it has manifested itself and the intensity of the events has varied along the way. And in recent weeks the problems have escalated. The most recent wave of financial turbulence is the worst so far since the original US mortgage crisis broke out.  So what has happened recently? For one thing, large agents in the US financial market have suffered acute problems. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has taken measures to safeguard financial stability. The unease we see in the markets is on a global level and affects us all, but the financial crisis is mainly centred on the United States.  We are not isolated The Swedish financial system has functioned well and the banks have been able to finance themselves both in Sweden and in the international capital markets. The overnight rate, the shortest interest rate in the economy, has remained stable around the repo rate. In this way the Riksbank’s system for steering the interest rate works well. But as I said, up here in Scandinavia we are not isolated from what is happening in the world around us. Swedish BIS Review 115/2008 1 
banks are now affected more tangibly than before by the global financial turbulence even though they only have small exposures to the US mortgage market, which is the centre of the crisis. Interest rates have now risen substantially here, too, for instance on the interbank market. This is the market where the banks borrow money from one another to cover their short-term liquidity needs. Let me stress, however, that higher interest rates are not the same thing as the Swedish banks experiencing problems, although it is becoming more expensive for them to borrow money. The Swedish banks have had a good development in profits in recent years and they are financially strong. They have a good starting position to meet higher costs.  Measures to ensure the markets function efficiently But the markets have not functioned as efficiently as usual. For instance, interest rates in the interbank market have risen as a result of the increased uncertainty. There has also been a surge in the demand for treasury bills. The Swedish National Debt Office and the Riksbank have maintained a regular dialogue regarding the money and bond markets and the need to counteract the effects of the US financial crisis. Last week the Debt Office decided in consultation with the Riksbank to issue treasury bills at a number of additional auctions to meet the large increase in demand. The funds from the auctions will be invested in what is known as covered mortgage bonds. This improves the way the market functions right now. To ensure that the financial system functions as well as possible, the Riksbank has also implemented some other measures for preventive purposes. On Monday we decided, to put it simply, to increase the access to credit for participants in the RIX payment system. One can say that we are oiling the wheels of the system by making it easier for participants to make their payments to one another during the course of the day. They can now to a greater extent use their own covered bonds, or those issued by an institution with close links, as collateral in the system. A covered bond has collateral in the form of, for instance, a mortgage, which is provided by the credit institution that has issued the bond. This means that the credit granter is more protected than in the case of ordinary bonds. Covered bonds are therefore good collateral and many other central banks accept these bonds on a larger scale than the Riksbank. In our case the permitted share was raised from 25 per cent to 75 per cent. This measure means, put in very simple terms, that participants in the RIX system can use more collateral to borrow against if necessary.  Another measure is that, for instance, the Riksbank and the central banks of Denmark and Norway, together with the US Federal Reserve, have reached an agreement for the purpose of increasing access to dollars in the Scandinavian financial markets, if necessary. For the Riksbank this involves the possibility to obtain access to US dollars in addition to the foreign currency reserve. This is what is known as a swap facility and amounts to a total sum corresponding to USD 10 billion. Our assessment is that it will probably not be necessary to use the money. It is nevertheless important to demonstrate that we are prepared to act if it should prove necessary. The agreement can be quickly put into operation if it should actually become necessary.  Financial stability is satisfactory What is happening now has not come as a bolt from the blue. And it is not a question of the central banks sitting with their arms folded ignoring the risks taken by the commercial banks. In Sweden, the Riksbank has regularly highlighted many of the risks in the financial system. We did so most recently in our Financial Stability Report. There we pointed out, for instance, that the financial turbulence might worsen and that the banks' access to funding could deteriorate. At the same time, we have all along made the assessment that financial stability in Sweden has been satisfactory. We make the same assessment now, and the Swedish banks are financially strong. 2 BIS Review 115/2008 
As we have seen, a lot has happened on the financial markets recently. We are following developments closely, constantly updating our analyses and we are prepared to take action if necessary. We have regular contacts with banks, market participants and other government agencies, as well as our central bank colleagues in other countries. There is a generally high level of uncertainty in the world economy at present and this will probably persist for a good while to come. I would therefore like to return now to what I mentioned at the beginning – the inflation target and the stability it offers to the economy, particularly when storms are raging all around us. Monetary policy – focus on the inflation target The objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability and this has been established by law since 1999. To be more precise, inflation measured in terms of the consumer price index, CPI, is to be held at 2 per cent, with a tolerance interval of +/- 1 percentage point. This is how the Riksbank formulated the inflation target when it was announced in 1993. One can say that the task of ensuring that prices remain stable has been delegated by the Swedish people through the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) to the Riksbank. And this is actually not merely an objective, it is also a means. By keeping inflation low and stable, monetary policy is to help to create the best possible conditions for good and sustainable economic growth. Delegating monetary policy to the central bank in the way the Riksdag has done in Sweden also reduces the risk of political pressures, short-sighted actions and rapid changes in monetary policy. Our focus – what governs our interest rate decisions – is on attaining the inflation target within a couple of years in a way that provides the most balanced development of the economy possible. This was also the case at our most recent monetary policy meeting in September, when the repo rate was raised to 4.75 per cent. It was a difficult situation in which to make a decision, with high inflation both in Sweden and abroad at the outset and a very uncertain world economy. Although we Executive Board members agreed on many things, our assessments differed with regard to the interest rate path needed to bring inflation back on target at a suitable pace.  Although the differences in our assessments were actually fairly modest, it is extremely important to be clear about both the common and individual motives behind the stances taken at the meeting. I am therefore now looking forward to first talking about what has recently affected interest rate policy on a more fundamental level and then about the factors behind the decision taken in September.  High inflation and rising interest rates The Riksbank is to ensure that we keep inflation in Sweden at a low and stable rate. We have indeed experienced a long period with a fairly low rate of price increase, approximately 1.6 per cent on average since the inflation target was announced. However, over the past year inflation has been higher. In August the rate of increase in consumer prices was 4.3 per cent. This is the highest inflation rate in almost 15 years. Given this, it is perhaps not surprising that expected inflation has also risen in the short term. But expectations of inflation several years ahead are now also clearly above the Riksbank's target of 2 per cent. It is therefore not surprising that many people are concerned. As inflation has risen, the Riksbank has raised its interest on loans to the banks, the repo rate. This is now 4.75 per cent. The banks’ lending rates to companies and households are higher and have also risen. They have risen more than the Riksbank’s rate increases. This is in turn linked to the uncertainty in the financial markets, which has increased the banks’ borrowing costs around the world. At the same time, the economic activity in the world in general has weakened, which leads to a decline in exports for Swedish companies. We have BIS Review 115/2008 3 
experienced many years of extremely good economic growth and low inflation. Now we must be prepared for high inflation, higher interest rates and lower employment possibly leading to a deterioration of the finances of many Swedish households over a couple of years. Monetary policy often comes into focus in this type of situation.  The recent debate – is the Riksbank chasing inflation spectres? The Riksbank’s interest rate increases have been much discussed recently. It has been said that the Bank is chasing a non-existent inflation spectre, that the inflation target should be scrapped or reformulated, and that the Riksbank should take more notice of economic activity than inflation. To begin with, inflation is a real problem for many households. Inflation means that everyone gets less for their money. Oil, electricity and food prices have risen substantially. These goods are an important part of household consumption. Together food and energy comprise approximately one quarter of the CPI. The fact that, for instance, oil and food prices have risen so much here in Sweden is largely because these goods have become more expensive in the world market. Should the inflation target be reformulated? Some of the recent criticism has concerned whether the inflation target should apply to some other measure than the CPI. The idea is that monetary policy should stabilise around a measure of inflation that excludes import prices. The Riksbank is in any case unable to affect prices in the world market. However, this is not a convincing argument. Swedish conditions also affect the prices of the goods we import. The world market price of a product is not the price that Swedish households see in the shops. The value of the krona in relation to other currencies for example plays a part. Demand and factors such as transport, mark-ups in the wholesale and retail channels are also significant.  What the Riksbank can do is to conduct well-balanced monetary policy so that consumer prices on average rise by 2 per cent a year. When the Riksbank raises the repo rate, demand is dampened, which reduces the scope for price increases in all areas, including energy and food. It is important that monetary policy is aimed at keeping down the general price increases and that the inflation target is not redefined merely because some prices are rising more than others. Households’ total purchasing power is affected when prices of imported goods change, and this would be the case even if we had an inflation target that excluded these prices. When, for instance, the price of oil rises over a longer period of time there is a risk that price increases will spread to other areas of the economy. This risk would hardly decline if the inflation target was formulated differently.  Of course one must be open to change that could improve the current monetary policy regime. But it is important to think things over very carefully. And we shouldn't fix something that isn't broken. If we look back over the period with the current inflation target, it is difficult to describe it as anything other than successful. The inflation target for monetary policy has without a doubt contributed to providing a stability in economic policy that was lacking in the Swedish economy during the 1970s and 1980s.  Temporary effects – with the right monetary policy What the Riksbank needs to keep in check is the general price increases. Monetary policy neither can nor should try to counteract the fact that prices of some goods increase more than others. So, if it is mainly a few products that have led to consumer prices increasing so much, why is the Riksbank tightening monetary policy? The argument put forward by some critics is that the increases in oil and food prices only affect inflation temporarily. The 4 BIS Review 115/2008 
Riksbank should not do anything about this. Such a view assumes that the increases in oil and food prices will not spread to other prices, to demands for wage compensation and to even higher inflation. But this is not something one can automatically assume. There are many examples over the years. Those of you who were around during the oil crisis of the 1970s will perhaps remember how the substantial rise in oil prices had an impact on the rest of the economy. The inflation rate reached two figures. Wise from this experience, I believe we should handle things differently now. It is our task to ensure that the temporary effects remain temporary and do not become entrenched. Do we only focus on inflation?  Another question that has arisen in the recent debate is to what extent the Riksbank should take production and employment into consideration. Let me first say that when it comes to the relation between low and stable inflation and good growth, one does not exclude the other. The actual purpose of the inflation target is to provide the conditions for good economic growth that is sustainable in the long term. Furthermore, the Riksbank shall also give some consideration to developments in production and employment in the individual interest rate decisions, as long as it appears possible to attain the inflation target. Monetary policy is flexible. We are no “inflation nutters” as my British colleague Mervyn King has put it. The Riksbank cannot stabilise inflation at 2 per cent all of the time. Sudden increases in oil, food, clothing or any other kind of prices can push up inflation. Our interest rate policy is then designed so that inflation can be expected to be back on target within a couple of years, not next week. The fact that it may take some time before inflation is back at 2 per cent provides some scope to take into account production and employment. The Riksbank thus has some scope to give consideration to developments in economic activity. This is something we actually do. Over the past year, for instance, the interest rate has not been raised dramatically, but at a more gradual pace, despite a rapid increase in inflation. The Riksbank’s assessment is that a cautious increase in the interest rate is sufficient to bring inflation back around the target of 2 per cent a couple of years ahead. However, the Riksbank’s task is to maintain price stability. This sets a limit as to how restrictive one can be with the interest rate weapon. Without the interest rate increase inflation could have soared similar to the way it did in the 1970s and 1980s. At that time the economic policy did not prevent inflation from becoming entrenched. The inflation target has been set to create conditions for good growth that is sustainable in the long term. An expansionary monetary policy which perhaps contributes to more favourable developments in economic activity in the short term can provide major problems for production and employment in the long term.  The most recent decision  When the most recent interest rate decision was made, we six members of the Executive Board held differing opinions. I and two of my colleagues voted to raise the interest rate to 4.75 per cent. There have not been many cases where the voting is a “draw” and the casting vote determines the decision; this has happened only four times since the Executive Board was formed almost ten years ago. The result is not particularly strange or surprising given the situation when the decision was made. We are six different individuals on the Executive Board. We have different backgrounds and different perspectives. Sometimes this leads to our assessments differing, even if we work towards the same objective. It applies in particular to very uncertain situations like the present one. But the whole idea of having an Executive Board is that disagreement is permitted. Different approaches and opinions enrich the discussions and hopefully lead to better decisions.  BIS Review 115/2008 5 
My own assessment So how did I reason at the most recent meeting, when I voted for another increase of a quarter percentage point? Well, to begin with it is important to put an individual decision in the right perspective. Monetary policy acts with a time lag and what affects inflation a couple of years ahead is a series of interest rate decisions rather than an individual interest rate increase, or cut, for that matter. My decision in September was therefore closely connected to both the interest rate policy we have conducted over the past few years and the interest rate path I expected to see in the future.  A new phase We have experienced a long period of low inflation and high growth from a global perspective, but we have now entered a new phase. In developed economies like the United States and the euro area growth is falling, while it remains high in emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil. The effects of the high demand for certain commodities from rapidly-growing economies are something that central banks around the world must manage in the future. Another example is the imbalances in the global economy. Access to credit was too high for a long time in many countries and contributed to an unsustainable development. The imbalances that were built up are being corrected, but it is still uncertain how long the adjustment will take. What we see now is a world less stable than we have been seeing in recent years. Sweden is a small open economy and the Riksbank conducts an independent monetary policy. We have an inflation target which we endeavour to attain. An inflation target becomes an even more important anchor for monetary policy in a situation like the present one. If financial imbalances and large fluctuations in commodity prices create global shocks over a long period of time, the inflation target can in itself have a calming effect on our own economy. It therefore feels particularly important to maintain our focus on the inflation target right now. The interest rate decision In connection with the Executive Board’s monetary policy meeting on 3 September, we saw signs that inflation is falling in various parts of the world. But this fall in inflation is from a very high level and as yet no clear decline is visible in the statistics. Swedish inflation is still at its highest level since the mid-1990s. At the same time, growth has been weaker than anticipated. Productivity has also been weak and this has led to rising production costs. The weak productivity appears to be persisting and leads to continued high cost pressures. Resource utilisation measured in terms of the number of hours worked is still slightly higher than normal. However, we expect it to decline.  Expectations of inflation have been high, both in the short and long term. At the time of the September meeting they were still above the inflation target. Expectations are an indication of confidence in monetary policy. Both interest rate increases and falling energy and food prices may have contributed to the slight fall. But it is important to remember that inflation expectations are still too high. There is considerable uncertainty regarding commodity prices and global developments and as I see it we cannot sound the all clear yet.  To meet the inflation target it is important to conduct a monetary policy that contributes to long-term inflation expectations being close to 2 per cent. My assessment was that a further increase was required to achieve this. When I looked ahead I considered that both inflation and inflation expectations must be closer to the target before expansionary monetary policy can be reconciled with bringing inflation back to 2 per cent within a couple of years. Weaker economic activity is no guarantee that inflation will “automatically” fall. This is connected to, for instance, the risk of contagion effects and the fact that inflation can become entrenched, 6 BIS Review 115/2008 
as I mentioned earlier. Both in Sweden and abroad there are many examples of inflation remaining high when growth slows down or falls. Compared with the assessment we made in July, we made a downward adjustment in our forecast for the future repo rate. New statistics indicated that both global and Swedish economic activity had weakened sooner than expected and we therefore revised down our forecasts for growth. Given this, I considered that we have now completed our interest rate increases. I expected that the next stage will be a cut and that monetary policy will ease slightly during 2009.  I think it is difficult to claim that the interest rate path we presented in September is too strict. The interest rates are not particularly high, either from an historical perspective or in comparison with many other countries with a floating exchange rate. Resource utilisation, the good public sector finances and the surplus on the current account provide us with a good starting point. The Swedish economy has the necessary requirements to meet both a limited downturn in economic activity and growth around the long-term average towards the end of our forecast horizon, at the same time as attaining the inflation target. In addition, the current interest rate provides some support for the exchange rate. This has some value with regard to meeting the inflation target. A few final words Let me just very briefly summarise what I have talked about today. The Riksbank strives constantly both to attain the inflation target and to manage its task of safeguarding financial stability in the best possible way. If we succeed, we provide stability in the Swedish economy, particularly in times when there is international turmoil. We will probably have to live with the financial market turbulence and the crisis in the United States for a good while to come. It is too early yet to be able to foresee when this will all be over. However, what we can say is that it will take time. The next occasion when we will be weighing together all of the new information received and assessing how these developments affect the prospects for growth and inflation is at our next monetary policy meeting at the end of October. Until then we will of course continue to follow developments very closely and to have regular contacts with banks, market participants and other government agencies. We are constantly trying to include all important information in our analyses. This is the way we always work, and it applies to both financial stability and monetary policy. Let me conclude with what must be the most important thing for Sweden right now – the observation that financial stability here at home is satisfactory and that Sweden is well-equipped to meet the global economic downturn on this occasion.

Hermann Remsperger: Fundamental issues of stabilising the financial system Keynote speech by Professor Dr Hermann Remsperger, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the conference on “Determinants and implications of the financial crisis” of the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management – Bankakademie, HfB, Frankfurt am Main, 17 September 2008. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen What I was afraid of has occurred. There is hardly anything more difficult than speaking after Michael Heise. Actually, he has already said all there is to say. But since I cannot simply stay silent, I would like to discuss with you some fundamental issues of stabilising the financial system. And I hope that my thoughts will perhaps have some small value added, even though I quite deliberately do not wish to go into the very recent events. My topic will therefore not be crisis management but the long-term prevention of crises. I would certainly be missing the point of the topic I am dealing with if I were now to list the whole wealth of existing proposals on stabilising the financial system. There isn’t enough time for that anyway. Therefore, instead of going into details, I shall try to highlight the fundamental issues that underlie many of the recommendations for action.  I have chosen to take this approach not least because I am also constantly concerned with fundamental issues precisely as a result of my work and involvement in the Financial Stability Forum. For example, one of the questions that arises for me this morning is how the institutional structure for maintaining the stability of the financial system should be configured in the long term, especially in the United States. Or, even more basically: how much freedom should the market participants have in the financial system and in what areas are the degrees of freedom to be limited?  These questions are the reason why, for my talk, I finally chose a matrix with keyword headings which feature all those recommendations for action that we encounter almost every day in the media. These headings include “enhancing transparency”, “refining Basel II”, “reforming deposit guarantee schemes”, “regulating rating agencies”, and “modifying monetary policymakers’ operational framework”. Under these headings, such recommendations relate to three sets of fundamental and interconnected stability issues, namely  1 key issues in the area of regulation  2 questions about the institutional structure for financial stability, and 3 fundamental issues with regard to procyclicality.  To put it quite plainly, in setting the individual topics against the fundamental issues, it has again become very clear to me that a lasting stabilisation of the financial system calls for a holistic, system-oriented policy approach, which is based on institution-oriented banking supervision but which also goes beyond it. Let me start with the fundamental issues in the area of regulation.  I Fundamental issues in the area of regulation Put in a nutshell, fundamental issues in the area of regulation relate to the tension between the poles of self-regulation and sovereign regulation. In other words, where are market solutions possible and where is sovereign regulation necessary? Another question is about the political level at which this fundamental decision is to be taken. Is it the national, the BIS Review 115/2008 1 
European or the international level? This adds a further, complex dimension to the underlying tensions and strains between self-regulation and sovereign regulation. I shall return to this point in a moment. But allow me first to emphasise that, in a market-based system, approaches involving self-regulation are the obvious course to take. Put in simple terms, the state in this case relies mainly on the fact that the market participants, first, set the standards themselves; second, that they will commit themselves to complying with these standards and, third, that they will organise an effective means of monitoring this compliance. Now, given the backdrop of current events, I probably do not need to over-emphasise the fact that, with regard to the necessary stability of the financial system, we cannot trust self-regulation alone. Sovereign regulation that “orders” the financial system is also part of the market economy. I take the view that sovereign regulation is particularly appropriate where the market players are unable or unwilling to set effective rules or where there are overriding reasons why the regulatory power of government has to be brought to bear. Banking supervision is a prime example of this: not only do banks have a key position in the financial system and, therefore, in the economy as a whole. They also have access, albeit a conditional one, to central bank money. As a result, there is unanimous agreement that self-regulation is not an option.  A fundamental decision in favour of sovereign regulation in banking supervisions by no means settles the question of whether such regulation necessarily has to set detailed and prescriptive rules. Indeed, regulation can also be organised in a principle-oriented way. In this case, the state demands that the market players follow certain principles in their transactions and monitors compliance with these principles. This approach should therefore not be confused with simple laissez faire. Rather, it places high demands on all those involved. Above all, principle-based regulation is predicated on the supervisors and the supervised having a shared understanding of the prudential aims.  If, with these principles, I now look closely at Basel II – the regulatory framework which has applied to our banks since January – I find both: rules, on the one hand, and principle-based provisions with room for manoeuvre, on the other. For example, Pillar 1 of Basel II contains clear provisions on how much capital has to be maintained for what credit risks. And, from the Bundesbank’s perspective, I would add that these regulations should be partially refined given the experience of the financial market turbulence. Among other things, we are in favour of higher capital cover for re-securitisations. This includes CDOs on asset-backed securities, for example. In addition, we advocate higher capital requirements for credit risks in the trading book and some adjustments in the area of qualified liquidity facilities in the standardised approach for securitisation. Pillar 2 of Basel II contains qualitative requirements for risk management in financial institutions, which are specified for Germany in the principle-based Minimum Requirements for Risk Management. The disclosure obligations in Pillar 3 also fall into the category of principle-oriented regulation. They leave the credit institutions scope in determining the type and scale of the information they provide.  In my view, all of this shows that, although the question of “rules or principles?” is a fundamental decision of sovereign regulation, it is not necessarily an “either-or” decision. Perhaps that also explains why, in reality, we regularly encounter a combination of principles offering fixed rules and flexibility. I believe that, on the whole, this is likely to be the best way to serve the requirements of a stable financial system as we now understand it. Nevertheless, I can see an approaching debate in which the flexibility of the second pillar of Basel II is at least partially called into question by supplementary provisions. I would warn against this.  As you are aware, however, fundamental issues of regulation for stabilising the financial system arise not only in banking supervision but also, say, in securitisation business, the hedge funds and, as an especially pressing issue, in the case of the rating agencies.  2 BIS Review 115/2008 
In the United States, rating agencies have to be registered with the SEC. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that Basel II relies on ratings for classifying bank loans. In Europe there is therefore a procedure with which agencies are authorised for the use of their ratings in determining a bank’s minimum capital.  Following the experience with ratings in the recent financial crisis, the current practice of having only a non-binding IOSCO code of conduct is generally perceived to be in need of reform. The rating agencies themselves are in the process of reviewing their internal procedures and rating methods.  In addition, in May the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) proposed the establishment of an international Standard Setting and Monitoring Body (SSMB) at IOSCO, in which the agencies are to set up standards together with the regulators. Compliance with these standards should then be monitored by the SSMB, albeit without the involvement of the agencies. This approach is claimed to be virtually a midway solution between self-regulation and sovereign regulation.  As you are aware, the European Commission has now put forward a proposal for consultation which envisages an authorisation procedure and the supervision of rating agencies – in other words, sovereign regulation. I would like to make three fundamental comments on this. First of all, every effort should be undertaken to ensure that solutions at the European level are consistent with a level playing field internationally. The crucial point on which everything hinges should be the IOSCO code of conduct since anything else might result in competitive disadvantages in Europe.  Second, emphasis should be placed on the investors’ own responsibility when using ratings. EU registration must not lead to “rubber-stamped in Brussels” being interpreted as a seal of quality for individual ratings.  Third, an EU registration procedure would have to be decentralised in structure; in particular, no new authority should be created. The Basel II authorisation procedure is a good reference point in this respect.  In making this comment, I have now basically arrived at the fundamental question of the suitable sovereign level for regulation. National and international regulations are in competition, with a third way existing in Europe in the form of regulation at the EU level. The more decentralised regulation is, the better it can be adapted to the characteristics of the financial system in question. The more centralised regulation is, the more the same regulatory conditions prevail. Deposit guarantee schemes are a good example of how the tensions between national and cross-border regulation can be resolved. In Europe we have a minimum level of harmonisation in the form of the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive. In Germany, besides this statutory deposit protection at the minimum European level, there exist additional, private protection schemes operated by the various categories of banks.  Not least in the wake of the bank run on Northern Rock last summer, the European Commission is considering a revision of the Deposit Protection Directive. It is aiming for a greater degree of harmonisation. In particular, this concerns a higher level of minimum protection and the abolition of the co-insurance. As the discussion in the EU now stands, this would mean that the principle of subsidiarity would be basically retained. We at the Bundesbank attach great importance to this. Deposit protection has to be consistent with the specific features of the national banking systems.  BIS Review 115/2008 3 
II Fundamental institutional questions  With the distribution of powers among the sovereign regulatory levels, I am now very close to the second set of fundamental issues. I would now like to talk about a number of fundamental institutional questions about the stabilisation of the financial system. I am doing this because, during the financial crisis, it has become clearer to me than ever before how much institutions matter. I am therefore concerned with the institutional framework for the monetary, supervisory and regulatory infrastructure.  In the USA, the shortcomings of governance in the financial system have been revealed for all to see in the crisis, at the same time posing two major challenges. The first challenge arises from the fragmented structure of financial supervision. In some cases, however, quite new institutional arrangements – that is, institutions – have to be put in place. With its “Blueprint”, the US Ministry of Finance has now presented an ambitious but cogent overall strategy for a longer-term reform of financial supervision. It envisages a radically overhauled institutional structure with a complete change of design in its tasks. I see one particularly important aspect of this blueprint in that fact that the Fed in the role of a “market stability regulator” would, for the first time, institutionalise a primarily macro-oriented perspective on the financial system. I await with keen interest how this debate will proceed.  With regard to the second institutional challenge in the USA, namely the review of the monetary policy instruments, a lot has already happened. To begin with, the Fed was not so well equipped with instruments for the liquidity policy action necessitated by the subprime crisis. The Fed was very quick to create efficiently functioning instruments in the crisis, however. When I now look at the institutional structure for financial stability in Germany and in the Eurosystem, I would like to highlight the synergy effects between operational money market management and banking supervision. The financial market turbulence has shown us quite clearly that these synergy effects can indeed be very large. As the Bundesbank is closely integrated into banking supervision, we can also fully exploit such synergy effects. Our deliberations on the time profile of liquidity provision and, hence, our stance in the Eurosystem benefit from general information from banking supervision. Conversely, the insights gained in contact with the banking industry in the practical conduct of refinancing operations and in payments are helpful to the banking supervisors.  These synergy effects quite certainly played a part in the Eurosystem being able to take early, resolute and successful countermeasures when the distribution of liquidity among the banks was no longer functioning as normal. In terms of the distribution of powers among the institutions, it is therefore sensible to have the national central banks closely integrated into banking supervision. And I am, of course, also glad to say that the success of central bank operations since August 2007 has certainly not been due just to the efficient division of labour among various institutions. Rather, the Eurosystem’s monetary policy framework has played a crucial part in this.  As I can report from my own experience, but without giving too many secrets away, the Eurosystem has earned a great deal of respect in the international institutions and bodies which are dealing in depth with the financial crisis and the lessons and implications to be drawn from it. A key role in this institutional structure of bodies is being played by the Financial Stability Forum, which our former Bundesbank President, Hans Tietmeyer, had the foresight to initiate within the G7 in 1999. The FSF demonstrated its great value in the crisis as an agency of informal cooperation between national bodies, international organisations and standard-setters. The list of recommendations reached by consensus and adopted by the FSF is now at the heart of the international response to the turbulence. The recommendations are being worked through in stages. A progress report on this will appear in just over three weeks. 4 BIS Review 115/2008 
Even so, it is undoubtedly no surprise that the international governance of the financial system – as after every global crisis – is now being subjected to critical scrutiny again. If we are thinking about changes, I believe we should strengthen those institutional structures that did their job well during the financial market turbulence. For me, this means that, first and foremost, the FSF should continue to a play key role in terms of responsibility for financial stability. Its widely drawn membership from central banks, ministries of finance, supervisors, regulators and international institutions means that the holistic assessment of the financial system is one of the key strengths of the FSF.  The International Monetary Fund should engage all its forces in the FSF, above all, with an in-depth analysis of the way the financial system interacts with the real economy. For the analysis of these interactions, the IMF can draw on decades of experience in Article IV consultations and a decade of assessments of the financial sector [FSAP]. The IMF therefore has almost ideal conditions for this in place. Despite the financial crisis, however, I do not see any compelling reasons for additional financing facilities at the IMF, which would bring it quite close to performing the tasks of a central bank.  III Fundamental issues of procyclicality After outlining some fundamental issues in the area of regulation and the institutional structure for safeguarding stability in the financial system, let me now turn to my third key issue, which, internationally, is right at the top of the agenda and, in my view, will also be under discussion for some time to come. Mario Draghi, the governor of Banca d'Italia, made this very clear yesterday evening at our Bundesbank Lecture in Berlin. Basically, the question is whether the regulatory framework for the financial system, as well as the provisions for accounting, act procyclically – and, if so, what can be done to counter that.  To reduce the complexity, I shall interpret the term “procyclicality” quite narrowly for once, namely as a reinforcement of the natural cycle of the financial system. Procyclical policy and procyclical elements of regulation would amplify the natural upswings and downswings of the financial system. If this leads to boom-bust cycles, the functional viability of the financial system is jeopardised.  Naturally, considerable caution is called for when dealing with the topic of procyclicality as we still don’t know enough about the cyclical effects of regulatory provisions. Added to this is the fact that the potential means against any procyclicality have not yet been researched and tested in detail, such as components that dampen procyclicality or even automatic stabilisers in the regulatory framework which are anticyclical in effect. My concern today is therefore quite a modest one. I merely wish to raise even further your awareness of all the issues associated with the proposition that the regulatory framework is procyclical.  To avoid any misunderstanding, I do now wish to stress once more that the regulatory framework with the risk-sensitive minimum capital requirements under Basel II and the use of fair value accounting under IRFS (or US GAAP) does contain cyclical elements. It is unclear, however, how far these built-in elements can also develop procyclical potential. Other experts argue, in turn, that the cyclicality of these two frameworks is a side effect of their desired characteristics. It is claimed that the potential procylicality has been deliberately condoned in order to make the capital requirements risk-sensitive and make capital requirements consistent with market conditions. And, just like you, I, too, have become familiar from this debate with the proposition that the traditional micro view of regulation has gained the upper hand over the macro or systemic perspective.  What is generally agreed in all of this is that the risk-sensitive minimum capital requirements under Basel II are based on probabilities of default, which fluctuate over the economic cycle. In a downturn, probabilities of default increase – along with the minimum capital requirements. Buffers, which are designed to dampen the procyclical potential, have now been built into Basel II. For example, long-term averages are to be used for the probabilities BIS Review 115/2008 5 
of default and the assigned loss given defaults are also to take due account of scenarios with a potential economic downturn. So far, it is unclear – and how could it possibly be otherwise so soon after the introduction of Basel II? – whether the cyclical fluctuations of the minimum capital requirements actually impact on the propensity to lend – in other words, whether they really have a procyclical effect. The extent to which this happens hinges on a large number of factors – for example, on how far the capital buffers exceed the regulatory minimum, on the willingness of the banks to let these buffers “breathe”, and, naturally enough, on the use of alternatives, such as raising additional capital. Moreover, not all the fluctuations in actual lending are on the supply side; demand, too, can fluctuate considerably over an economic cycle.  Furthermore, my cautious attitude to the question of procyclicality also has to do with the fact that empirical studies on the impact of risk-sensitive minimum capital requirements need longer time series. Less than one year after the introduction of Basel II in Germany, the database is still very narrow. It is not yet possible to make a detailed assessment of whether the minimum capital requirements are becoming binding and therefore acting in a procyclical manner. Knee-jerk responses, such as the general introduction of additional general capital buffers by means of Pillar 2 are therefore, as we see it, not appropriate. What is, in fact, called for is a close monitoring of developments and a careful analysis of the incoming data. It is important, first of all, to gain a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms of banks’ capital management and of Basel II’s impact over an adequate period of time. The banking supervisors are working very hard on this. Their findings, as well as others, can then be used to assess any systemic effects of the prudential requirements. If procyclical effects exist on a significant scale, they should then be taken into account in a system-oriented supervisory approach.  Now, I have already indicated that the fundamental issues concerning procyclicality also have to do with accounting. Fair value accounting leads to valuations fluctuating along with market prices. This evidently heightened the financial market turbulence. With a mark-to-market valuation of the paper, losses result in falling asset values, making the reduction of risk positions seem advisable, thus triggering a further wave of selling. Computer-controlled procedures for automatically limiting losses can give further impetus to this procyclicality. Conversely, rising asset values in an upswing make additional investment possible, which can drive market prices up even further. Nevertheless, by means of “prudential filters” the banking supervisors have ensured that these fluctuations in the balance sheet items do not impact fully on the regulatory capital. This means that the nexus of falling market prices for assets, declining own funds and restricted ability to lend in a downswing is dampened. In an upswing the reverse applies. This prudential correction mechanism therefore limits only part of the effects of fair-value-based accounting, namely its impact on the potential supply of credit.  IV Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen In conclusion, let me return once more to the beginning. After well over a year of financial market turbulence and following the experience of the past few days, I firmly believe that stabilising the financial system cannot consist solely in working through “to do” lists with their recommendations for action, however positive and correct they may be. Rather, a lasting stabilisation of the financial system calls for a holistic policy approach which links the microprudential base – in other words, the perspective on the individual institutions – with the macroprudential perspective and which simultaneously integrates the macroeconomic background and developments in the financial markets.  6 BIS Review 115/2008 
Realising such as a holistic approach is certainly not an easy task. But I regard it as the right course for arriving at a lasting stabilisation of the financial system.  Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 115/2008 7 
Ben S Bernanke: US financial markets Testimony of Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, Washington DC, 23 September 2008. *      *      * Chairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, and members of the Committee, I appreciate this opportunity to discuss recent developments in financial markets and the economy. As you know, the U.S. economy continues to confront substantial challenges, including a weakening labor market and elevated inflation. Notably, stresses in financial markets have been high and have recently intensified significantly. If financial conditions fail to improve for a protracted period, the implications for the broader economy could be quite adverse.  The downturn in the housing market has been a key factor underlying both the strained condition of financial markets and the slowdown of the broader economy. In the financial sphere, falling home prices and rising mortgage delinquencies have led to major losses at many financial institutions, losses only partially replaced by the raising of new capital. Investor concerns about financial institutions increased over the summer, as mortgage-related assets deteriorated further and economic activity weakened. Among the firms under the greatest pressure were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and, more recently, American International Group (AIG). As investors lost confidence in them, these companies saw their access to liquidity and capital markets increasingly impaired and their stock prices drop sharply.  The Federal Reserve believes that, whenever possible, such difficulties should be addressed through private-sector arrangements – for example, by raising new equity capital, by negotiations leading to a merger or acquisition, or by an orderly wind-down. Government assistance should be given with the greatest of reluctance and only when the stability of the financial system, and, consequently, the health of the broader economy, is at risk. In the cases of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, however, capital raises of sufficient size appeared infeasible and the size and government-sponsored status of the two companies precluded a merger with or acquisition by another company. To avoid unacceptably large dislocations in the financial sector, the housing market, and the economy as a whole, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, and the Treasury used its authority, granted by the Congress in July, to make available financial support to the two firms. The Federal Reserve, with which FHFA consulted on the conservatorship decision as specified in the July legislation, supported these steps as necessary and appropriate. We have seen benefits of this action in the form of lower mortgage rates, which should help the housing market. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury attempted to identify private-sector approaches to avoid the imminent failures of AIG and Lehman Brothers, but none was forthcoming. In the case of AIG, the Federal Reserve, with the support of the Treasury, provided an emergency credit line to facilitate an orderly resolution. The Federal Reserve took this action because it judged that, in light of the prevailing market conditions and the size and composition of AIG's obligations, a disorderly failure of AIG would have severely threatened global financial stability and, consequently, the performance of the U.S. economy. To mitigate concerns that this action would exacerbate moral hazard and encourage inappropriate risk-taking in the future, the Federal Reserve ensured that the terms of the credit extended to AIG imposed significant costs and constraints on the firm's owners, managers, and creditors. The chief executive officer has been replaced. The collateral for the loan is the company itself, together BIS Review 114/2008 1 
with its subsidiaries.1 (Insurance policyholders and holders of AIG investment products are, however, fully protected.) Interest will accrue on the outstanding balance of the loan at a rate of three-month Libor plus 850 basis points, implying a current interest rate over 11 percent. In addition, the U.S. government will receive equity participation rights corresponding to a 79.9 percent equity interest in AIG and has the right to veto the payment of dividends to common and preferred shareholders, among other things.  In the case of Lehman Brothers, a major investment bank, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury declined to commit public funds to support the institution. The failure of Lehman posed risks. But the troubles at Lehman had been well known for some time, and investors clearly recognized – as evidenced, for example, by the high cost of insuring Lehman's debt in the market for credit default swaps – that the failure of the firm was a significant possibility. Thus, we judged that investors and counterparties had had time to take precautionary measures. While perhaps manageable in itself, Lehman's default was combined with the unexpectedly rapid collapse of AIG, which together contributed to the development last week of extraordinarily turbulent conditions in global financial markets. These conditions caused equity prices to fall sharply, the cost of short-term credit – where available – to spike upward, and liquidity to dry up in many markets. Losses at a large money market mutual fund sparked extensive withdrawals from a number of such funds. A marked increase in the demand for safe assets – a flight to quality – sent the yield on Treasury bills down to a few hundredths of a percent. By further reducing asset values and potentially restricting the flow of credit to households and businesses, these developments pose a direct threat to economic growth. The Federal Reserve took a number of actions to increase liquidity and stabilize markets. Notably, to address dollar funding pressures worldwide, we announced a significant expansion of reciprocal currency arrangements with foreign central banks, including an approximate doubling of the existing swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank and the authorization of new swap facilities with the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada. We will continue to work closely with colleagues at other central banks to address ongoing liquidity pressures. The Federal Reserve also announced initiatives to assist money market mutual funds facing heavy redemptions and to increase liquidity in short-term credit markets.  Despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and other agencies, global financial markets remain under extraordinary stress. Action by the Congress is urgently required to stabilize the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and for our economy. In this regard, the Federal Reserve supports the Treasury's proposal to buy illiquid assets from financial institutions. Purchasing impaired assets will create liquidity and promote price discovery in the markets for these assets, while reducing investor uncertainty about the current value and prospects of financial institutions. More generally, removing these assets from institutions’ balance sheets will help to restore confidence in our financial markets and enable banks and other institutions to raise capital and to expand credit to support economic growth.  At this juncture, in light of the fast-moving developments in financial markets, it is essential to deal with the crisis at hand. Certainly, the shortcomings and weaknesses of our financial markets and regulatory system must be addressed if we are to avoid a repetition of what has transpired in our financial markets over the past year. However, the development of a comprehensive proposal for reform would require careful and extensive analysis that would be difficult to compress into a short legislative timeframe now available. Looking forward, the Federal Reserve is committed to working closely with the Congress, the Administration, other                                                  1  Specifically, the loan is collateralized by all of the assets of the company and its primary non-regulated subsidiaries. These assets include the equity of substantially all of AIG's regulated subsidiaries. 2 BIS Review 114/2008

Marion Williams: Governing the global financial system1Paper by Dr Marion Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Barbados, for the Initiative for Policy Dialogue Task Force on Financial Market Regulation, coordinated by Columbia University, Manchester University, UK, 1-2 July 2008. *      *      * The paper is set against a background in which the regulatory world is grappling with the realization that its regulatory regimes have been less than adequate to cope with the fast changing pace of financial innovation, sophisticated securitization and unfettered financial liberalization. It discusses the current global financial architecture, analyzes its strengths and weaknesses, the developments which have led to questions about its adequacy and suggests possible ways in which it can be improved and made more effective. There is no single international oversight body in the financial world. The earliest institution closest to being described as a global oversight body was the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). It retains however, mostly a developed country focus, principally European.  Within the BIS the most influential group is possibly the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (BCBS), a Committee which provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. It is this Committee which develops guidelines and supervisory standards. Other supervisory groups have developed to cater to geographical needs. The Caribbean Group of Bank Supervisors performs this function for the Caribbean. The International Monetary Fund was set up after the BIS. An important role for the International Monetary Fund is to provide lender of last resort facilities to many countries both developing and developed. In addition to lender of last resort functions, it also provides an important economic and financial monitoring function through its Article IV consultations and in more recent years, Financial Sector Adjustment Programmes (FSAPs). The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is an organization of regulators of the securities industry whose objective is to cooperate together to promote high standards of regulation, to exchange information and to provide mutual assistance and generally protect the integrity of the securities markets. Other International regulatory organizations include the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) body which issues standards adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) is of much more recent vintage. It was convened in 1999 to promote international financial stability. Its first major initiatives related to offshore centres. It does not include developing countries among its members, but makes recommendations and calls for their implementation relating to financial centres in both emerging markets and in developing countries. The FSF comprises 12 countries (G7 plus Hong Kong, Switzerland and Netherlands, Australia and Singapore including related institutions in those countries and 9 international standard setting organizations). The FSF is housed in the BIS.                                                  1  Prepared for the Initiative for policy Dialogue (IPD) (housed at Columbia University) which hold its second meeting of it Task Force on Financial Market Regulation On July1-2 (Sponsored by and held at Brooks World Poverty Institute at the University of Manchester). It will analyse a) the transparency and regulatory challenges and discussions emerging from the current crisis, b) the implications of both the crisis and regulatory discussions for developing and developed countries and c0 reforms in the global financial architecture that might make the global financial system more stable and more equitable. BIS Review 114/2008 1 
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. They comprise principally European and North American countries with subsequent additions of Japan, Mexico, Singapore and South Africa. Several International Organizations have observer status. These groups sometimes coordinate with each other both through formal and informal channels. The group with the most representative membership is however the International Monetary Fund which is comprised of 185 members. However up until recently, the IMF had not concentrated its resources on regulation of banks or on monitoring or evaluating the innovations in the financial system and exploring its implications. The FSF, if it widened its mandate to continual monitoring rather than issue-based approaches could come closest to the kind of entity which has the track record needed to coordinate regulatory and oversight functions of bank regulation, securities, insurance accounting rules and payment system issues and monetary and financial stability issues. The impact of innovation and the challenge for regulators It is against the background of this regulatory framework and in the context of a philosophy of financial liberalisation and integration of financial markets that innovative financial technologies took off. Financial technologies however rapidly outpaced the regulatory framework and it is now fairly well acknowledged that regulatory frameworks have not kept pace with financial innovation.  Financial innovation has manifested itself in various ways, the most prominent being the growing importance of new and complex financial instruments, new business models which focus on multiple financial activities facilitated by financial liberalisation, and significant developments in the area of securitisation and disintermediation. To this can be added the rising importance of relatively new, largely unregulated players, such as hedge funds, private equity firms, conduits and structured investment vehicles – SIVs, the constraints to financial innovation seemed limitless and regulators were left behind in the process. By the first half of 2007, financial market activity had expanded at a tremendous pace. However, dependence on capital markets and on sustained market liquidity also increased, as banks and other intermediaries placed greater reliance on their ability to “originate and distribute” loans and other financial products. They also depended on the market to manage their risk positions dynamically. The coincidence of greater levels of deregulation and integration of capital markets implied that if a major problem arose it was more likely to spread quickly across borders. This environment encouraged an increase in risk-taking as many players “hunted for yield. Interestingly, the composition of investors also changed. Measuring risk where credit can be sliced and diced The widespread use of structured credits effectively lowered the compensation for bearing credit risk and market risk to historically low levels. It is during this time that a market for bearing risk through complex structures of credit derivatives flourished. There were a few warning signals particularly about hedge funds, but not many warnings about securitisation. Regulators were caught napping and the rating agencies did not spot the weaknesses.  There are two aspects to this problem, one is the absence of oversight bodies which were monitoring and more importantly, which had authority to forestall this problem and the other was the absence of rules or processes which would help to prevent its occurrence. There was also clearly a need for internal corporate ground rules at the operational level. However, securitization is here to stay as it is a critical factor in achieving financial flexibility in a world of global flows. However, it is important that credit originators bear greater responsibility for the credit worthiness of the credits they originate. Because of the difficulty of tracking risks in 2 BIS Review 114/2008 
securitised loans which have been leveraged several times, loan originators need to be required to take more responsibility and to suffer some penalty for failure of the loans they originate. A solution to this problem will require greater study by derivative experts, but it is important that is addressed. Concentration and risk management Developing guidelines for risk management and requiring compliance to them are a core remedy for this situation and adequate internal risk management measures and processes at the level of the firm are very important. Portfolio concentration seems also to be an important area which calls for attention. Sectoral concentration and instrument concentration are both risk areas for which guidelines need to be developed. Regulatory slips In addition to national oversight level, something went wrong also with global regulatory and oversight systems. The IMF did not see itself as having specific responsibility for these developments and the BIS, while it did see itself as an entity with some responsibility for the stability of the financial system, was a European dominated organisation, and most of its clients were not experiencing these problems at home to the same degree as they were occurring in the US. They did draw attention to the development, largely in the area of hedge funds but did not appear to display alarm and were perhaps too hesitant in requesting remedial measures from US regulators, in which jurisdiction the problem was escalating most. The initiatives which had been taken in the late nineties as offshore centres flourished, and which gave rise to the Financial Stability Forum and the FATF did not replicate themselves with the same aggression and with concerted action as in the case of the offshore centres issue, nor did these entities evaluate the nature of the problem sufficiently quickly. As cracks in the financial architecture surfaced and new vulnerabilities were exposed, it became increasingly important that both market participants and policy markers improved their understanding and assessment of threats to financial stability, and take steps, where appropriate, to contain and reduce them.  The Financial Stability Forum (FSF); the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with their emphasis on macro prudential indicators and early warning systems have recently been active in the development of models to identify and assess potential sources of major vulnerability to the financial system. This involves great degrees of dialogue by regulators with practitioners, to understand better current approaches to measuring risks and to encourage improvements and the sharing of best practices in stress testing techniques. The former group lacks the network for so doing and the authority. The latter has that network but presently lacks the track record of analysing financial markets, instruments, structures and flows with a view to improving quickly on risk management techniques.  Size, market share and mega-financial institutions The extent to which mega-financial institutions are at risk has not been highlighted a great deal but may be a sleeping giant problem. Indeed, in the UK and in US the financial institutions which failed were small financial institutions and not mega institutions. However, when we look at the write-downs of debt the largest debt write-downs in North America have been by the largest banks. If these have been larger relative to their size, then we would have a greater problem. Indeed, preliminary indications are that there is a need to focus more on size, governability, adequacy of internal controls and internal information flow as increasingly important aspects of financial governance by oversight bodies of mega-banks. BIS Review 114/2008 3 
Indeed many large banks have been increasing their capital by going to market, some tapping into liquidity outside of their jurisdictions, even when regulators have not demanded it. There may be some issues here of too light a regulatory hand and over confidence in the role of the market. Responsibility rests with the CEOs as was evident in the firing of three CEOs of three large financial institutions in the US recently. It emphasises that Information flow, internal oversight systems, distributed decision making and incentive systems which support good governance need to be an integral part of review by regulators, particularly so in mega-financial institutions where distance from the operation can be a problem. Innovation, financial market development and monetary policy The role for central banks in influencing macroeconomic outcomes has also changed as a result of the inter-connectedness of capital markets and the internationalisation of financial flows. The development of deeper, more complete and more competitive financial markets have strengthened the pass-through effect of central bank interest rates to market interest rates and has led to a closer relationship between market and bank interest rates. Consequently, the deepening of financial markets has served to amplify the effects of monetary policy on bank interest rates, and ceteris paribus other variables such as inflation. However a countervailing truth has also been evident. The major monetary policy transmission channel through bank lending has become less important, yet new regulations are still focusing on the quality of bank credit.  Widespread use of credit derivatives has meant that banks could respond more flexibly to changes in financial market conditions, and may therefore not pass through each and every change in the central bank’s official short-term interest rate. Moreover, financial development has not only broadened banks’ options in terms of responding to interest rate changes; they have also broadened borrowers’ financing opportunities, reducing their dependency on bank loans. These developments have meant that there is a more urgent need for adequate amounts of data which would provide policymakers with sufficient ammunition to try to maintain financial stability. Indeed, in some jurisdictions investment banks, the key institutions in this securitization boom fell outside the prudential purview of key financial regulators Measuring stability Initiatives to build robust financial stability indices have thus far not been good enough or easily understandable by the market. Moreover interpreting them with sufficient precision in order to home in on remedial areas in need, has been a fuzzy exercise. The concept of financial stability involves various financial intermediaries, financial market segments and infrastructure, for which a whole host of different quantitative and qualitative indicators can be used. As a consequence, determining the degree of financial stability remains a highly integrated complex task. It therefore means that the governance system which has responsibility for ensuring financial stability must be able to monitor information and analyse developments in several financial sectors and not just in commercial banks. Recognition of the multi-faceted nature of ensuring financial stability contributed to the concept of a single regulator as evidenced in the establishment of Financial Services authorities in some jurisdictions and was intended to help to deal with the problem of the widening scope of financial transactions and interconnectedness. It is beginning to appear that it is becoming increasingly difficult for a single regulatory authority to fully grasp all the intricacies of securities regulation, insurance, banking and derivatives use and all other financial institutional arrangements simultaneously. It seems therefore that what is required is not only greater depth of understanding by regulators in each specific financial area but also 4 BIS Review 114/2008 
greater collaboration among regulators in these areas with a view to collaborating to ensure greater stability in the systems as a whole. The role of calculating the feedback effects between financial system behaviour and the real economy has traditionally been conducted by central banks on a national scale and by the IMF on a global scale, and the latter still remains a very important role. The IMF may be well positioned to evaluate these effects, but it is not clear that it is best positioned to set regulatory criteria. There therefore seemed to be a role for an oversight monitoring body with multiple oversight responsibilities, but with the ability to access a wide range of inputs from various single regulatory bodies with single regulatory responsibilities. The bodies which come closest to this are the BIS and FSF, despite the drawback that they are not truly global institutions. It is useful to note here that the BIS is the engine room of the FSF. Given that feedback effects play a crucial role in assessing a financial system’s vulnerability to contagion and systemic-wide stress this is an area that some international oversight body needs to concentrate on more intensively. Since this requires continuous monitoring and interactive dialogue and risk management skills, a joint FSF/IMF collaboration may be necessary. Data availability and relevant data identification With the exception of market prices and regulatory information, only a limited set of data is available in a timely and manner and in a manner that facilitates international comparison. For instance, financial intermediaries’ financial reporting contains little information on risk transfer mechanisms, and the use of off-balance sheet financial derivatives.  Methods have to be found also for handling the shifting demand for data in an environment in which financial markets are constantly undergoing change. This is the regulators challenge. At present, stability forecasting is often scattered with respect to risk categories, financial market segments and structural or regulatory issues. While every national regulator should be involved in this process, global recognition of this problem may be needed at the global level. This must not be confused with any doubts about the skills and knowledge of such special geographic groupings. Central bank as regulator or financial services authority? Having set guidelines, the issue of compliance is important. Over the years there has been a simultaneous shift from a direct and administered system to market-determined and marked-based systems of determining interest rates, exchange rates and other key financial variables. However, the regulator or policymaker must still remain vigilant at all times to ensure that private owners and management of financial intermediaries operate within defined risk parameters, observe the standards, guidelines and codes diligently, comply with prudential regulations and norms, and follow the best corporate governance practices. The regulator who has responsibility for compliance may not necessarily be the regulatory which sets the guidelines as guidelines can span regulatory authorities. The need for coordination is therefore essential. Even the role of governments in the process of underwriting balance sheets has been an issue. In the UK it was Government which gave verbal undertakings to depositors about the safety of their funds. In the US, the question also arose around the issue of central banks bailing out financial institutions (which were not banks) and whether the use of funds which would otherwise be available to the treasury, was appropriate. This issue of bailing out financial institutions which central banks do not regulate also has implications for reporting obligations and raises the spectre of the wisdom and practicality of a single regulatory authority and the moral hazard of an institution which regulates but does not provide financial BIS Review 114/2008 5 
support, and the information and regulatory needs of the authority which does. It is noted that Northern Rock was regulated by the FSA and bailed out by the Bank of England. Importance of real time information The use of technology to produce an updated management information system on real-time basis and the re-engineering of business processes and systems are the tools which can help regulators to remain on the top of the potential problems. Also, in many instances, the ability to regulate effectively is also dependent on the robustness of governing legislation, rules and regulations, as well as the ability of legislators to act quickly in changing such laws and regulations. Very often financial regulators and legislators take years to enact laws and regulations while financial activity is changing rapidly. In this situation, the regulatory system can be irrelevant in the face of fast paced financial developments. In this context, the content, characteristics, embedded risks and the accounting of the ever growing array of financial instruments particularly derivatives, hedge products and other similar products have to be fully understood so that guidelines governing them may need to be revised and made relevant, and quickly. However, while some of these rules may be set by securities regulators, it is banks which use securities, and the absence of appropriate rules by securities regulators is affecting the stability of banks and near-banks who answer to different regulators and who may need in extremity to be bailed out by a third regulator – the central bank. Common standards and disclosure requirements Regulators have also to insist that there are common standards for valuation of assets and liabilities and there are common yardsticks for measurement. It is not clear that these standards should necessarily be accounting standards. Transparency and disclosure standards have to be kept under constant watch and suitably upgraded so that the innovators are obligated to provide the full range of information required to evaluate risks. While the regulators should not stifle financial innovation, they should have the capacity to understand the risks involved and disseminate them to the market participants.  The traditional approach of regulation, that is, mainly compliance-oriented with emphasis on review of portfolios rather than evaluation of processes has diminished effectiveness in the present dynamic landscape. The imperatives of market innovation demand a departure from the current predominant approach towards a more proactive approach that forces banks to recognise issues when they occur or, preferably, even ensure that the probability of their occurrence is contained. This approach puts more emphasis on examining the bank’s risk measurement and management processes instead of simply reviewing its assets portfolio. It demands that a bank’s risk management processes should be scaled up to reflect risk appetite and the complexity of operations. Specifically, the bank which engages in more complex nature of businesses should be expected to have in place credible internal risk measurement models and should assess and maintain economic capital, adequate to cover the underlying business risks.  Capital adequacy The emphasis on adequate capital has helped a great deal in the past but cannot in itself ensure solvency and stability of the financial system in all situations. However, there are some inherent rigidities which fail to cover many of the risks that banks assume in their business operations. That’s why capital adequacy concepts have been becoming less rigid though it has been undermined through the use of regulatory capital arbitrage. The current 6 BIS Review 114/2008 
sub-prime crisis in the US is testimony to the effects of regulatory arbitrage and the impact of regulatory loopholes, which can occur in even the most developed financial system. While the BIS has been the most pro-active in trying to stay on top of these aspects of risk measurement in the industry, it too has fallen behind. This could principally be because the BIS has been concentrating principally on commercial banks, whereas the weaknesses in the financial systems had moved to the securities markets. Measuring fair value Accounting guidelines and bank regulation guidelines do not always coincide. Recent accounting mark-to-market rules of the IFRS are a case in point. Indeed, the role that mark-to-market accounting may have played in the evaluation of assets of financial institutions in recent months and in hampering the ability of creditor financial institutions to organize workouts of debt with their customers has been a matter of some discussion. Accounting rules tend to make the decision to reschedule or reorganize debt workouts a matter for greater provisioning by the financial institution, thus discouraging workouts and the long term prospect of recovery. In the recent US case, earlier in the year, Government intervened and mandated that some customers must be given time to reorganise their debts. However, accounting rules do not predispose to making arrangements with ones creditors. The verdict is out on how the Spanish solution of dynamic provisioning has solved the problem. The counter-argument is that these system prolong the period over which debt is collectible and in the meanwhile might be misrepresenting the value of the asset. Discussion and dialogue with the accounting associations seem to be critical to resolving this problem which has the potential for preventing recovery of debt over the longer term.  Review of Basel II Accord The new Basel II Accord is expected to eliminate some of those anomalies, but it is not perfect. Still, Basel II covers more comprehensive range of risks, better align regulatory capital to underlying risks, integrates capital requirement to a larger framework and provides for the role of supervisors in evaluating risk and market discipline. Since it provides options to banks, it appears to encourage improvements in the risk management processes. Policy makers have already realised the importance of this new accord, and presently it is in different stages of implementation across the globe. However, the implementation in itself demands even more concentrated efforts and capacity building both with regulators and concerned stakeholders. However, following the sub-prime crisis in the US there are growing concerns about the advanced internal based approach which gives banks flexibility to develop their own risk assessment systems, in light of what happened in the investment banking community when these institutions had total autonomy to do so and did not. The role of market needs to be enhanced to discipline businesses indulging in excessive risk-taking. But this is not going to be an easy task, especially in the economies that have built-in safety nets which translate to negative incentives and which hamper market discipline on one hand and in turn encourage excessive risk taking by banks on the other.  Moral hazard and market discipline The usefulness of market discipline in augmenting the supervisory roles cannot be overlooked, but has to be reworked. While some of these safety nets are indispensable, we should seek ways to reduce associated moral hazard, and perfect the market discipline framework to complement supervisory practices. The extent to which markets discipline BIS Review 114/2008 7 
themselves is however being questioned and it is becoming clearer that there must be penalties for inappropriate and risky behaviour which threaten system stability. Improved disclosure about risk profile, risk management practices and performances and related matters facilitates market discipline by enabling the market participants as well as supervisors to assess the soundness of a bank given the level of risks it assumes. The market assessment of the bank’s soundness as reflected in the pricing of its products by the market could be used as an indicator for devising effective policy responses. A great deal of effort has been put into the introduction of Basel II by the BIS and in most organizations there is a tendency to protect one’s creation. However, it is important that given the questions that have been raised about certain aspects of Basel II in the contest of the sub-prime crisis and the moral hazard of self assessment, that the architects of Basel II revisit some of the major tenets of the new proposed regulatory framework, especially the advanced approach. The role of ratings In a Basel II-regulated world, and in a world where market discipline matters greatly, ratings will become even more important. Ratings should reflect risk and prompt more responsible behaviour by financial institutions who value their ratings. This too has its challenges since in many instances pricing is based on a risk rating, itself the product of analysis of information that has been provided to the ratings agency by the specific issuer. Following the sub-prime fallout, the validity of ratings, rating agency modeling, methodology and their compensation has been called into question. Therefore, any enhanced programme aimed at improving the governance of the global financial system may require some changes to the ratings infrastructure and the extent to which ratings reflect risk and are not overly influenced by massive corporate profits of high-risk institutions. Indeed a special rating for risk may be appropriate – that is both for risk in the firm and transferred risk – i.e. risk transferred by the firm to the system.  There needs to be a series of major changes to plug the loopholes in the system and regulators need to ensure that they are as proactive as possible. Global liquidity management Over the past several years the liberalization of the financial system has created the need for liquidity to be provided, not to governments through the IMF as was the case in the past through stabilisation programmes but directly to financial institutions. The internationalisation of finance and the existence of mega –banks emphasises the need for liquidity support across large financial institutions. This may very well be beyond the capability of monetary authorities. There is a need to identify how this problem can be solved and how that liquidity can be provided before the problems occur. What is more serious is that where these problems are systemic and are not restricted to any individual bank, then access to liquidity could be very problematic. This eventuality needs to be considered before it occurs. Towards a revised global governance structure The question of developing a multi-pronged over-arching monitoring body is an important factor in a revised governance system. The nucleus of this exists in the BIS and the FSF and the IMF. The BIS already has in place, in addition to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, several useful sub-committees, for example, the work on Policy Development Group which has a number of sub committees – on Risk Management and Modelling, Liquidity, Definition of Capital, on Trading Book matters, and on Cross-border Bank resolution. The down-side of this arrangement is the degree of possible tunnel vision since 8 BIS Review 114/2008 
most of the sub-committees arose out of Basel II Accord, which now appears needs some modification in light of recent events. One issue is global acceptability. Most of these groups, even the International Liaison Group – that with the widest representation – falls short of international representation, of an organisation like the IMF with 185 members. The question is, how much is lost in terms of global stability by the exclusion of these countries? Is their inclusion in the IMF – albeit even there in a notional way – enough, or are they destined to continue to be excluded on the grounds that they are not systemically important? The Financial Stability Forum attempts to function as a critical issues forum with representation beyond banking. This Forum, despite its G7 focus includes a number of international financial regulatory organisations. It trys to project that it is not an arm of the BIS, but is housed in BIS. This comes closest to being a multipurpose oversight body, but lacks global representation, something which probably needs to be remedied if it wants to be considered a global body with the ability to speak to other countries with authority. This group therefore, by reporting to the IMF is able to give itself some legitimacy. The report of the FSF of April 2008 on enhancing market and institutional resilience is an example of its work; a good analysis with general recommendations with specific recommendations promised later. Who, however will determine whether and how the recommendations are implemented is the key question? The IMF? Summary This paper attempted to analyse the international financial governance system, its strengths and weaknesses and in the course of the paper a number of issues were ventilated and a number of recommendations made. They include: - The need for clear rules and processes for securitisation and an oversight body whose authority is observed in this regard. - The need to better understand current approaches to measuring risk and to track risks in securitised loans and to improve the internal reporting systems in mega-banks. - The need to revise incentive systems so they do not reward those who transfer risks to others. - Focus on financial risk generally and not on bank risks in particular. - Concretise measures of financial stability and develop international comparability. - Conduct more in depth studies on financial system vulnerability to inflation. - Develop a clearly defined role for a body with multiple financial oversight responsibilities and determine whether this is the FSF and if so deal with its global legitimacy. - Develop more information on risk transfer mechanisms. - Develop systems of forecasting liquidity needs which result from globalisation. - Determine the split of responsibilities between the regulator which set the guidelines, the regulator which ensures compliance and the authority which finances bail-outs. - Clarify the role of governments and guard against moral hazard of saving financial institutions at all costs. - Ensure that accounting guidelines do not frustrate debt recovery arrangements. BIS Review 114/2008 9 
- Re-visit the self-assessment guidelines in the advanced approach of Basel II. - Educate investors to rely less on ratings and to use independent judgement. - Increase the levels of capital adequacy and support this with flexibility for supervisors to call for increased capital based on risk assessments.  This paper does not call for a total revamp of the financial governance structure but rather for a number of key improvements; among them dealing with the issue of legitimacy and also importantly, since some of these issues had been identified prior to the difficulties early in the year, ensuring that systems and regulated entities accelerate their responses to the recommendations. 10 BIS Review 114/2008 
John Gieve: The credit crunch and the UK economy Speech by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, to the Family Office Leadership Summit, London, 22 September 2008. *      *      * Introduction In recent days we have seen extraordinary developments in US financial markets. At the start of last week we saw the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the merger of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America; by Friday the US Treasury had rescued AIG, issued a guarantee of Money Market Funds and an outline plan for a Resolution Trust that is now in Congress. And this morning the Federal Reserve announced that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley would become regulated bank holding companies.  But I want today to concentrate on the broader economic impact of the crisis in credit markets, which began over a year ago with the downturn in the US sub-prime housing market. While the epicentre has remained in the US, it has already had a major impact on the structure of our banking sector. Northern Rock was among the first casualties. And this year we are seeing a significant consolidation within the UK banking sector, with Santander purchasing Alliance & Leicester, Nationwide absorbing two smaller building societies, and most recently the merger of HBOS and Lloyds TSB. The turmoil has also affected all of the Bank’s work; from the setting of interest rates, to the scale and structure of our market operations, and to our joint work with the FSA and Treasury to deal with institutions under stress and to help design an effective international response to the crisis.  For example, like other central banks, we have adapted our money market operations to provide the liquidity the banking system as a whole has required. First, we have allowed banks to increase their reserve balances at the Bank, increasing the size of our overall provision of central bank money; second, within that larger total, we have shifted the balance towards longer-term lending as the terms of market finance have shortened; third, we have widened the collateral we accept for longer-term repos. And in April, we introduced a special scheme to provide banks with up to three years’ finance for legacy assets which have become illiquid.  Last week we offered extra sterling liquidity through our usual Open Market Operations and provided US dollar liquidity as part of co-ordinated action with the Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank. We also extended the window in which banks can swap their legacy assets under the Special Liquidity Scheme until January next year. Even once the window closes, the Scheme’s asset swap will provide liquidity for a period of up to three years, something many people have not fully appreciated.  Events are still moving quickly, so I hope you will understand why I am not going to attempt a live commentary on events. I hope that the massive and far-reaching measures the US Government has now announced will restore greater calm and confidence in their banking system. Stabilisation of US markets and banks should have a beneficial knock-on effect on wider international markets too. But we will continue to monitor the situation closely, in consultation with our counterparts in the US and elsewhere, in order to judge whether any further measures are needed.  Inflation outlook This morning I want to take a wider perspective and discuss how the credit crunch is affecting the wider UK economy and draw some medium-term lessons for economic policy.  BIS Review 114/2008 1 
And the first point to make is that the turmoil in financial markets has not been the only shock to our economy in the last 12 months. In any other week more attention would have been given to the fact that for the second successive quarter the Governor had to write an open letter to the Chancellor on behalf of the Monetary Policy Committee to explain why inflation was more than a percentage point away from the target of 2%. In fact inflation has risen from 2.1% in December to 4.7% in August and it seems set to peak above 5% soon.  The immediate driver of that increase has been the international commodity cycle (Chart 1). The rapid growth across most large emerging market economies (EMEs) in particular has fuelled global demand for raw materials, which in the short term are in relatively fixed supply, pulling their prices upwards. In August, oil prices were up 60% higher than a year earlier, wholesale gas prices were up 90%, and food prices 40%.  These sharp increases in costs have fed into food and petrol prices and passed along the supply chain, driving up the prices of other goods including in particular household gas and electricity bills (Chart 2). But so long as the prices of wholesale energy and foodstuffs on global markets stabilise at their new higher levels, their direct impact on inflation should wash out after a year. In other words, by late 2009 these items would not be making any contribution to the rate of consumer price inflation: whereas, at present, they are contributing almost 3 percentage points.  Moreover there are some signs that the commodity cycle may have turned down. Since the peak in July, the price of food has fallen by 10% and the price of crude oil has fallen by over a quarter, and that is consistent with other indicators that point to a slowing in growth in both emerging and advanced economies. That good news on commodity prices has been offset somewhat in the UK by a falling exchange rate. Sterling has been trading at around 1.8 against the US dollar – a year ago it was 2.0. But the same arithmetic applies: such price level shocks need have no long-term impact on the inflation rate. In the medium term the real upside risks to inflation lie at home – in whether we see “second round” rises in wages and prices in the domestic economy. It is to counter those pressures that the MPC have judged it necessary over the last year for growth to slow and create a margin of spare capacity in our economy. That makes it more difficult for companies to raise prices and puts more pressure on them to restrain their costs.  It also re-emphasises our determination to get inflation back to the 2% target and thus influences the expectations of financial markets, price setters, wage negotiators and households generally. And expectations themselves have an important impact on inflation. Broadly, the higher households’ expect inflation to be, the less they are likely to save today. Inflation expectations also shape workers’ wage demands as they try to protect their standard of living. And companies’ expectations will shape the prices they set as well as their willingness to concede cost increases.  We know from the inflations of the 70s, 80s, and early 90s that raising interest rates will in time bring inflation down, even when expectations of future inflation are high. But we also know how painful that process is. It works through the increased threat of bankruptcy and unemployment. That forces a change in peoples’ behaviour and their hearts and minds and expectations follow. Conversely, the more confident people are that inflation will fall back the less we have to rely on slowing the economy to force them to hold prices and wages down. That is why the risk of inflation expectations drifting up has been such a central concern of the MPC over the last year. In my view it has been particularly important through recent months, when each forecast has been higher than the one before and each inflation figure has exceeded the earlier forecast, not to confuse the central message that we will set policy to bring inflation back down to target.  We have seen households’ near-term expectations of inflation rise this year, but that was inevitable given experience and our own forecasts (Chart 3). What matters more are 2 BIS Review 114/2008 
expectations of inflation over the medium-term, and whether they are consistent with the target, and here the surveys are less alarming: according to the YouGov/Citigroup survey, those expectations have fallen back a little and a gap has opened up between people’s perceptions of current inflation and their expectations of a year or more ahead.  We can use other economic data as a cross-check on what is happening to inflation expectations. If households’ expectations had become detached, we should expect to see households spending more, and saving less, and pushing for larger nominal wage increases. If companies’ expectations had become detached, we should expect to see a broad-based pickup in cost and price inflation. But consumer spending appears to be weak, nominal wage growth remains relatively muted and once we strip out the impact of rising commodity prices, output price inflation has been steady. To paraphrase Sherlock Holmes, if expectations have become detached, it is curious that those dogs haven’t barked. So in my view the news on that front has been encouraging.  The impact of the credit crunch And of course, we have been balancing that upside risk to inflation from the commodity price shock against a downside risk that the credit crisis would drive down activity too far and push inflation below target in the medium term. And the news on that front remains worrying.  The headlines are about the drama on Wall Street but the failure or rescue of even big and well known financial firms matters mainly because of their knock on impact on the wider economy. The last year has brought home once again why central banks have to be concerned with financial stability as well as monetary stability and inflation. For the biggest risk to the financial sector is also the biggest downside risk to the economy: namely that damage to bank balance sheets would lead to tighter credit conditions, lower asset prices, lower consumption and investment and to a severe feedback loop into more losses for banks and so on down a spiral. That feedback is already working to some degree not just in the US but in the UK too. Our investment banks have suffered losses in their trading books and a wider group of banks have lost money on their treasury books because of the fall in the values of structured credit of all sorts. At the same time they have found that some of their major sources of finance, notably securitisation and medium term unsecured lending, have dried up and others, notably shorter term lending in money markets, have become much more expensive (Chart 4).  What is more, all these effects have lasted longer than expected and seem set to continue for some time. Banks have responded by hoarding liquidity and trying to reduce their leverage by raising new capital (not without difficulty in some cases) and by constraining the growth of lending. One direct effect has been a marked tightening of credit conditions over the past year (Chart 5), which seems still to be underway. That in turn is pushing down asset prices and demand. Our forecasts and our policy decisions have reflected our best assessment of the likely impact of this feedback. We brought down interest rates earlier in the year to cushion the impact of the change in bank behaviour. In effect we have relied on the credit squeeze in large measure to produce the slowdown we consider necessary. But we are fully aware of the risk that the squeeze on banks and the feedback to the economy could prove more powerful than expected.  That risk does not just arise from the drama of the last week or two. We will continue to work for the return of calmer financial markets. But we should not rely on that to reverse quickly the broader macroeconomic slowdown that is underway. Indeed there are still risks to the downside and I thought it might be useful to spell out how they feed through the economy and therefore make plain what indicators I will be focusing on in the next few months.  BIS Review 114/2008 3 
Any contraction in lending to the real economy can amplify the slowdown in demand (Chart 6). Increases in retail lending rates for those who can still get access to credit discourage spending. Increases in credit rationing can have a more dramatic impact. If those households and companies are unable to tap other sources of finance, then their spending will have to fall back in line with income.  Spending on high cost durable goods – such as purchases of cars and white goods by households and machines by companies – are likely to be particularly affected. And the contraction in mortgage lending pushes down house prices, further eroding the value of the collateral against which banks’ loans are secured.  Tighter credit conditions raise income gearing, forcing households and companies to devote a larger share of their income to servicing debt. And as the impact of those tighter credit conditions bite on the economy, income is likely to be squeezed and that at the same time as real incomes are being affected by higher food and energy prices. The slowdown in demand will fall disproportionately on certain industries, starting with the house-building sector and related services and lead to falls in employment. Some households and companies are likely to be driven over the default threshold.  Tighter credit conditions could also affect the potential output of the economy – reducing the capacity of the economy to produce goods and services. The economy’s supply capacity reflects not only the number of people who work and the number of machines at their disposal, but also how productive our companies are at using that labour and capital to produce output. And the innovations in new products and new processes which drive productivity growth are financed in part by bank lending.  In short, the process of deleveraging that was designed to alleviate pressure on banks’ capital position can lead to an additional wave of credit losses, coupled with higher write-off rates, given the lower level of property prices (Chart 7). And, welcome though the reforms of Basel II and accounting rules are in many respects, they can accentuate the squeeze on capital because the requirements are based on risk weights which rise when arrears are increasing and collateral values are falling.  House prices and consumption One important feedback is through the housing market which is continuing to weaken. The number of loan approvals for house purchases is at a record low, the ratio of sales to stocks is approaching the levels of the early 1990s, and prices are now down 12% on their peak of late last year.  Of course falls in house prices tend to coincide with a slowdown in the wider economy because they are affected by the same factors – notably falls in real income and employment. But they can also feed back into activity. First they slow housing investment and transaction flow which hits builders and related services like estate agents and conveyancers. The purchases of white goods and furniture tend to go hand in hand with transactions in the housing market. So the slowdown in the number of people moving home is likely to impact on spending on those goods.  Falling house prices limit how much households and small businesses can borrow today and that pulls down consumption and investment. Also by reducing their expectations of what they will be able to borrow tomorrow either to compensate for a reduction in income or a need to spend, some households and firms may increase their precautionary savings.  Finally, falling house prices redistribute wealth. Those who already own houses and expect to trade down in future and realise a capital gain, are worse off. On the other side, those hoping to trade up or who are not yet on the housing ladder are better off (although the tighter constraints on lending may mean they have to save a bigger deposit to enter the market). The former will tend to reduce their consumption; the latter will tend to do the 4 BIS Review 114/2008 
opposite. In a perfect market these two effects might balance out. But given that some of the beneficiaries of house price falls do not yet have independent incomes, and others have a longer period ahead to consume their additional wealth, on balance I would expect the net effect on consumption to be negative. More widely I would expect some impact from the end of a wide perception that in housing you can have your cake and eat it – that the return on your house as an investment will in time substantially offset the cost of housing as a service.  All these feedback channels are at work and economics is better at identifying their nature than in forecasting their scale. There is no alternative there to reviewing all the indicators I have mentioned month by month and then making an informed judgment.  Some policy lessons for the medium term We identified the mispricing of risk, particularly in credit markets in our Financial Stability Reports over the last two years. But the reckoning has been more severe and destabilising than anyone anticipated. Risk premia had become compressed and leverage throughout the financial markets had risen too high. The pendulum has now swung back with a vengeance. As the FSR noted earlier this year, risk premia now appear to have overshot in some markets and that is contributing to the slowdown in the real economy.  Could policymakers have taken earlier action to correct those imbalances? Of course we took the decisions we did on the basis of the available data at the time. But with hindsight, seen across the world as a whole, there was a case for somewhat tighter monetary policy to prevent the demand for resources outstripping supply (although I would note that our interest rates have been consistently higher in recent years than those elsewhere in the advanced economies). The rise in oil and food prices has appeared as an external pressure on each country on its own but it is not external to us all collectively. A particular problem here – that has yet to be resolved – is the expansion of the dollar bloc. The emerging economies were importing loose monetary policy, which scarcely seemed appropriate to their domestic conditions.  However it is hard to believe that a somewhat tighter monetary policy would have been guaranteed to head off the credit boom and subsequent crunch altogether. Put another way, monetary policy is a blunt instrument. To prevent excesses in financial markets, we might have had to generate an unnecessary slowdown in the real economy. I share the view therefore that we have to look for new regulatory measures to complement interest rates.  There are a number of specific lessons on regulation which have already been identified. The FSA, for example, is already strengthening its prudential supervision. And internationally, we need to fill gaps in the current framework – for example on mortgage origination in the US, increasing the capital requirements for some credit products and loan commitments, and ensuring that investors and rating agencies assess new products more diligently. In the UK we have also set out proposals to reform the legal framework for dealing with failing banks. Through the Financial Stability Forum we also need to strengthened supervisory colleges and cross-border crisis management arrangements.  One more general lesson is that we have to recognise the difference between what is good risk management in a single company and what is good for the system as a whole. For a company the ideal risk management system is one which enables them to take risks, reap the rewards but get out first when the music stops. And the right capital and liquidity is one which is just enough to see you through the subsequent downturn in asset prices and transactions. But there is always someone at the end of the queue and it is impossible to be sure who they will be. Moreover in a global market the problems of one institution are bound to spread quickly to others along a complex web of interconnections in many markets. For the authorities what matters is whether the losses to the slower players damage the system as a whole. One lesson of recent events is that the capital and liquidity buffers need to be BIS Review 114/2008 5 
higher for everyone. The long decline in holdings of liquid assets (Chart 8) by banks for example has to be reversed a bit and the increase in leverage likewise (Chart 9).  In the Financial Stability Forum, which is leading the international regulatory response to the crisis, we are also looking at the scope for “macro prudential” instruments to dampen the destabilising procyclicality in financial markets. To do this we need to do more than simply raise the minimum levels of capital and liquidity that regulators, rating agencies, or the markets require. We need to create reserves based on macroeconomic factors, which can be drawn down as the cycle turns down and have to be replenished on the upswing when profits are high. The system of dynamic provisioning in Spain seems to work effectively in that respect and may well offer a guide for the way forward.  Conclusion To conclude, on monetary policy, we have one instrument, and one goal – ensuring that inflation stabilises at target in the medium-term. While we must remain vigilant for any signs of inflation expectations drifting upwards, the news on that front is encouraging. On the other side, the risk we must be careful not to underestimate is the deflationary consequences of the credit crisis.  At the moment we are focused on the risk that the slowdown in the real economy will be amplified through a contraction in banks’ balance sheets. But we should also set in place longer term measures to prevent such financial imbalances from building up again in the next upswing. In my view the case for macro-prudential policies alongside monetary policy is compelling.

Mugur Isărescu: Hard landing unlikely for Romania  Interview with Dr Mugur Isărescu, Governor of the National Bank of Romania, by Mediafax news agency, Bucharest, 8 September 2008. *      *      * Mr. Governor, foreign analysts have placed Romania along with four other states – Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Bulgaria – in a group of countries heading to a hard landing. In fact the economies of Estonia and Latvia have contracted sharply, with growth plunging from levels of around 10 percent into negative territory; inflation has reached two-digit levels and the external deficit exceeded 15 percent of gross domestic product. Is it possible for Romania to witness similar negative growth dynamics? Is it fair to include Romania in that group? Reading what those foreign analysts said, I have hardly found a solid rationale that would justify Romania's being placed within the hard-landing risk zone. On the contrary.  Turning now to comments, I will underline that there are some similarities among the countries in this group: GDP per capita is below the EU average, they all have registered high growth rates in the catching-up process. However, there are also fundamental differences, among which the most important in my view is the monetary policy mechanism. Three of the four countries mentioned in the group have currency boards in place, and the fourth, i.e. Latvia, has a mechanism close to a currency board. Of course, currency board has its clear benefits. Let us remember that, for example, in Bulgaria the inflation rate had topped 1,000 percent and the economy was in shambles. The introduction of the currency board was the solution which, at unavoidable social costs, brought the Bulgarian economy afloat, with inflation falling steeply and staying close to EU levels for a good couple of years. But the currency board has its limits and constraints. The BNR has constantly opposed the adoption of such a system by Romania given these limits and constraints. Actually, a country adopting the currency board is deprived of monetary policy and thus the central bank becomes a sort of an institute for statistics. Instead of a two-pedal vehicle – monetary and fiscal policies – the economy of currency board countries has only one pedal left, namely the fiscal policy. Assuming the risk of an extended comment, let us look at what happened in the four countries and what happened in Romania in the past few years in a rather unusual international context, with the euro appreciating simultaneously with the increases in farming products and energy prices.  The appreciation of the euro triggered a slide of output competitiveness in the countries having their exchange rate pegged to the euro and the rises in global prices boosted domestic inflation. Currency board countries could change neither the exchange rate, nor the interest rates which are linked to euro area levels, currently standing at 4.25 percent a year. Therefore, with inflation running at 16-20 percent in the Baltic States, interest rates became strongly negative in real terms and the monetary policy procyclical, boosting consumption, while the fixed exchange rate has discouraged production. Basically, the main weakness of the currency board, namely the inability to respond to exogenous adverse factors, pushed the economies of those countries towards a hard landing.  Let's look now at the picture in Romania. Our exchange rate regime, featuring a flexible exchange rate in a managed floating system, allowed the market to correct the overappreciation the leu had registered at a certain point via its own mechanisms, and the BNR was able to raise interest rates – which it did seven times already over the past 10 months – in order to permanently keep them in real-positive territory and curb inflation which had been triggered by the same external factors that affected the countries you have mentioned before. The BNR has even moved forward in order to slow down consumption and maintain a healthy portfolio for commercial banks via the recent prudential measures BIS Review 113/2008 1 
regarding loans to households. All these have significantly contained the risk of a hard landing for the Romanian economy, even if such a risk still lingers as long as the gap between the current account deficit and its financing via FDI remains significant.  Nevertheless, the foreign analysts that included Romania in the group of the five countries exposed to a hard landing had substantiated their opinion. Are they completely wrong?  Let us make an assessment. One of the reasons they brought forward was that Romania's fiscal policy is procyclical. Well, although we are in an election year, we have reasons to believe that the 2008 budget deficit will stay below 3 percent. Moreover, the central bank has additionally tightened its monetary policy in order to offset the insufficient restrictiveness of the fiscal policy.  Another reason is that income policy is much too expansionary, and this too is our concern here at the BNR. We have sent repeated warnings in this respect, the more so as a possible offsetting via further tightening of the monetary policy could not only prove ineffective, but also counterproductive, both leading to a deterioration of external competitiveness. Re-establishing a long-term balance between income growth and productivity dynamics is therefore a must.  Finally, I saw in some papers that Romania would be downgraded because of its external liquidity position. This indicator is computed as a ratio between the country's international reserves and its overall foreign debt, both public and private, in the short-run. We have a sub-par ratio in Romania, as short-term external debt is higher than reserves. I believe this is also an overstatement, as Romania's international reserves are close to the upper limit of the optimal level if we take into account the other indicators, such as the ratio between reserves and imports. The short-term external debt is high indeed, but the bulk of it belongs to the private sector. And out of this, loans taken by foreign-based banks operating in Romania from their parent undertakings abroad account for the largest share. We have started to address this issue by taking measures aimed at discouraging foreign currency-denominated loans. If that risk materialised and parent banks diminished their flows to Romania, the effect would be rather beneficial as it would remove the base for an unsustainable expansion of foreign currency-denominated credit which has been a headache for so many years.  Therefore, I do not consider these arguments that solid to place Romania in a group of countries with high likelihood of witnessing hard landing.  Do you think, therefore, that high economic growth in Romania will go on?  I believe that Romania will see further economic growth in the coming years. A growth much closer to the potential which our experts had estimated at around 6 percent annually. It is true that, with weakening economic activity worldwide, especially in the EU which is our main trade partner, economic growth might be a bit slower than 6 percent. No doubt that economic growth will be affected by several factors next year, placing it over or below 6 percent: the oil price, the farming year, heightened efforts to develop the infrastructure and also to create conditions to boost labour productivity, the level of foreign investments, and so on. In any case, a 6 percent annual economic growth in the present context is a remarkable achievement. That would not prevent some analysts from saying that, if GDP growth slows to 6 from 9 percent, the growth rate plunged by 33 percent.  An 8-9 percent growth means overheating? What is your opinion?  I have never ventured to say that one figure alone would mean the economy is overheated. I usually present things in a more nuanced manner, just like they are in reality. What does 2 BIS Review 113/2008 
overheating actually mean? A development that substantially exceeds the growth potential, leading to an overheating of output factors, especially to a chronic lack of labour force and a fast increase of wages and prices. For this year, I believe we need a sectoral approach. On the one hand, we have a significant rise in farming output due mainly to natural factors. And there is no overheating there. On the contrary, prices of most agricultural products are falling and production factors – especially land, but also labour force – are obviously under-exploited. Romania's great farming potential has yet to be turned to account. On the other hand, in construction, another major contributor to this year's growth, there are visible signs of overheating: scarce labour force, substantial increases of prices for building materials, higher wages, etc. Of course, a wise policy should stimulate only the sectors where the potential is not fully exploited (such as agriculture) or where we have bottlenecks, as it is the case of road infrastructure in Romania.  However, there are numerous opinions according to which rating agencies could downgrade Romania. Which would be the main risk factors that could lead to a downgrade?  So far, rating agencies have only changed the outlook, not the rating. To answer your question – although I do not believe that Romania will be downgraded to below "investment grade" – the main risk factor remains the current account deficit. We have implemented tight monetary policies to tackle this issue. I believe that at the end of this year we will see a containment of this indicator to its 2007 figure of 14 percent of GDP as compared to some analysts' expectations of 15-16 percent. This is a positive thing for a start but we should not stop here. Romania needs policies that would allow a gradual and predictable reduction of the current account deficit to levels almost entirely covered by direct capital investments to regain confidence of the rating agencies and ensure an improvement of external creditworthiness. We will be thus forced to implement a gradual correction of this deficit, even by a few percentage points in the next two to three years, and it is desirable that this happens in the context of sustainable economic growth, close to the potential, while consolidating disinflation which will resume this autumn after a few quarters of considerable efforts. In this respect, the BNR opinion has been repeatedly expressed in public, namely that such a correction can only be made via a balanced mix of monetary, fiscal and income policies, coupled with faster structural reforms that would lead to higher productivity.  What would be the effects of a downgrade for Romania?  Let me stress this again, I do not believe in a downgrade. As I have already mentioned, we may see a change in the outlook. If there is a downgrade, its consequences would be rather serious. It would primarily be reflected by the marked increase in external financing costs, but also by deterring FDIs, which would limit the country's rapid growth potential.  Why do you think rating agencies are more cautious about Romania than about other countries?  It may be because of an insufficient clarity regarding the real economic and financial situation of Romania, which may derive also from the inconsistent signals that sometimes come from inside the country.  Thank you very much, Mr. Governor.  BIS Review 113/2008 3 
Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Strengthening our fight against money laundering & terrorist financing Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas), at the closing ceremonies of the EU-RP Anti-Money Laundering Project-Philippines, Central Bank of the Philippines, Manila, 12 September 2008. *      *      * Ambassador Alistair MacDonald; Congressman Jaime Lopez; Anti-Money Laundering Council Members – SEC Chairman Fe Barin and Insurance Commissioner Eduardo Malinis; Honorable Members of the Monetary Board and the Judiciary, Honorable Members of the European Commission, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Representatives from our multilateral partners including the IMF/ World Bank and the ADB, Dr. Ferdinando Buffoni, fellow workers in government, special guests, good morning.  Today, we celebrate a significant milestone: the successful completion of the joint program of the Philippine Government and the European Commission in strengthening our capacity to fight money laundering.  Two years, ten months and six days ago, we launched the “Training the Trainers Program.” I am pleased to announce that the evaluation indicated that this program accomplished its objectives of strengthening the institutional capacity of agencies and institutions involved in the implementation of AML/CFT strategies and of raising the awareness of the Philippine civil society on AML/CFT issues.  My understanding is that the participants took full advantage of this training program and lived up to its challenges. Altogether, we have 20 successful trainers from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Insurance Commission, the Anti-Money Laundering Council Secretariat, the Philippine National Police, the Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Court.  May I request all the participants to the “Training the Trainers Program” to stand up and be recognized. Ladies and gentlemen, let us give them a well-deserved round of applause!  Congratulations program participants! You have completed the first step. The next challenge is to use the training skills you have acquired in sharing the knowledge you have gained with the stakeholders tasked to implement AML/CFT measures. The objective is to empower them to fully respond to evolving challenges in our fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.  I am also impressed by the stronger cooperation that has taken root among the agencies of government represented in the program: from the supervisory authorities to the judicial and law enforcement agencies.  For us at the Anti-Money Laundering Council, training and educational programs are important initiatives under the Philippines’ AML/CFT regime. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001, as amended, mandates the AMLC to develop educational programs on the harmful effects of money laundering, the methods and techniques used in money laundering, the viable means of preventing money laundering and the effective ways of prosecuting and punishing offenders.  Ladies and gentlemen. The Philippines has been making big strides in having a robust legal AML/CFT framework. Following the enactment by our legislators of the Anti Money Laundering Act, we have:  • criminalized money laundering  BIS Review 113/2008 1 
• created the Anti-Money Laundering Council as the Philippines’ Financial Intelligence Unit  • established the mandatory obligations for covered institutions relative to the requirements on customer due diligence, record keeping, and the reporting of covered and suspicious transactions  • enforced mutual legal assistance and cooperation; and finally,  • instituted a civil forfeiture system  In addition, the Supervising Authorities have issued circulars and guidelines to covered institutions regarding correspondent banking, politically exposed persons, wire transfers, alternative remittance systems, as well as cross border transportation of currency, and UN Security Council resolutions on designated terrorist individuals and organizations.  As of today, we have one successful money laundering conviction and 37 money laundering cases pending before the Regional Trial Courts, the Ombudsman, and the Department of Justice. And there are other charges we are preparing to file in our courts.  However, we do face new challenges from globalization and the internationalization of money laundering and terrorist financing techniques.  In addition, new and evolving technologies and financial systems are being used by money launderers to weave a complex trail that is difficult to find and unravel.  As money launderers continue to refine their techniques and find new avenues for their illicit operations, so must we work together to fortify our defenses to prevent or stop them. Otherwise, we risk having a threat to the reputation and viability of our financial system.  It is in this context that we have been proactive in the Philippines. The Anti Money Laundering Council, which I chair, has taken important initiatives to broaden the Philippines’ AML/CFT strategy, to intensify its position as a partner of the global community in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, and to align our AML/CFT regime with the international standards of the FATF.  On the other hand, as the international watchdog on AML/CFT issues, the Financial Action Task Force, has issued the FATF 40 + 9 Recommendations and continuously monitors AML/CFT compliance by its member countries through peer reviews and assessments.  Accordingly, the Anti Money Laundering Council submitted for consideration of the Congressional Oversight Committee – which Representative Jaime Lopez co-chairs – proposed amendments to the AMLA in line with the Revised FATF 40 recommendations and 9 Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. These amendments, intended to give more teeth to the Anti Money Laundering legislation, are as follows: • the addition of more predicate crimes such as trafficking in persons, bribery, counterfeiting, frauds and other illegal exactions, malversation, forgery, environmental crimes and terrorism and its financing;  • the inclusion of an appropriate regime for designated non-financial businesses and professionals, such as casinos, real estate agents, dealers in precious metals and stones, lawyers, and accountants;  • provision for a system of incentives and rewards; and  • retention by the AMLC of a percentage of civilly forfeited funds.  I am pleased to report that our House of Representatives is similarly proactive in terms of strengthening our fight against money laundering. There are now two pending bills on proposed AMLA amendments: • House Bill 3053 sponsored by Representative Rufus Rodriguez; and  2 BIS Review 113/2008 
• House Bill 4784 sponsored by Speaker Prospero Nograles and Representative Jaime Lopez, who is the Chairman of the Committee on Banks and Financial intermediaries and the Co-Chairman of the Congressional oversight Committee on anti-money laundering.  Ladies and gentlemen. Another important event in our fight against money laundering is going to take place in a few days. From September 22 to October 6, 2008, the Philippines’ AML/CFT regime will be assessed by the World Bank and the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). When the assessment is finalized, we will know how we rate in terms of implementing our AML/CFT regime.  In preparation for this, the AMLC has been conducting meetings and consultations with relevant government agencies and financial institutions to ensure that the Assessment Team is provided with necessary information for its on-site mission. The completion of our program on “Training the Trainors” therefore comes at a most opportune time. Implemented with technical assistance provided by the European Commission, this program underscores the trust and confidence of our European allies in our country as a capable, reliable, and enduring partner in the increasingly challenging war against crimes and its financing. Of course, declaring war against money laundering and terrorist financing is only the beginning. To win this war, we must be united, committed, focused, and vigilant.  We are fighting for security, peace, and stability of our nations, the safety of our people, and the future of our children. The stakes are simply too high; losing is definitely not an option. This is the one big fight we should invest in to win.  On behalf of my colleagues at the Anti Money Laundering Council therefore, I thank the European Commission represented by Ambassador MacDonald (let us give them a big hand) for their valuable support.  And once again, let us congratulate all the participants to the “Training for Trainors Program” for their commitment to broaden the network of people fighting money laundering and terrorist financing in our country.  Together, let us continue to broaden support and fortify our position in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Thank you all and good day. Maraming salamat and Mabuhay!

Axel A Weber: Current developments in the financial system Welcoming remarks by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the 5th Bundesbank Lecture, Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin, 16 September 2008.  *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen I am very pleased to welcome you to this year’s Bundesbank Lecture at this beautiful location here in the very heart of Berlin. I am particularly grateful that Mr Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy, will be our speaker today. Mario, my special welcome to you and thanks a lot for not hesitating one moment to accept our invitation to be the lecturer at our event. It is an honour to have you here.  Let me briefly say a few words regarding both this event and our speaker for today. On the event: The Bundesbank Lecture Series aims to achieve two things. First, we intend to provide a high-level forum for public debate on economic and monetary policy issues. Second, we want to raise the Bundesbank’s profile in the German capital. With today’s gathering, our Lecture Series, which started in 2004, is celebrating its fifth anniversary. Alan Greenspan, Jean-Claude Trichet, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, and Ben Bernanke have shared their thoughts with us at previous lectures.  We are proud to have Mario Draghi as speaker. The title of his speech will be “Restoring stability in the financial system”. He is a distinguished expert on financial stability issues. As the current chairman of the Financial Stability Forum he is in a focal position to discuss necessary measures to restore financial stability. Obviously, the topic of his speech could not be more topical given the current developments on financial markets. The financial market crisis – alongside rising inflationary pressures – has been the dominant topic for more than a year now. One does not have to be a prophet to forecast that it is likely to stay with us in the months ahead, too.  Of course, I do not want to anticipate Mario’s remarks, but let me say some words on the current developments.  The filing of chapter 11 bankruptcy petition by Lehman Brothers Holdings inc. and the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America has certainly further increased uncertainty and risk aversion on financial markets. We observe flight to quality behaviour by investors and rising spreads on credit markets. This had to be expected. All in all, however, market participants have not overreacted and remained cool-headed. This is a positive sign.  Central banks, including the Eurosystem, have reacted decisively to the situation with liquidity provisions and other measures. German banks do not report liquidity problems.  The German financial system is stable and over the past years its resilience against adverse shocks has markedly improved. Moreover, the universal banking model – a characteristic feature of the German financial system – has proven its robustness and stability.  These structural achievements will help to cushion current tensions due to higher perceived counterparty risk and a necessary unwinding of positions on the market for credit risk transfer – both unavoidable outcomes in the face of an insolvency of one of the major market participants.  The financial turbulence has created the most challenging situations for financial intermediaries, for central banks, for supervisory agencies, and for regulatory bodies in decades. And since the causes of the crisis are deeply rooted, a comprehensive coordinated response at the international level is evidently warranted.  BIS Review 112/2008 1 
In this context, the Financial Stability Forum – the FSF – in particular is playing a crucial role in the process of mitigating the ongoing difficulties and making the financial system more resilient to future shocks. The FSF was established in 1999, following a report by the then Bundesbank President, Hans Tietmeyer.  The FSF brings together senior representatives of national financial authorities (for example, central banks, supervisory authorities and treasury departments), international financial institutions (such as the IMF or the BIS), international regulatory and supervisory groupings (for example, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, International Accounting Standard Board), committees of central bank experts (such as the Committee on the Global Financial System) and the European Central Bank. The FSF’s mandate is to assess vulnerabilities affecting the international financial system, to identify and oversee action needed to address these, and to improve coordination and information exchange among the various authorities responsible for financial stability.  In doing so, the FSF aims to promote international financial stability, improve the functioning of financial markets, and reduce the tendency for financial shocks to spread from country to country, thus destabilising the world economy. The FSF seeks to give momentum to a broad-based multilateral agenda for strengthening financial systems and the stability of international financial markets. The necessary changes are enacted by the relevant national and international financial authorities. In a nutshell, the FSF acts as a central hub for all the issues that are relevant from a global financial stability perspective.  On the speaker: Mario Draghi, Governor of the Banca d’Italia, has been chairing the FSF in a personal capacity since April 2006. This position – together with the economic and international expertise he has gained during his career – makes him an excellent speaker in current times, given the backdrop of the financial market turbulence.  Mario Draghi graduated from the University of Rome, received his Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and subsequently served as professor of economics at the University of Florence from 1981 to 1991. Prior to taking the helm at the Banca d’Italia, he was vice-chairman and managing director of Goldman Sachs and a member of the firm-wide management committee (2002-2005). He was director general of the Italian Treasury (1991-2001), chairman of the European Economic and Financial Committee, a member of the G7 Deputies, and chairman of OECD Working Party 3. Finally, from 1984 to 1990, he was an executive director of the World Bank.  A few weeks ago, during the annual central bankers’ meeting in Jackson Hole, Mario delivered a speech entitled “The current crisis and beyond”. In his speech, he pointed out three elements that mark the cornerstones of the work plan of the FSF for the month ahead. More precisely, he talked about the need to look more closely at the incentives for appropriate risk control frameworks, efforts to improve the resilience of the financial system to shocks frameworks for dampening the cyclicality of risk-taking. Not only was it a pleasure to listen to him, I also fully endorse the proposals he made.  The title of his speech today is “Restoring Stability in the Financial System”, a topic that is evidently highly relevant and of interest to all of us. Mario, I am looking forward to your insights during the fifth Bundesbank Lecture. The floor is yours. 2 BIS Review 112/2008 
Amando M Tetangco, Jr: The Philippines – addressing the challenges. Staying the course Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas), at the Philippine Economic Briefing, Makati City, 17 September 2008. *      *      * Good morning. Thank you for joining us in this mid-year economic briefing.  I am pleased to speak before you on the developments in the monetary, external and banking sectors. After providing you with an overview of recent economic developments, I will discuss the outlook for the next two years which takes into account the challenges that our economy is facing. Then, I will walk you through how the BSP has responded to these challenges. I will close with the BSP’s policy thrusts going forward. Let me start with the latest price developments.  Inflation averaged 8.8 percent for the first 8 months of the year, rising to 12.5 percent in August from 4.9 percent in January 2008. Core inflation, which measures the underlying trend in inflation by excluding specific food and energy prices, climbed to 7.0 percent year-on-year in August, from 3.4 percent in January.  Price pressures have been building up since early this year. Initially the price increases were due to supply-side factors, specifically from elevated international oil and non-oil commodity prices. However, second round price pressures subsequently became apparent, as evident in the rise in core inflation and the adjustments in the pricing of services as well as wages. These have resulted in a more challenging inflation environment.  Meanwhile, the country’s external payments profile remains a major source of strength for the economy. The BOP remained in surplus for the first eight months of 2008 at US$2.0 billion. Remittances from overseas Filipinos continued to boost the BOP, reaching US$9.6 billion for the first seven months of 2008, higher by 18.2 percent relative to the year-ago level.  The sustained BOP surplus resulted in the continued build-up of the country’s gross international reserves (GIR), which stood at US$36.7 billion as of end-August 2008. At this level, the GIR is equivalent to 6.0 months’ worth of import cover, 2.9 times the country’s short-term external debt based on residual maturity. The strong external position has allowed both the public and private sectors to prepay some of their FX obligations, resulting in further improvements in the country’s external debt ratio. As of end March 2008, the external debt ratio stood at 35.6 percent, less than half its level in 2001 of 72.9 percent.  The peso has weakened in recent months. On a year-to-date basis, the peso depreciated against the US dollar by 12.3 percent as it closed at P47.09/US$1 on 15 September 2008. This is on account of rising risk aversion due to worries over global economic slowdown and credit tightening. Concerns over rising inflation further added pressure against the peso. For the period 2001-2008 (to-date), the peso appreciated by 9.1 percent, generally in tandem with most currencies in the region. The Philippine peso has been generally competitive against our major trading partners and competitors in real terms. If we take 2001-2002 as the comparator period given both good GDP and inflation numbers, coupled with the manageable external payments position, the end points remain broadly on the same level. BIS Review 112/2008 1 
On the financial sector, the banking system remains generally sound and stable. The banking system’s asset base has been expanding steadily. The continued asset clean-up of banks, accomplished without the use of public funds, has enhanced asset quality, bringing the NPL ratio closer to the pre-Asian crisis level of around 4.0 percent. Banks remained capitalized at levels above both the BSP-regulatory requirement and the BIS standard.  Owing to reforms earlier instituted, the Philippine banking system has not been significantly affected by the financial stresses experienced from the US subprime mortgage market. Furthermore, the Philippine domestic banks’ exposure to structured products, such as CLNs and CDOs, issued by investment houses like Lehman Brothers has been limited and are well cushioned by banks’ capital base. However, we continue to closely monitor developments in the global financial markets, including further risk aversion against emerging markets including the Philippines, as these may adversely impact the growth of the banking sector.  Where are we heading? The inflation path is expected to be hump-shaped, with the peak around Sept/Oct this year, after which we expect a gradual leveling off. We expect to see the single-digit level again by late Q1/early Q2 next year. Nevertheless, the forecasts still indicate that inflation could exceed the 2008 and 2009 targets. The BOP surplus by end 2008 is estimated at around US$2.0 billion. This would result in a GIR level of US$37 billion by the end of 2008. What are the challenges that we face as we try to achieve these projections? The Philippines – like many emerging countries – is faced with the challenge of rising inflation and slower economic growth. The slowdown in US and global growth could result in a deceleration of Philippine export growth and a decline in foreign investments. While global commodity prices have started to show some easing, world oil prices are expected to remain volatile due to low global production capacity and rising demand in emerging economies. Non-oil commodity prices may take longer to unwind because of strong demand from growing consumption of emerging countries and as inputs for biofuel production. The risk of high inflation remains present. Meanwhile, the strains in global financial markets continue to persist and have heightened risk aversion. While emerging markets, including the Philippines, have been fairly resilient to the global credit turmoil, they could face greater risks because of higher borrowing costs and reversals in capital flows How has the BSP addressed these? Consistent with our primary mandate, we have responded through policies appropriately aimed at sustaining price stability. We believe this is essential in ensuring sustained long-term economic growth. As I mentioned earlier, the BSP noted that the spikes in prices in early 2008 were supply-side in origin. These had mainly global roots and were expected to be largely transitory. As is well accepted, such supply-side shocks are best addressed by non-monetary measures. Acknowledging that the impact of monetary policy under that scenario would be limited, the BSP followed a prudent approach by accommodating these first-round effects. In other words, BSP treated the resulting rise in prices as a shift in relative prices, and allowed it to go through. Thus, BSP kept its policy settings steady during our March and April meetings. Subsequently, however, we noted changes in the inflation dynamics. First, inflation expectations were rising. More specifically, consumer and business expectations surveys began to show more respondents expecting headline inflation to go up in the coming months. BSP’s survey of private sector economists/analysts showed higher inflation forecasts for both 2008 and 2009. Moreover, the term spreads on secondary market yields for government securities were on the rise, reflecting market sentiment for a continued rise in the future.  Second, real interest rates continued to be in negative territory. This would pose some complications to making decisions on savings, investment and production, which over time could weigh down on capital flows, exchange rate and ultimately, inflation. 2 BIS Review 112/2008 
Given the new information, the BSP responded with a combination of policy rate hikes and careful communication of BSP’s inflation-fighting resolve. During its policy meetings in June, July and August, the BSP gradually raised its policy rates from 5 percent to 6 percent. The cumulative 100 basis points hike was a recognition that it was necessary to act promptly and preemptively to: 1) address price pressures that were coming more evidently from second-round effects; 2) guide inflationary expectations, to arrest self-perpetration into higher actual inflation; and 3) rein in inflation and allow it to fall within the target range over the policy horizon.  Latest indicators show that inflation is losing speed but risks remain. Global commodity prices are now starting to show some easing. However, we still need to remain cautious given the inherent volatility in commodity prices. The BSP remains confident that its current monetary policy stance could be accommodated by resilient demand conditions. The buoyancy of domestic demand suggests room for measured interest rate action without causing serious effects on the real sector. Meanwhile, we have continued to institute reforms to further strengthen the banking system and deepen the domestic capital market. These reforms are focused on further enhancing the regulatory framework through the continued implementation of the BASEL II framework; accelerating the implementation of risk-based supervision; improving corporate governance, including by promoting compliance with international accounting and financial reporting standards; continuing to promote microfinance lending to improve small businesses’ access to credit; and supporting the deepening of the domestic capital market. What can you expect from the BSP going forward? The policy thrusts of the BSP are aimed at ensuring that the headway that we have achieved in nurturing a resilient economy and a sound banking sector will continue even in the face of the challenges we all face. First, monetary policy will continue to be sufficiently cautious and vigilant to the emerging balance of risks. It will continually reassess the evolving situation as price pressures show initial signs of slowing down and as demand conditions moderate. This will ensure a responsive conduct of appropriate monetary policy. In the external sector, our policies will continue to be directed at maintaining a market-determined exchange rate with scope for occasional official action to address sharp volatilities in the exchange rate; maintaining a comfortable level of reserves as self-insurance; and ensuring the sustainability of our external debt. These policies will continue to promote strong fundamentals that will help reduce the economy’s vulnerability against global economic risks and support the needs of a more dynamic and globally integrated economy. In the financial sector, we remain firmly committed to sustain key reforms that will lead to greater efficiency, effective risk management, stronger capital base and improved corporate governance standards in the banking system. These financial and banking sector reforms will continue to raise savings and help boost financing for productive activities.  In summary, let me assure you that the BSP is prepared to take all necessary action to address the threat of high inflation and promote price stability. We stress here that high inflation erodes the community’s purchasing power, reduces their consumption expenditure and slows down economic growth. We are therefore mindful of the impact of our monetary policy action on the economy’s growth momentum. The resiliency of our economy allows us to have greater flexibility in responding to the challenges that come our way.  Thank you very much. BIS Review 112/2008 3 
Paul Tucker: Money and credit, twelve months on Speech by Mr Paul Tucker, Executive Director and Member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, at the Money, Macro and Finance Research Group 40th Annual Conference, Birkbeck College, London, 12 September 2008. *      *      * As many people have said, this is a challenging time for policymakers. But the real challenge is for households and firms in the real world who are having to navigate the fallout from the extraordinary combination of financial and commodity shocks rippling through the world economy. Our job as policymakers is to make that process as smooth as it can be over the medium term. And having our eye on the medium term means we must ensure that the gains of the past ten-to-fifteen years in stabilising inflation are not frittered away. In confronting that task, policymakers are having both to make big picture judgments about the balance of forces buffeting the UK economy; and to apply areas of economic theory that stretch the frontiers of existing research. So, in joining your research conference this morning, I want to sketch, broadly, what the current conjuncture suggests, from the policymaker’s perspective, should feature in the future research agenda of monetary economists.  The current conjuncture, and policy By way of establishing the context, I will begin with the Bank of England’s most recent economic forecast. In August, the Monetary Policy Committee published our latest projections for output growth and inflation. On the then profile of market interest rates, the Committee as a whole1 judged that, most likely, output growth would slow quite sharply during the current year and would be anaemic for a period thereafter. Crucially, the balance of risks to that most likely (or modal) outlook was judged to be on the downside. In other words, the mean forecast for output was somewhat weaker still. For inflation, meanwhile, the most likely outlook was that, after an uncomfortably high and protracted spike, it would fall back to a little below the 2% target by the end of two years, and would continue to drift down thereafter. In other words, the crucial judgment was that the accumulation and persistence of slack in the economy would most likely be enough to avoid inflation getting out of control.  That was the part of the August projections that captured the attention of the markets and commentators.  But, collectively, we also concluded that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook was to the upside, so that the mean for inflation was actually above the 2% target at around two years or so. That’s not without significance given that most analytical models suggest that policymakers should set policy in the light of the mean, not the mode – although a better description of the MPC’s approach would be to say that we take account of the nature of the entire distribution of risks.2                                                   1   See Tucker, PMWT, 2008 “Making monetary policy by Committee” Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin 2008 Q3 (forthcoming) for some thoughts on the relatively collective nature of the MPC’s forecasts given its one person, one vote decisions on Bank Rate. 2  I have to say that the textbook stress on the mean (or expected value) might be somewhat overdone in some circumstances, in particular where the mean is materially influenced by certain types of low probability/high impact risks. I hope the following will illustrate that. Imagine, not in the current context, that there is a risk of a dollar collapse against the euro, the currency of the UK’s largest trading partner, but without a similar risk of sterling collapsing. Say the probability is judged to be low, but the impact large; so that, in the probability-weighted way, it is enough to shift the mean outlook for future inflation. If (if) the risk crystallised, BIS Review 112/2008 1 
Now, putting this together, the following inference can be drawn; and I hope that I shall be excused if I plod through this in slow motion. Focusing on a roughly two-year horizon, if inflation was most likely to be below target in the context of the August modal forecast for output, then it would be even further below target if the MPC’s view in August of the downside risks to growth were to materialise (ie consistent with the mean path for output but no further adverse shock to costs). But, in fact, the mean path for inflation was above target at around two years. That underlines the hefty upside risk to inflation that featured in the Committee’s August projections.  Indeed, we cannot be remotely complacent about the risks in either direction. This is a delicate balance, and one that is developing from month to month. It is a convenient but in some ways misleading shorthand to characterise the Committee as currently balancing a growth risk against an inflation risk. Given our mandate – and, indeed, given how the economy works – that is better thought of as our having to balance the downside risks to inflation over the medium-term against the upside risks to inflation over the medium-term. So, perhaps contrary to some recent commentary, the MPC remains as focused on medium-term inflation as ever. No shift in the underlying reaction function. No shift in the aversion to inflation (or to deflation). But, of course, the current environment is highly unusual and our reaction function cannot be written down as a fully specified state-contingent rule; and so everyone is discovering that we truly are committed to low inflation in the medium term.  The mandate is expressed in terms of stable low inflation because that is what central banks can deliver over the medium term, and because nominal stability is a precondition for sustainable growth. There is not a comfortable medium-term trade off between growth and inflation. Inflation is just the opposite of a free lunch. If in the interests of sustaining growth in the short run, we were to risk letting inflation become established at higher levels, things could easily get out of control as higher medium-term inflation expectations would become embedded. We would then find it much harder to bring inflation back to target, and could well end up having to generate a serious recession to put the genie back in the bottle. The experience of the thirty years before the current regime demonstrated the economic and social costs – to households, livelihoods and businesses – of what that entails. The MPC’s inflation targeting mandate is the expression of those lessons that – tragically for millions of people, given the chances of getting stuck in unemployment – UK policymakers had to learn. We’re not about to give up on the mandate. Success in anchoring inflation expectations in line with the target will give us more scope over time to cushion the economy from the adverse shocks to growth – which of course we would want to do when we can, consistent with medium-term stability.  What does, of course, shift as the months pass is our assessment, as nine individuals, of the balance of risks to inflation, given changes in the economic environment. And quite a lot has happened since our August forecast.  In the six weeks or so since the Committee’s August report was finalised, the signs of weakening in the UK’s major trading partner, the euro area, have intensified. Growth appears to be slowing in parts of Asia too. And in the US, the housing market has not yet obviously stabilised, which is probably a precondition for broader recovery there. Domestically, the output data have been on the soft side, moving into line with the battery of surveys and the Bank’s regional Agents. The labour market also appears to have softened, with unemployment rising and fewer vacancies advertised. It is perhaps not surprising that, compared with recent slowdowns, there should be less hoarding of labour if firms expect the adverse environment to persist for a while; and with tighter credit conditions, stretching                                                                                                                                                       the export-oriented euro area would be adversely affected, and the UK with it. But, seriously, should the UK cut the policy rate to head off the risk of a dent to output from a dollar collapse that hadn’t yet occurred? I don’t think so. 2 BIS Review 112/2008 
working capital, making it harder for firms to finance the retention of a less-than-fully-occupied labour force. In the manufacturing sector, input and output price inflation have edged down very slightly. In the service sector, the data are less timely, though surveys have started to indicate some slowing in the pace of inflation. Commodity prices – not only energy, but food too – have continued to fall, perhaps reflecting the effects on global demand of the earlier price rises and the reduction of subsidies by a raft of emerging-market countries. Equities have fallen around 3%. But sterling’s exchange rate has fallen – by around 4% since the MPC’s August meeting; and by about 15% since the beginning of 2007, so that, in sterling terms, the fall in oil prices has been less pronounced over the past month or so.  On balance, those developments mostly comprise downside news, since the August Inflation Report, to the outlook for demand and for inflation. But the recent depreciation of the exchange rate has to be offset against that. And headline inflation has reached 4.4%. It will probably rise further. The Committee can and will ensure that this is a temporary state of affairs. But, for the moment, inflation expectations do continue to flash an amber light. Meanwhile, credit has remained tight, and underlying money growth has decelerated, implying that monetary conditions may be leaning against those incipient inflationary pressures. At the end of the last year – some months’ after the onset of the market turmoil – I set out some of the thinking that guided my interpretation of the monetary data and how it related to my policy decisions.3 I stressed that “we must try to avoid a vicious circle in which tighter liquidity conditions, lower asset values, impaired capital resources, reduced credit supply, and slower aggregate demand feed back on each other”. A vicious circle between the world financial system and global economy has so far probably been kept at bay; global growth has slowed not collapsed. But there is no denying an adverse feedback loop between tightening credit conditions, the macro slowdown, and the perception that that will in time impair banks’ asset portfolios. So it seems timely to revisit some of the issues of “money and credit”. The Taylor-rule framework for thinking about policy  It is well over a decade since John Taylor set out what has become part of the current orthodoxy of monetary economics. His rule looks something like this: it = Πt +r*t+ a(Πt – Π*t ) +b(yt-y*t ) This is, at its roots, a Wicksellian view of the world.4 By fixing the short-run nominal rate, the central bank can, given stickiness in prices over the short run, shift the short real interest rate – both in absolute terms and, more particularly, relative to the short-run real rate that would equilibriate demand and supply.5 So that gap between the short real rate and its “equilibrium” can be thought of as representing the stance of monetary policy, which should be chosen by the central bank in the light of the extent to which inflation deviates from target, and to which aggregate demand deviates from the supply capacity of the economy. Implicit in this rule is                                                  3  See Tucker, PMWT (2008) “ Money and credit: banking and the macroeconomy”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 2008 Q1 pp 96-106. 4  See Wicksell, K, 1898, “Interest rates and Prices”. 5  Typically, policymakers think about that in terms of the “output gap”, reflecting firms’ capacity utilisation and slack/pressure in the labour market. By contrast, in the academic literature – notably Michael Woodford’s Interest and Prices – the benchmark is to set monetary policy in order to offset the frictions in the economy, so as to obtain the conditions that would prevail if prices, wages etc were fully flexible. Policymakers and academics need to resolve how big the gap is between those two approaches. BIS Review 112/2008 3 
that the textbook policymaker knows how the degree of slack in the real economy acts on future inflation (or the slope of the Phillips curve).  The two forces sweeping through the world economy test the way policymakers typically apply various elements of this set up in more routine circumstances. For example, how do the commodity price rises and, separately, the credit crunch affect the “equilibrium” short-term real rate? Is the actual short real rate still an adequate proxy measure of monetary conditions? Is the “normal” relationship between economic slack and future inflation intact?  The cost shocks, and monetary conditions  Although they have fallen by nearly $50 since the peak reached in July, oil prices are still up more than 200% since the middle of 2003; and, indeed, around 3% since the beginning of this year. As oil is a key input to production, this acts like a negative supply shock for the Western economies: it costs firms more to produce the same level of output than before the run up in oil prices. And, like a tax, it acts to redistribute spending power from energy consumers to energy producers. In those circumstances, real-take home pay has to grow more slowly for a while in order to avoid the capital stock shrinking as firms sought to maintain the internationally-determined required rate of return. The role of monetary policy is to facilitate that process, recognising the potential redundancy of some capital resources given higher energy prices, and the upward pressure on real interest rates as households seek to borrow to tide them over the tough times. In other words, in the now standard set up, taking the cost shock on its own, the equilibrating short-term real rate (r star) has risen and the economy’s potential supply (y star) has probably fallen. So, ignoring other developments, policy would have to be tighter than otherwise, even if the direct effects of the cost rise on the price level were accommodated. But, of course, other things have been going on, and it is the net effect for our policy rate that matters. And that involves making a judgment about the tightness of credit conditions. The credit shock and monetary conditions In conducting policy, commentators usually take the short-run nominal interest rate, Bank Rate, as a summary measure of monetary conditions. If Bank Rate is increased, monetary conditions are being tightened; and conditions are being loosened if Bank Rate is cut. There are a few important simplifying assumptions being made here – assumptions whose validity in current circumstances is doubtful.  In the first place, that view of the world implicitly assumes that the equilibrium real rate is stable over time, whereas in fact it will move about.6 Sometimes the central bank will need to change its policy rate simply in order to maintain unchanged monetary conditions (as proxied in the literature by r minus r star). In the same vein, if near-term inflation expectations rise or fall, our nominal policy rate may need to change just to leave the actual short real rate unchanged. In other words, we can fix only one thing – the short nominal rate – but what any particular level of Bank Rate means for monetary conditions will depend on short-run inflation expectations and on the equilibrium real rate needed to balance the economy. Both will likely have changed materially in the face of the cost and credit shocks. What our Bank Rate will mean for monetary conditions will depend on how it relates to the panoply of other interest rates on financial contracts. In fully efficient markets, the risk-free                                                  6  See Neiss, K and Nelson, E (2001) “The real interest rate as an inflation indicator”, Bank of England Working Paper No 130. 4 BIS Review 112/2008 
rate is a fully satisfactory summary statistic; other rates fall into line through arbitrage, with differences reflecting risk premia. More practically, it can typically be assumed that the rates charged on private sector loans are maintained at fairly stable spreads relative to the risk-free yield curve (ie given the expected path of the policy rate). And, related to that, it can also typically be assumed that the degree of credit rationing in the economy is broadly constant over time. Obviously, neither of those things is true at present.  The most unusual, and stretched, circumstances lie within the global financial system itself. The premium on unsecured interbank lending has risen (Chart 1); and growth of such lending has slowed. This reflects a desire to hoard liquidity in a hazardous environment; and heightened aversion to taking on unsecured credit exposures for term maturities. Banks are, in consequence, deleveraging7 their balance sheets. Broadly, they can do so in two ways – raise extra capital, or shrink (the pace of growth in) their balance sheets. Both have been underway. The balance sheet shrinkage is reducing the supply of credit to households and firms. But there is differentiation across the banking industry, according to size and strength. In that environment, spreads on corporate bonds are higher. Many corporate and household lending rates have been affected by the rise in Libor relative to risk-free rates. And retail rates – for both loans, and some deposits – have risen relative to the relevant risk-free rate. Effective rates on some types of lending are not much changed since last summer, but we have cut Bank Rate by 75bp and the risk-free curve has shifted down (Chart 2). All this is true in the US too, probably more so. That has led John Taylor himself to suggest8 that, to maintain an unchanged policy stance, the policy rate should be reduced by the extent of the widening in spreads. In fact, as I am sure Taylor recognises, it is nowhere near so straightforward – if for no other reason than that, for the real economy, the most severe feature of the credit shock is the rising incidence of quantity rationing.9There appears to be some discrimination between lower-risk and higher-risk borrowers in the household sector. Rates on fixed-rate mortgages have recently been cut for lower loan-to-value borrowers. We have added a question to our current Credit Condition Survey, due out later this month, to gauge conditions in that part of the market. Plainly, conditions have tightened a lot for riskier borrowers – households and firms. That means we need to look at quantity data as well as at the price of credit. For companies, money growth has fallen very sharply. Lending held up for a while, but possibly in part because firms were drawing on committed lines of credit while they were still available on pre-turmoil terms. The Credit Conditions Survey has signalled a clear tightening (Chart 3). To translate this back into a Taylor-rule world, we would need to know the so-called “shadow prices”. Of course we don’t know those unobservable prices. But we can, perhaps, get a broadbrush handle on the materiality of the tightening by using estimated equations for credit (and money) demand, holding all other influences constant.10 There is just huge uncertainty                                                  7  See Tucker, PMWT (2008), “The credit crisis: lessons from a protracted peacetime”, remarks given at the Chatham House conference on “The New Financial Frontiers”. These remarks are also forthcoming in the 2008 Q3 edition of the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin. 8  See Taylor, JB., (2008) “Monetary Policy and the State of the Economy”, testimony before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, February and Mculley, P and Touli, R (2008) “Chasing the Neutral Rate Down: Financial Conditions, Monetary Policy, and the Taylor Rule”, Global Central Bank Focus, PIMCO. 9  Another reason reflected in the Curdia and Woodford (2008) paper is the fact that borrowers and savers have different propensities to consume. Consequently a change in spreads will affect the “average rate” faced by borrowers and savers in a different way from a change in the policy rate. 10  Based, for example, on Brigden, A and Mizen, P (1999) “ Money, credit and investment in the UK corporate sector”, Bank of England Working Paper number 100. BIS Review 112/2008 5 
about such estimates but, for what it’s worth, they indicate a material tightening from this source.  Alternatively, that can be thought of as being equivalent to a fall in the real risk-free rate of interest that would equilibriate supply and demand.11 Taken on its own, this rather leans against the proposition, advanced by a number of commentators, that monetary conditions are loose on the grounds that deducting CPI inflation of between 4 and 5% from a Bank Rate of 5% leaves a “real rate” close to zero. First, as I have been arguing, it is vital to take into account the possibility that the real rate warranted in the current conjuncture has fallen. Second, headline CPI might not be the best deflator for calculating the relevant real rate of interest. CPI may not necessarily be the price – the “own real rate” – relevant for individual households’ and businesses’ spending decisions.12 For example, firms’ investment might be more dependent on the price of capital goods. Despite the pickup in oil prices, the pace of inflation for capital goods has been much lower than for CPI. So that might suggest a correspondingly higher real rate for businesses than one based on CPI (Chart 4). A similar question could be posed about the real rate facing households, given that the CPI currently excludes the costs of owner occupation.  So one can safely conclude that it is not all straightforward at present to calibrate monetary conditions.  For researchers, that underlines the importance of renewing work directed at gauging monetary conditions. A recent paper by Michael Woodford13 concluded that information from money and credit quantities could not add anything to spreads; and, what is more, that they were not as useful as spreads because the quantity effects of a tightening become apparent only with lags. The set up in Woodford’s paper does not, however, involve quantity rationing. When such rationing occurs, data on the quantity of lending and money may be more useful, even with a lag, than the shadow prices that cannot be observed! Of course, I absolutely do not want a reversion to oversimplified Monetary Conditions Indices, which set a trap for policymakers by ignoring the nature of the shocks that shift credit supply and other financial variables. But we do need to have a better quantitive understanding of how the equilibrium real rate (r star) shifts with shocks to the financial parts of the economy.  For UK policymakers, overall, the sharp slowing in corporate and household credit and money growth signals that monetary conditions are quite tight. Tighter bank lending conditions will make it harder for households to maintain their spending during this testing period – when the rise in energy and food prices has squeezed disposable incomes; and when the savings rate was already low. Similarly, with less easy access to credit, it will be harder for firms to bridge to the expected recovery without cutting costs. On the whole, the corporate sector probably entered this episode with stronger balance sheets, leveraged buy-outs aside, than the household sector. But, as the months have passed, firms have been registering a greater sensitivity to tighter financial conditions.  The lags between the incidence of the financial shock last summer and its impact on spending in the economy have been fairly drawn out. It is striking that through the autumn and perhaps even into the spring, a number of commentators thought this was essentially a problem for Wall Street not Main Street. We need more research to help understand those lags, and whether the credit shock has been more potent for its coinciding with the climb in commodity prices.                                                  11  David Miles has recently made a broadly similar point in “The cost of bank debt: rethinking the neutral rate”. 12  I owe this point to Mervyn King. 13  See Curdia V, and Woodford and M (2008), “Credit Frictions and Optimal Monetary Policy”, a paper discussed at the BIS Annual Conference in June 2008. 6 BIS Review 112/2008 
That assessment has informed my view that slack will accumulate, leaning against – but not eliminating – the current upside risks to inflation. Indeed, the best gauge of our view of monetary and credit conditions is to be found in our periodic forecasts for growth and inflation.  Nominal trends  A hazard, given the current paradigm in monetary economics, is that its all too easy for policymakers to fall into the habit of never mentioning anything nominal – apart from inflation expectations. One of the key challenges for monetary researchers is, accordingly, to discover more about what determines inflation expectations. Meanwhile, whatever is incorporated into forecasting models, policymakers cannot sensibly just take it for granted that expectations are anchored, so that inflation will painlessly come back into line with the target whenever it is driven away by temporary cost shocks. What that means right now is that arresting the upside risk to inflation cannot rely entirely on real-economy interactions.  So what diagnostics have we got on nominal trends, right now? On the whole, they are not signalling an imminent resurgence in inflationary psychology. Nominal demand growth has slowed quite sharply (Chart 5). Adjusting for various misleading technicals,14 broad money has decelerated sharply (Chart 6). The rate of growth of so-called Divisia money, a measure of transactions balances, has similarly fallen sharply. And in the labour market, nominal earnings growth has recently been below 3.5%, although the annual wage round lies ahead. Sterling’s exchange rate has fallen, however. That might be consistent with the foreign exchange markets expecting a nominal shock in the future. But there are other possible explanations, notably that a risk premium may have become incorporated to compensate for uncertainty in the outlook.  Had there been a shift in the market’s inflation expectations, the obvious place for that to show up would be in the yields on nominal government bonds. For medium-term maturities, so-called “breakeven inflation rates” – derived from the difference between the yields on conventional and inflation-indexed gilts – have stabilised over the past few months. Given the frictions that many believe distort indexed-linked yields,15 I also like to look directly at nominal forward rates. The underlying thought is that, relative to fluctuations in bond yields brought about by past shifts in inflation regimes, longer-term risk-free real rates may not move around a great deal, so that any systematic inflationary impulse would be quite likely to show up in nominal yields. Consistent with that, following the UK’s disinflation in the early-1990s, medium-term nominal forward rates fell by around 400bp. Since the new monetary regime became established in the late 1990s, they have been more or less stable, and currently remain within the range prevailing over the past decade or so.  Surveys of household inflation expectations tell a broadly consistent story. For near-term horizons, they have picked up sharply. What limited information we have on the public’s                                                  14  Broad money (M4) can be adjusted using Bank estimates of banks' intragroup business with other financial corporations, as well as banks' repo activity with LCH.Clearnet's RepoClear service. Such estimates are based on anecdotal information provided by a small sample of banks. Work is under way within the Bank to improve the basis of these estimates, see Burgess, S and Janssen, N (2007), “Proposals to modify the measurement of broad money in the United Kingdom: a user consultation”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, vol. 47, no. 3, pages 402-14. 15  Of course, if true risk-free rates fall then, other things being equal, nominal forward rates would fall too, and so would not, on their own, be a good indicator of inflation expectations. Given the bulge in Asian savings, there are reasons to think that long real rates might have fallen. But this is much less pronounced in US$ TIP yields than in UK indexed-gilt yields, and so I incline to the view that the gilt-market “breakeven” rates are somewhat distorted. BIS Review 112/2008 7 
medium-term expectations suggests that the expectations might have been more contained, and might more recently have started to edge down a bit. But it is hard to know how much weight to place on that.  But if the upside risks to medium-term inflation are not yet firmly embedded in expectations and so are not evident across the nominal indicators, we certainly cannot conclude that the risk has passed.  Headline inflation outturns remain elevated, and could top 5% – well above the 2% target – for a number of months. Not only have goods prices accelerated, reflecting the direct impact of food and energy prices, but services inflation has risen too (Chart 7). As a diagnostic of the underlying upside risks, ignoring the direct effect of past increases in food and energy prices, inflation has reached around 2%. Sterling’s recent depreciation will give a further impulse to import prices; and so, other things being equal, may stretch out the period of uncomfortably high inflation, endangering inflation expectations.  Moreover, there remains a risk of continuing inflation impulses from the persistence of imbalances in the global economy. Global inflation, global imbalances and the international monetary regime The rate of nominal expansion in much of the emerging market world has remained brisk. From our point of view, up until recently that seemed to add to the upward impetus to commodity prices, exacerbating the upward pressure on our firms’ costs.  Of course, part of the rise in commodity prices over the past few years is explained by a profound structural shift as the world economy is joined by large, rapidly developing economies which are increasingly energy intensive. In addition, nominal demand has probably played a role recently. Some EMEs have exchange rates that are fixed, more or less, to the US dollar, and so have been importing a monetary easing, which they hardly needed, as the FOMC cut the Fed funds rate to address domestic US circumstances. In other countries, there has also been less than complete sterilisation of the monetary effects of exchange rate intervention. Absent offsetting policy action, eventually the nominal expansion permitted will be dissipated in rising inflation and so an appreciation in real exchange rates. For a given path of nominal demand, that would tend to reduce the pressure of demand on global commodity prices, as many of the largest EME economies are, basically, commodity importers themselves. But persistent elevated inflation in the EMEs would also increase the nominal price of some of our imports, unless an adjustment in nominal exchange rates were permitted. In fact, over recent months there have been some steps towards taking domestic monetary action across a number of emerging market economies. But there is a risk that higher EME inflation will persist if, left unchecked, it becomes embedded in inflation expectations.  With inflation also elevated across the major industrialised economies, this underlines the risk to global inflation from imbalances in global supply and demand. Individual countries can suffer exogenous shocks to inflation from commodity prices, but that is essentially a relative price shift, to which the world economy has to adjust. By contrast, a persistent rise in inflationary pressures cannot be exogenous for all countries collectively. In that respect, the international monetary regime, and the global imbalances it has sustained, continues to pose risks to the outlook for our economy. Indeed, in terms of where we find ourselves, we must take care not to put the cost shock and the credit shock in completely separate boxes. They both owe something to global imbalances. Early commentators on the developing international monetary system, 8 BIS Review 112/2008 
combining a mixture of floating and fixed-rate exchange rates (so-called Bretton Woods II),16 were inclined to the view that current account imbalances would prove sustainable – essentially because Asia would, they assumed, continue to finance the USA’s savings deficit. But, as has become apparent over time, that seemed to rely on the invisible hand smoothing over the counterpart imbalances within some net debtor economies, notably the USA; or, more crudely, of it making no difference that, in aggregate, American households had effectively given up saving.  Given the now widely acknowledged ex ante imbalance a few years ago between global investment and Asian-fuelled global saving, this was associated with a compression of long-term risk-free rates and an associated rise in asset prices. And given frictions elsewhere in the system, including the US GSE’s guarantees reducing the headline returns on prime-mortgage securitisations, that contributed to compression in risk premia. And that, I fear, fuelled a “search for yield” in which investors, having enjoyed the extraordinary windfall gains that accompany rising asset prices, extrapolated forward their elevated ex post returns into ex ante requirements (Diagram A).17 (Such extrapolation amounts to a bubble, but via the channel of a requirement or target rather than, directly, a simple expectation.) There’s only one way to deliver on such requirements in those conditions: take more risk and hope no one prices for it. Leverage and maturity transformation were the order of the day. Macro met finance, and the results were unhappy – a theme I shall return to later.  For too long without success, monetary policymakers and international institutions called for resolution of the global imbalances. Perhaps with hindsight, the industrialised economies should have been clearer about their own course in a second-best world in which some important exchange rates have remained semi-fixed for longer than believed ideal. The second-best probably involved measures to generate more domestic saving; may have invited tolerance for temporarily lower inflation; and perhaps tighter regulation of liquidity provision by the commercial banking system. But whatever the hindsight, there remains a pressing need to evaluate now the continuing risks from the pattern of global current account positions and capital flows. For researchers, this unfinished episode in global economic history underlines the significance of international monetary economics, but perhaps also a need to integrate it not only with the theory of asset pricing but also with a rich appreciation of credit creation and risk. Risk premia, money, default and crises Indeed, an implicit theme running through various threads in my remarks this morning, which I shall now try to pull together, is the need for further progress in integrating macroeconomics and finance – applied as well as theory. I will give a few reasons why.  As well as compensating for expected default, expected inflation and so on, yields on assets embody risk premia to compensate for uncertainty in future returns. In the modern literature, these risk premia are taken to be determined by how useful a financial asset is in helping households to smooth the path of their consumption. Assets that deliver low returns during bad times don’t contribute much to helping households sustain consumption, and so carry a higher risk premium. So risk premia might vary with the volatility of the asset return; the volatility of consumption; and with the correlation between asset returns and consumption.                                                  16  See Dooley, M.P, Folkerts-Landau, D and Garber, P (2003), “An essay on the revised Bretton Woods System”, NBER Working Paper 9971. “System” is not quite the right word, because it is not the product of collective international thought and planning. 17  See Tucker, PMWT (2006) “Uncertainty, the implementation of monetary policy and the management of risk”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin 2006 Q2 pp 202-211. BIS Review 112/2008 9 
Like other economic variables, such premia may change as their underlying determinants change, and given the nature of the “shocks” affecting the macroeconomy. All that is familiar, fairly orthodox stuff these days. Indeed, an extraordinary amount of work at the macro/financial frontier has been going on over recent years. But as John Cochrane has commented, “work has barely begun”.18 From a policymakers’ perspective, that does seem to be the case.  First, while papers are still produced in the tradition that “macroeconomists can safely go on ignoring finance”, we – policymakers – are having to make sense of a macro environment in which the supply of credit has been interrupted by problems sourced in part to swings in risk premia, and quite possibly swings in risk aversion. Models incorporating risk premia – and, indeed, embracing bubbles – might just help us with that.  But it is striking that, so far, the progress in finance hardly features in the macro models used around the world for forecasting. Indeed, such models barely recognise the existence of financial instruments beyond risk-free bonds and equities.19 In modern DSGE models, asset prices (and so risk premia) merely reflect economic developments; they are not “actors” in any way. Even if we were to accept that risk premia are not “actors”, for policymakers they might serve as useful diagnostics of what is going on in the economy – of the nature of the underlying shocks – given that asset price changes are typically apparent some time before the associated real economy adjustments. On that view, we need research that will help us read the “risk premia” tea leaves. For example, an increase in premia that could be traced to an increase in the correlation between consumption and investment returns, might point to a prospective increase in households’ precautionary saving. But it’s less obvious, at least to me, what macroeconomic developments I should expect if risk premia rose due to an “exogenous” rise, say due to reduced market making, in the volatility of asset prices. We also need to be able to make sense of shifts in relative risk premia on different asset classes. We need models that can say something useful about the compression, and then widening, in credit and liquidity risk premia that in some ways define the current financial turmoil. We need to know whether or not those shifts reflect changes in fundamentals, or unwarranted “exuberance” or “fear” in the markets; and whether or not they have implications for demand and supply conditions in the real economy.  Second, very little has been said about how, or whether, the supply of money (or monetary policy) may affect risk premia. Years ago Brunner and Meltzer set out a view20 of how shocks to the supply of base money were transmitted to the economy through effects on asset prices over and above the impact on the risk-free discount rate, but through liquidity (and maybe other risk) premia. More recently, some policymakers,21 have conjectured that swings in the supply of broad money (via bank lending) can be associated with shifts in risk premia too. The thought is that in a world in which different assets are not perfect substitutes for each other, whether money is over or under-supplied can affect the relative value of other financial assets. If the channel is thought to work through broad money, as transactions balances,22 then of course it is the supply of bank lending that matters. Essentially, when “liquidity” is plentiful, it may be undervalued. That may build a bridge to the literature on how the supply                                                  18  See Cochrane, J, “Financial Markets and the Real Economy. 19  See Tucker, PMWT “Reflections on Operating an Inflation Target”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 2006 Q2 pp 212-224. 20  See Tucker, PMWT (2007) “A perspective on recent monetary and financial system developments” Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin 2007 Q2 pp 310-316. 21  Including the current G of the BofE and myself; see King, M (2002) “No money, no inflation – the role of money in the economy” Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin 2002 Q2 pp 162-177. 22  See Thornton, D.

of credit from the banking sector can influence the liquidity of asset markets.23 This echoes my earlier discussion of the potential utility, as indicators, of the data on money and credit quantities when the degree of credit rationing shifts. We’d do better at making sense of those issues if we had a better understanding of the determinants and macro-significance of risk premia in the first place.  Extending that point, the literature may too easily dismiss the possible effects on prices of the demand and supply of financial assets more generally. But we need testable theories as to why, and the circumstances in which, they might matter.  Finally, looking beyond the ex ante compensation for risk, we also need to have better models for exploring what can happen – in the financial system and in the macroeconomy – when nasty forms of risk do actually crystallise. Default comes to mind.24 Bank default is a special case, given the special role of banks in a monetary economy. And, guess what? Banks don’t really feature in modern macro models. Of course, incorporating those features of the real world is incredibly hard, involving heterogeneous agents, incomplete contracts and markets, and uncertainty.  Uncertainty needs to be underlined. It isn’t clear whether existing models could explain the swings we have been experiencing in some asset prices. Is that something to do with market participants having become radically uncertain about the nature of the underlying distributions? And do asset prices become actors in those circumstances? Over many decades now,25 elegant models have been developed for studying financial market distress in the abstract – whether affecting banks or asset markets. This, of course, involves strategic interaction amongst agents. We have other models in which the probability of such distress may be related to various characteristics of banks, such as whether they are comfortably within thresholds for capital adequacy – the argument being that as they get closer to the threshold, depositors become less confident about the stability of each other’s behaviour.26 And we have models in which bank capital is affected by macroeconomic developments; and models in which, through financial accelerator-like mechanisms, impaired bank capital affects the supply of credit,27 and so potentially macroeconomic variables. But we don’t yet have models in which the determinants of the probability of banking system distress are influenced by the macro environment; and in which such distress can, really, occur and affect the macro environment. That seems to call for somehow embedding game-theoretic strategic interactions within dynamic macro models.28                                                 23  See Allen, F, and Gale, D, (2007) “Understanding Financial Crises”, Oxford University Press. 24  Commenting on a recent paper by Michael Woodford, Charles Goodhart (pointed out that the model incorporated credit risk premia but not default. Everyone is hoping that Woodford picks up the challenge. (See Goodhard, C, comments on “Credit Frictions and Optimal Monetary Policy” by Curdia and Woodford (2008).

Overall, truly incorporating risk into our thinking has to be one of the last great frontiers for applied macroeconomics. For central banks, that would help to meet the challenge of integrating our monetary policy and financial stability missions, which cannot be separated in a monetary economy.  Summary and conclusions This morning I have offered some thoughts on what one policymaker would find useful from future research in applied monetary economics: • the determination of fluctuations in inflation expectations • a revival of interest in money and credit quantities, especially when credit rationing means that we cannot observe “shadow prices” and so cannot live entirely in the modern textbook world of prices • and if, as I believe we should, we are going to continue to think largely in terms of prices, then we need more work on the determination of risk premia on a range of financial assets, and the information they can give us on the real economy, integrating this into our workhorse macro forecasting models • empirical work on the lags with which shocks to the financial system feed through to the real economy, and on the conditions for the impact to matter • work designed to help quantify how different shocks to supply and demand affect the equilibrium short-term real interest rate • greater interest in the international monetary regime, and on how countries may be able to shield themselves during a period of unsustainable imbalances without succumbing to “begar thy neighbour” policies; and • the development of dynamic macro models in which really bad things, such as defaults, bank distress and asset price collapses, can happen and can have macroeconomic effects. That is quite a shopping list. The official sector, internationally, could, in my view, probably help – both researchers and itself – by producing data on financial flows and stocks as rich as the real economy data we collect. I have in mind things like the Federal Reserve’s “Flow of Funds” statistics. As well as being of immediate practical use, over time there would be benefits from the richer empirical research it would allow your community to conduct. The underlying thought is that, until we know more about risk premia, we should not give up tracking quantities. Doing so in the future might aid comprehension of the risks in the financial system.  The challenge for policymakers is no smaller than that for researchers. We must tackle the task at hand with the tools we have. There are substantial risks to inflation in both directions over the medium term. But at present, the most likely prospect remains that, as the global economy slows, accumulating slack in the economy will head off the upside risks to inflation. That strategy relies not only on real-economy interactions, but crucially on the credibility of the target and the Committee. Above all else, therefore, we must be clear about our mandate: to deliver stable inflation, at 2%, over the medium term.                                                                                                                                                        they tell the end of the story, when all relative prices have been determined, whereas we want to enrich our grasp of the narrative so that we can influence the end of the story. 12 BIS Review 112/2008

Svein Gjedrem: Monetary policy from a historical perspective Speech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the conference to mark the 100th anniversary of the Association of Norwegian Economists, Oslo, 16 September 2008. The text may differ slightly from the actual presentation. *      *      * Introduction Let me begin by offering my congratulations to the Association of Norwegian Economists on its 100th anniversary. One hundred is a respectable age. In Norway, the introduction of a university degree in economics was certainly an important stimulus in the first part of the last century. In the period since the Second World War, major changes in society have increased the demand for expertise in the field of economics.  And economists are constantly gaining new insights. This also applies to the field of central banking, even though one of the fundamental central bank responsibilities – to safeguard the value of money – was as important 100 years ago as it is today. Monetary policy in Norway has changed considerably over the past 100 years. The government, with the support of the Storting, has now defined an objective for monetary policy of low and stable inflation. Norges Bank sets its interest rate with a view to achieving price stability. This has not always been the case.  Monetary policy in Norway  Norges Bank was established in 1816 and was placed directly under the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The government had no control or influence. The Bank was authorised to issue banknotes that were to serve as legal tender. To ensure stability in the value of money, the banknotes were to be redeemable in silver, although this was not achieved until 1842. Later – in 1874 – the basis for the monetary system was changed from silver to gold. One year BIS Review 111/2008 1 
later, in 1875, Norway entered the Scandinavian Currency Union with Sweden and Denmark. Norway was a member of the currency union until around the mid-1920s, but after 1914 the union lost its practical significance.1  The latter half of the 1800s was generally marked by stable prices. Hence, when the first students completed their degree in economics in 1908, price stability was perhaps not the main concern of economists.     When the First World War broke out in 1914, confidence in the monetary system faltered. The obligation to convert banknotes into gold was suspended. The money supply was out of control and inflation rose sharply. It reached 40 per cent in 1918. When Nicolai Rygg took office as chairman of the board of Norges Bank in 1920, he regarded it as an obligation to restore the gold value of the krone to previous values, i.e. parity policy.2 This was considered a pre-condition for restoring confidence in the monetary system and in money as a means of payment and saving vehicle.3                                                 1  See Jonung (2005) for a more detailed description of the Scandinavian currency union. See also Qvigstad and Skjæveland (1994). 2  As used in the Norwegian debate, “parity policy” refers to the monetary policy of the 1920s, when the Norwegian krone was forced back to its former gold parity by means of highly deflationary policies. (Footnote not included in Norwegian text.) 3  See Ecklund (2008), p.43-44. 2 BIS Review 111/2008 
   The crisis in the 1930s, which severely affected the Norwegian economy, led to changes in views regarding economic policy. The parity policy experience was probably an important reason for this change. As a result, there were few objections when after liberation in 1945, the government with the Storting’s support made decisions that under the law were the responsibilities of the central bank. This was the start of a new era of reduced independence for the central bank. The discount rate, for example, was reduced to 2.5 per cent on the recommendation of the government in January 1946. The Bank's task was to implement the government's decisions. Norges Bank nonetheless played an important role in shaping monetary policy, for example serving as an interface with international financial community and acting as adviser and facilitator.4In the first decades after the Second World War, it was firmly believed that the economy could be fine-tuned in the desired direction by coordinating instruments established by the central authorities. In Norway, this resulted in a period of low nominal interest rates set by the government authorities, direct regulation of credit through quotas set out in a separate credit budget, channelling of loans for special purposes via state banks, regulation of cross-border capital movements, a fixed but adjustable krone and occasionally the use of price and wage regulation. For a period, regulation and fine-tuning seemed to be having the intended effect. But in the 1970s, inflation got out of control in Norway and in a number of other countries. The Norwegian economy experienced a price/wage spiral. Although the krone was devalued several times in the 10-year period from 1976 to 1986 in pace with high price and wage inflation, this was nonetheless not sufficient to prevent a decline in the manufacturing sector.  In 1980, Odd Aukrust, Head of Research in Statistics Norway, stated the following with regard to developments in the Norwegian economy: "Unfortunately there is even less reason for optimism this time. It seems that competitiveness in Norwegian manufacturing will deteriorate in the year ahead. The main problem is that no one can control price                                                  4  See Ecklund (2008), p.120. BIS Review 111/2008 3 
developments. With annual inflation at approximately 10 per cent, no one dares to invest in measures that could stop this price carousel.”5  High inflation showed that the economic policy framework was not functioning as intended, and the importance of providing the economy with a nominal anchor became evident. In the light of experience, it became clear that unemployment could not be permanently reduced by merely accepting higher inflation.6One of the first to formulate this clearly in the debate in Norway was then Director General at the Ministry of Finance Per Schreiner, who wrote in 1982 that:7"It has long been a commonly held view in the Nordic countries that a policy choice can be made between price stability and full employment. There are strong indications that this choice does not exist […] Personally, I am no longer in doubt that controlling inflation is essential to achieving other social objectives."  In line with developments in other countries, a shift in monetary policy also took place in Norway. In 1985, legislation was adopted which gave Norges Bank greater independence. After the last devaluation in 1986, monetary policy was oriented towards a fixed exchange rate. The fixed exchange rate was to be our nominal anchor.  The fixed exchange rate regime was abandoned in December 1992 in the wake of the crisis in the European Monetary System (EMS). The UK withdrew from the EMS and our neighbours Sweden and Finland also had to accept a floating exchange rate. The crisis revealed the built-in weaknesses of a fixed exchange rate regime in a world of free capital flows and deep financial markets. And it did indeed finally spread to the Norwegian krone. When the fixed exchange rate policy was abandoned, there was a risk that the Norwegian economy might again lose its nominal anchor. But the krone exchange rate showed little change, and rapidly found a new range. From 1996 the conditions necessary for exchange-rate stability deteriorated. With a strengthening of central government finances, the minority government was not able to contribute sufficiently to restraining growth in government spending. Wage growth was substantially higher than in other countries. Moreover, petroleum revenues fluctuated widely from year to year and turbulence in international financial markets spilled over to our currency. The krone exchange rate fluctuated in spite of the active use of Norges Bank's instruments. Volatility increased further in 1998. The Norwegian krone fell in value. In response to this the interest rate was raised on several occasions through 1998.  The years between 1996 and 1998 showed that it was difficult to use the interest rate to fine-tune the exchange rate. Norges Bank Governor Kjell Storvik discussed the situation in a speech he gave in August 1998: “Let us be mindful of the well known fact that a lower exchange-rate can amplify inflation expectations and that these expectations can in turn contribute to expectations of a weaker exchange rate, and in themselves amplify the depreciation tendency. Price expectations would then be self-fulfilling. The interest-rate level                                                  5  Translation of an interview published in the Norwegian newspaper Adresseavisen 27 December 1980. 6  A key element in the Keynesian way of thinking in the 1960s and 1970s was that employment could be reduced in the long term merely by accepting higher inflation. This was demonstrated by the Phillips curve (named after the economist A.W. Phillips), which showed that low unemployment has historically accompanied high wage growth. In the 1960s, Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps rejected the idea that this empirical relationship could be used to reduce unemployment in the long term. Any attempt to reduce unemployment would over time only result in higher inflation, without affecting employment and output. A more detailed discussion of these developments in macroeconomic history can be found in Snowdon and Vane (2005). 7  See Schreiner (1982). 4 BIS Review 111/2008 
that has now been established should, in addition to directly contributing to stabilising the krone exchange rate, also curb price expectations.”8  In recognition of this fact, Norges Bank gradually gave greater weight to influencing inflation developments as a prerequisite for a more stable krone exchange rate over time. As stated in an article in the Norwegian daily newspaper Aftenposten in May 19999: “In the discretionary assessments on which monetary policy is based, Norges Bank gives weight to fundamental preconditions for exchange-rate stability over time. Price and cost inflation must be brought down towards the level aimed for by the euro area countries. At the same time the situation must be avoided whereby monetary policy in itself contributes to a downturn with deflation.” The division of responsibility in economic policy was even more clearly defined when the government presented new economic policy guidelines in March 2001. An inflation target for monetary policy was introduced, with an operational target for annual consumer price inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time. The fiscal policy rule was also introduced. According to this rule, the cyclically adjusted non-oil government budget deficit shall correspond to the long-term real return on the Government Pension Fund – Global. The division of responsibility in economic policy has since been the following: • Monetary policy steers inflation in the medium and long term and can also contribute to smoothing swings in output and employment.  • The central government budget – growth in public spending – affects the real krone exchange rate and the size of the internationally exposed business sector in the long term. At the same time, developments in government expenditure and revenues must ensure a reasonable distribution across generations.  • Wage formation, the structure of the economy and incentives determine how well and how efficiently we utilise labour and other real economic resources. It is the government that defines the inflation target. Norges Bank sets the interest rate with the aim of reaching the inflation target. The Bank must account for its decisions. It does so through an annual report on the conduct of monetary policy. The report is submitted to the Ministry of Finance to be presented to the King and communicated to the Storting. The government’s assessment is presented in the annual credit reports. The governor of Norges Bank is also required once a year – first in 2003 – to appear at an open hearing on monetary policy of the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs.  What can we learn from history? We can learn from history. The experience of the 1970s and 1980s was a costly one. After the last devaluation in 1986, a fixed exchange rate policy was introduced and the economy went through a period of extensive restructuring. Confidence in the krone had to be restored to prevent persistently high inflation. This required very high interest rates. The Norwegian economy entered into the deepest recession since the interwar period. Unemployment rose from around 2 per cent in 1987 to 6 per cent in the winter of 1992/1993. Many companies went bankrupt and households faced debt problems. There was a crisis in the banking sector. Inflation only decreased to 2-3 per cent in the early 1990s. The years between 1986 and the beginning of the 1990s provide a realistic picture of the cost of bringing down inflation from a high level.                                                   8  See Storvik (1998). 9  See Gjedrem ”Challenges in monetary policy”, Aftenposten, 4 May 1999. BIS Review 111/2008 5 
Inflation has been low and stable since the mid-1990s because the objective of monetary policy has been to provide the economy with a nominal anchor. Economic agents should be able to rely on the value of money remaining stable over time. High inflation and inflation that varies considerably over time result in random changes in the real value of assets and debt. This leads to unintended transfers between creditors and debtors. When inflation is high and variable over time, the function of prices as an information vehicle is also impaired. When inflation is low and stable, changes in relative prices are more easily discernible, and it is easier for households and businesses to make decisions about consumption and investment. Low and stable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make over time to employment, economic growth and welfare.  The central banks in the first industrialised countries have attained a more independent status over the past 20 years. This is partly because Germany and its firm Bundesbank fared better during the period of high inflation in the 1970s and 1980s than many other countries. Arguments in favour of an independent central bank are also found in economic theory. Studies by Finn Kydland of Norway and Edward Prescott of the US at the end of the 1970s on economic policy rules were groundbreaking.10 The insights gained from these studies provide arguments for ensuring central bank independence and deriving monetary policy objectives. History and theoretical studies have taught us that adverse effects may occur if the authorities do not take into account that households and enterprises are forward-looking when making decisions about consumption, investment, wages and prices. They base these decisions their expectations of economic policy in the future, not only on today’s policy. It is therefore important that the authorities do not sow doubt, but on the contrary pursue a long-term and predictable policy. The authorities must be credible and inspire confidence. There must be consistency between the stated objectives of economic policy and what is actually done to achieve these objectives. This is the most important reason why the conduct of monetary policy has been delegated to the central bank in Norway, as is the case in other comparable countries.  The question of central bank independence is not new. When Norges Bank was established almost 200 years ago, there was much discussion about where to locate the head office. Trondheim was chosen and one of the arguments in the debate was that locating the central bank far from the seat of government would prevent the central bank from coming under political pressure. It was not until 1896 that the Storting decided that the central bank should be moved to Kristiania (now Oslo). The strongest objection to relocating the central bank from Trondheim to Kristiania was expressed by Director Karl Gether Bomhoff, who was in fact also a friend of Henrik Ibsen from his Dresden period.11 Bomhoff was a member of the Bank’s board for 35 years, from 1885 to 1920. In 1893, he became the first permanently employed chairman of the board and the first director for the entire central bank. He emphasised that Norges Bank had to be independent and free of pressure from the political authorities and civil servants He stated at the time:12“As I have said before, I believe that the Bank can be managed just as well from Trondheim as from Kristiania, and I believe, better, because in the capital city it will be subject to pressure that it is impossible to know how long the board will be able to resist, since there are those in Kristiania, and perhaps also in the government, that may seek to change the Bank’s objectives. Norges Bank should be maintained as an independent institution under the control of the Storting.”                                                  10  See Kydland and Prescott (1977). 11  See Figueiredo (2007). 12  See Borlaug (1999), pp 34-35. 6 BIS Review 111/2008 
Geographical distance to markets and government has no significance today, but it may well be said that Bomhoff expressed thoughts that were articulated in more modern terms by Kydland and Prescott 70-80 years later. History has also taught us that fiscal policy has considerable bearing on the role monetary policy can play. If the government's debt is too high, the political authorities have an incentive to increase inflation in order to reduce the real value of the debt. It is then difficult to anchor inflation expectations. No monetary policy can secure the nominal anchor if government spending spins out of control. Monetary policy and fiscal policy must therefore have a common platform. The interaction between the political authorities and the central bank can be effective if the authorities take the role of “leader”, and the central bank the role of “follower”. Inflation targeting provides a clear indication as to how the central bank should respond in different situations. The political authorities are the “leader” in this interaction. They can internalise the central bank’s – the “follower’s” – pattern of response in their actions.13 Government spending growth can then be decided knowing the effect it will have on interest rates.  We have also learned from history that financial bubbles and crises occur from time to time. Even though financial crises may seem to be very different, they usually have a common feature. The US economist Hyman P. Minsky was of the view that this could be summed up in five stages: First a shock, often triggered by a technological breakthrough or changes in legislation and regulation of the business sector, followed by a period of growth – a boom – where new technology and opportunities are applied. This turns into euphoria – people get carried away. At some point some people wake up and take out their profits by selling. This triggers a fall in asset prices and equity prices and ultimately leads to panic and a crash.14 This is referred to as the Minsky moment.  We are now in the midst of a global financial crisis, which originated in the US housing market. Combined with new financial instruments that were intended to spread risk – but that did not prove to be viable – the US housing crisis has spread to many parts of the world and whose outcome is still unknown. Seven or eight years ago, we experienced a similar situation, although not as severe, when the dotcom bubble burst. Many also recall the crises in the emerging market economies in Asia, Central Europe and South America ten years ago and the downturn in the Japanese economy in the 1990s. Nor will we forget the banking crises in the Scandinavian countries in the early 1990s. However, financial crises are nothing new. We also find parallels to today's crisis if we go back to the Great Depression in the 1930s. If we go much further back in history, to the 1600s, the same phenomenon occurred with speculation in the tulip trade. In Holland, they discovered at an early stage that a virus could give tulips stripes and beautiful colour. A forward market for bulbs developed in the 1630s. In 1636 market prices rose sharply and in a short time that winter bulb prices increased 25-fold. This did not last. The market collapsed in February 1637 and prices fell to 5 per cent of earlier levels in the course of few days. Auction lists a hundred years after the crisis show prices from one per cent to 0.005 per cent of the level before the collapse.15Moving depictions of financial crises and their effect on people can also be found in imaginative literature. The Norwegian author Alexander Kielland depicts the local financial bubble in Stavanger in the 1880s in his book Fortuna. There was a surge in credit growth and speculation in commercial bills that did not represent actual values. Speculation formed the basis for quick gains and it all ended in bankruptcies and banks that failed.

climaxes in the book is a scene where Taraldsen – the old messenger from Norges Bank – realises that the financial bubble is about to burst: … in breathless surprise Taraldsen asked again: "Aren't your bills of exchange to be redeemed today?" "No." "Mr. Marcussen! People say that you are a jocular man; but this –" "I'm not joking – damn it!" Old Taraldsen straightened up; everyone was hunched over their work; only young Rasmus' eyes met his. The boy was white as a sheet; he began to understand. It also started to become clear for old Taraldsen; but immediately afterwards, he became very confused again; because he understood the entire scope of this; he had the entire town's bills of exchange in his head; and of course he had seen a lot of this kind of thing during his long life but all of those were trifles compared to what would happen now. His voice shook as he almost ceremoniously asked: "Will Carsten Løvdahl's papers be protested?" "Yes," replied Marcussen without looking up. Old Taraldsen trotted out of the offices; but on the steps he met the messenger from Aktiebanken: "Is it true? – Taraldsen!" "Now the entire town is going to collapse," answered the old man, throwing up his arms in despair. Kielland’s description of a financial crisis and its consequences was realistic. There was speculation then and there is speculation today, but in other kinds of financial instruments than at that time. We might find employees at Lehman Brothers today who have expressed themselves in the same way as old Taraldsen. It seems to be an inherent property in financial markets that financial bubbles and crises occur from time to time. A monetary policy that is oriented towards stabilising inflation and inflation expectations will reduce the impact. We have seen that when the interest rate is raised to restrain the rise in prices for goods and services, it also has the effect of stabilising house and property prices. In some areas, however, regulations and frameworks – cf. the substantial tax subsidy benefiting homeowners – amplify fluctuations in asset prices and lending. Conclusion The monetary system has changed through history. If we go far enough back in time, money consisted of coins with a certain quantity of silver or gold. The quantity of silver and gold therefore limited the volume of money that could be produced. This ensured that coins were attractive as a means of exchange and as a means of storing value. On the other hand, paper money cost almost nothing to produce and can be therefore be printed in unlimited quantities. Over the past 100 years, there have been several periods when paper money could be redeemed for silver or gold. For example, this was for a long period the case in the Scandinavian Currency Union. In the period after the Second World War and up to the beginning of the 1970s, the US dollar had a fixed price against gold while other currencies had a fixed exchange rate against the US dollar. This was the basis for what was known as the Bretton Woods monetary system. Paper money had a value because the central bank was obligated to redeem it for gold.  8 BIS Review 111/2008 
A system whereby paper money can be redeemed for gold is nevertheless more fragile than a system whereby coins must contain a certain quantity of the precious metal. A central bank can quickly cease to redeem paper money for gold, or redeem notes at a lower gold price than prevailing earlier. This is what happened when the Bretton Woods system collapsed after the Federal Reserve was no longer obligated to redeem dollars for gold. Today’s monetary system may even be more fragile. Gold and silver belong to the past. Today it is deposit money and paper money that prevail. People must be confident that deposit money can be converted into paper money. The central bank must promise that the value of paper money is maintained. If people do not believe that the central bank will keep its promise, they will want neither deposit money nor paper money. Money will then lose its value. Other currencies or goods with direct utility value will take over as a means of exchange and a means for storing value. This reduces the effectiveness of the economic system. We are of the view that it is an important but demanding task to safeguard the value of money. It is our own economic policy that determines the value of our money in the long term. It is therefore important to remember that price stability does not come about on its own.

T T Mboweni: Overview of the South African economy Address by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the 88th ordinary general meeting of shareholders, Pretoria, 18 September 2008. *      *      * Introduction The past year has been a difficult one for both the global and domestic economies. At the time of the previous annual general meeting of the South African Reserve Bank (the Bank), the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States (US) was in an early phase, and at that stage the full implications were yet to be seen. A year later we are witnessing the repercussions in terms of pressure on the international financial markets and a slowing global economy. Compounding these developments were sustained increases in the prices of a number of commodities, particularly food and oil, which have fuelled domestic and global inflation. The South African banking sector has been relatively insulated from these financial market uncertainties. Nevertheless, greater vigilance has been required in supervising and regulating the domestic banking sector and payment system, which contributed to an orderly financial market environment. At the same time, monetary policy has faced particular challenges as relative price movements and strong domestic demand caused inflation to exceed the inflation target range. In carrying out its mandate of achieving and maintaining price stability, the Bank has tightened the stance of monetary policy over the past year. However, the Bank has retained its focus on maintaining the efficient internal workings of the Bank. It is in this context that I report to you today. This year a comprehensive economic report is included as part of the Annual Report. In previous years this economic report was published as a separate Annual Economic Report. The economic report provides an analysis of developments in the domestic and international economy during the year under review, with particular emphasis on developments that have had implications for the operations and policy implementation of the Bank. The focus of this address is on the main operational areas of the Bank. Monetary policy The challenges facing monetary policy intensified during the year. Inflation was impacted initially by strong domestic demand pressures, and sustained and significantinternational oil and food price increases. Since April 2007, CPIX inflation has exceeded the upper end of the target range of 3 to 6 per cent and it has risen persistently since then. In July 2008 CPIX inflation had reached a level of 13,0 per cent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has consistently recognised that there is little that monetary policy can do to avoid the impact or first-round effects of exogenous relative price changes on domestic inflation. Monetary policy needs to focus on preventing these first-round effects from feeding through to a generalised or broad-based increase in inflation. Central to this is the management of inflation expectations. If monetary policy fails to act appropriately, inflation expectations will become less anchored, with implications for price and wage setting. Whereas initially much of the pressure on inflation came from exogenous sources, more recently it has become evident that second-round effects have become more prominent. During the year under review underlying inflation has increased consistently: in July 2007 CPIX inflation excluding food and petrol measured 5,0 per cent, whereas by July 2008 it had increased to 7,4 per cent. There was also some deterioration in inflation expectations. During the second half of 2007 expectations, as reflected in the inflation expectations survey conducted on behalf of the BIS Review 111/2008 1 
Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University, remained within the target range, although there was a moderate upward drift. This was despite the unfavourable inflation outcomes. However, the picture changed in 2008 when expectations increased significantly above the upper end of the inflation target range for all years in the forecast period. This deterioration is consistent with other market-based measures of inflation expectations. During the past year there have been a number of factors that impacted on inflation and that influenced monetary policy decisions. These included endogenous and exogenous factors. The international oil price continued to put pressure on domestic inflation. Oil prices were affected by strong global demand, particularly from fast-growing emerging-market economies, most notably in Asia. Numerous oil-supply disruptions, mainly a result of geopolitical developments and adverse weather conditions, also affected the oil market. As a result, the price of North Sea Brent crude oil increased from just over US$50 per barrel in January 2007 to reach a high of over US$145 per barrel in July 2008, before moderating in recent weeks. The combined effects of the international oil price and rand exchange rate developments have resulted in a cumulative increase in domestic petrol prices of about R2,75 per litre since September 2007. Despite an improved domestic maize harvest and relatively benign weather conditions, food prices also continued to place upward pressure on inflation. Factors sustaining pressure on international food prices include drought conditions in some regions, export restrictions in a number of countries, the diversion of food crops to biofuels production, and increased global demand fuelled by strong growth and higher incomes in emerging markets in particular. Domestically, between August 2007 and July 2008, food prices contributed on average 4,1 percentage points to average CPIX inflation of 9,3 per cent. Pressures from food and oil prices have also impacted on global inflation. Despite a general downturn in most of the advanced economies, monetary policy in numerous countries has been tightened in recent months in response to heightened inflation pressures. Since early 2008, the exchange rate has also begun to pose a threat to the inflation outlook. The exchange rate reacted to a number of developments including the widening deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, electricity supply constraints, bouts of global risk aversion and movements in the US dollar against other currencies. More recently, the rand exchange rate has appreciated somewhat from its earlier lows. The trend of wage settlements has also become an increasing risk to the inflation outlook. Nominal wage settlements have been increasing over the past year, although they are still on average below the inflation rate, particularly once productivity changes are adjusted for. Most other domestic determinants of inflation remained well contained and have either been neutral or helpful to inflation developments. After a long lag, household consumption expenditure showed a definite response to the tightened monetary policy stance, despite only a moderate slowdown in bank credit extension to households. Demand for durable goods has been particularly responsive to higher nominal interest rates. Asset price developments, in the form of lower equity prices and a subdued housing market, reduced the pressure on inflation emanating from wealth effects. Output growth, which has measured around 5 per cent per annum during the past four years, showed signs of moderating and the economy appears to be growing somewhat below potential output growth. Fiscal policy also remained supportive of monetary policy. In response to the impact of these developments on the inflation outlook, the monetary policy stance has been tightened progressively over the past year. The repurchase rate was increased by 50 basis points after each of four of the six MPC meetings held since the previous annual general meeting. Since the tightening cycle began in June 2006, the repurchase rate has been increased by a cumulative 500 basis points. In January 2008 interest rates were kept on hold despite a mildly deteriorated inflation forecast. At that time, 2 BIS Review 111/2008 
the risks to the outlook were more or less the same, but the MPC assessed that the extent of these risks had moderated somewhat. However, by the next meeting this assessment had changed in the light of new developments, including the risk posed to the outlook by Eskom’s application for a significant further increase in the price of electricity. At its most recent meeting in August 2008 the MPC decided to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged. The committee decided that although upside risks to the inflation outlook remained, the degree of risk had subsided somewhat, particularly in the light of the continued slowdown in household consumption expenditure, the widening output gap and the lower international oil prices. The inflation forecast of the Bank showed that inflation was expected to peak in the third quarter of 2008 and then begin to decline, and to return to within the target range by the second quarter of 2010. The fact that inflation has been outside the target range for some time has been regarded by some as an indication of the failure of the inflation-targeting framework. It is generally accepted that a flexible inflation-targeting regime should allow for a deviation from the target in the event of exogenous shocks, which are beyond the control of the monetary authorities. Our framework also allows for deviations from the target in such instances, to avoid an excessive impact on output variability. However, to prevent second-round effects, it is important that expectations remain well anchored. Failure to respond will inevitably cause expectations to become dislodged and result in a further acceleration of inflation. The Bank remains committed to bringing inflation back to within the target in a reasonable time frame. Money-market operations The Bank manages the daily liquidity requirement in the money market so as to ensure that the implementation of monetary policy is consistent with the stance determined by the MPC. During the past year the daily liquidity requirement has been kept within a range of between R6,6 billion and R14,7 billion. The purchases of foreign exchange from the local foreign-exchange market create rand liquidity that has to be drained in order to maintain a liquidity shortage in the money market. Liquidity was drained in a number of ways, including the issuing of SARB debentures, conducting longer-term reverse repurchase transactions and increasing deposits in the sterilisation account that the National Treasury holds with the Bank. In addition, increases in notes and coin in circulation, and in the statutory cash reserves of commercial banks also drained liquidity. Accumulation and management of reserves The Bank continued to increase the level of official gross gold and foreign-exchange reserves, from US$29,8 billion at the end of August 2007 to US$34,3 billion at the end of August 2008. Over the same period, the international liquidity position increased from US$27,4 billion to US$33,5 billion. In addition to accumulating foreign-exchange reserves, the Bank reduced the level of its borrowed reserves from around US$3,2 billion at the end of August 2007 to US$896 million at the end of August 2008. Borrowed reserves were reduced with the repayment of the outstanding portion of the syndicated loan entered into in 2005. South Africa is one of a number of emerging-market countries that have a relatively high current-account deficit, which underlines the need for a healthy level of reserves. The current level of reserves puts South Africa more or less in line with many of its peers in the emerging-market community and it meets the generally accepted reserve-adequacy measures. However, the Bank does not regard the current level as excessive and is likely to continue accumulating reserves at a moderate pace when market conditions permit. Enhancing the reserves management processes of the Bank has been a strategic focus area for a number of years, commensurate with the growing responsibility associated with higher levels of reserves. This improvement continued during the past year. The primary focus BIS Review 111/2008 3 
during the period under review was the formulation and partial implementation of a strategic asset allocation, which involved the quantification of risk tolerance in the form of a target duration per currency and a risk budget to facilitate the active management of reserves. In line with these developments, the roll-out of the internally managed portfolios was initiated to move closer to the approved strategic asset allocation. Currency distribution In celebration of former President Nelson Mandela’s 90th birthday on 18 July 2008, the Bank issued five million pieces of the bi-metal commemorative R5 coin depicting the former president. Arrangements were made to distribute this special commemorative coin to all provinces prior to 18 July 2008, thereby ensuring that they were available nationally on Mr Mandela’s birthday. The national payment system In March 2008 the Bank celebrated the 10th anniversary of the implementation of the South African Multiple Option Settlement (SAMOS) system. During 2008 an upgrade of the SAMOS system was initiated to facilitate the implementation of delivery-versuspayment in the settlement of money-market securities. Another project was initiated to review the South African settlement system infrastructure and applications, and to benchmark them against those of other central banks. Business continuity management also received special attention during 2008. Interbank clearing and settlement are of systemic importance and the Bank co-operated with stakeholders to minimise potential disruptions in this domain. The Bank continued to develop the oversight of the national payment system (NPS). This included the issuing of directives relating to the conduct of system operators and third-party service providers in the payment system, which became effective in December 2007. The measures contained in these directives are aimed at ensuring the safety and efficiency of the NPS. The Bank also participated in the Continuous Linked Settlement system oversight and served on the foreign-exchange settlement subgroup of the Bank for International Settlements. The Bank, in its role as overseer of the NPS, established the National Payment System Advisory Body (NPSAB), which is representative of all the regulated stakeholders within the NPS. This body allows for regulated bank and non-bank participants to establish associations that can represent the interests of their members at the NPSAB. Financial stability The resilience of financial markets globally has been severely tested during the past year following the widespread impact of negative developments in the US housing and subprime mortgage markets. As a result of the securitisation of sub-prime loans, the effect turned out to be more widespread than anticipated originally. Emerging-market economies, in general, and South Africa, in particular, have proven to be remarkably resilient in the midst of this financial market turmoil. The impact on South Africa has been indirect, mainly through financial market volatility and the resultant economic slowdown in the US and other major industrialised countries. The Bank, in recognising the importance of a stable financial system to support its primary objective, seeks to identify inherent weaknesses in the financial system and monitor risks that may result in financial system disturbances. The domestic financial system was assessed as sound, based on a quantitative analysis of a standard set of financial soundness indicators. The Bank’s qualitative assessment of the inherent robustness of the financial system environment against the 12 key financial soundness standards of the 4 BIS Review 111/2008 
Financial Stability Forum shows a high level of general compliance with international standards and best practice. Bank regulation and supervision As part of its bank supervision function, the Bank focused on the impact of international financial market developments on the banking sector. In mid-2007 the Bank requested a selection of South African banks to provide detailed reports on their exposure to the prevailing risks. It was found that local banks had no direct exposure to the sub-prime mortgage market, while certain of the banks’ international franchises had only limited exposure. However, indirect effects, such as increased funding costs, were observable. In view of the developments in financial markets and specific events in some international banking institutions, the Bank deemed it important to embark on a process to evaluate the appropriateness of South African banks’ incentive schemes during 2008. A major change to the South African banking regulatory and supervisory framework occurred as a result of the implementation of Basel II on 1 January 2008. The process followed in implementing Basel II was characterised by its broad consultative approach; several quantitative impact studies and field tests; amendments to the regulatory and supervisory frameworks; and regular interaction with all South African banking institutions. The amended Banks Act, 1990 and Regulations relating to Banks, as well as the revised supervisory process were implemented at the same time. The Bank, in close co-operation with the Financial Intelligence Centre, continued to monitor the compliance of banking institutions with legislation relating to anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. Furthermore, in August 2008 the Bank participated in the Financial Action Task Force’s mutual evaluation of South Africa’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing system. International co-operation The African continent and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region remain the focal points of the Bank’s international relations efforts as programmes to achieve regional integration gain momentum. The Bank currently hosts the Secretariat of the Committee of Central Bank Governors (CCBG) in SADC and continues to support the implementation of CCBG projects. Significant progress has been made in the committees dealing with payment systems, information technology, macroeconomics, banking supervision and legal issues. This progress has been shared with the finance committees in Parliament where the ratification of the Finance and Investment Protocol, a key instrument to advance regional economic integration in SADC, has been sought. In our relations with multilateral institutions our efforts have been concentrated on increased participation in key forums such as the G-20. The chair of the G-20 passed on to Brazil from South Africa at the beginning of this year. South Africa remains an active participant in this forum of systemically important advanced and emerging-market economies. The focus of the forum this year includes competition in the financial sector, fiscal space for social inclusion and clean energy. In addition, with the active involvement of the forum, progress was made this year with the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, particularly in relation to quota reform and the finances of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Bank, through the SARB College (the College) continued to contribute to training in Africa by co-operating with international training institutions and central banks. The College hosted the residential segment of the IMF Financial Programming and Policies course, and a course for African countries on external vulnerabilities. The College also co-hosted a high-level seminar on capital flight in sub-Saharan Africa with the World Bank Institute. BIS Review 111/2008 5 
Internal administration The Annual Report of the Bank was distributed to shareholders before this meeting. The total assets of the Bank show an increase from R220 billion at the end of March 2007 to R300 billion at the end of March 2008. The increase was mainly the result of the accumulation of official gold and foreign-exchange reserves; and was financed, in the main, by an increase in government deposits, the issuing of SARB debentures, an increase in currency in circulation, and the effect of valuation adjustments to the net reserves as a result of exchange rate and gold price movements. These adjustments are reflected in the increase in the Gold and Foreign Exchange Contingency Reserve Account. The Bank’s profit before taxation increased from R2 907 million for the previous financial year to R3 475 million for the financial year ended 31 March 2008. Budgeted expenditure of the Bank for the current financial year amounts to R1,9 billion. The four subsidiary companies of the Bank, namely the South African Mint Company, the South African Bank Note Company, the South African Reserve Bank Captive Insurance Company and the Corporation for Public Deposits achieved their objectives during the financial year. After a review of reports by their Boards of Directors and internal and external auditors, the Bank is satisfied that the subsidiaries are managed in accordance with their objectives and best corporate governance practice. The results of the subsidiaries are reported on a consolidated basis with those of the Bank in the financial statements in the Annual Report. The shares of the Bank continued to trade through the over-the-counter trading facility, implemented on 1 October 2005. During the period 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008, 42 transactions were successfully concluded, representing 69 516 shares. Human resources remain an important focus of the Bank. As at the end of March 2008 the Bank employed 1 896 permanent and 48 contract staff members. The staff turnover rate was about 7 per cent, which is significantly lower than the banking-sector average of about 11 per cent. In terms of overall racial employment equity, the Bank progressed from 43 per cent black employees in 2000 to 58 per cent in 2008. Accordingly, the Bank’s overall target of 50 per cent black employees has been realised and surpassed. At managerial level, 44 per cent of the positions are filled by black employees compared with 18 per cent in 2000. Overall gender equity improved from 42 per cent female employees in 2000 to 47 per cent in 2008. The Bank aims to have 50 per cent female employees at all levels of employment by 2011. Performance management received special attention during the past year. This issue was identified in the Bank’s Seventh Annual Report on the Employment Equity Plan to the Department of Labour as the only remaining barrier to employment equity. A special task team was commissioned to research, investigate and benchmark best practice relating to performance management. The report was finalised and approved by the Remuneration Committee of the Bank. At the Bank we consider the wellness of employees as one of our primary human capital objectives. In this regard, we have updated and modernised clinic facilities that will cater for the well-being of employees. In the area of HIV/AIDS management we have completed prevalence testing, conducted industrial theatres to sensitise staff, and are implementing Bank-wide peer counsellor and educator training. The Bank has always considered training and development to be of paramount importance. In the past financial year the Bank spent an amount of about R33 million on training, development, study aid, bursaries, skills development levies and educational grants. The Cadet Graduate Programme of the Bank increased its intake from 10 in the previous year to 17 in 2008. The College formed a strategic alliance with the University of South Africa and the Institute of Bankers in South Africa to offer a nationally recognised qualification, namely the Advanced Diploma in Central Banking, which is also prescribed for the Cadet Graduate Programme. 6 BIS Review 111/2008 
A number of high-level workshops and seminars were organised by the College for specific niche markets. The second biennial conference on Challenges for Monetary Policy-makers in Emerging Markets is being organised and is scheduled to take place in October 2008. Business continuity plans have been developed and successfully tested for all critical business processes. The Bank further continues to contribute towards the establishment and maintenance of a resilient business continuity capability within the broader financial sector, including the cash management industry. The upgrading of the back-up uninterrupted power supply for Head Office is in progress. This is being done to prevent interruptions in Bank operations as a result of unplanned power disruptions. The Bank has also embarked on a project to investigate the energy efficiency and environmental friendliness of its buildings. This project should result in a reduction in the consumption of electricity and fuel. Planning is in progress for several projects at the various branches around the country to ensure the efficient distribution of currency. The design for the proposed new Bloemfontein Branch has commenced, and tenders are awaited for extensive additions and alterations to the East London Branch. The new cafeteria at the Pretoria North Branch has been completed. Furthermore, the Cape Town Tower Block will be upgraded and the Johannesburg Branch will undergo major repairs. At Head Office large projects aimed at enhancing the existing infrastructure have been completed. These include the replacement of carpets, modernisation of lifts and maintenance of the air-conditioning system. The upgrading of the fire protection and evacuation systems, and the project to improve accessibility for people with disabilities are under way. Conclusion Global and domestic developments are expected to continue to pose a challenge to monetary policy in the coming year. In the international markets heightened volatility is expected to persist and growth in industrialised countries is expected to moderate further. The outlook for commodity prices is therefore uncertain and this makes for a difficult monetary policy environment. The Bank will continue to focus on bringing inflation down to within the inflation target range. The objective of the Bank remains to achieve and maintain low inflation in the interest of sustainable economic growth. During times of global financial market instability it is even more important to maintain vigilance over the payment system, domestic financial markets and the banking system in particular. After the successful implementation of Basel II, the Bank will continue to monitor closely the domestic banks not only with respect to the possible impact of global developments, but also to the impact of tighter credit conditions on indebted households and firms. Staff development will remain one of our strategic objectives. There will be a continued focus on training and development within the context of our Employment Equity Plan. Appropriate training is a benefit not only to the individual, but more generally to the Bank and the wider economy. Acknowledgements I wish to thank the Presidency, the Government and Parliament for their continued support. The Bank maintained a good working relationship with the National Treasury through the system of bilateral committees. Furthermore, I wish to thank the Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance, and the Director-General of the National Treasury and his staff for their ongoing support and co-operation. BIS Review 111/2008 7 
Sincere thanks are also due to the members of the Board of the Bank for their tireless efforts in ensuring appropriate corporate governance in the Bank. I welcome Mr Elias Masilela who has been appointed to the Board as a government representative. He takes the place of Prof. Vishnu Padayachee whose term of office expired last year. I wish to take this opportunity to thank Prof. Padayachee for his valuable contributions to the Bank over the past years. The successes achieved in dealing with the challenges of the past year are due to the continued dedication and commitment of the deputy governors, management and staff of the Bank. I wish to thank them all for their contributions and I am confident that these efforts will ensure that the coming year is even more successful. 8 BIS Review 111/2008 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Ehrenplaquette of the city of Frankfurt am Main – awarding ceremony Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the awarding ceremony of the Ehrenplaquette of the city of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, 15 September 2008. *      *      * Sehr geehrte Frau Oberbürgermeisterin, sehr geehrter Herr Stadtverordnetenvorsteher, hochgeschätzte Vertreter des Konsularischen Corps, meine Damen und Herren, hier im Frankfurter Römer habe ich seit meinem Amtsantritt als Präsident der Europäischen Zentralbank vor bald fünf Jahren schon öfter gestanden und zu geladenen Gästen gesprochen. Heute freue ich mich ganz besonders, das Wort zu ergreifen. Ich möchte mich aus ganzem Herzen dafür zu bedanken, dass die Stadt Frankfurt mich mit ihrer Ehrenplakette auszeichnet. Zentralbanken eine Heimat in seinen Mauern. So zunächst der Bank deutscher Länder, dann der Deutschen Bundesbank und seit 1998 außerdem der Europäischen Zentralbank. Für die Auszeichnung, die mir heute hier zuteil wird, gilt mein Dank zunächst meinen Kollegen im Direktorium der Europäischen Zentralbank und den Mitarbeitern. Sie alle haben Ihren nachhaltigen Einsatz geleistet, um die Zusammenarbeit mit der Stadt Frankfurt in so konstruktiver und professioneller Weise zu gestalten und haben durch Ihr persönliches Engagement den Beitrag zum Kulturleben dieser Stadt erst ermöglicht. Diese gemeinsame Leistung ist die Grundlage für diese Ehrung, die Verleihung der „Ehrenplakette der Stadt Frankfurt“. Ich bin glücklich, mich in die Reihe der Zentralbankpräsidenten einreihen zu dürfen, die vor mir die Ehrenplakette der Stadt Frankfurt erhalten haben, darunter mein leider viel zu früh verstorbener Vorgänger Willem F. Duisenberg. Lassen Sie mich nun kurz auf die ersten zehn Jahre der Existenz der Europäischen Zentralbank eingehen. 1.  The ECB after 10 years Ten years ago, on 1 June 1998, the European Central Bank was founded, together with the European System of Central Banks, the ESCB. The primary mandate of the ECB and the ESCB was, and is, to preserve price stability and to safeguard the credibility of Europe's single currency, the euro, which was created seven months later.  It was the will of the democracies of Europe that led to the creation of the ECB . Its mandate and its independence in fulfilling its mandate were given by the people of Europe on a multi-national and multi-partisan basis. We are faithful to our mandate because we are faithful to the democratic will of the Member States.  What can we say now, after ten years? Since day one, the single currency has fully inherited the degree of credibility and confidence that was the privilege of the most credible national currencies before the euro. The credibility was such that the medium and long-term market rates of the euro were at the same low level as those experienced by the most reliable national currencies before. In spite of a series of global shocks resulting from the prices of oil and commodities, yearly inflation since 1 January 1999 has been 2.1% on average. Price stability in the medium term is essential not only because it protects the incomes of all our fellow citizens – and particularly the most vulnerable and poorest ones – but also because it is one of the preconditions for growth and job creation. Since the euro came into being about 16 million new jobs have been created, over one million more than on the other side of the Atlantic. BIS Review 110/2008 1 
The first ten years have been extremely busy for the Executive Board, for the Governing Council, for the ECB and for the Eurosystem. The extraordinary motivation of our staff members is, in my opinion, due to their awareness of, and pride in, making history.  The single currency is the most advanced feature of European unity and in many respects its emblem. We owe it to the lucidity of the founding fathers and to the determination of a series of visionary leaders. To them we owe an immense debt of gratitude. Gratitude also to the leaders who maintained a steady hand during the 1990s in the run-up to the euro, in a very difficult environment.  This anniversary is no time for complacency. But for continuous efforts, because the challenges lying ahead for Monetary Union will be numerous and demanding. As one of the major central banks in the industrialised world, we, like the others, have three challenges to cope with in our monetary policy-making: rapid technological progress, globalisation in all its dimensions, including the transformation of global finance, and population ageing.  On top of those three major challenges, the ECB and the Eurosystem have to cope with two other important, self-assigned challenges. The first is the deepening of economic and financial integration at continental level, the progressive completion of a single economy with a single currency; we are the only central bank which is actively contributing to a major structural transformation of its own economy. The second is enlargement: we are called upon to extend progressively the euro area across the European Union as a whole; we are also the only central bank to undertake such an endeavour. Economic Union itself has its own challenges. I see three major challenges for the Eurogroup, for the governments of the euro area and for the Commission. The full and complete implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is a crucial component of EMU in the absence of a European federal budget. The resolute pursuit of structural reforms in line with the Lisbon process, which are decisive in order to raise the long-term growth potential of Europe. And the lucid monitoring of the national competitive indicators, including unit labour costs.  Europe can count on the ECB and on the Eurosystem to implement in this century the historic task which was assigned to us at the end of the last century. We will be faithful to the primary mandate given to us by the Treaty. We know that our fellow citizens are asking us to deliver price stability. We know also that price stability is a prerequisite for financial stability, a very important objective at the current juncture. All the members of the Governing Council make their decisions taking into account the interests of the whole of the euro area, of 15 countries. We do not consider any particular country, but all 15 of them. And as I said, in the current juncture there is no place for complacency but for permanent credible alertness. 2.  The ECB and its relations with Frankfurt During its first ten years the ECB has developed excellent relations with its environment here in Frankfurt, be it with the institutions of the city or with the population. At the beginning there were still some taxi drivers who did not understand immediately where to bring a passenger who just said: “European Central Bank, please”. Today, the situation is quite different. And the ECB has endeavoured to spread the knowledge of what is happening in there. We do that via our publications or our Website but also by inviting the public to come inside the ECB. Therefore, we participated in the Skyscraper festivals of 2001 and 2007, following the example of our forerunner, the European Monetary Institute which did so in 1996 and 1998. In the framework of our 10th anniversary we held an Open Day on 1 June, and about 1,000 visitors could get first hand information of the role and functions of the ECB. In addition, we regularly explain our work to groups of visitors from around the world, and among them of course citizens from Frankfurt and the Rhein-Main area. In 2007 their number reached 13,500 altogether and each visitor did not only see the ECB but also the city of Frankfurt. For completeness, I wish to also mention our taking part in the Osthafenfest and in the Luminale, 2 BIS Review 110/2008 
during which the Großmarkthalle was fantastically illuminated. Also, ECB staff participated in dragon boat races and got the enthusiastic support from the public and their colleagues on the banks of the Main. The ECB is a European body, and its staff is now composed of nationals from the 27 Member States of the European Union. Every day, I enjoy the multi-cultural atmosphere at the ECB which is stimulating as it brings fresh ideas into our professional life because of the different experiences, work styles and cultural backgrounds only to name a few of the inspiring factors. Our daily encounter with the richness of European heritage brought us to the thought to let the public participate in this understanding. We did so by launching the Cultural Days of the European Central Bank which we have organised every year since 2003. The basic concept is to feature each time aspects of the variety and affluence of the culture of one of the Member States of the European Union, and bring it to Frankfurt to present it to the citizens of the Rhine-Main region and beyond, with events covering music, literature, film, and modern dance. Furthermore, we offer lectures about different topics, art and photographic exhibitions and events for children. After having started with Portugal in 2003, it was Poland’s turn in 2004, followed in 2005 by Hungary, in 2006 by Austria and in 2007 by Greece. This year we did not focus on the culture of only one Member State but presented for our 10th birthday a kaleidoscope of the culture of all 27 EU countries in a combination of different events. In 2009 we will return to the traditional pattern and have selected Romania as the next single country.  In the organisation of the Cultural Days the ECB can rely in particular on the precious support from the central banks of the relevant theme countries which are, among other things, an important factor in the selection and financing of the programme. However, we have over the years also extremely well cooperated with the city of Frankfurt, and I wish to thank the Lord Mayor and the other members of the city government or parliament very, very much for their assistance and contributions to the Cultural Days which I hope have enriched the international flavour of the city. 3.  Closing remark Sehr geehrter Frau Oberbürgermeisterin, meine Damen und Herren, die EZB, ihr Management und ihre Belegschaft fühlen sich seit zehn Jahren in Frankfurt sehr wohl. Ich danke Ihnen nochmals aufrichtig für die Ehrung, die ich sehr gerne im Namen des Direktoriums und unserer Mitarbeiter entgegennehme.  Vielen Dank für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit. BIS Review 110/2008 3 
Philipp Hildebrand: Financial stability Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Lausanne, Lausanne, 16 September 2008. The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * During the period of financial market turbulence, central banks have gone far with their interventions to stabilize the financial system, taking into account the high costs that can be imposed by a banking crisis onto the real economy. Central banks by themselves, however, cannot guarantee financial stability in the long term. In particular, we cannot exclude that their interventions create incentives for banks to be less cautious in the future. The first line of defence therefore consists of banks having sound risk management practices and holding appropriate levels of capital and liquidity. The Financial Stability Forum has made a series of recommendations in this respect. Given the size of the big Swiss banks in relation to our national economy, we should be especially prudent. For this reason, the Swiss National Bank supports the project undertaken by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC) to strengthen capital adequacy requirements and to revise the liquidity requirements for the big banks. As the SFBC has pointed out on several occasions, these measures have to be implemented gradually – to ensure that banks have sufficient time to adapt. These measures will contribute to the solidity and credibility of the Swiss financial centre. This will strengthen its position as a global leader in wealth management. BIS Review 110/2008 1 
Lucas Papademos: China and the European Union – global economic challenges and policy responses Speech by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Hamburg Summit: “China meets Europe”, Hamburg, 11 September 2008. *      *      * I.  Introduction  Dear Lord Mayor Von Beust, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a privilege and pleasure for me to be in Hamburg today to address this distinguished audience on some important and topical policy issues concerning the rapidly growing economic relations between China and Europe. The Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg provides an ideal stage for addressing these issues. Hamburg’s history as a great port and trading metropolis bears testimony to how openness to commerce and exchange generates growth and prosperity. Still today, Hamburg is the second-largest port in Europe, and ranks ninth in the world. It is thus not surprising that China is Hamburg’s most important and fastest growing trade partner, accounting for more than one third of total shipments. Hamburg is, therefore, one of the most vital points where Europe meets China. Today, I would like to discuss the economic relations between the European Union and China in the context of the major policy challenges being faced by both our economies in an environment of increasing global interdependence. I will examine, in particular, the role of economic reforms and monetary policy in addressing the challenges stemming from the marked slowdown in global economic growth and the persistently high inflation, and will assess their effects for the China-EU economic relationship. Let me start with a brief review of key features of the bilateral trade between the EU and China and related policy issues.  II.  The trade dimension of the China-EU economic relationship Trade between the 27 members of the European Union and China has expanded at an impressive pace, especially since China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at the end of 2001. China has indeed become the second largest trading partner of the EU since 2005, while it was ranking fourth in 1999. From China’s perspective, the relative importance of the EU in total trade has grown even more impressively: the EU is now the first trading partner of China, having overtaken both the United States and Japan since 2005. Increasing trade with China has clearly implied major benefits for Europe. Our economy has benefited, at least over a certain period of time, from the favourable impact on inflation resulting through various channels from the lower cost of imported manufactured and intermediate goods. Moreover, increased competition has provided a further stimulus for the introduction of structural reforms to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the European economy. So, why do we Europeans occasionally express concern about the expanding trade and, more generally, the economic ties between the EU and China? I think that there are many bad and some good reasons. The main reason, in my view, is that Europe can not yet reap the full potential benefits of free trade owing to certain “asymmetries” characterising the EU-China trade relationship. Let me first illustrate this with some figures. While China is the EU’s main import partner, it is only its fourth largest export partner. In 2007, the value of EU imports from China was 231 billion euro, almost four times higher than the imports from Japan. The EU’s exports to China amounted to almost 72 billion euro, that is, less than one third of the imports from China. The EU currently exports more to Switzerland, a country with only 7.5 million inhabitants, than to China! As a result of this asymmetry, the EU’s trade deficit with China was 160 billion euro in 2007, accounting for 86% of the EU total trade BIS Review 110/2008 1 
deficit. To put it differently, the total trade deficit of the EU of 186 billion euro very much reflects the sizeable imbalance in the European-Chinese trade. There are several explanations for the EU-China trade imbalance. A significant part of it is, of course, the natural outcome of market forces. For instance, the large Chinese trade surpluses in the textiles and IT sectors can be explained by China’s competitive advantage and specialisation in labour-intensive production. In addition, due to its increasing role as an “assembling hub”, China has become an export platform in Asia, meaning that several goods that were previously exported directly from other Asian countries are now exported from China. At the same time, while Europe has a comparative advantage in the production of high value-added goods, such as pharmaceuticals and machinery, we do not observe significant surpluses in the trade of any of these products.  Why does Europe not export more of the products where it has a comparative advantage to China? And, more generally, what other factors can explain the observed asymmetries in the EU-China economic relationship? One possible explanation is that European firms are not able to successfully export high-tech goods to China due to difficulties in accessing its domestic market. According to the European Commission, non-tariff barriers in China are indeed estimated to result in a loss of European exports estimated at 20 billion euro, or 30% of total trade.1 Another likely reason relates to the exchange rate between the euro and the Chinese renminbi. While the bilateral exchange rate is only one factor affecting the growing trade deficit, it is difficult to argue that it has had a negligible impact over the years 2002-07: in that period, the Chinese trade surplus with the euro area almost tripled while the Chinese renminbi depreciated vis-à-vis the euro by a cumulative 30%. In 2008, however, the renminbi has so far appreciated against the euro by 9.4%, a welcome development for the balancing of our trade relationship.  III.  Global economic challenges, structural reforms and monetary policy responses  More generally, the observed “asymmetries” characterising the EU-China economic relationship reflect to a large extent differences in the structure and functioning of markets in the two areas as well as differences in the economic and monetary policies pursued. The latter are partly a consequence of differences in domestic economic circumstances and of differences in the policy responses to the global economic challenges. At the present juncture, China and Europe face three main common challenges, albeit to varying degrees: first, a marked slowdown of the global economy and a deteriorating economic outlook; second, persistently high inflation over a prolonged period of time, as a result of past increases in oil and food prices as well as of rising underlying domestic inflationary pressures; and, third, continuing tensions in global financial markets that have intensified in recent months. The magnitude and nature of the economic challenges being faced domestically varies across countries and economic areas. In advanced industrial economies, including the euro area economy, the deceleration of economic growth has turned out to be more marked and abrupt than previously expected. At the same time, the pace of economic activity in many emerging market economies has so far remained relatively strong, although it is moderating. Nevertheless, the further weakening of economic activity in most advanced industrial economies is progressively having spill-over effects, through trade and financial markets, on emerging market economies. The hypothesis of decoupling of the growth performance of advanced and emerging economies is increasingly being tested across the globe. The                                                  1  See European Commission (2007), “Future opportunities and challenges in EU-China trade and investment relations 2006-2010”. 2 BIS Review 110/2008 
notable exception is China which continues to experience robust growth, only moderately lower than the growth of 11.5% recorded in 2007. To address these multiple challenges, policy instruments must be used in an effective and consistent way. Effectiveness requires to choose the appropriate policy instrument that can materially contribute to the achievement of an objective in a sustained manner. Consistency requires using the available instruments in a way that is mutually reinforcing. The effective and consistent use of policy instruments should produce outcomes that have a durable overall positive impact on economic performance. Let me elaborate on these propositions by examining the appropriate policy responses to the global economic challenges we face in the euro area and in China, and by assessing their effects on the EU-China economic relationship.  Policy responses in the euro area In the euro area, although the slowdown of the economy is mainly the consequence of the impact of the significant past increases in oil and other commodity prices and of the direct and indirect effects of the ongoing financial turmoil, the growth performance of its economy over the medium and longer run will fundamentally depend on the implementation of further reforms that can raise trend productivity growth, by increasing investment in innovation and education, and raising the utilisation of labour, by enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of labour markets. Such reforms will simultaneously contribute to the moderation of unit labour cost growth and to the more efficient response of both product and labour markets to the adverse shocks buffeting the European economies. As a result, the adjustment of the economy will be facilitated and its shock-absorption capacity strengthened. Moreover, the international competitiveness of the euro area will increase and this will help to reduce some of the asymmetries characterising the China-EU relationship. The question that some will raise is whether such reforms should or can be implemented during a period of heightened uncertainty and reduced consumer confidence. My answer is that if they are properly designed, adequately explained and effectively introduced, such reforms can also help boost confidence in the performance and prospects of the euro area economy, particularly in some of its member states that have experienced a substantial cumulative erosion of competitiveness over the past years. Fiscal policy in the euro area can play a stabilising role during the current slowdown automatically, because our tax systems incorporate stronger income-stabilising mechanisms than is the case in other advanced industrial economies. At the same time, budgetary policies for 2009 and beyond should reflect and fully respect existing policy commitments. The implementation of fiscal policies that aim at sound fiscal positions over the medium-term will contribute to containing inflationary pressures and will enhance the functioning of the automatic stabilisers that can mitigate the impact of shocks over the economic cycle. What is the role of the ECB in addressing the unfavourable combination of persistently high inflation, weakening economic growth and continuing tensions in the financial markets? The objective of the single European monetary policy is unambiguously clear. The overriding goal, in accordance with our mandate, is to preserve price stability over the medium term. The stance of monetary policy must ensure that the high inflation we have been experiencing over a prolonged period of time does not get embedded into medium and longer-term inflation expectations, which should be kept firmly anchored to price stability. Broad-based second-round effects from higher energy and other commodity prices on price and wage-setting should be avoided. In order to address these upside risks to price stability, the Governing Council raised the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points in early July. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments in the period ahead and will do what is necessary to preserve price stability in the euro area over the medium term. BIS Review 110/2008 3 
At the same time, the ECB will continue to manage liquidity in the interbank money market in order to ensure that the very short-term money market rate remains close to the ECB’s main policy rate, as required for the efficient implementation of monetary policy, and to alleviate the persisting pressures in the term money markets, so as to mitigate the impact of the financial turmoil on the banking system and the broader economy. Over the past year, the ECB money market operations have effectively contributed to containing risks to the euro area’s financial stability without changing the stance of monetary policy – as defined by the key ECB interest rates – which remained firmly geared towards the price stability objective. Moreover, although the ECB supplied large amounts of liquidity to the banking system to offset or contain the impact of disturbances to the money market, the injection of additional liquidity was temporary. As a result, the overall amount of bank reserves – central bank money– in the economy has not been augmented, but only the intertemporal allocation and the maturity structure of the central bank funds provided has been affected.  Last week, we announced certain changes in the operational risk framework (collateral framework) of the Eurosystem’s money market operations. These changes did not alter the key elements of this framework – as they did not affect the range of eligible counterparties or the range of eligible collateral – but they did refine some of the framework’s features so as to better contain certain potential risks in the light of changing financial market developments and practices. The changes introduced, which will be effective as of 1 February 2009, aim at striking a balance between preserving the stabilising features of the collateral framework and mitigating risks which could be faced by the Eurosystem in an environment of protracted financial market tensions. Policy responses in China Let me now turn to China and focus on two policy issues that are particularly relevant to the global economic challenges we face and to the strengthening of the EU-China economic relationship. A bright spot in the clouded global economic environment is the continuing resilience of China’s growth. Indeed, the latest consensus forecasts project very strong GDP growth of 9.9% in 2008 and 9.2% in 2009, only moderately lower than the economic expansion of 11.5% in 2007. The remarkably robust growth outlook of the Chinese economy is however surrounded by uncertainty in the light of the sharp slowdown in most advanced industrial economies and the declining pace of economic activity in a number of emerging market economies. At the same time, inflation pressures in China intensified in late 2007 and early 2008. Although headline inflation declined in recent months, average annual CPI inflation is forecast2 to be 6.9% in 2008, about 2 percentage points higher than the average annual inflation rate in the previous year and the inflation target set at the beginning of 2008. Moreover, the rise in underlying inflationary pressure is more visible in nominal wage growth, which according to some estimates was above 18% in the second quarter of this year, after having reached a peak of over 19% in the first quarter. If wage developments are indicative of domestic underlying inflationary pressures, a key issue is how China will contain potentially significant inflation risks which could undermine the sustainability of its extraordinary growth performance. A second important issue is the implication of the combination of fast growth and rising inflation in China for the global inflation prospects, both because of potential effects on the prices of its exports and, especially, because of the large share of the growth in the demand for commodities by China in the growth of total global demand for commodities.3                                                 2  Consensus forecast for average annual CPI inflation in 2008. 3  In 2007, it was estimated that the growth in the demand for oil by China accounted for just over 47 % of the increase in total global demand in that year. 4 BIS Review 110/2008 
These two issues are intimately linked because the sustainability of growth depends on establishing an environment of low inflation, of price stability. Moreover, to “maintain the stability of the value of the currency and thereby promote economic growth” requires the preservation of domestic price level stability. To secure these goals, monetary policy has to be fully geared towards achieving the internal price stability objective, as is the case in the euro area. But to successfully achieve price stability requires allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility, since pegging the exchange rate vis-à-vis another currency or a basket or currencies, or tightly managing the exchange rate, effectively limits the room of manoeuvre for monetary policy. These arguments underscore the importance of the steps that have been taken by the Chinese authorities since the exchange rate reform in July 2005: they have formally delinked from the hard peg against the US dollar, allowed an appreciation of the renminbi in effective terms, promoted the development of the local foreign exchange market, and set up a policy framework that has the potential to deliver even greater exchange rate flexibility. As a result of these measures, the renminbi has appreciated by almost 17% in real and around 15% in nominal effective terms. These developments are welcome and should be praised since they contribute to the achievement of external and internal stability. But are these steps sufficient in the light of the global and domestic challenges we all face? In July 2008, the Chinese authorities have emphasised at the highest political level that the central policy objective is “to maintain steady, comparatively fast growth while fighting inflation”.4 The continued emphasis on fighting inflation is especially significant during this period of still strong underlying inflationary pressure. But as a central banker, I would like to add that to win the battle against inflation in any country requires enhancing the room for manoeuvre for monetary policy and the effectiveness of the monetary policy instruments. This would imply allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility, as the continuing substantial foreign exchange inflows and the persistent current account surpluses of China keep augmenting domestic monetary liquidity and increase the costs of sterilisation operations. Moreover, it would require greater reliance on indirect means of monetary control, notably the use of the interest rates as an instrument to better manage liquidity in the money market and influence aggregate demand more effectively. To this end, structural changes are necessary to enhance the functioning of the interbank money market and, more generally, to promote the development of the financial system. Our colleagues at the People’s Bank of China are fully aware of the importance of such reforms and have been taking pertinent measures to strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments in fighting the battle against inflation. Two questions are often asked concerning two perceived trade-offs that may be faced by central banks and economic authorities: First, the potential trade-off between fast, sustained growth and inflation, and, second, the potential trade-off between exchange rate stability and internal price stability. These issues have also been debated extensively and intensively in China in recent years. Let me say that the European experience, as well as the evidence from other advanced as well as emerging market economies, clearly demonstrates that there is no stable trade-off between growth and inflation that can be effectively exploited by policy-makers. Containing inflationary pressures and preserving price stability over the medium term is the best contribution that monetary authorities can make to achieving the objective of sustainable growth. The pace of durable growth can only be strengthened through structural reforms that can increase the economy’s efficiency and productive potential. On this front, we Europeans have made a lot of progress in recent years, but much more remains to be done. With regard to the concerns that have been expressed about the potentially adverse effects of currency appreciation on export performance and the pace of economic growth in China, let me point to the lessons of history. It provides rich evidence from many countries which                                                  4  Excerpt from the statement of the Chinese Politburo issued at end-July 2008. BIS Review 110/2008 5 
adjusted their economy successfully to a stronger currency and became more prosperous as the domestic currency appreciated and internal price stability was secured. Germany’s economic history over the past sixty years offers the best example. It demonstrates the benefits associated with the transition from a fixed exchange rate pegged to the US dollar, to a fixed but adjustable exchange rate, to the eventual adoption of a free float of the Deutsche Mark that allowed for greater monetary policy autonomy. This autonomy was essential for pursuing the primary objective of domestic price stability in Germany in the face of external price shocks without hampering – and indeed even helping to strengthen – its overall competitiveness performance over the medium and longer run. But there are also other success stories of achieving price stability without sacrificing competitiveness among emerging market economies, which, notwithstanding significant appreciation of their real effective exchange rates, have experienced stronger non-inflationary growth that was instrumental in securing those countries’ competitiveness and keeping up export growth. IV.  Concluding remarks The world economy is navigating through heavy seas at the moment. Both China and the European Union are confronted with a number of common challenges as well as specific domestic concerns. In order to address these in an effective and consistent manner, all available policy tools need to be used in an appropriate way. This requires continued progress in implementing the necessary reforms. I think it is fair to say that we all have our homework to do – though the focus of these efforts naturally differs. In Europe, it means, inter alia, focusing on labour and product market reforms, in order to enhance the growth potential of our economies; in China, it means, inter alia, reforms in financial markets and the banking sector, in order to improve financial intermediation and monetary control. As I highlighted in my remarks, one of the common challenges that we all face is the high inflationary pressure affecting the global economy. To master this challenge, it is essential to use monetary policy in an effective and determined manner. The global phenomenon of inflation is perceived in many countries or economic areas as the consequence of an “external” shock. This harbours the risk, if this shock is accommodated, that it will result in sustained inflationary pressure with adverse effects for growth in these countries and beyond. Therefore, concerted efforts by monetary authorities worldwide are needed to fight global inflation. Finally, the combination of stability-oriented monetary policies and continued structural reforms would also help to address some of the asymmetries I referred to earlier and thus further strengthen the bilateral economic relations between Europe and China. Thank you very much for your attention.  6 BIS Review 110/2008 
BIS Review 109/2008 1 Martín Redrado: Financial turbulence – impact on developed and emerging economies (opening address) Opening address by Mr Martín Redrado, Governor of the Central Bank of Argentina, at the Central Bank of Argentina 2008 Money and Banking Conference “Financial turbulence – impact on developed and emerging economies”, Buenos Aires, 1 September 2008. *      *      * During the last years, we have consolidated this conference as an international forum, which includes some of the most renowned academics and monetary policymakers from developed and emerging economies. I very well understand the effort that many of you have made to be here, so I would like to thank all participants and, very especially, those who, coming from abroad, join us every year. Organizing this conference is not an isolated effort. This is part of a comprehensive strategy of being an active professional member of the international financial community. The title of this conference was chosen last year, and it probably is more applicable now than then. The financial turmoil of the past year, which very clearly affected some specific sectors in the U.S., does not recede, and keeps spreading to other markets and regions in the world. There is a general consensus that global economy now poses one of the greatest challenges in the post-war period.  Financial disruptions, through tighter credit conditions and undermined confidence, have imbued the real economy with recession in the main developed countries. The situation is worsened by renewed inflationary pressures, partly due to an unprecedented rise in commodity prices. In this process, there is a convergence of structural factors and cyclical forces associated to the prosperity of the global economy in the previous period. Due to some of these factors and to the implementation of sounder and more prudent macroeconomic policies, emerging economies turned out to be relatively resilient. However, it is not realistic to think that they can be completely “decoupled” from the events in the developed world, especially if the external context continues to deteriorate.  A characteristic of crises is that great efforts are devoted to go through them as quickly as possible. This may occasionally sow the seeds for future problems. In turn, these periods plainly reveal structural weaknesses. Looking forward, one of the crucial issues to focus on is how to unwind the massive interventions and collaterals used by the most important central banks. In my view, the extensive liquidity provided was a necessary response. It is arguable whether or not there was a late response and if it would have been better to have had a preestablished framework. This might have allowed better assessing the effects and providing a more predictable scenario by specifying in advance the measures for reabsorbing that liquidity in the future.  In the emerging world, there is no doubt that a structurally growing demand is in place, not only for food but also for energy, minerals, metals and all sorts of commodities. Expansion in developing countries is mostly due to a process by which large emerging regions are catching up with improved living standards. Against this backdrop, recovery of credit and financing is essential to solve the income and price challenges faced by the global economy. If there is a clear message to draw from this crisis, it is that there is no such thing as “one size fits all”. A few days ago, in Jackson Hole, the focus was on how to prevent the crisis from worsening and maintain stability in this new context. The most important lesson I have 
2 BIS Review 109/2008 learnt is that there is no optimal solution in abstracto. Especially, when dealing with complex economic policy dilemmas. This brings about the existence of so-called “financial cycles” and markets tendency to instability that may result in severe macroeconomic disruptions. The world faces an unprecedented combination of negative economic events: financial crisis, recession and inflation. This phenomenon is very rare for developed economies. For emerging economies, unfortunately, this trinity is much more familiar. In our way, we have a long experience in dealing with the consequences of these critical events. In fact, several of the problems we are currently discussing are surprisingly recurrent and show that there are similarities between crises. These factors, together with some new elements which made recent adjustments somewhat dramatic (such as the role of new financial instruments and players), have forced us, policymakers, to implement original solutions. During past decades, crises in the emerging world have helped clarify the connection between the objectives of monetary and financial stability. As currently takes place in the developed world, it also highlights the importance of liquidity and capital regulation. In times of hardship, it is necessary to have in hand criterions to temporarily apply “reduction ratios” to adjust capital requirements for the instruments most affected by the crisis resolution mechanisms. This is based on systemic factors, which are somehow involuntary for institutions operating under these conditions. This approach buys the system some time (a relatively less scarce resource in times of crisis) and minimizes the need for a government capitalization. In this new framework, central banks from the main developed economies also had to revise their usual regulation, operation and intervention mechanisms. By implementing new facilities, they significantly expanded their scope. As a result of the difficulties experienced by bear sterns and, despite the fact that the prudential regulation and supervision network was focused on the behavior of commercial banks, the fed “throw away the textbook”. Because of its critical role in the process of credit generation, and for being involved in a complex network of financial transactions, the eventual bankruptcy of an investment bank in a context of generalized leverage was expected to cause systemic events. This new prominence of market-based intermediaries will have long lasting effect on the creation of the theoretical schemes behind monetary policy. As usual, and regardless of undeniable costs, times of crisis are breeding ground for creativity, but also for the inevitable revision of previously accepted principles. In times of turmoil, theoretical consensus on “what to do” and “how to do it” tends to vanish. In other words, if the relationship between economic theory and policy recommendations is reasonably well defined during “normal” times, in times of turmoil, this relationship becomes much weaker.  Admittedly, sometimes this may be due to the relative complacency characterizing boom periods, and to the inadvertent way in which changes build up, with consequences that become apparent very vividly when it is perhaps already too late.  As I see it, “the perfect storm” is revealing us the non linearity of reality, and that our models need to be reformulated and surely made more complex. In other words, every crisis should be seen as an opportunity to revise fundamental structures. It is now clear that financial regulation policies, with their slight variations at a global level, were to be revised. The excellent paper recently presented by Adrian and Shin of the Federal Reserve of New York is definitely a step in the right direction. This paper has, at least, two elements worth considering: first, it reintroduces financial intermediation as an essential part of economic models and second, it gives monetary aggregates a role to play in the central bank policy function again. 
BIS Review 109/2008 3 In addition, it arrives at a conclusion that I have been claiming in discussions with my colleagues for some time: far from being disconnected, financial stability objectives and the rest of the traditional monetary policy objectives are two sides of the same coin. That is, we have reached a point in which economic theory is having a hard time keeping up with praxis. For this reason, the costs and benefits of policies becomes blurring, posing significant challenges to central bankers. The difference is that now these challenges are not only faced by emerging countries, like in the past, but also haunts the developed world. This highlights the importance of “the risk management approach” in the design of precautionary strategies for monetary policy. In fact, the crisis afforded central banks of developed economies some flexibility in their instruments. We, as monetary authorities in emerging countries, are much more used to employ diverse tools.  This reflects the need for a more pragmatic approach, derived from a less linear reality and with traditional transmission mechanisms that are not as deep. Even the emerging countries with inflation targeting regimes were forced to make their systems more flexible to face a new inflationary environment resulting from a changing global economic structure. In the end, we all operate under similar principles, but are surrounded by different realities, circumstances and idiosyncracies.  This reminds me of José Ortega y Gasset's expression in Meditations on the Quixote, “I am myself plus my circumstance”.  With this, I am not proposing a return to the classical dilemma of rules versus discretion in monetary theory during the 1980s. I believe that Kydland and Prescott, as well as Barro and Gordon have been very convincing. In my opinion, we should discuss the possibility of giving equal weight to the rules and the need for a flexible response to specific events; these events are the ones precisely not considered in the design of those rules due to their low likelihood of occurrence. In policy design, monetary authorities should explicitly try to avoid ex ante the emergence of imbalances that could lead to financial instability. The aim is to “reduce the frequency and severity of bouts of financial instability in the future”, as Ben Bernanke argues. Recent literature has shown results that are ambiguous or even contrary to those yielded by the usual “technology”. As regards the rules implemented via the interest rate channel, in the past 15 years the conventional wisdom was that short-term interest rates could be used to change the whole yield curve and thus affect economic agents’ decisions. Recent work shows that this may not be the case and that the impact of short-term rates on real variables is substantially different. In turn, a 2007 paper by Black and Rosen shows that the effect of the interest rate policy varies according to the bank’s size and that it has an asymmetric impact between small and large bank customers. My reading is clear: the intellectual stature and experience of all players involved in the controversy prove that there is no single policy or one optimal approach that could be defined in a vacuum. Every policy option has its costs and benefits: there is no such thing as a free lunch. The key is to choose whether we want to avoid “going long” or “falling short”. Naturally, beyond any attempt to mitigate this trade-off, the strategy and policy choice will crucially depend on the attitudes of the government and its people towards risk.  It will also depend on their intertemporal considerations, because the profit and loss profile of alternative regimes will not always coincide. Furthermore, past trends in the relevant economy and the starting conditions will naturally affect our policy choice. Our Central Bank’s approach to monetary policy in and for the specific circumstances of the Argentine economy can be understood in this framework. This approach is three-fold: (1) a robust monetary policy that ensures the equilibrium between supply and demand (2) a 
4 BIS Review 109/2008 counter-cyclical scheme of foreign reserve accumulation to mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce macroeconomic volatility; and (3) a managed floating exchange rate regime.  Our economy has been systematically prone to recurring and marked macroeconomic instability episodes. The occurrence of shocks (in terms of trade or in the conditions to access external financing, among others) and the existence of shock-amplifying mechanisms have been a source of recurring macroeconomic instability in the past. These trends were often underscored by the macroeconomic policy itself, which tended to behave procyclically. This explains the preventive approach underlying the current monetary policy design and also reveals our asymmetric approach to the shocks affecting the domestic economy. On numerous occasions we have insisted on the idea that the past haunts us and leads us to adopt a prudent and asymmetrical strategy in response to exogenous forces: until enough evidence proves otherwise, we are forced to “dramatically shift the burden of proof” and assume that every negative shock is permanent and that, a priori, positive forces are temporary. Naturally, this has a bearing on economic policy as a whole. Therefore, a prudent fiscal strategy of building up excess savings in good times should be a natural consequence of this asymmetric approach to shocks. The same happens in the monetary and financial field. The buildup of liquidity buffers in good times allows us to weather the storm in an unprecedented way for our history, both for exogenous and endogenous reasons. In the past few months, we took strong measures to ensure monetary and financial stability. We noticed a marked mis-alignment in the demand for money which activated the warning signs on our control panel. In other words, there was a diversion in one of the variables from values provided by our scheme in the base scenario. Private sector deposits experienced a temporary decline of 8% in less than a month during may. To put it in perspective, in three months, deposits fell by 17% during the Tequila Effect.  Taking all this into account, and having assessed the costs and benefits of using each instrument, we focused all our efforts in restoring money market equilibrium. This is no more than a professional response based on the risk management approach applied to the Argentine monetary policy. The Central Bank surgically and sequentially implemented a set of ten measures. First, we strengthened the demand for Argentine pesos and once the foreign exchange market was relatively calm, we undertook actions to reinstate liquidity, so as to ensure financial stability and the well functioning of the payment system. In fact, we adopted the following prudential scheme: 1) First, we adapted our operations in the repo market: we established a scheme to offer liquidity at a fixed (up to 3 billion ar pesos) and a variable (badlar) interest rate. By offering a wider variety of options, we ensured the availability of resources in appropriate conditions to provide liquidity to the system. 2) We renewed only partially central bank securities coming due and repurchased some others with near term maturities. 3) We extended the limits to operate in the futures market, both for the Central Bank and some of its counterparties.  4) We allowed the reference foreign exchange rate for futures and forward transactions between the Central Bank and its counterparties to be settled by the Emerging Market Traders Association (EMTA). This measure is clearly a vote of confidence in our approach. 
BIS Review 109/2008 5 5) We begun to do open market operations through government securities market by purchasing instruments that can be liquidated in pesos or dollars in the secondary market. This mechanism worked as an additional tool to provide liquidity beyond the banking sector, and at the same time, enabled the intervention on the different segments of the yield curve, avoiding distortions in its temporal structure. 6) To alleviate the seasonal effects on the traditionally illiquid month of July, we unified the financial institutions’ minimum cash requirement for June and July in a single bi-monthly term. This improves the institutions’ liquidity management. 7) We developed a mechanism for US dollar-denominated repo supply. This was an additional way to ensure dollar supply at times when the dollar increased its share in investors’ portfolios and when it was necessary to lower depreciation expectations. 8) The Central Bank started to participate in the NDF market with operations up to 12 months and with counterparties whose credit quality was not lower than A-. 9) We opened a new repo window to include as collateral certain instruments (Bogar and guaranteed loans) that cannot be used in traditional repo operations. This enabled institutions that had no significant central bank bills and notes positions in their portfolios to access our liquidity provision mechanisms.   10) Finally, we offered new maturity options for reverse repos, readjusting the cost in line with the new term structure.  That is, the system was adapted through a set of ten measures to stabilize the foreign exchange market and then correct the remaining monetary and financial variables. In a nutshell, we have taken all the necessary steps to ensure full systemic liquidity in pesos and dollars. And, as a result, fluctuations in financial variables were limited, and the real economy was not negatively affected. This is not a change on our policies. It is the same framework implemented in the last few years but facing a different scenario. The current situation is a stress test for the strength of this strategy, and ratifies the consistency and validity of its fundamental pillars.  To sum up, conferences such as this one, featuring many dear colleagues with whom we usually interact in seminars around the world in a peculiar time like the current one, are breeding ground for analyzing the impact of the crisis and its scenarios. Moreover, given the current international economic scenario, history is providing the money and banking conference with a unique opportunity, through a better understanding of reality, to influence policy redesign both in the emerging and the developed world. Welcome to all of you and thank you very much. 
Hu Xiaolian: Recent economic and financial developments in China Remarks by Ms Hu Xiaolian, Deputy Governor of the People’s Bank of China, at the Central Bank of Argentina 2008 Money and Banking Conference “Financial turbulence – impact on developed and emerging economies”, Buenos Aires, 1 September 2008. *      *      * Respected Governor Martín Redrado, Ladies and gentlemen, I feel deeply honored to be invited to come to this beautiful city of Buenos Aires for the seminar. As you know, recent developments in the global economy has been charcterized by a broad-based slowdown, heightened financial market turbulences and rising inflation pressure. I’m very pleased to be able to have frank and in-depth exchange of views with all of you about the challenges China has been facing and measures that have been taken in this context. I.  Recent economic and financial developments in China Since the beginning of 2008, the Chinese economy has maintained a stable and rapid growth momentum in the process of combating against the challenges resulting from historically rare and severe natural disasters and turmoil both in the international and domestic economic and financial conditions. Investment, consumption and export grew in a balanced manner; domestic demand especially consumer demand became a stronger driving force for economic growth; investment grew steadily and investment structure improved; the national economy developed in the desired direction. Urban and rural household income continued to rise, and domestic consumer demand remained strong. In the first half of the year, the per capita disposable income of urban residents registered 8065 yuan, a year-on-year growth of 14.4 percent or 6.3 percent in real terms; the per capita cash income of farmers was 2528 yuan, a year-on-year growth of 19.8 percent or 10.3 percent in real terms. The steady income increase in both urban and rural areas supported the continued growth of consumption. In the first half of 2008, the gross volume of retail sales reached 5.1 trillion yuan, representing nominal growth of 21.4 percent or real growth of 12.9 percent, 0.2 percentage points higher than that in the same period of the last year. Among the total, retail sales in urban China grew 22.1 percent to 3.5 trillion yuan, and retail sales in counties, townships, and villages grew 20.0 percent to 1.6 trillion yuan. The growth gap between the urban and rural areas was 2.1 percentage points, 0.4 percentage points wider than the same period of last year. Fixed-asset investment grew steadily with an improved investment structure. In the first half of the year, fixed-asset investment totaled 6.8 trillion yuan, representing a year-on-year growth of 26.3 percent and an acceleration of 0.4 percentage points. Urban fixed-asset investment reached 5.8 trillion yuan, up 26.8 percent year on year, while rural fixed-asset investment posted 996.6 billion yuan, up 23.2 percent, an acceleration of 0.1 and 1.7 percentage points respectively from the same period of the last year. In terms of geographical distribution, fixed-asset investment in eastern, central and western China grew 22.4 percent, 35.3 percent and 28.6 percent respectively, with central and western China growing much faster than eastern China. In terms of the sectoral distribution, fixed-asset investment growth in the three industries registered 69.5 percent, 26.6 percent, and 26.2 percent respectively, with the primary industry representing an acceleration of 32.0 percentage points, much higher than that of the second and the tertiary industries, whose growth was relatively stable. BIS Review 109/2008 1 
In the first half of the year, GDP grew 10.4 percent year on year to 13.1 trillion yuan, a deceleration of 1.8 percentage points from the previous year; the consumer price index was up 7.9 percent, an acceleration of 4.7 percentage points; the trade surplus posted US$99 billion, a decline of 13.2 billion from that in the same period of the last year; the actually utilization of foreign direct investment totaled US$52.4 billion, an acceleration of 33.4 percentage points from the previous year. II.  Issues and challenges facing China’s economy 1.  Inflation has become the primary concern in China’s economy. China is currently facing excessively increasing pressures on prices. Since Q4 2006, driven by large increases in food prices, the CPI has grown at a relatively rapid pace. In the first half of 2008, the year-on-year CPI grew at a historically high rate of 7.9 percent. The formation of China’s current inflation is complicated, and is a result of various factors. First, external factors have impact on domestic prices, such as large widespread rise in prices of global commodities, foods and assets, and inflation imported from developed and other emerging market economies. Even though the appreciation of the RMB has somewhat offset the impact, the driving force of the imported inflation remains strong. Second, due to the limited supply, prices of important commodities such as pork have risen rather quickly. Third, the rising cost of labor and price adjustment of resources exerted upward pressures on prices. The cost of labor and the imported inflation are reinforcing with each other resulting in spiraling prices. 2.  The impact of sub-prime mortgage crisis on China’s economy cannot be ignored. Although the sub-prime mortgage crisis has a limited direct impact on China’s economy, it can never be ignored. First, the U.S. economic growth of and the growth of China’s export are strongly and positively related, and the lower growth of the U.S. economy will most likely affect China’s export and its economic growth. Second, uncertainties in capital flows have risen and a large amount of international capital flew into China, as a result of successive cuts in policy rates by the Federal Reserve, the continuing depreciation of the U.S. dollar and the turmoil in the international financial markets. Third, the continuing deprecation of the U.S. dollar increased the prices of global commodities denominated in the U.S. dollar, putting comparatively huge imported inflationary pressures on China. Fourth, China’s foreign exchange reserve management faces big challenges after the sub-prime crisis. Changes in major international reserve currencies, such as the Euro and the U.S. dollar are becoming more and more unpredictable, thus complicating the management of China’s foreign exchange reserves. Fifth, the inflationary pressure and the sub-prime crisis has heightened the moderation risk of China’s economic growth. External shocks constitute the greatest risk this year for China’s economy , which has become a major pare of the global economy . Although the inflationary pressure and the sub-prime crisis have negative impact, they will not change the fundamentals of China’s economy, which will maintain a rather rapid growth rate. III.  China’s recent monetary policy The Chinese government has placed anti-inflation as its top priority for a long time. In light of the apparent movements in the price level, at end-2007 China made it a top priority to “prevent rapid growth from turning into overheating and to prevent structural price rises from becoming generalized inflation” in macro adjustment policies. Recently, China stressed once again to put maintaining stable and rapid economic growth and curbing excessive price hikes 2 BIS Review 109/2008 
as the top priority of macroeconomic management, and put reining in inflation high on its agenda. In the first half of 2008, the PBC took the following measures to implement monetary policy: The first was to raise reserve requirement ratio to absorb excess liquidity. The PBC raised the reserve requirement ratio on many occasions. After the reserve requirement ratio was raised by one percentage point on June 7, except for certain financial institutions and quake-hit areas, the reserve requirement ratio of most financial institutions was 17.5 percent. The rise of reserve requirement ratio absorbed a lot of liquidity, eased the inflationary pressure, avoided the rapid increase of interest rate, and contained hot-money inflows. The second was to flexibly conduct the open market operations. In light of short-term liquidity demand of the banking system and changes of fund demands of financial institutions in the first half of 2008, the PBC flexibly used a mix of instruments, rationalized their maturity structures, kept interest rate stable in the course of open market operations, guided market expectation, and conducted cash management of the state treasury when appropriate. The third was to strengthen “window guidance” and credit guidance. Efforts were made to guide financial institutions to strengthen credit regulation and extend loans in a sound and balanced manner during the year, so as to prevent volatile movements of lending activities. Measures were taken to encourage growth in some sectors while discouraging it in others and rationalize the credit structure. Efforts were made to restrict loans extended to highly energy-consuming and highly polluting industries and industries with overcapacity. Credit support was increased to some key areas, such as agriculture, rural areas and farmers, post-disaster reconstruction, small enterprises, the services industry and independent innovation, energy-conservation and environment protection projects, and credit line to small- and medium-sized enterprises was raised. The fourth was to improve the RMB exchange rate formation mechanism reform, and speed up the reform of foreign exchange system. Efforts were made to deepen the reform of the foreign exchange system, appropriately guide the market expectation of RMB exchange rate, strengthen the monitoring over, analysis of and management of cross-border capital flows, and strengthen monitoring over abnormal cross-border capital flows in the trade sector and other areas; to reform the foreign exchange system in trade in service on a pilot basis in some regions; to allow more market participants on the foreign exchange market, and to promote the equilibrium of the balance of payments. The fifth was to steadily promote the reform of financial institutions. For the time being, the stock-holding reform of state-owned banks is further deepened. The corporate governance, business transformation and operation performance of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Bank of China, the China Construction Bank and the Bank of Communications has been upgraded on a continuous basis. The fundamental work for the reform of the Agricultural Bank of China has made significant progress. The commercialization of the China Development Bank was steadily pushed ahead, and the reform of rural credit cooperatives has made big progress and achieved phased results. The aforesaid measures have achieved remarkable results. As the food price decelerates with increased supply and the prices of oil and other commodities on the international market slid recently, China’s CPI declined from 8.7 percent in February to 6.3 percent in July, and future inflationary pressure is expected to further moderate. In the meantime, the monetary and financial situation remained stable. At end-June, broad money M2 stood at RMB 44.3 trillion yuan, representing an increase of 17.4 percent year-on-year, lower than that at end-2007. Deposits and loans of financial institutions increased in a stable manner. In the first half of 2008, outstanding deposits of financial institutions stood at RMB 45.0 trillion yuan, an increase of 17.8 percent year-on-year; outstanding loans of financial institutions registered RMB 30.5 trillion yuan, an increase of 15.2 percent year-on-year. The exchange rate of RMB displayed an overall appreciating trend. The flexibility of the RMB exchange rate was improved, and the connection between RMB and other major currencies became more apparent. As of end-June, the exchange rate of the RMB versus the U.S. Dollar rose by 6.50 percent from the end of last year, and the RMB depreciated by 1.51 percent and 0.63 percent against the Japanese Yen and the Euro respectively from the end of last year. From BIS Review 109/2008 3 
the foreign exchange rate system reform to the end of June 2008, the RMB appreciated by 20.66 percent accumulatively against the U.S. Dollar, depreciated by 7.54 percent against the Euro, and appreciated by 13.33 percent against the Japanese Yen. In the first half of 2008, the daily fluctuation of the RMB central parity averaged 79 basis points, larger than the 62 basis points of that in 2007. The growth of foreign reserves began to decelerate, and is expected to decelerate further. IV.  China’s policy stance to be adopted in the next stage An old Chinese saying goes “ruling a country is like cooking seafood delicacy”, which follows that ruling a country requires the same meticulous efforts as cooking palatable seafood. At present, there are more destabilizing factors in the international economic environment, and problems in China’s economy are becoming more apparent; therefore, we need more patience and wisdom in order to maintain stable and rapid economic development. In the next stage, China will put maintaining stable and rapid economic growth and curbing excessive price hikes as the top priority of macroeconomic management, and put reining in inflation high on its agenda. Efforts will be made to maintain the continuity and stability of monetary policy, increase the foresightedness, pertinence and flexibility of the adjustment policy, adopt fine-tuning measures when appropriate according to changing situation both at home and abroad, manage the priorities, pace and intensity of macroeconomic adjustment, encourage growth of some sectors while discouraging it of others, strengthen financial support to key areas and weak aspects of the economy so as to balance the relationship between containing inflation and maintaining rapid economic growth and promote the economy to grow in a sound and rapid manner. The year 2008 marks the 30th anniversary of China’s reform and opening-up. In the past 30 years, China successfully transformed itself from a command economy to a market economy, from a closed and semi-closed economy to a fully opened-up economy, making outstanding economic and social advancements. China’s GDP has been growing at an average annual rate of 9.7 percent, and foreign trade 17.4 percent, ranking the fourth and the third respectively in the world. People’s living conditions have achieved overall well off. But China is and will stay in the primary stage of socialism for a long time. There are still a lot of poor people in urban and rural areas; urbanization is inadequate; the per capita GDP ranks behind the 100th in the world. Constrained by such a reality, the solution to many problems is a long-term and systemic project. When making policies, consideration should be given to China’s national situation, development stage and affordability. We have recognized that with increasing economic globalization, financial integration driven by financial innovation and diversification of transfer modes of financial risks, more regional and global problems will emerge, and the coordination of macroeconomic policies, monetary policy in particular, among different nations is becoming more and more important. Going forward, to address various problems, China will rely on itself and accelerate reform and development on the one hand, and pay attention to exchange and cooperation with other countries on the other hand. China is willing to continue to increase understanding, share experiences and strengthen cooperation with the rest of the world to create a favorable international environment that is conducive to the development of all countries. Finally, I wish a complete success of the seminar. Thank you! 4 BIS Review 109/2008 
Ardian Fullani: Achievements and challenges of the Albanian banking system  Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the reception for the bankers and representatives of banks operating in Albania, organized by the Albanian Association of Banks, on the occasion of the closing year 2008, Tirana, 18 December 2008. *      *      * Dear Chairman of the Albanian Association of Banks, Dear managers of the Albanian banking system, Thanking you for this invitation, I avail myself of this opportunity to provide some considerations of the path we have been through during 2008 and the challenges ahead us. What we have been through during this fall sounds unreal and somewhat unbelievable. Many taboos have overturned and the list of news enlarges day after day, including also schemes of financial mega-fraud.  I commenced my speech this way so as not to overlook this unusual global event, to provide an outline of the general economic and financial setting surrounding our environment and above all, to underline an immense truth: that the Albanian banking system has shown admirable resilience and that the immunity shown has not only been a matter of luck.  The year 2008 has been an intensive year of ceaseless changes, at the centre of which were the safeguard and consolidation of macroeconomic stability at home and the banking system’s financial stability.  Taking a quick glance at the Albanian economy over the present years, I can state that it has maintained the projected growth for year 2008, under stable consumer prices and domestic currency exchange rate. Monetary policy has been throughout the year 2008 cautious and has kept the key policy rate unchanged at 6.25 percent. In addition, fiscal policy has been characterized by the collection of budget revenues beyond the Government’s projections and by the concentration of expenditures in mainly infrastructure-related projects. As in the recent years, the banking system has sustained the economic activity and consumer demand with loans, hence providing numerous incentives for a stable economic growth.  The positive performance of the economy and of certain economic sectors – in particular trade and construction – has been propelled by the positive rates of domestic demand at home. Lending has maintained its high annual growth rates of 42 percent. As a share of GDP and the system’s assets, loans have recorded further growth to 36 percent and 41 percent, respectively. Businesses were the main banking loans’ users, accounting for 66 percent of loan portfolio growth. This positive performance was associated with a favourable macroeconomic and financial setting. During the second half of the year, the CPI has recorded an annual drop to 2.6 percent in November. In addition, other inflation measures, such as core inflation, traded and non-traded inflation, attest to the downward intensity of inflationary pressures at home. The inflationary expectations of the economic agents have also provided their contribution to this stability. According to our surveys they are anchored to around 3 per cent. These developments attest to the fact that monetary policy and the strengthening of supervisory measures by the Bank of Albania have proved to be effective in containing the inflationary pressures. Taking into account the central bank’s role and objective, I would like to underline that our commitment and success in preserving price stability has been mirrored in the anchoring of the inflationary expectations close to our 3 percent target.  The banking system’s performance for the present year proves to be positive. In the early year 2008, credit registry started to operate. Its establishment represents a key innovation of BIS Review 163/2008 1 
the financial infrastructure in Albania. We all attest to the fact that by putting the credit registry into operation, we have contributed to: • Having basic understanding of credibility of the borrower and avoiding careless borrowers; • Reducing a bank's cost in collecting information on borrowers; • Promoting increased borrower discipline; • Identifying all borrower liabilities and providing such information to lenders; and • Improving the banking industry database, through developing the borrower loan history. According to the latest data, the banking system appears to be lucrative. Return on assets for the entire year 2008 is expected to be 1.17 percent, while return on equity 14.7 percent. During the present year, banks have expanded their investments while augmenting their capital on the other hand. Capital adequacy accounts for 17.5 percent of total assets and off-balance sheet items classified by risk. The liquidity situation of the banking system for year 2008 is presented as good. Despite the downward trend shown in the recent years (owing to the high credit growth rate), liquid assets to total assets in the system account for about 46 percent, which is considered as being satisfactory. The main resource of funds in the system – customer deposits – have been ever-increasingly consolidating their upward trend, mirroring public confidence in the Albanian banking system. As of end October, total deposits in the system amounted to 665.9 billion leks, up by 5.7 percent compared to end-year 2007. Following the open forum this spring, the Supervisory Council paved the way to approving a package of new regulations, which aim at harmonizing the regulatory and supervisory framework with the best international practices.  In accordance with the new banking law, new criteria have been established for measuring, supervising and reporting of bank’s large exposures to a person/customer or a group of related persons/customers or having a special relationship with the bank, aiming at managing the risk stemming from the concentrated exposure to them.  The strengthening of internal control in banks and branches of foreign banks has been another focus of the Bank of Albania during the present year. The new regulation considers internal control as part of bank’s accountable governance. It provides the platform for establishing an efficient internal control system as key factor in the banks and branches of foreign banks’ governance and management.  Special attention has been also paid to the transparency related to banking and financial products and services. The regulation harmonizes the requirements on the way and mode on providing information to customers on banking products and services, on the publication of effective interest rates on deposits and loans, on the method of calculating the effective interest rate on loans, on the constituent elements to be specified in loan and deposit contract, on the marketing of products and services, on keeping the customer’s data confidentiality, on dealing with the customer’s complaints and on the establishment of specific structures to deal with these complaints.  Part of this new package has also been the standardization of the required information that banks and branches of foreign banks have to make public, related to the bank’s main activity, its organization and management, its financial performance, its financial situation, the risk management and the accounting policies.  2 BIS Review 163/2008 
In light of the international situation and in order to better diversify the risk stemming from the concentration in banks’ investments in the international financial markets, the Supervisory Council of the Bank of Albania amended the regulation on the management of risk from banks’ large exposures, aiming at reducing large exposures’ threshold.  Enhancing the efficiency of the financial market and of the money market in particular, has also been at the central bank’s focus. During the year 2008 was approved the regulation on the master repurchase agreement, hence providing a new instrument which reduces risk in borrowing transactions between banks.  After this short outline of our performance, of the Bank of Albania and of the banking system, it comes natural to claim that we have acted rightly by taking a number of preventive measures that have helped us absorb the negative effects of the latest events.  Dear bankers,  Year 2008 is leaving and a new year is coming now. Like the majority of various world economies, even our country is in front of many uncertainties. I would not like to overlook the domestic factors, but however, what is currently considered as the hottest issue, has to do with the overall global environment. For a long time from now, various agencies, and national and international institutions have forecasted a year of world contracted overall production. It would be utopian, and to a certain extent a lack of prudence, if we think that our economy would be slightly or not at all affected by global crisis. Though Albania is a small economy, it is open, with numerous relations for exchanging goods and financial funds.  I have emphasized in my public presentations that all the actors should be prepared for harder days. In light of this I would like to notify you of a number of statements, findings or actions that we (I mean the Bank of Albania and the banking system) are going to carry out in the coming months.  1. Based on the latest analysis of the country’s economic and financial developments and on inflation forecasts for two forthcoming years, I would like to emphasise that there is a good anchoring of inflationary expectations around the Bank of Albania’s 3 percent target. Latest developments and information suggest that risks balance to future inflation is shifted to downward trend, creating space for manoeuvring in the near future. 2. Based on recent empirical studies of the Bank of Albania, it comes out that the relation of credit to economy with the country’s economic growth is positive and relatively strong. So, the credit growth leads to maintaining current paces of the country’s economic activity. In the recent years credit to economy has eclipsed the contribution of the public sector to generating and using financial funds, also based on a long process of the country’s fiscal consolidation. This process of more effective usage of funds impacts on increasing the efficiency and the economic growth. A contraction of credit to economy carries over the risk of reverse action, of eclipsing the credit to economy contribution from the public sector’s spending. In this sense, being aware of all the difficulties ahead, I would insist once more on my request to you to continue to keep credit to economy paces. 3. Further to my previous requests, I would once again require from you to be more active in the money market, in the interbank market and in securities market. The Bank of Albania has repeated time and again that we will satisfy all the financial market liquidity needs, but on the other hand we require from you to be more independent from your headquarters, in the policies you apply with relation to domestic financial market, in terms of BIS Review 163/2008 3 
investments portfolio. You are licensed and operating in Albania, therefore, you have under your management the Albanian citizens’ savings and the essential task of every banking system is the financial intermediation in the country they are operating. The Bank of Albania will insist for the fastest implementation of repurchase agreements in the transactions you carry out in the interbank market. The Bank of Albania makes use of a systematic approach in its dealing with and operating in the interbank market, which necessarily requires an efficient liquidity re-allocation among banks. Such a thing is carried out by applying repurchase agreement, thus preventing credit risk. In the meantime, the Bank of Albania is completing the regulation on DVP (delivery versus payment), which will simultaneously bring about even the settlement risk prevention. This constitutes another step in terms of financial infrastructure improvement for an efficient banking market.  4. The Bank of Albania is also looking into some other measures to better precede the optimal functioning of the banking system. Under more concrete terms, the Bank of Albania will require that the dividends materialised over 2008 be destined to increase the capital of banks you manage. I have constantly pointed out that our system is well-capitalised, but however under current conditions I regard its further increase as a prudential measure. 5. One of the strategic goals for the central bank’s objectives is the strengthening of its institutional independence and credibility, being a central and accountable institution for the mission entitled by law. One of the factors impacting directly and indirectly on the strengthening of this independence is also the fulfilment and improvement of the Bank of Albania’s legal framework in line with contemporary standards. To this end, we are working under three main directions: • Drafting the Law “On Payment System in the Republic of Albania” is included in short-term priorities that the Republic of Albania, through the Bank of Albania, has undertaken in view of the obligations deriving from the SAA, the European Partnership, as well as in short-term and medium-term priorities required under the National Plan for the Implementation of the SAA. This draft law aims at: - Strengthening the system’s institutional framework; - Enhancing legal framework transparency through tasks clarification of participants in the system; - Stipulating a complete regime for licensing and supervising the whole relevant systems. • Alterations in the legal framework of the Bank of Albania will be also associated with effective regulatory framework improvement, having banking supervision regulations on focus. 6. The Bank of Albania, starting from this year-end, will launch into circulation the new banknote with the face value of 2000 leks, while the whole existing series has been re-printed. I would like to highlight that the whole series of the re-printed banknotes and of the denomination 2000 leks is equipped with most modern security elements. In the meantime I avail myself of the opportunity to clarify to the public that the new denomination is an adjustment of the current structure, filling in a large gap between both existing denominations of a higher nominal value.  4 BIS Review 163/2008 
2009 will be a difficult year, and therefore everyone should take appropriate measures to correctly realise and interpret his role with professionalism. To maintain the dynamics of the country’s steady development toward full European convergence, the banking system must further perfect its infrastructure. I would regard the improvement of customer service and the increase of public education and communication as sound foundations of this infrastructure. All the above-stated, along with technology investments, would enable a higher transparency to clients and more competitive service costs. This would lead to improved image to the public, enhancing the public confidence in the banking system.  Dear bankers, Allow me to conclude my speech by emphasising once again the great importance the moment imposes to us. Wherever we are, inside the country or abroad, we must regard the challenge of overcoming this crisis as a patriotic task, which requires commitment and a high moral, social and political awareness.  Thanking you once again for the invitation, I avail myself of the opportunity to wish you happy year-end celebrations. BIS Review 163/2008 5 
Shamshad Akhtar: The effectiveness of monetary policy in Pakistan Speech by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the convocation of the Institute of Business Management, Karachi, 6 December 2008. *      *      * A. Introduction Economic policies aim to increase the welfare of the general public, and monetary policy supports this broad objective by focusing its efforts to promote price stability. Embedded in this objective is the belief that persistent inflation would compromise the long term economic prospects of the country. The objective of monetary policy in Pakistan, as laid down in the SBP Act of 1956, is to achieve the targets of inflation and growth set annually by the government. In pursuit of this mandate, SBP formulates the country’s monetary policy that is consistent with these announced targets. In my remarks today, I plan to provide perspective on: • First, why central banks focus on price stability?  • Second, how the monetary policy transmission mechanisms work?  • Third, what are the principal features of Pakistan’s monetary policy framework? • Fourth, selected thoughts on effectiveness of Pakistan’s monetary policy framework • Finally, what measures are needed to improve the effectiveness of the monetary policy framework in Pakistan?  These questions have been a subject of much debate lately, as monetary tightening – an inevitable policy response for regaining macroeconomic stability – has aroused anxiety but better public understanding of this question will help them to appreciate central bank’s monetary policy stance. B. Why focus on price stability?  Before getting into other intricacies of monetary policy, it is useful to bring forth the importance of price stability as an overriding objective of monetary policy. Actual inflation outcome in the economy is driven largely by the level of output gap (the difference between what the economy is demanding and what it can potentially produce) and inflation expectations. When the output gap widens, the actual output is more than what the economy can sustain in the long run with stable inflation. This reflects excessive demand for available resources in the economy, which pushes up general prices. In order to stem the increase in resource cost and the general price level in the economy, this gap needs to be narrowed or stabilized. This can be achieved by either reducing the demand in the short run or increasing the productive capacity over the medium to long run. Reducing aggregate demand, however, entails reduction in current output and an increase in the unemployment level in the economy.  The famous classical Phillips curve that captures the trade-off between stabilizing inflation and controlling unemployment was criticized by Phelps and Friedman in the late 1960s. They argued that if inflation expectations react to changes in actual inflation, then any trade-off between inflation and unemployment would be short-lived at best. If wages are set once a year and for some reason the output prices increase, then the producers have an incentive to increase their output by hiring more workers. However it is only possible if workers' expectations of inflation remain unchanged during the period of increase in output prices. If workers adjust their expectations in accordance with actual inflation and demand higher nominal wages, it leaves relatively little incentive for firms to increase the output.  BIS Review 163/2008 1 
Therefore the focus has shifted away from this trade-off and new consensus has emerged in the literature that price stability is key to long run growth prospects. Both theory and evidence suggest that monetary stimulus can only affect real economic activity in the short-run. In the long run, however, there is no conflict between low inflation and full utilization of economic resources. Ensuring price stability, in turn, requires effective management and anchoring of inflation expectations.  With stable prices, economic decisions can be made with less uncertainty and therefore markets can function without concern about unpredictable fluctuations in the purchasing power of money. On the other hand, high and unanticipated inflation lowers the quality of the signals coming from the price system as producers and consumers find it difficult to distinguish price changes arising from changes in the supply and demand for products from changes arising from the high level of general inflation. In the market economy, prices represent basic means of transmission of information; the increased noise associated with high inflation lowers the effectiveness of the market system. High and unanticipated inflation makes it impossible to plan for relatively longer outlook, creating incentives for households and firms to shorten their decision horizons and to spend resources in managing inflation risks rather than focusing on the most productive activities.  Ben Bernanke argued that the Fed’s mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment are almost entirely complementary: “price stability is an end of monetary policy; it is also a means by which policy can achieve its other objectives”.1 This argument has also been supported by Keneth Rogoff (1985) who advocated that the central bank should place larger weight on inflation stabilization, in order to increase the welfare of the society. Therefore, the competing goals of growth and price stability, which may seem to be at odds with each other, in fact boils down to a single objective i.e. price stability. In this backdrop, there is no surprise that most of the central banks aim at maintaining low and stable inflation. Central banks place more weight and demonstrate increased willingness on controlling inflation relative to output growth, and financial and exchange rate stability. It is important to acknowledge, however, that in practical policy making, adhering to revealed preferences is rather difficult. The reason is that central banks do not operate in a vacuum and require coordination with other policy making institutions, in particular the fiscal authority. In addition, the social and cultural make-up of a country and political economy considerations often require central banks to accommodate conflicting policies. In other words, sticking to an announced rule-based monetary policy can be difficult in practice; “enlightened discretion” is preferred by most central banks. Thus, SBP’s decision to focus on arresting the persistent inflationary trends is tantamount to a pro-growth policy, not a growth retarding one.  C. Monetary policy transmission mechanism The monetary transmission mechanism refers to a process through which monetary policy decisions affect the level of economic activity in the economy and the inflation rate. Understanding the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is crucial for appropriate design and efficient conduct of monetary policy. As monetary policy actions affect policy variables with a considerable lag and with high degree of variability and uncertainty, it is important to predict the possible impact and extent of monetary policy actions on the real variables. Thus, by its very nature, monetary policy tends to be forward-looking. It is also important to know which transmission channels are more effective in terms of transmitting changes in monetary policy actions to ultimate policy goals. Since various financial sector developments particularly regarding introduction of new financial products, technological changes, institutional strengthening, and expectations about future policy, etc.                                                  1  http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke2006.02.24a.htm#f3#mainNav 2 BIS Review 163/2008 
can potentially change economic effects of the monetary policy measures, there is a need to regularly update, empirically test and reinterpret monetary policy transmission channels. The impact of monetary policy is perceived to transmit in to the real economic activity through five channels.  • The first channel and most widely studied and understood channel of monetary policy transmission relies on the link between changes in the short-term nominal interest rate (induced by changes in the policy rate) and the long-term real interest rate that ultimately affect components of aggregate demand such as consumption and investment in an economy. As such, it is the changes in the long-term real interest rates that have its impact on aggregate consumption, business investment and other components of aggregate demand. • The second channel, known as the credit channel, involves changes in monetary policy that not only affects the ability of firms to borrow money (by affecting their net worth) but also affects the ability of banks to lend money. The strength of this channel depends on the degree to which the central bank has allowed banks to extend loans and the dependence of borrowers on bank loans. These factors are clearly influenced by the structure of the financial system and its regulation.  • The third channel of monetary policy transmission focuses on asset prices (other than the interest rate) such as the market value of securities (bonds and equities) and prices of real estate. A policy-induced change in the nominal interest rate affects the price of bonds and stocks that may change the market value of firms relative to the replacement cost of capital, affecting investment. Moreover, a change in the prices of securities entails a change in wealth which can affect the consumption of households. • Fourth, a policy-induced change in the domestic interest rate also affects the exchange rate that in turn affects the foreign financial flows, net exports and thus aggregate demand. The strength of the exchange rate channel depends on the responsiveness of the exchange rate to monetary shocks, the degree of openness of the economy, sensitivity of foreign private inflows and net exports to exchange rate variations, and the net worth of firms and thus their borrowing capacity if they have taken exposure to foreign currency. Moreover, exchange rate changes lead to changes in the domestic price of imported consumption goods and imported production inputs affecting inflation directly.  • Since expectations influence the inflation dynamics, there is a fifth channel that is based on the economic agents’ expectations of the future prospects of the economy and likely stance of the monetary policy. According to this “expectations channel”, most economic variables are determined in a forward-looking manner and are affected by the expected monetary policy actions. Thus, a consistent, credible, and transparent monetary policy can potentially affect the likely path of the economy by simply affecting expectations. D. Monetary policy framework in Pakistan Considering the economic and financial market structure in Pakistan, SBP has for sometime pursued a monetary targeting regime with broad money supply (M2) as a nominal anchor to achieve the objective of controlling inflation without any prejudice to growth. The process of monetary policy formulation usually begins at the start of the fiscal year when SBP sets a target of M2 growth in line with government’s targets of inflation and growth (usually in the month of May) and an estimation of money demand in the economy. The basic idea is to keep the money supply close to its estimated demand level, as both a significant excess and a shortfall may lead to considerable deviations in actual outcomes of inflation and real GDP BIS Review 163/2008 3 
growth from their respective targets. Underlying this framework are two strong assumptions: first, there is a strong and reliable relationship between the goal variable (inflation or real GDP) and M2; and second, the SBP can control growth in M2.  While containing the M2 growth close to its target level is the key consideration in the current monetary framework, the composition of the money supply does matter and at times requires policy actions even if these actions lead to a deviation in monetary growth from its target level. To understand this point, it is necessary to know the major components of money supply and their relative importance. Net foreign Assets (NFA) and Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the banking system are the two major components of money supply. The NFA is the excess of foreign exchange inflows over outflows to the banking system, or in other terms it is a reflection of underlying trends in the country’s external Balance of Payment (BoP) position. It is estimated by the projected values of all major external transactions such as trade, workers’ remittances, debt servicing, foreign investment, and debt flows etc. The NDA of the banking system, which primarily consists of credit to the government and the private sector, reflects changes in the fiscal and the real sectors of the economy. It is estimated as a residual of M2 and the NFA. Further breakup of NDA is estimated on the basis of projected credit needs of the government and the private sector.  Now coming to the importance of these components of the money supply, depletion in NFA is generally considered as an unhealthy development. Sharp NFA depletion reflects worsening BOP position and a pressure on exchange rate. In such a case, a higher NDA growth, though helps in expanding M2 to reach its target level, may further deteriorate external accounts, sharper depreciation of local currency, and higher depletion of country’s foreign exchange reserves. Although since FY07, only the indicative M2 growth target is being announced, SBP also takes into consideration the causative factors for monetary expansion while pursing this target. Considering the changes in monetary aggregates and other economic variables, the changes in monetary policy are signaled through adjustments in the policy discount rate (3-day repo rate). Further, the changes in the policy rate are complemented by appropriate liquidity management mainly through Open Market Operations (OMOs) and if required changes in the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) and Statutory Liquid Reserve requirement (SLR) are also made.  E. Effectiveness of monetary policy in Pakistan Significance of various channels that transmit the monetary policy shocks in Pakistan to the real economy has been analyzed by few economists. Ahmad et al. (2005) found that credit channel is the most important conduit for transmitting monetary policy actions to the real economic activity. Evidence confirms transmission through the active asset price channel and exchange rate channel. According to this study, monetary policy shocks impact real output after a lag of 7 to 11 months. Tasneem and Waheed (2006), on the other hand, investigated whether different sectors of the economy respond differently to monetary shocks. The presence of sector wise differences in the monetary transmission mechanism has profound implications for macroeconomic management as the central bank then has to weigh the varying consequences of its actions on different sectors. Investigating the transmission of changes in interest rate to seven sub sectors of the economy, the authors found evidence supporting sector-specific variation in the real effects of monetary policy. They found that the interest rate shock on manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and finance and insurance sectors transmit after a lag of 6 to 12 months. On the other hand, monetary policy shocks have negligible impact on agriculture, mining and quarrying, construction and ownership of dwelling sectors.  Generally, historical evidence does reflect that Pakistan has been a high inflation and high interest economy given its inherent structural weaknesses. The role and effectiveness of monetary policy appears more visible in the 2000s when financial sector reforms started 4 BIS Review 163/2008 
bearing fruits in terms of a more market based money and foreign exchange markets. Entering the 21st century, the loose monetary policy stance in the face of low inflation, low growth and low twin deficits, along with structural measures to open up the economy and alleviate some first round constraints, triggered the economy on a long term growth trajectory of above 7 percent. Monetary policy stance was however altered as the inflationary pressures started to build up in 2005. At the end of the fiscal year, the economy, which had been showing sustained steady growth since FY01, registered a historically high level of growth (9 percent), average inflation rose sharply (9.3 percent) and the external current account balance turned into deficit (-1.4 percent of GDP). Coinciding with these developments, the fiscal module started to show signs of stress as the fiscal balance was converted into a deficit and the stock of external debt and liabilities, which had been declining since FY00 after the Paris Club rescheduling, began increasing. These indicators largely capture the high and growing aggregate demand in the economy on account of sustained increase in peoples’ income.  With the emerging domestic and global price pressures, SBP tightened its monetary policy after a prolonged gap of a few years. The efforts to rein-in inflation, however, proved less effective due to a rebound in international commodity prices and a rise in domestic food prices later on. The rise in the international commodity prices, particularly oil, exacerbated the fight against inflation. The international oil prices (Arabian Light) rose from US$27.1 at end 2004 to US$50.9 at end 2006, whereas international food prices rose by 24, 24 and 21 percent during 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.2  Realizing the complications of monetary management and adverse global and domestic economic developments, the implementation of SBP monetary policy during FY06 varied significantly from the preceding fiscal years. In addition to the rise in the policy rate, the central bank focused on the short-end of the yield curve, draining excess liquidity from the inter-bank money market and pushing up short-tenor rates. Consequently, not only did the overnight rates remain close to the discount rate through most of the year, the volatility in these rates also declined.  These tight monetary conditions along with the Government’s administrative measures to control food inflation helped in scaling down average inflation from 9.3 percent in FY05 to 7.9 percent in FY06, within the 8.0 percent annual target. This was certainly an encouraging development, particularly as it was achieved without affecting economic growth as the real GDP growth remained strong at 6.6 percent in FY06. Monetary policy tightening was strengthened further. For FY07, the government set an inflation target of 6.5 percent. To achieve this, a further moderation in aggregate demand during FY07 was required as the core inflation witnessed a relatively smaller decline in FY06, indicating that demand-side inflationary pressures were strong. In this perspective, SBP further tightened its monetary policy in July 2006 raising the CRR and SLR for the scheduled banks; and its policy rate by 50 basis points (bps) to 9.5 percent. Moreover, proactive liquidity management helped in transmitting the monetary tightening signals to key interest rates in the economy. For instance, the Karachi Inter Bank Offer Rate (KIBOR) of 6 month tenor increased from 9.6 percent in June 2006 to 10.02 percent at end-June 2007 and the banks’ weighted average lending and deposits rates (on outstanding amount) increased by 0.93 percentage points and 1.1 percentage points, respectively, during FY07. In retrospect, it appears evident that monetary tightening in FY07 did not put any adverse impact on economic growth, as not only was the real GDP growth target of 7.0 percent for FY07 was met, the growth was quite broad based. At the same time, the impact of the monetary tightening was most evident in the continued deceleration in core inflation during                                                  2  Changes in annual average food price index; source: IMF commodity price data.

FY07. One measure of core inflation, the non-food non-energy CPI, continued its downtrend from YoY high of 7.8 percent in October 2005, to 6.3 percent at end-FY06, and to 5.1 percent by the end of FY07. However, much of the gains from the tight monetary policy on overall CPI inflation were offset by the unexpected rise in food inflation.  On the downside, however, broad money supply (M2) grew by 19.3 percent during FY07, exceeding the annual target by 5.8 percentage points. Slippages in money supply growth largely stemmed from an expansion in NFA due to the higher than expected foreign exchange inflows.  Equally stressful was the impact of Government borrowings from the central bank during the course of the year. The pressure from the fiscal account was due to mismatch in its external budgetary inflows and expenditures. With the privatization inflows and the receipts from a sovereign debt offering at end-FY07, the Government managed to end the year with retirement of central bank borrowings, on the margin. By end-FY07, SBP holdings of government papers were still around Rs 452 billion, despite a net retirement of Rs 56.0 billion during the year. Another major aberration in FY07 emanated from the high level of SBP refinancing extended, for both working capital and long-term investment, to exporters. Aside from monetary management complexities, these schemes have been distorting the incentive structure in the economy. FY08 and beginning of FY09 was even more challenging FY08 was an exceptionally difficult year. The domestic macroeconomic and political vulnerabilities coupled with a very challenging global environment caused slippages in macroeconomic targets by a wide margin.  After a relatively long period of macroeconomic stability and prosperity, the global economy faced multifarious challenges: (i) hit by the sub prime mortgage crisis in U.S in 2007, the international financial markets had been in turmoil, the impact of which was felt across markets and continents; (ii) rising global commodity prices, with crude oil and food staples prices skyrocketing; and (iii) a gradual slide in the U.S dollar against major currencies. Combination of these events induced a degree of recessionary tendencies and inflationary pressures across developed and developing countries. Policy-makers were gripped with the dual challenge of slowdown in growth and unprecedented rising inflationary pressures. Central bankers faced a demanding task of weighing the trade-off between growth and price stability. With the exception of few developed countries, most central banks showed a strong bias towards addressing the risk of inflation and responded with tightening of monetary policies. On the domestic front, the external current account deficit and fiscal deficit widened considerably to unsustainable level (8.4 and 7.4 percent of GDP). The subsidy payments worth Rs 407 billion by Government, which account for almost half of the fiscal deficit, shielded domestic consumers from high international POL and commodity prices and distorted the natural demand adjustment mechanism. While the government passed on price increase to consumers, the rising international oil and other importable prices continued to take a toll on the economy.  Rising demand has cost the country dearly in terms of foreign exchange spent on importing large volumes of these commodities. Rising fiscal deficit and lower than required financing flows resulted in exceptional recourse of the Government to the highly inflationary central bank borrowing for financing deficit. At the same time the surge in imports persisted.  As a result, inflation accelerated and its expectations strengthened due to pass through of international oil prices to the domestic market, increases in the electricity tariff and the general sales tax, and rising exchange rate depreciation. These developments resulted in a further rise in headline as well as core inflation (20 percent weighted trimmed measure) to 25 percent and 21.7 percent respectively in October 2008. Considering the size of 6 BIS Review 163/2008 
macroeconomic imbalances and the emerging inflationary pressures, SBP remained committed to achieve price stability over the medium term and thus had to launch steeper monetary tightening to tame the demand pressures and restore macroeconomic stability in FY09. SBP thus increased the policy rate from 13.5 to 15 percent.  F. What needs to be done to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy? Apart from taking policy measures to address the emerging challenges, SBP also introduced structural changes in the process of monetary policy formulation and conduct to make the monetary policy formulation and implementation more transparent, efficient, and effective. Specifically, during the last couple of years, SBP focused on  • Institutionalizing the process of policy formulation and conduct,  • Stepping up movement towards a more market based credit allocation mechanism,  • Developing its analytical and operational capacity,  • Improving its capabilities to assess future developments to act proactively, and  • Improving upon the communication of policy stance to the general public.  However, the following areas need attention and are key for effective monetary management. 1. Effectiveness of monetary and fiscal coordination would be helpful. Section 9A and 9B of the SBP Act (amended in 1994) articulates the institutional mechanism for economic policy making and coordination and defines the ground rules for both the process and the policy making. However, the track record of the Monetary and Fiscal Policies Coordination Board (MFPCB), established in February 1994 that requires quarterly meetings of the SBP and the government, has been less than satisfactory. Furthermore, the sequencing of economy-wide projections is done in isolation of the budget and monetary policy making process, and the budget making process has not respected the monetary compulsions. With rising spending and stagnating revenues, the budget assumes at the start of the year certain recourse to the central bank rather than treat it as mere ways and means advances. 2. For effective analysis of developments and policy making, timely and quality information is extremely important. However, due to weaknesses in the data collection and reporting mechanism of the various agencies of the country, information is not available with desired frequency and timeliness. Also there are concerns over the quality of data. Unlike many developed and developing countries, data on quarterly GDP, employment and wages, etc. is not available in case of Pakistan. Moreover, the data on key macroeconomic variables (such as government expenditure and revenue, output of large-scale manufacturing, crop estimates, etc.) is usually available with substantial lags. This constrains an in-depth analysis of the current economic situation and evolving trends, and hinders the ability of the SBP to develop a forward-looking policy stance. 3. Unlike many countries, both developed and developing, there is no prescribed limit on government borrowing from SBP defined in the SBP Act or the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation (FRDL) Act 2005. Besides being highly inflationary, government borrowing from SBP also complicates liquidity management. Borrowing from the central bank injects liquidity in the system through increased currency in circulation and deposits of the government with the banks. In both cases, the impact of tight monetary stance is diluted as this automatic creation of money increases money supply without any prior notice. Moreover, access to potentially unlimited borrowings from the SBP provides little incentives to the government to put the fiscal accounts in order. Therefore, the foremost task to BIS Review 163/2008 7 
improve the effectiveness of monetary policy is to prohibit the practice of government borrowings from the SBP. In this regard, appropriate provisions are required to cease or limit government recourse to central bank financing through amendments in the SBP Act and the FRDL Act 2005.  4. Another issue is to make a clear distinction between exchange rate management and monetary management. Currently, there is a general perception that the State Bank is bound to keep the exchange rate at some predefined level and any movement away from this level is then considered as an inefficiency of the SBP. There is a need to understand that for an open economy, it is impossible to pursue an independent monetary and exchange rate policy as well as allowing capital to move freely across the border. Since the SBP endeavors to achieve price stability through achieving monetary targets by changes in the policy rate, it is not possible to maintain exchange rates at some level with free capital mobility. This can only be achieved by putting complete restrictions on capital movements, which is not possible. SBPs responsibility is to ensure an environment where foreign exchange flows are driven by economic fundamental and are not mis-guided by rent seeking speculation. 5. Finally, based on experience particularly gained during the last two months is to differentiate between liquidity management and monetary policy stance. Recently, when the banking system experienced extraordinary stress due to shallow liquidity in the system, rumor mongering heightened the general public anxiety over few banks’ sustainability. Consequently, the SBP had to intervene in the market by injecting ample liquidity through various measures. In some quarters, these changes were deemed as a change in the Bank’s tight monetary policy stance. However, this was not the case and the Bank had to clearly and repeatedly communicate that the existing stance is being continued. Later on, the Bank further tightened its monetary policy. It must be understood that quite often, liquidity management can drive the market interest rates away from the direction desired under the monetary policy stance. However, this has to be temporary and the interest rates are bound to move in the policy stance direction. To resolve this issue, the SBP is studying various options, including the introduction of a “Standing Deposit Facility” to keep the inter-bank rate within a corridor. In conclusion, it is imperative that above steps be taken urgently. Over the period, however, this needs to be complemented with much deeper structural reforms to synchronize and reform the medium term planning for the budget and monetary policy formulation process. Several studies and technical assistance have provided extensive guidance in this area, but the lack of capacities and short term compulsions have often withheld such reforms. What is important is to recognize that a medium term development strategy, independently worked out, would help minimize one agency interest which has often been a source of coordination difficulties. It would also help the budget making process more rule based than the incrementally driven process to satisfy conflicting demands.  Reference: Ahmed N., H Shah, A. I. Agha, Y. A.

Yandraduth Googoolye: Credit risk and market risk – the journey ahead Opening and closing remarks by Mr Yandraduth Googoolye, First Deputy Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the working session on “Credit risk and market risk – the journey ahead” at the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and Indian Bank’s Association Conference on “Global Banking: Paradigm Shift” Theme: “Navigating successfully in an uncertain world” Mumbai, 7 November 2008. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen It is a pleasure for me to chair this afternoon session on Credit risk and Market risk, a subject whose importance is gaining momentum among policymakers these days. Economic theory tells us that Credit risk and Market risk are intrinsically related to each other and are not separable (Jarrow and Turnbull: 2008). With financial innovation, the interaction between Credit risk and Market risk has itself become even more complex today. The recent financial crisis has indeed showed us how a credit risk event can trigger other market related and liquidity related risk events. The sub-prime crisis in the United States, which has its origin in protracted low interest rate policy, has shown us how our interest rates setting decisions impact on credit risk – a linkage that has been somehow neglected over recent times. As we coordinate our efforts to ease monetary conditions to curb the growing risk that our economies would dip into recession; we need to be vigilant on the long term consequence of our decisions today, to avoid another financial turmoil in future. Financial innovation has spurred the development of risk management tools but it has also brought together various other forms of risk into financial products, making the art of risk management even more sophisticated. The rapid growth of derivative instruments blurs the dividing line between the established concepts of Credit risk and Market risk. The trading of credit derivatives and other exotic securities has transformed credit risk into market risk. When the credit conflagration morphed into a fully-fledged panic in financial markets over the last few weeks, the major stock markets plunged. A decade or so ago, technological innovation produced securitized and other credit derivatives to help financial institutions to manage risks (credit or liquidity). Those instruments quickly gained popularity among practitioners as they promised to transfer credit risk to those who were supposedly in a better position to bear those risks while contributing to financial stability. As these instruments grew in complexity, existing risks were transformed into other risks and new risks emerged. Those risks were typically measured and managed in isolation from one another, whereas in reality, they are closely linked. A credit event that drives down the value of a particular asset is likely to reduce the liquidity and price of that asset as well, at least in the short term. Therefore, as trading in those credit instruments grew, new portfolio models were developed to take on board the interaction between Credit risk and Market risk. Traditionally, regulation has distinguished between Credit risk and Market risk, and has treated both risks independently. The Basel II Accord requires banks to keep capital for Credit risk for banking book exposures and Market risk for trading book exposures. However, it does not provide an implicit capital cushion for correlation between the two risks, other than a capital charge for counterparty credit risk for certain trading book exposures. However, emphasis is put on stress testing credit portfolio for these types of events. The recent events in financial markets have brought Central Bankers, Regulators and risk managers to rethink and question the reliability of these new risk management systems for BIS Review 163/2008 1 
Credit risk and Market risk; and the diversification effects and the relevance of risk aggregation embedded in these instruments. Having said this, it may also be opportune to reflect over the future of regulatory practices for Credit risk and Market risk. Ladies and Gentlemen, as my time is almost over, let me take the next few minutes to tell you more on our distinguished speakers for this session. We welcome today, experts from McKinsey & Company. (Presentations by the speakers) Concluding remarks I thank you all gentlemen for your fruitful presentations on such an interesting topic. This session has indeed been very informative for all of us present today and I hope that we may all draw lessons from your presentation on Credit risk and Market risk, particular on part of the presentation that was focused on the experience of Indian banks in managing those risks. I now wish to quote a few sentences from the report: “Towards Superior Risk Management in Indian Banking.” “Banks will need to continuously refine today’s practices. It is important to constantly revisit the risk architecture through the on going refinement of models, stress testing scenarios, revalidating limits, redesigning customer facing processes and restructuring of the organization. This also implies broadening the traditional purview of risk management to include newer practices such as reputational risk, business process re-engineering and concurrent audit improvement.” To conclude, as banking gets more sophisticated, risk management systems should be able to size up the newer risks the operations expose a bank to. Therefore, while the banking sector has grown rapidly and displayed high resilience, the need for continuous vigil on the part of bank managements and the regulator can hardly be overemphasized. For me therefore, it is the systems and processes for being able to anticipate risk events in time in a complex financial world that should be the focus area for banks the world over including the banks in India. Thank you all for you attention. 2 BIS Review 163/2008 
Duvvuri Subbarao: The global financial turmoil and challenges for the Indian economy Speech by Dr Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Bankers' Club, Kolkata, 10 December 2008. *      *      * It is my pleasure to be here this evening and to be able to share my thoughts with an exclusive gathering of bankers. Since this is an in-house meeting and we are professional colleagues, I propose to be frank and forthright. I am glad to know that the Bankers' Club in Kolkata has been recently revived and is engaged in promoting professional interaction within the banking community.  The global financial crisis is now the staple of front page news. Banks around the world, including those in India, are in the forefront of managing the challenge of crisis resolution. Since it is so topical, I would like to take this opportunity to share my perspective on the current global turmoil, its impact on India, the outlook for the Indian economy and the challenges that lie ahead for the Indian banking system, in particular.  Global financial outlook The global financial situation continues to be uncertain and unsettled. What started off as a sub-prime crisis in the US housing mortgage sector has turned successively into a global banking crisis, global financial crisis and now a global economic crisis. Text book economics often cites housing as a prime example of a non-tradable good. It is paradoxical that a quintessentially non-tradable good as housing has triggered a crisis of global dimensions. This crisis is also the first of a kind in the sense that it is the first financial crisis since the Great Depression that originated in the advanced economies and rapidly engulfed the whole world. Such is the depth and sweep of financial globalisation. By far, the most frequently asked question (FAQ) today is whether the worst – in terms of the financial sector meltdown, and in particular, failure of financial institutions – is behind us. No one is really willing to take a definitive call on this, which is a sign of the increasing number of unknown unknowns.  Even as recently as six months ago, there was a view that the fallout of the crisis will remain confined to the financial sector and that, at the most, there would only be a shallow recession in the advanced economies. These expectations, as it now turns out, have been belied. The contagion has traversed from the financial to the real sector; and it now looks like the recession will be deeper and the recovery longer than earlier anticipated.  Global economic outlook Many economists are now predicting that this “Great Recession” of 2008/09 will be the worst global recession since the 1930s. The IMF made its customary forecast for global growth in the World Economic Outlook published in October 2008. By early November, the IMF had revised its forecast for global growth downwards – from 3.9 per cent to 3.7 per cent for 2008, and from 3.0 per cent to 2.2 per cent for 2009. There are two inferences that follow from this. First, that the global situation has deteriorated rapidly, in a space of less than two months. Second, that 2009 is going to be a more challenging year than 2008.  Emerging economies Ironically, even as late as six months ago, it was intellectually fashionable to subscribe to the “decoupling theory” – that even if advanced countries went into a downturn, emerging BIS Review 162/2008 1 
economies will, at worst, be affected only marginally, and will largely steam ahead on their own. In a rapidly globalising world, the decoupling theory was never very persuasive; given the evidence of the last few months – capital flow reversals, sharp widening of spreads between sovereign and corporate debt, and abrupt currency depreciations – the decoupling theory has almost completely lost credibility. Growth prospects of emerging economies have most definitively been undermined by the ongoing crisis with, of course, considerable variations across countries.  Impact of the crisis on India India too is having to weather the negative impact of the crisis. As the impact on India unfolds, there are two frequently asked questions: First, how is that India is affected when it came out of the Asian crisis relatively unscathed? Second, why is India affected even when its exports account for only 15 per cent of its GDP? The answer to both the questions lies in globalisation. We are certainly more integrated into the world economy today than ten years ago at the time of the Asian crisis. Integration into the world implies more than just exports. Going by the common measure of globalisation, India's two-way trade (merchandise exports plus imports), as a proportion of GDP, grew from 21.2 per cent in 1997-98, the year of the Asian crisis, to 34.7 per cent in 2007-08. If we take an expanded measure of globalisation, that is, the ratio of total external transactions (gross current account flows plus gross capital flows) to GDP, this ratio has increased from 46.8 per cent in 1997-98 to 117.4 per cent in 2007-08. These numbers are clear evidence of India's increasing integration into the world economy over the last 10 years.  We must also note another important difference between the crisis in the advanced countries and the developments in India. While in the advanced countries the contagion spread from the financial to the real sector, in India, the slowdown in the real sector is affecting the financial sector, which in turn, has a second-order impact on the real sector.  The Indian banking system The Indian banking system is not directly exposed to the sub-prime mortgage assets. It has very limited indirect exposure to the US mortgage market, or to the failed institutions or stressed assets. Indian banks, both in the public sector and in the private sector, are financially sound, well capitalised and well regulated. The average capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) for the Indian banking system, as at end-March 2008, was 12.6 per cent, as against the regulatory minimum of nine per cent and the Basel norm of eight per cent. Even so, India is experiencing the knock-on effects of the global crisis, through the monetary, financial and real channels – all of which are coming on top of the already expected cyclical moderation in growth. Our financial markets – equity market, money market, forex market and credit market – have all come under pressure mainly because of what we have begun to call “the substitution effect” of: (i) drying up of overseas financing for Indian banks and Indian corporates; (ii) constraints in raising funds in a bearish domestic capital market; and (iii) decline in the internal accruals of the corporates. All these factors added to the pressure on the domestic credit market.  Simultaneously, the reversal of capital flows, caused by the global de-leveraging process, has put pressure on our forex market. The sharp fluctuation in the overnight money market rates in October 2008 and the depreciation of the rupee reflected the combined impact of the global credit crunch and the de-leveraging process underway. Outlook for India The outlook for India, going forward, is mixed. There is evidence of a slow down in the economic activity. The real GDP growth has moderated in the first half of 2008-09. Industrial 2 BIS Review 162/2008 
activity, particularly in the manufacturing and infrastructure sectors, is decelerating. The services sector too, which has been our prime growth engine for the last five years, is slowing, mainly in the construction, transport and communication, trade, hotels and restaurants sub-sectors. For the first time in seven years, exports have declined in absolute terms in October 2008. Recent data indicate that the demand for bank credit is slackening despite comfortable liquidity in the system. Higher input costs and dampened demand have dented corporate margins while the uncertainty surrounding the crisis has affected business confidence. Inflation On the positive side, headline inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index, has fallen sharply, and the decline has been sustained for the past four weeks, pointing to a faster-than-expected reduction in inflation. Largely, the falling commodity prices have been the key drivers behind the disinflation; however, some contribution has also come from slowing domestic demand. The reduction in prices of petrol and diesel announced last week, and a cut in the excise duties should further ease the inflationary pressures. To be sure, consumer price inflation for the months of September and October 2008 did increase. This is possibly owing to the firm trend in food-articles inflation and the higher weight of food articles in the measures of consumer price inflation. Historically, there has been a positive correlation between wholesale and consumer price inflation, and given this correlation, consumer price inflation too can be expected to soften in the months ahead.  RBI's policy stance The Reserve Bank's monetary policy stance has consistently been to balance growth, inflation and financial stability concerns. When inflation surged earlier this year, the RBI had moved quickly to tighten policy. Then again, reflecting the unfolding global situation and expectation of decline in inflation, RBI has adjusted its monetary stance over the last couple of months. The endeavour of our monetary stance has been to manage liquidity – both domestic and forex liquidity – and to ensure that credit continues to flow for productive activities.  Measures taken so far The RBI has taken several measures aimed at infusing rupee as well as foreign exchange liquidity and to maintain credit flow to productive sectors of the economy. Measures aimed at expanding the rupee liquidity included significant reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR), reduction of the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), opening a special repo window under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) for banks for on-lending to the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), housing finance companies (HFCs) and mutual funds (MFs), and extending a special refinance facility, which banks can access without any collateral. The Reserve Bank is also unwinding the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) securities, roughly synchronised with the government borrowing programme, in order to manage liquidity.  Measures aimed at managing forex liquidity include upward adjustment of the interest rate ceilings on the foreign currency non-resident (banks) [FCNR(B)] and non-resident (external) rupee account [NR(E)RA] deposits, substantially relaxing the external commercial borrowings (ECB) regime, allowing the NBFCs and HFCs access to foreign borrowing and allowing corporates to buy back foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) to take advantage of the discount in the prevailing depressed global markets. The Reserve Bank has also instituted a rupee-dollar swap facility for banks with overseas branches to give them comfort in managing their short-term funding requirements.  BIS Review 162/2008 3 
Measures to encourage flow of credit to sectors which are coming under pressure include extending the period of pre-shipment and post-shipment credit for exports, expanding the refinance facility for exports, counter-cyclical adjustment of provisioning norms for all types of standard assets (except in case of direct advances to agriculture and small and medium enterprises which continue to be at 0.25 per cent) and risk weights on banks' exposure to certain sectors which had been increased earlier counter-cyclically, and expanding the lendable resources available to the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), the National Housing Bank (NHB) and the Export-Import Bank of India (EXIM Bank).  To improve the flow of credit to productive sectors at viable costs so as to sustain the growth momentum, the Reserve Bank signalled a lowering of the interest rate structure by reducing its key policy rate viz., the repo rate by 250 basis points from 9.0 per cent as on October 19 to 6.5 per cent by December 8, 2008.  Although, we remain vulnerable to global financial and economic developments, the measures taken so far have eased the liquidity and credit flow situations considerably. I must also add that in managing the impact of the global crisis, we have been mindful that no policy initiative is totally costless. Managing this delicate balance between costs and benefits has been one of our challenges. The measures taken by the RBI have been appreciated and criticised. I would like to assure you that we give as much importance to our critics as our admirers. While some of the criticism has been fair and value adding, some of it stems from an inadequate appreciation of the RBI perspective. I thought it may be useful to give our perspective so as to inform public debate on important monetary policy issues.  Everyone is now agreed that the way forward on this crisis at the present time is too uncertain. Even today, it is not possible to clearly see the path of the crisis and its resolution over the coming months. It is just not possible to have a precise road map all laid out to be unleashed in one go. This crisis does not allow us that luxury. And, mind you, India is not unique in this respect. Almost every country, whether or not directly affected, is having to manage under uncertainty. There are simply too many unknown unknowns. In the circumstances, the stance of the RBI has been to respond to the evolving situation swiftly and effectively, and to the extent possible, in anticipation of immediate developments. We do have a road map that is comprehensive and practical. It would be our endeavour to adapt this road map to the evolving global developments and implement it flexibly and pragmatically. Our approach, as indeed of every prudent central banker around the world, has been to "cross the river by feeling the stones". The RBI will continue to be on vigil and do everything possible within its mandate to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the Indian economy. The challenges ahead Let me now turn to the major challenges facing the banking system in the country, particularly in the wake of the global financial crisis.  The first challenge: maintaining the credit flow The outlook, both for the world and for India, continues to remain uncertain. The future trajectory of the global crisis is not yet clear. As I mentioned earlier, the year 2009-10 will be more challenging than the current one. There was a noticeable decline in the credit demand in the month of November 2008 but it is not yet clear if it was a one off episode or it reflects a trend. If it is indicative of slowing economic activity, it would be a major challenge for the banks to ensure healthy flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy. As you know, economic growth, even in normal times, requires efficient financial intermediation. An economic downturn, therefore, requires even more efficient financial intermediation – and 4 BIS Review 162/2008 
this is a major challenge that the banking community has to address. There is a need to ensure a steady credit flow to the real sector of the economy in order to sustain demand even while maintaining credit quality.  There are two aspects to lending viz., availability and cost of credit. While the availability of credit should not be an issue, the cost of credit seems to be an issue at the current juncture. There seem to be two reasons inhibiting the banks from extending credit: first, a high weighted-average cost of funds because of high interest rates on deposits; and second, concerns about credit quality, which makes the banks risk averse, particularly in lending to certain segments. During the last one month, there has been a sharp reversal in trend and, as noted earlier, credit demand seems to be slackening. The reduced funding demand on the banks should enable them to reduce the interest rates on deposit and thereby reduce the overall cost of funds. In addition, from a macro perspective the decelation of headline inflation noticed so far and the expectations of softening of inflation in the months ahead should enable a reduction in nominal interest rates. These developments in turn, would facilitate lending at lower interest rates, making fresh lending more viable and, at least partly obviating the risk aversion of the banks.  Let me assure you that the RBI, on its part, will continue to maintain adequate liquidity in the system to enable the flow of credit to the economy. The second challenge: how do we reform financial sector regulation? By far, the most contentious and most voluble debate triggered by the crisis has been about the flaws in the regulatory architecture of the financial sector. Several issues have come to the fore. I will mention just a few. How can complex derivative products, which transmitted risks across the system, be made more transparent? What are the financial stability implications of structured products like credit derivatives? Are exchange traded derivatives better than over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives? How do we eliminate the drawbacks of the “originate-to-distribute” model? Is universal banking, the model that the United States has now turned to, appropriate? Can we apply the same regulatory regime for both wholesale and retail banks? The burden of all the above questions is to identify the drawbacks in the present regulatory regimes and indicate possible solutions. There is no doubt that we must pursue all these questions. In doing so, I would urge that we remember two things. The first thing to remember is that no one size fits all. For example, universal banking may be good in some of the countries and in some of the situations, and not so in others. The second thing to remember is that some regulations, arguably, have been behind the curve. There is no denying that regulations have to keep pace with innovations in the financial markets but in doing so, we must be mindful of the risks of over-tightening the regulations lest they stifle innovation. The third challenge: regulatory forbearance and relaxing regulatory norms There has been a sustained demand from various quarters for exercising regulatory forbearance in regard to extant prudential regulations applicable to the banking sector. As a part of counter-cyclical package, we have already made several changes to the current prudential norms. These include: (a) reduction in the risk weights for claims on unrated corporates and commercial real estate to 100 per cent; (b) reduction in the provisioning requirement for all standard assets to 0.40 per cent; (c) permitting housing loans to be restructured even if the revised payment period exceeds ten years; (d) making the restructured commercial real estate exposures eligible for special treatment if restructured before June 30, 2009. There are demands for further regulatory forbearance. For example, there has been a demand to relax the asset classification norms by increasing the period of delinquency BIS Review 162/2008 5 
beyond the current norm of 90 days after which the loan asset is required to be classified as non-performing. The objective underlying the demand is to permit the banks to avoid recognising non-performing loans (NPLs) for a longer period. Is it desirable to change the NPL norm by relaxing the 90 day rule? The demand is presumably premised on the argument that the relaxation in the norm will make the banks' financials look better, allow them to reserve less, conserve capital, and may even allow them to offer more credit (or at least not cut back on credit). However, there are several forceful arguments against the relaxation sought. Let me mention a few.  (i) Delay in recognition of NPL removes pressure on the banks to deal promptly with the problem. History suggests that delayed recognition of impairment in the value of the assets makes the problems only worse. The sooner banks restructure the loan (through, say, CDR mechanism) or, where appropriate, send the loan for collection, the better. (ii) This global downturn is likely to be a prolonged one. If banks do not recognise their problem loans here and now, and deal with them expeditiously, the problem will only get compounded with the passage of time and will keep haunting them in future.  (iii) The prudential regulatory norms ought not to be changed lightly, especially when markets are on edge. If the impression gains ground that the modified norms under-state the extent of impairment and over-state the asset quality in the banking sector, the markets could suspect the worst and needlessly penalise the banks through market discipline.  These are the issues we need to reflect on in moving towards further regulatory forbearance. The fourth challenge: effective implementation of Basel II framework As you are aware, a part of the Indian banking system has already migrated to the Basel II Framework effective March 31, 2008 and the remaining commercial banks are slated to do so by March 31, 2009. However, having regard to the state of preparedness of the system, we have, for the present, adopted only the simpler approaches available under the Framework. The RBI is yet to announced the timeframe for adoption of the Advanced Approaches in the Indian banking system but the migration to these Approaches is the eventual goal – for which the banking system will need to start its preparations in all earnestness.  The migration to the Advanced Approaches poses several significant challenges to the bankers and, as the banking regulator and supervisor, also to the RBI. The first challenge is the availability of long time-series data for computing the risk parameters required under the Advanced Approaches. Good-quality, consistent and reliable data and information relating to the loan portfolios of the banks as also sophisticated IT resources are critical to the proper risk assessment under the Basel II framework. Data limitation is a key impediment to the design and implementation of credit risk models. This may prove to be a major challenge for us in India, given the wide-spread branch network – though the increasing computerisation in the banking industry should prove to be of great help.  The second challenge is that the Advanced Approaches for credit risk and operational risk envisaged under the Basel II Framework also require use of risk models by the banks. This, in turn, requires internal validation of these models by the banks themselves as also by the supervisors before the models can be permitted to be used for regulatory capital purposes. Such a validation process demands expert skills which need to be developed and nurtured.  Third, since Basel II Framework is primarily about ensuring robust risk management in the banks, its effective implementation, particularly the Advanced Approaches, will demand rapid and significant upgradation of skills – both at the level of the banking system as also within the RBI. In this context, the challenge that banks are likely to face will be multi-faceted, viz., assessing skill requirements, identifying and bridging the gaps, identifying talents, putting the 6 BIS Review 162/2008 
available talents to optimum use, attracting fresh talents, retention of talents, and change management. Banks would, therefore, need to pay special attention to strengthening their risk management infrastructure, in all its dimensions, including the human resources. We, in the RBI, are mindful of our part of the challenges in this regard and are taking necessary measures.  The implementation of Basel II requires closer cooperation, information sharing and co-ordination of policies among sectoral supervisors, specially in the context of financial conglomerates. The existence of separate supervisory authorities to regulate different segments of the markets within a jurisdiction may create challenges in implementation of Basel II not only within a jurisdiction but also across jurisdictions – which would require effective cross-border supervisory cooperation and co-ordination.  The fifth challenge: the challenge of banking development and financial inclusion in Eastern India  Banking development in the eastern region of the country, as measured by several parameters, is lagging behind the national average. Let me give some evidence to illustrate this.  • In March 2008, the all-India per branch population coverage was 15,400. For the eastern region, the figure varied from 25,000 in Bihar to 9,600 in Sikkim..  • In March 2007, at the all-India level, the per capita deposit was Rs. 28,600. The corresponding figure for the eastern region was Rs. 14,400. Similarly, as against the per capita credit of Rs 28,600 at the all-India level, the corresponding figure for the eastern region is only Rs. 7,200.  • In March 2007, at the all-India level, the population of people having bank accounts was 41 per cent. The corresponding population for the eastern region was only 30.7 per cent, ranging from 21.1 per cent for Bihar to 39.6 per cent for West Bengal.  • In March 2007, at the all-India level, the credit-deposit ratio was 74.5 per cent. For the eastern region, the ratio was just 50 per cent.  In terms of infrastructure coverage and other development indicators, the eastern region is not as developed as other regions of the country. Admittedly, this affects the credit absorption capacity and may also explain some of the lagging parameters mentioned above. However, this can not be an excuse for inaction. It should be impetus for vigorous action. Finance can lead development just as much as it can be led by it. This is specially true for the poor. Nearly a third of the people of Bihar and West Bengal are below the poverty line. Through greater financial inclusion it should be possible to provide savings, loan and insurance products at affordable prices and this can generate income and employment in a very significant measure.  We must recognise that the opportunity cost of formal finance for the borrower is so high that mere financial inclusion can unlock value that today is accruing to rentiers and informal finance providers. This apart, transaction costs can be reduced through the kind of scale of operations that only banks are capable of achieving and this itself become a source of value creation.  Financial inclusion can not be reduced to a mere number game. The actual impact of financial inclusion and expanded banking coverage must be felt at the grass-root level. I find that a number of measures have been initiated to deepen the banking penetration in the region. For example, in West Bengal, a Task Force for extending banking facilities in unbanked Gram Panchayats (GP) was constituted by the State Level Bankers’ Committee in December 2007. The task force has identified 511 GPs at which bank branches will be opened in next three years and at 427 GP-centres in the following three years. I understand BIS Review 162/2008 7 
that the State Government has agreed to provide premises adjacent to the GP offices and extend other facilities like road connection and power at such centres.  Where a full fledged branch can not be opened immediately, banks could look at covering the unbanked areas through satellite offices, weekly branches, or use the business correspondent model for ensuring greater coverage within a shorter period. Information Technology (IT) solutions should also be explored for providing a back bone of credit information, customer information apart from facilitating more efficient credit delivery and reducing cost of payments and remittances.  I understand there has been an interesting and innovative experiment undertaken in West Bengal for promoting financial inclusion. A Financial Inclusion/Literacy Campaign was launched in an urban slum area viz., the Basanti Colony, Ultadanga, Kolkata in mid-October 2008 in association with six commercial banks. These banks are the State Bank of India, United Bank of India, UCO Bank, Allahabad Bank, Bank of India and Bank of Baroda – which had branches in the vicinity of the slum area. All six banks were allotted separate counters for opening of accounts as well as to campaign for their bank-specific products. Free photo facility for account holders was provided and the cost was shared by all the participating banks. The initiatives such as this should be pursued and the full range of financial services provided to these areas. I understand that the Local Council extended support for obtaining identity documents required for opening of bank accounts. This experiment demonstrates what banks can do if only they are responsive, sensitive, proactive and result oriented. Coming to sectoral flow of credit, while the share of agriculture in the State’s SDP is higher than at the all-India level, the share of agricultural credit in total credit is roughly the same for the State. This points to the need to look at bankable schemes in the agriculture sector. Also, NABARD has a very significant role to play in this region. As the micro and small enterprises account for 7.2 per cent of total credit in the region, SIDBI too, as a development finance institution, has to play a prominent role in accelerating and catalysing the flow of bank credit to the MSE sector in the region.  Although not often acknowledged, effective financial intermediation has been one of the important factors behind India’s recent growth episode. Efficient financial intermediation is a formidable challenge where poverty and disadvantage are high. You, as senior bank managers in the eastern region of the country, have a bigger challenge and greater opportunity. A bigger challenge because you have to be even more efficient than elsewhere, and a greater opportunity because by being responsive and sensitive, you can make "a bigger difference".  Conclusion Going forward, developments in the real economy, financial markets and global commodity prices point to a period of moderation in growth with declining inflation. What is heartening though is that the fundamentals of our economy continue to be strong. Once calm and confidence are restored in the global markets, economic activity in India will recover sharply. But a period of painful adjustment is inevitable. It is our collective challenge – for you, the bankers, and for us at the RBI – to respond to this extraordinary situation effectively and return India to its path of growth and poverty reduction.  Thank you. 8 BIS Review 162/2008 
Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj: Ensuring stability – international perspectives on creating an effective regulatory framework Inaugural plenary address by His Excellency Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, at the 15th World Islamic Banking Conference 2008, Manama, 24 November 2008. *      *      * Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen: “Salaam Alaikum” It is a pleasure to participate in this Opening Session, and to have this opportunity to welcome you all to the 2008 World Islamic Banking Conference. This is the 15th Conference of its kind to have been held here in Bahrain, and in July of this year, the first WIBC European Summit was held in London. The inaugural European Summit was yet a further indication that Islamic finance is rapidly moving into the financial mainstream. I should like to begin by thanking the many distinguished speakers who will be appearing during the Conference, as well as the event organisers and sponsors. Collectively, your contributions are the reasons for the success of this event. I should also particularly like to extend a warm welcome to His Excellency Heng Swee Keat, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Thank you for being with us today. The theme of this Session – “Ensuring stability: International perspectives on creating an effective regulatory framework” – is timely in my view. Until very recently, many commentators and analysts believed that the economies of the GCC were an oasis of calm in the ongoing global financial turmoil. However, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September, it has become clear that no part of the world can be immune to the present crisis. We have seen a vastly changed financial landscape, and there is little doubt that the availability of funds and the costs of borrowing are being affected in all parts of the world. Against the background of this global financial turmoil, it seems a good time to take stock of the prospects for the Islamic financial industry, and to consider in particular how best to ensure the stability of the industry in future. In recent months as the global financial crisis has deepened, many commentators have pointed out that Islamic financial institutions have escaped relatively unscathed from the severe downturn which is affecting most conventional financial institutions. This certainly presents the industry with an opportunity to continue its rapid and successful growth of recent decades. However, the fact that Shari’a compliant institutions have avoided significant losses resulting from the global financial crisis does not mean that there are no lessons that they can learn from the fallout. Let me mention three in particular which I believe are particularly relevant – the risks of herding behaviour, the importance of liquidity management, and the importance of sound corporate governance. The first example I invite you to consider concerns the belief by many conventional banks that lending to sub-prime borrowers represented a viable new business line in which there would be an appropriate risk reward trade-off. The first movers in this market might have found a profitable niche – but once many banks tried to become players in the same market, credit standards became lax and loans were made to borrowers who had little chance of repaying them. Although some banks recognized the risks they did not do enough to mitigate them at a sufficiently early stage. The reason, as the former head of a major bank remarked in explaining his bank’s sub-prime related write-offs, is that “if the music is playing, you have to get up and dance.” BIS Review 162/2008 1 
The sub-prime episode provides an illustration of the herding instinct which has been a recurrent feature of financial markets since their very beginning. Some banks discover a profit opportunity, other banks follow, and before long the oversupply of credit has led to losses. Although Shari’a compliant financial institutions have been insulated from direct losses resulting from the recent financial crisis, this does not mean that they are not as much subject to herding as are conventional financial institutions. As I have pointed out in the past, newer entrants to the industry have merely tended to copy the strategies they see being successfully pursued by their more established rivals. As a result, the industry’s assets have become heavily weighted towards the property sector – real estate, commercial property and construction. Events in other parts of the world have recently reminded us that this sector can and does experience significant cycles of activity. We also need to remember that a business model which looks robust in conditions of rising asset values and abundant liquidity, may not be so in a changed economic environment. The industry needs carefully to consider the risks of the widespread adoption of the same business model. Is it that there are genuine profit opportunities that are not being exploited by their competitors? Or is it instead the consequence of merely deciding to follow the herd?  An important part of the regulator’s role is to lean against the tendency towards herding that seems to be a perennial feature of financial markets. This is not always a popular role but it is an essential one. For example, by imposing concentration limits, regulators can require banks to hold a more diversified and therefore less risky portfolio of assets. While we recognise that there are advantages to banks in developing expertise in particular economic sectors, there are also significant risks in chasing after the profit opportunities others have already exploited. While regulators can help to ensure that financial institutions’ risks are well diversified, the main incentive for risk diversification needs to come from the industry itself. The industry needs to develop a greater diversity of business models, more diverse and stable income sources, and more robust risk management and stress testing techniques. The essential consideration in Islamic finance, as in all forms of finance, is to find the right balance between business development and risk management. A second issue brought to prominence by the recent global financial turmoil concerns financial institutions’ liquidity risk management. Conventional financial institutions and their regulators clearly did not pay sufficient attention to liquidity risks in the run up to the crisis. Liquidity has been a source of potential risk for the Islamic financial services industry for some time, particularly given the relative unavailability of short-term, liquid money market instruments that are Shari’a compliant. To assist Islamic financial institutions to overcome this problem, the CBB has recently developed an Islamic Sukuk liquidity instrument. This is a repurchase agreement which has been designed to enable financial institutions to access short-term liquidity against Government of Bahrain long- and short-term Ijara Sukuk. Despite this important innovation in the CBB’s standing facilities, there is a continuing need for more depth and liquidity in Shari’a compliant money markets and the CBB will continue to explore other such initiatives. A final issue which the recent global financial turmoil has brought to prominence concerns corporate governance. The experience of the conventional financial sector has been a reminder that financial institutions need high standards of corporate governance as they are entrusted with other people’s money. While this is true of all financial institutions, the need is particularly great for those which are Shari’a compliant due to several issues that are specific to their business model. Decisions on profit distribution, for example, require the careful balancing of the interests of multiple stakeholder groups – not just shareholders as in conventional banks, but the 2 BIS Review 162/2008 
interests of the holders of investment accounts as well. Investment account holders are exposed to many of the same risks as shareholders, but lack the same control rights – such as the ability to vote for Board members – that are attached to equity ownership. Balancing these different stake holder interests, requires the adoption of strong corporate governance practices, and the standards developed both by AAOIFI and by the Islamic Financial Services Board, are vital components of the solution. To conclude, although the Islamic financial services industry has been insulated to-date from the effects of the global financial crisis, there are many lessons that Shari’a compliant institutions can learn. The global financial crisis has been a reminder of the importance of risk diversification, of good liquidity management, and sound corporate governance. These are all lessons which the Islamic financial industry needs to bear in mind if it is to continue to enjoy the framework for stability that is essential for its future prosperity.

Yandraduth Googoolye: Supervision and regulation of state-owned banks Address by Mr Yandraduth Googoolye, First Deputy Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the Financial Stability Institute, World Bank and International Monetary Fund Seminar on “Supervision and Regulation of State-Owned Banks”, hosted by the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai, 5 November 2008. *      *      * Distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very pleased to be in Mumbai today to share a few thoughts on supervision and regulation of government-owned banks. I must at the outset compliment the Financial Stability Institute, World Bank and International Monetary Fund for having chosen this issue as the theme for this seminar. No subject could be more topical in the current context given that we are seeing in the West a reverse process of private banks getting wholly or semi-nationalized. Therefore, the lessons of this seminar, which is targeted at the emerging economies, could be useful for the developed world as well, in a more meaningful way than perhaps they might have been a few weeks ago. Before getting to the theme of regulation and supervision of government-owned banks, let us see the different ways in which Government can have stakes in banks. Firstly, government ownership can arise at the initial shareholding stage, i.e. an entity in which Government has majority shareholding applies for a banking licence. Secondly, Government may set up a bank or nationalize existing bank(s) through an Act of Parliament to further its social and developmental objectives, and thirdly Government could acquire shares in an existing bank to bailing out a failing bank, something quite fashionable these days! Indeed there is an extensive literature and a lot of debate on the role of government ownership in banking. It would perhaps be useful to briefly touch upon some of the theories that have been put forward on government ownership in banking. The views that have been more frequently associated with state ownership of banks are the social view, the political view and the agency view. The social view suggests that government-owned banks contribute to economic development and improve general welfare (Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980)). The political view highlights the role of politicians in pursuing their personal goals, for example maximizing employment of their electorate or financing favoured enterprises (Shleifer (1998)). The agency view relates to the agency costs in government bureaucracy that may result in managerial inefficiency (Banerjee (1997), Hart, Shleifer and Vishny (1997)). Various studies have also been conducted to assess the impact of government ownership on banks. Caprio and Marinez (2000) demonstrated that government ownership is significantly and positively associated with increases in bank fragility; Barth, Caprio and Levine (2004) found no conclusive evidence on the relationship between government ownership in banks and the likelihood of a banking crisis. Those inconsistent results seem to suggest that in spite of the implicit deposit protection arising out of government ownership of banks, such banks are not immune from insolvency risk. Even if the depositors’ interests are not jeopardized, it might be at the cost of general public interest. These observations are meant to show the implications of government ownership of banks on the banking system and on economic growth, and put into perspective the critical importance of regulation and supervision of government-owned banks. In fact, it is rather easy to see that the best way to get the maximum benefit of the government ownership of banks is to subject them to proper regulation and supervision. BIS Review 162/2008 1 
The whole issue of regulation and supervision of the public sector banks assumes a special significance only because there is a notion that the regulator may not have de facto independence because the Government, as the shareholder of the regulator, may influence the regulatory process as applied to the banks owned by it (Government). However, if government-owned banks have to function as commercially viable entities, the regulatory process should be able to shield them from being used in a manner detrimental to depositors’/public interest. This would also be necessary from the point of view of creating a level playing field for both government-owned banks and private banks. The issue of differentiated regulation or regulatory process may take various forms. There could be differences in the way the directors are chosen by Government. If the board of directors of a government-controlled financial institution comprises only representatives of Government, there may be a tendency for the broader goals of Government to override the commercial objectives of the bank and thereby depositors’ interest. The objectivity with which the regulator deals with nominations of persons who might not pass the fit and proper test in such cases will be an indicator of the independence of the regulator and the uniformity of supervisory practices. Another issue, also emanating from the corporate governance perspective, arises from the fact that while in the case of most enterprises, the shareholder gets the prime place among various stakeholders, in the case of a bank, the protection of depositors’ interest is the central area of focus. In the case of a public sector bank in which the shareholder/controller of the central bank or the regulator is the sole or majority shareholder, a question arises as to how the regulator (whether the central bank or any other authority) would focus on depositors’ interest as opposed to shareholders’ interest. One might wonder whether those interests are in conflict. It may not be so all the time but there do exist situations where conflicts might arise. For example, the various principles of prudence that the regulator requires financial institutions to adhere to might curtail the risk-taking ability and thus channel resources into safer, but not so remunerative activities. A third area of perception of different treatment arises in regard to lending policies. For instance, how would a regulatory authority view a public sector bank lending for socially justifiable objectives that may not be bankable in the strict sense of the term? Would the regulator treat such lending by all banks alike or would it condone the lending by the public sector bank as an extension of the social objectives of the Government? A fourth aspect could be over regulation because of public accountability associated with government ownership. Thus the government may directly or through the regulator impose too many restrictions on the functioning of a bank owned by it and these could impede the fleet footedness one would expect a commercial entity to display. For example, decisions on write offs, restructuring involving financial sacrifice by the bank may go through the bureaucratic rigmarole leading to delays and failure to clinch critical settlements. Very often government ownership is associated with excessive emphasis on the process without regard to and often to the detriment of the expected outcome. The regulator too may view these passively, if not positively, as all such decisions or indecisions may be justified on the principles of propriety as also because of the comfort of the bail out of the depositor in the event of insolvency. The Mauritian experience Let me now turn to the situation in Mauritius. Before I go into the details of the regulatory and supervisory process, I would like to outline the structure of the financial services industry in the country. The major financial institutions in Mauritius are banks, insurance companies- both general and life, non-bank deposit taking financial institutions, cash dealers comprising money changers and foreign exchange dealers. Banks account for 80% of the country’s financial sector. The legal framework for the regulation and supervision of financial 2 BIS Review 162/2008 
institutions is provided mainly by the Banking Act 2004, the Bank of Mauritius Act 2004 and the Financial Services Act 2007. The Banking Act is administered by the Bank of Mauritius and applies to banks, non-bank deposit taking institutions and the cash dealers while the Financial Services Act is implemented by the Financial Services Commission which oversees all other segments of the financial sector including insurance and leasing. The non-bank deposit taking institutions engaged in leasing business are regulated and supervised by both the Bank of Mauritius and Financial Services Commission, such overlaps not being uncommon in other jurisdictions as well. There are conglomerates having business in segments coming within the purview of both regulators. We have a joint coordination committee to exchange notes and we are moving towards the concept of a lead regulator. The Bank of Mauritius Act basically sets out the responsibilities and functions of the Bank and thus its provisions have a bearing on the Bank’s regulatory and supervisory role. There are in all 19 banks and 13 non-bank deposit taking institutions. Out of these institutions, at present there are two banks and three non-bank deposit taking institutions in which Government has a majority stake – directly or indirectly. The shares in a bank in which the government-controlled development financial institution held a majority stake were divested to private entities recently. The Government’s interest in the five institutions is held in different ways. For instance, in one of the banks Government of Mauritius directly holds a part of the shares while the remaining is held through government-controlled organizations like the Pension Fund etc. In another case, Government stake is partly held by the government-controlled Post Office. One of those banks is listed on the Stock Exchange as well. Two of the non4 banks are subsidiaries of government undertakings. In the final analysis though, the manner in which the Government stake is held may not have any bearing on the control exercised by Government on the entities’ management. All these institutions are regulated and supervised by Bank of Mauritius like any other institution under its purview, as I would explain later on. However, a deposit-taking development financial institution in the public sector is not yet brought within the purview of the Bank. A uniform regulatory approach In certain jurisdictions, the legal framework for regulation and supervision makes a distinction on the applicability of certain provisions of the legislation to privately-owned and public sector financial institutions. In India, some of the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act (1949), particularly relating to the appointment of the Chief Executive and directors, are not applicable to the public sector banks. However, in Mauritius, all the provisions of the Banking Act apply in the same manner and to the same extent to both types of institutions. As such the regulatory authority of the Bank of Mauritius applies on all aspects of the functioning of a public sector financial institution as it does to those of similar institutions in the private sector. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to outline some of the more important aspects to illustrate the uniformity of approach, namely in the areas of licensing, regulatory limits, audit, onsite examination, offsite surveillance and corporate governance. The Chairman, Chief Executive officer, the directors and other senior officers of a government-owned entity are scrutinized for the fit and proper test in the same manner as a private sector entity, when examining an application for a banking licence. All guidelines apply equally to the public sector banks and the private sector banks. As an example of the extreme application of uniformity, I should cite the fact that lending by a government owned bank to a public sector entity is considered a related party exposure and subject to the discipline governing connected lending. BIS Review 162/2008 3 
The Bank of Mauritius vets the credentials of the external auditors of both private sector banks and public sector banks before giving its approval for their appointment. The offsite surveillance and the onsite examination are conducted in the same manner for private sector banks and public sector banks. Further, the various principles of corporate governance enunciated by the Bank are applied with the same rigour to a public and a private sector financial institution. As such the public sector institutions are required to even constitute Conduct Review Committees to examine related party transactions – which in their case would mainly mean credit facilities to or transactions with other public sector enterprises. Given the importance of corporate governance in banking institutions, the independent functioning of the Board of Directors cannot be overemphasized. Our Guideline on Corporate Governance requires the Board of a banking institution to have a healthy proportion of independent directors and encourages a minimum of 40 per cent. The Board should also put in place an appropriate structure and procedures to achieve and project its independence. The directors of the Board should meet the “fit and proper” criteria at the outset and on an ongoing basis. These requirements have contributed to ensure that political interests do not take precedence over the bank’s commercial interests. As such the uniformity, de jure enshrined in the legal framework, is de facto extended to the supervisory process as well. Performance of banks in Mauritius Before moving over to my concluding remarks, I would briefly deal with the performance of the banking sector in Mauritius. It is a matter of great comfort that of late the sector has been witnessing robust growth in most parameters coupled with a decline in the ratio of non-performing loans to total advances. The deposits of banks increased from MUR435 billion to MUR537 billion between end June 2007 and end June 2008; while advances grew from MUR305 billion to MUR356 billion during the same period. The pre-tax profit increased from MUR9.9 billion for the year ended March 2007 to MUR11.1 billion for the year ended March 2008. Non performing loans represented 2.4 per cent of the gross advances at the end of June 2008. There are 186 branches and 382 ATMs in the country and on an average more than one electronic card is in use per adult population. The public sector banks have also turned in good performance. In fact one of the two public sector banks is the second largest bank in the country. The return on assets for the year ended March 2008 of the two public sector banks was 2.84 per cent and 0.74 per cent as against the average of 1.7 per cent for the industry. Similarly the return on equity of one of them was 20.93 per cent as against the industry average of 23.26 per cent.  It is therefore evident that the banking sector, including the entities in which Government has controlling interest, has performed well. I must also assure you that they are resilient enough, thus vindicating our faith in applying a uniform legal, regulatory and supervisory framework. Let me make one final comment on the performance of public sector banks. There is a general perception that public sector institutions are not as innovative as private sector entities. Well this may not always be true. In fact one of the public sector banks in Mauritius won the Euromoney and The Banker Award for the “Best Bank in Mauritius” on a number of occasions. Concluding remarks It is undoubtedly a good practice not to let the ownership structure influence the regulatory and supervisory process. This has two positive effects. First, the public sector entity functions like any other commercial organization within the risk management guidelines issued by the regulator. Secondly, the privately-owned entities in the sector would not feel discriminated. 4 BIS Review 162/2008 
This is necessary to attract private capital in the sector. Obviously, a regulatory process that favours one segment vis-à-vis the other within the same industry would not be conducive for fostering healthy competition. Having said all this, there is an important issue, which we cannot lose sight of. One of the major comforts that a regulator seeks as part of its depositor interest centric function is the reputation and the financial strength of the promoter. From this perspective the nation’s sovereign as the main shareholder gives a lot of comfort to the regulator. The recent events, even if one may consider them exceptional, demonstrated that those perceived as invincible also do not have the financial muscle of the sovereign. However, the regulator should not bask under the comfort of the sovereign being the promoter nor should it let any instruments of Government abuse this comfort. The punch line, if one has to sum up the whole gamut of issues relating to regulation and supervision of public sector banks, could read – Feel comfortable, but don’t relax! Thank you all for your attention. BIS Review 162/2008 5 
Christian Noyer: A new regulatory framework for a new financial system Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, at a round table discussion at the University of Paris-Dauphine, Paris, 11 December 2008. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to take part in this round table discussion. Today, the prevailing view is – and justly so – that it is necessary to rethink financial regulation. There are two reasons for this: a) Financial markets and banks are, more or less strongly, confronted with problems of asymmetric information; b) Operational inefficiencies may arise, leading, in some extreme cases, to the seizing up of certain market segments. Needless to say that these imperfections are interconnected. In many respects, the financial crisis is the expression of these imperfections. Three examples can be used as an illustration. The underestimation of risk and the mispricing of assets during the upswing of the financial cycle show that markets may generate excess investment in certain sectors of the economy (e.g. the US real estate sector). Furthermore, it appears that financial innovation and the change in banks’ economic models have resulted in a significant increase in information asymmetries and, more importantly, in lower incentives for economic agents to pay attention to these asymmetries. Lastly, the fact that some market segments seized up during the crisis suggests that some infrastructures necessary for their functioning are lacking. To simplify, I believe that the logic underlying the current regulatory system consists in ensuring the financial stability of market segments, but without adopting an overall approach. However, the crisis has forced us to acknowledge that this fragmented approach to regulation does not necessarily ensure the stability of the entire financial system. During this crisis, the fact that financial institutions had considerably increased their use of leverage and that risk was concentrated among a relatively small number of banks was neither well assessed, nor well captured, nor prevented by regulation. In view of this failure and in order to mitigate the impact in terms of financial instability, government interventions were designed, not to stabilize the situation of any particular institution, but to prevent systemic risk from materialising. As a result, we now require macro-prudential regulation. This naturally leads us to address the issue of the scope of financial regulation. Who should be regulated? The problem is not new; it is also complex. Like me, you will have noticed that, at their last summit meeting, the G20 Heads of State and Government laid down a clear principle on the matter. They have indeed committed themselves to ensuring that “all financial markets, products and participants are regulated or subject to oversight, as appropriate to their circumstances”. The crisis shows quite clearly that the markets and institutions that have a systemic role must be regulated. This criterion implies re-examining the functioning of certain OTC markets, such as the interbank money market or the credit derivatives market. Similarly, rating agencies should also be regulated, given the key role they play in correcting information asymmetries on financial markets. Lastly, public authorities should pay greater attention to those financial institutions that are central to the supply of market liquidity and financing. An important starting point is to acknowledge that financial system participants have very different functions, pursue different strategies and operate according to different economic models. This diversity is crucial to the smooth functioning of markets. A one-size-fits-all BIS Review 161/2008 1 
regulatory framework applied to all participants would certainly give rise to herd behaviour and, consequently, reinforce the endogeneity of certain risks. A gradation could reasonably be applied to the regulations and requirements imposed on financial system participants. Three levels, ranging from oversight to regulation, naturally come to mind. The first level would take the form of a mandatory registration and the commitment to comply with a code of good practices. The second – more restrictive – level would include disclosure obligations with regard to activities and accounts, in addition to the mandatory registration and the compliance with good practices. Hedge funds and, more generally, institutions pursuing strategies essentially based on leverage or risk-taking could have to meet such requirements. Finally, the last level would involve more restrictive regulations with regard to activities and risk-taking, as well as closer oversight. In many respects, this gradation system is not only relevant with regard to prudential requirements. It should also apply to accounting rules for example. Beyond the theoretical considerations, it is important that financial regulation, in all its forms, should contribute to maintaining financial system diversity. Thus, attempting to measure all assets and liabilities at fair value has some drawbacks – and even entails risks – that need to be taken into account if lessons are to be drawn from the financial crisis for accounting rules. To conclude, I would like to stress an important point regarding the new financial regulatory framework. It would be unrealistic to believe that financial regulation is the answer, and, above all, that it is capable of protecting us from the risk of financial instability. Indeed, the crisis can largely be attributed to financial institutions’ inadequate risk management, which stems from an irrational trust in quantitative tools. Financial regulation should be an incentive for financial system participants to develop a sound and efficient management framework. It is no substitute. 2 BIS Review 161/2008 
Stanley Fischer: Impact of the global financial crisis on Israel’s economy Address by Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, to the General Assembly of the Association of Publicly Traded Companies, Jerusalem, 8 December 2008. *      *      * For more than a year the world has been confronting one of the worst financial crises in over seventy years. This crisis has two phases: the first, financial, and the second, real, in other words a significant slowdown, and possibly even a global recession. Both the financial and real effects of the global financial crisis on Israel's economy are clearly evident. I would like to stress, however, that Israel entered this period in a more favorable state than that in most other countries. On the financial side the crisis is reflected in Israel mainly by the fall in prices of shares and corporate bonds, unlike in the advanced and other economies. In addition, the rate of growth declined to 2.3 percent (annual rate) in the third quarter, and it is expected that the slowdown in Israel's growth rate will continue, i.e., growth will remain positive, but will slow further, (to 1.5 percent in 2009), as opposed to a more significant slowdown, or even a recession, in the advanced economies.  Israel's relatively favorable situation is due to several factors:  1) The government's fiscal policy in the last few years was a responsible one. 2) The Bank of Israel’s interest rate policy supported financial stability and the ability of the economy to deal successfully with the effects of the slowdown in growth. This, without acting counter to the return of inflation to within the target range. 3) A surplus has been created in the current account of the balance of payments. 4) Israel's foreign exchange reserves are high and rising, as a result of the Bank of Israel's plan to increase them. 5) The levels of growth and employment were high at the onset of the crisis. 6) Israel's banking system is strong and stable compared with those of the advanced economies. 7) Israel's capital market did not develop advanced, complex financial instruments whose inherent risk levels are difficult to assess. 8) The average debt burden of companies and households is relatively low. The challenge at present is to preserve the economy's relatively favorable position, to take advantage of it to deal with the new situation, and to introduce the measures needed to escape from the period of slowdown without harming the economy's ability to return to the path of rapid and sustained growth. All this, despite the forthcoming elections and the fact that the 2009 budget has not been approved yet. At this stage the Bank of Israel, in the framework of its powers and the instruments available, is taking the following steps: 1) It is conducting an active interest rate policy intended to strengthen the economy's ability to handle the crisis. 2) The Bank Supervision Department has intensified its regular monitoring of developments in the banking system. In addition, the Bank announced that it was ready to help the banks with all the means at its disposal, as necessary, in order to support depositors.  BIS Review 161/2008 1 
3) The Bank's program to buy foreign currency will continue until the forex reserves reach the level considered appropriate under the current circumstances – between $40 billion and $44 billion.  What do we still have to do?  1) A cautious fiscal policy should be pursued. Thus, assuming a growth rate of 1.5 percent in 2009, the budget deficit is expected to reach about 3 percent of GDP, based on the automatic stabilizers, i.e., the expected drop in tax revenues resulting from the slowdown in growth, on the one hand, and a certain rise in government expenditure arising, for example, from an increase in unemployment, on the other. It would not be advisable to allow the deficit to rise much beyond that; in other words, our ability to embark on an expansionary fiscal policy is limited.  Nevertheless, the tax cuts planned for 2009 should proceed, in a manner consistent with the automatic stabilizers.  2) The measures formulated by the Ministry of Finance in cooperation with the Securities Authority and the Bank of Israel should be implemented. This program should help the economy weather the storm.  3) It is essential, and I would place the emphasis on this aspect, to introduce measures on the financial side, particularly steps intended to increase the sources of bank and nonbank credit for the business sector, including small and medium-sized businesses, and to stimulate foreign investment in Israel's capital market.  Yesterday the Prime Minister decided to support the proposal put forward by the work teams of the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Israel and the Prime Minister's Office, regarding a "safety net" for savers close to retirement age. The Bank is in favor of the proposal and its immediate implementation.  However, we view the safety net as a temporary measure for this particular time. It is important to start thinking about changes to the structure of the pensions system in Israel, to ensure that those paying into funded pension schemes, as opposed to those covered by unfunded schemes, are not placed in a situation in which, close to retirement age, they are likely to lose a significant part of their savings. It is important that the pension system be structured such that when the time arrives savers can receive a reasonable pension for the rest of their lives. One possible pension scheme structure that could be adopted is the Sicilian model, in which the savings of those close to retirement age are transferred to relatively low-risk channels.  To my great regret, the other steps formulated by the Ministry of Finance, although approved by the Prime Minister, are making little or no progress vis-à-vis the Knesset, and are not being implemented. Thus, valuable time that could be used to the benefit of the economy is being wasted, particularly regarding measures relating to the financial side. Further delay in applying these measures is likely to erode the economic achievements of the last few years and our ability successfully to meet the challenges facing us.  This is not the time, therefore, to postpone decision making. The financial crisis is here, and is not waiting for us. The measures have been planned, and all that remains is to start with the none-too-simple task of making decisions and implementing them. It is essential that at this time, in the approach to the elections to the Knesset, we persist in being focused, and act with a view to the medium and long term. Failure to do so will cost us dear.  2 BIS Review 161/2008 
Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj: Bahrain develops its financial centre in the Gulf region  Address by His Excellency Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, at the BNP Paribas – Inauguration of new premises at the Bahrain Financial Harbor, Manama, 9 November 2008. *      *      * Monsieur de Courscel, Monsieur Durand, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is an honour and a pleasure for me to join you today to celebrate the formal opening of the BNP Paribas premises at the Bahrain Financial Harbor. May I welcome M. de Courscel and his colleagues who have travelled from Paris to be with us today. Their presence is indicative of the importance that BNP Paribas places on the development of its business in the Gulf region and an acknowledgement of the role of Bahrain as the leading financial centre of the region, can play in that development. The bank’s relationship with Bahrain goes back nearly 35 years and this relationship has been rather special. With the granting of a Full Commercial Banking licence in February 1975, the bank became the first European mainland banking institution to conduct business in Bahrain. Later in the same year, the bank was one of the first international institutions to be granted an Offshore Banking Unit licence. Therefore, from an historical perspective alone, the bank has been closely involved in, and has become an integral part of, Bahrain’s development as an international financial centre. The professional competence of its staff, the commitment of local management to maintain and enhance its operational base in Bahrain, and the support given to this concept by its regional and head office directors, have been foundations upon which a success story has been built. At the beginning of this decade, Bahrain was officially appointed as the hub for the bank’s regional operations. The opening of these splendid premises at the Bahrain Financial Harbor are a physical expression of the success that BNP Paribas has subsequently enjoyed in the region. These are, of course, challenging times for the global financial system. There now seems little doubt that, in the short term at least, this region will not remain unaffected by the global economic downturn. However, it is important to look beyond the immediate picture and focus instead on the long-run prospects for global and regional economic growth. The fact that BNP Paribas is now strengthening its commitment to this region, is testament to its view that many good business opportunities are still to be found here. I am confident that the success that BNP Paribas has enjoyed in Bahrain for the past 35 years will continue into the future. That success will be underpinned by the same principles as in the past: adherence to sound business practice, enlightened staff policies and good customer relations, all of which have been the framework within which the bank has prospered. Honoured guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure I declare open the BNP Paribas office in the Bahrain Financial Harbor. May I wish the bank a successful and prosperous evolution and continued close association with the development of Bahrain as the leading international financial centre of the Gulf region.

Christian Noyer: Lessons from the crisis. A central banker’s reflections on some accounting policy issues Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, at the European meeting of the accounting profession, Paris, 11 December 2008. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to be taking part in this European meeting of the accounting profession. This discussion seems to me to be especially timely since the current crisis has raised a whole series of questions related more or less closely to accounting policy. It is no coincidence that the latest Banque de France Financial Stability Review is devoted to issues of valuation. I am convinced that the crisis will force us to carry out an in-depth assessment of the concepts and tools relating to valuation. I am not an accountant. The point of view I am putting forward today is that of a central banker who is responsible in particular for financial stability. With this perspective in mind, I propose that together we take a look at three topics. • an overview of the crisis from the point of view of valuation • the issue of the neutrality of accounting conventions • the consistency of rules and practices with regard to valuation Financial crisis, a crisis of valuation In many respects, the current crisis is about valuation. To be sure, the factors underlying and accounting for the crisis are numerous. However, one of its significant features is that the uncertainty surrounding the “true” value of complex financial instruments has undermined the confidence of global markets, increased uncertainty about counterparty risk and led to contagion across asset classes, financial markets and economic regions. The crisis has highlighted the fact that the valuation of financial instruments is not only a question of accounting. It raises issues about risk measurement and management by financial institutions, prudential issues via the definition of capital requirements and, more widely, financial stability issues. However, valuation is also without any doubt an accounting issue. It is therefore hardly surprising that the debate about the application of accounting standards to financial instruments is a highly topical one. I think it interesting to note that the crisis has occurred in a financial system that has seen two far-reaching developments. I am referring first of all to the rapid growth in securitisation and products whose valuation is complex. I will not dwell on this aspect as it is not the subject of today’s meeting. The aspect I would like to focus on is the transition to the “fair value” accounting of financial instruments. The rationale behind this accounting development is understandable and can be summarised as follows. The aim is to enable investors and financial system participants, which include supervisors, to have a better understanding of the risk profile of financial institutions in order to better assess their position. In order to achieve this, financial statements must – in the case of instruments for which it is economically relevant – be sensitive to price signals from markets, which reflect transaction values. I believe that two elements are important in this argument. The first is that financial statements have the crucial merit of providing information. The second is that the rationale of fair value valuation contains within it its own limitations. The concept of "transaction", which is BIS Review 160/2008 1 
fundamental in this context and, as a result, that of "market", should constitute the limits of the scope of application of fair value accounting. Are accounting choices neutral? It goes without saying that the greater sensitivity of balance sheets to market fluctuations resulting from fair value accounting obviously has an impact on financial stability. A central banker may legitimately wonder whether accounting conventions are neutral with respect to the behaviour of financial players and market dynamics. The current crisis and volatility that we have been faced with over the past few months suggest that accounting conventions have an impact in terms of financial incentives and may have had a not insignificant impact on financial players' strategies. One example serves to illustrate this point. It is macroeconomic in nature and relates to risk-taking by financial institutions. It is the possibility, in the case of some instruments, of recording as of the first trading day all of the discounted future profits even though the risks remain on the balance sheet. If we are to believe the financial industry itself, this possibility has an impact on investment strategies. It cannot be ruled out that because this rule makes it possible to record substantial income flows during cyclical upswings, it has contributed to greater risk-taking by some institutions in order to maintain these income flows year after year. In a more general way, the extension of the scope of application of fair value accounting has very probably, during cyclical upswings, also contributed to many assets being accounted for at market value whereas the intention of market participants to manage these assets on a fair value basis was not clear. My aim here is not to make a judgement about the relative merits of accounting choices. It is to highlight the fact that these choices have implications that go beyond accounting policy. In concrete terms, therefore, the question that we need to ask collectively is: what is the optimum policy response? Do accounting conventions need to be modified? Or can other regulatory frameworks correct these effects? Consistency of valuation rules  This leads me to the last point that I would like to an address today: the consistency of rules and practices with respect to valuation. There are currently differences of approach between accounting practices, prudential regulation and risk management practices. It is thus wholly accepted in the financial industry that there is inevitably uncertainty surrounding the valuation of financial instruments, particularly when they are complex or illiquid. In addition, the limitations of mathematical models are recognised. These two factors, i.e. price volatility over the financial cycle and the limits of quantitative techniques highlight a number of divergences between internal risk management and fair value accounting. More generally, the application of accounting rules, which give the value of a company or activity at a given moment, does not always allow the forward-looking valuation of financial instruments or sound risk management practices. Yet these aspects are important for prudential authorities. Conversely, choices in terms of prudential regulation can have an impact on financial stability when they interact with certain accounting rules. For instance, the hitherto favourable treatment given by prudential rules to the trading book has without doubt encouraged behaviour aimed at generating very short-term profits via transactions booked at market value. Like me you will have noted that, in their press release in November, the G20 Heads of State and Government gave particular attention to accounting issues. The work programme they have assigned to ministers and experts addresses several areas. It is aimed at "harmonising accounting standards, particularly for complex instruments, during times of stress". It also aims to "address weaknesses in accounting and disclosure standards for off-balance sheet 2 BIS Review 160/2008 
vehicles". Lastly, it aims to "enhance the required disclosure of complex financial instruments by firms". The Heads of State and Government have assigned an ultimate objective to accounting standard setters, i.e. the creation of a "single high-quality global standard". It is striking that the attention given to accounting issues is linked to financial stability considerations. To conclude this address that has already been rather too lengthy, I should just like to remove any ambiguity that may have arisen from the discussions that have intensified with the crisis. I do not think that it is in anyone's interest in the current period to weaken accounting conventions. Accurate, rigorous and fully transparent financial statements are the bedrock of financial activity. The aim of the work and discussions that have been actively pursued over the last few months and that will continue in the coming period is in fact both a modest and a difficult one. It is to ensure that accounting conventions fully reflect the reality of financial activities and are not overambitious. This undoubtedly means reviewing the role of fair value in the accounting treatment of financial instruments. Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 160/2008 3 
Mark Carney: From hindsight to foresight Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to Women in Capital Markets, Toronto, Ontario, 17 December 2008.  *      *      * It has been a difficult year for capital markets professionals. The turmoil has deteriorated into a full-blown financial crisis. Most financial markets have experienced historic falls in prices, and some are strained to the point of closing. Issues of financial stability that were once the obsession of a pessimistic few are now the daily concern of many. Policy-makers have had to respond with bold measures. These will work, although it will take time for confidence to return and for capital to flow once again. In the interim, the dramatic repricing of risk across financial assets will be increasingly mirrored in the real economy. Businesses are already beginning to postpone large investments, and households now hesitate over major purchases. Partly as a consequence of financial instability, next year will be a trying one for many Canadians.  Few forecast these events; although, in an outbreak of retrospective foresight, an increasing number now claim they saw it coming. The reality is that among all the banks, investors, academics and policy-makers, only a handful were able to identify ahead of time the causes and potential scale of the crisis.1 Central banks, ministries of finance and international financial institutions all believed either that risks were being adequately managed or that vulnerabilities lay elsewhere. Around the world, private banks exceeded their regulatory capital requirements. Clearly, though, risks were not being managed properly and capital was inadequate. Now, in the rush to respond, we must avoid building the financial equivalent of the Maginot line – overpreparing for a repeat of current events while remaining vulnerable to the root causes of the next crisis. Rather, we must develop early-warning systems with precision and with teeth. This will require progress internationally and domestically. Internationally, both the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must become more effective. There are several ways of accomplishing this. The first is to divide more clearly responsibilities between these bodies, with the IMF having primary responsibility for surveillance (i.e., the early-warning system) and the FSF for coordinating the development of a resilient financial system. Second, policy-makers themselves must become more engaged. The value of international organizations is not that their bureaucracies possess unique powers of insight, but rather that they can convene senior policy-makers, challenge them, and then forge a consensus on how to foster sustainable global economic growth. Third, countries must recognize that membership in these organizations brings responsibilities. This is why Canada successfully pushed at the recent G-20 summit for mandatory regular reviews of each country's financial system by the IMF (a process carried out under the Financial Sector Assessment Program or FSAP). Finally, it matters who is around the table. In Washington last month, G-20 leaders agreed to expand the FSF to include key emerging markets. These countries not only have first-hand experience of financial crises but also are the major surplus countries who, as major capital providers, need to be part of a global solution.2                                                   1  Examples include Bill White, formerly of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank for International Settlements; Harvard University's Ken Rogoff; Nouriel Roubini of New York University; Wynne Godley of Cambridge; and Bernard Connolly of AIG Financial Products. 2  M. Carney, "Reflections on Recent International Economic Developments" (Speech to the Canadian Club of Montreal, Montréal, Quebec, 25 September 2008). BIS Review 160/2008 1 
Domestic responsibility for financial stability is currently shared among a large number of federal and provincial bodies. This includes the Bank of Canada, which is mandated by legislation to "promote the economic and financial welfare of Canada." Today I would like to focus on how the Bank can fulfill this broad mandate by contributing to financial stability in Canada.  A macroprudential approach A clear lesson of the current crisis is the need to take a macroprudential approach to financial stability. Macroprudential surveillance assesses current risks by looking at the broad economic and financial conditions that can contribute to the buildup of risks to the financial system and the economy as a whole. Macroprudential regulation seeks to improve the resiliency of the financial system by designing standards and codes to limit the buildup of financial and economic imbalances. Put simply, a macroprudential approach focuses on the forest, not the trees.  Two topical fallacies of composition illustrate the point. The first is what Keynes termed the "paradox of thrift." It may be individually rational for people to want to save more and businesses to invest less during uncertain economic times. If this behaviour is widespread, however, it becomes collectively irrational. Fear of recession feeds a recession. Similarly, a bank may decide to hoard capital in anticipation of increased loan losses during a slowdown. If all banks do the same, their actions will exacerbate the downturn and increase their eventual losses. It is well-known that timely and properly calibrated monetary and fiscal policy can address the first issue. It is less widely recognized that macroprudential regulation can address the second.  In many ways, the central bank is ideally suited to bring a macroprudential approach to financial stability. Our mandate demands that we take an economy-wide perspective. Further, we have a strong motivation to maintain a stable, efficient financial system because we rely on it to transmit our monetary policy actions. However, we do not have many of the tools necessary to secure financial stability. Monetary policy is a blunt instrument, poorly suited to addressing financial imbalances. Instead, macrofinancial stability should be one of the core objectives of financial regulation. Until it is, under the current framework, the Bank can promote financial stability through two tools: liquidity and advocacy.  The Bank is the ultimate source of liquidity within the economy. We have used our recently enhanced powers under the Bank of Canada Act extensively throughout the crisis, with measures that now total more than $36 billion of term liquidity. There are four important points of context. First, we are not supplying net liquidity to the system – there is no new central bank money. Rather, we are redistributing liquidity by exchanging liquid assets for high-quality, though less-liquid ones. Second, we are substantially over-collateralized to protect our balance sheet.3 Third, consistent with Canada's relatively strong banking system, our liquidity provision has not been as large as elsewhere. For example, the Bank of Canada is currently providing liquidity equivalent to around 1 per cent of total domestic banking assets. The comparable figures are 4 per cent in Europe, 5 per cent in the United Kingdom and 6 per cent in the United States. Finally, while the provision of extraordinary liquidity by central banks is limiting the damage from the crisis, it has long been apparent that official liquidity, irrespective of size, cannot re-open markets on its own. The Bank's second tool – advocacy – has not received the same profile as the first – a fact I hope to begin to change today. The Bank can promote financial stability by influencing public sector policies and private sector behaviour. We do this in two ways; by leveraging our                                                  3  For example, at the end of November, the Bank had collateral for its term purchase and resale agreements worth 105 per cent of the amount outstanding in term PRAs. 2 BIS Review 160/2008 
position in key domestic and international organizations, and by producing solid analysis and research to ground our advice. Domestically, we work closely with representatives from the Federal Department of Finance, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. We meet regularly to share information, coordinate actions, and advise the federal government on financial sector policy. Within this group, the Bank of Canada is the only organization that brings a solely macroprudential perspective to the table – a perspective we intend increasingly to assert. Improving our analysis and sharpening our accountability In recent years, the Bank has made financial stability a strategic priority. Strengthening this priority was one of the primary motivations behind our internal reorganization last month. We now have a department dedicated to financial stability, and we are investing heavily in our research and analysis. We are hiring senior capital markets professionals and drawing on leading academics as special advisers. In addition, the mandate of the Bank's Governing Council has been sharpened to add financial stability assessment to its responsibilities. The deputy governors and I should be held accountable for our analysis; others for whether or not they follow our advice.  To be clear, we are not seeking to identify every worthy reform in the financial sector (they are legion). Rather, we will seek to identify stresses in the economy as well as the regulations and practices that have the potential for serious macroeconomic consequences. In doing so, we will want occasionally to change behaviours, conventions and even regulations to mitigate threats. The latest edition of the Bank's Financial System Review (FSR), which was published last week, is a first step. It contains, for the first time, the judgment of the Governing Council as to the main risks to Canadian financial stability. I will return to this shortly. First, I will say a few words regarding an article in the current FSR, which details efforts by Bank staff to construct an early-warning indicator for financial stress in Canada.4  An early-warning system The Bank of Canada has developed a financial stress indicator, the FSI, which uses a number of domestic variables to measure the degree of financial stress in the economy.5 As you would expect, the FSI is now showing record levels of stress. It is correlated with how you all probably feel. While this indicator does an excellent job of measuring stress in real time, our objective is to develop empirical measures that could forewarn of potential financial crises. In other words, given that the FSI accurately measures financial stress, what accurately predicts changes in the FSI? It has been clear for some time that rapid growth in credit and sustained growth in asset prices often precede financial crises. Bank researchers have found a promising tool for assessing Canada's vulnerability to crisis: a combination of growth in domestic business credit and real estate prices that tends to be a good predictor of changes to the Bank's financial stress indicator one to two years in the future. However, this combination was unable to predict the current crisis because the root causes came from outside Canada. There is ongoing work at the Bank to refine these tools, which could prove important, not                                                  4  M. Misina, P. St-Amant, and G. Tkacz, "Credit, Asset Prices, and Financial Stress in Canada", Financial System Review (Ottawa: Bank of Canada, December 2008): 29-33. 5  M. Illing and Y. Liu, "An Index of Financial Stress for Canada" (Working Paper No. 2003-14, Bank of Canada, 2003). BIS Review 160/2008 3 
only for predicting future periods of financial instability and thereby prompting timely corrective actions, but also for the development of countercyclical capital rules that I will discuss in a few minutes.  Current risks to stability In the FSR, five major risks to financial stability were identified: first, the liquidity and funding of financial institutions; second, their capital adequacy; third, the state of household balance sheets; fourth, the possibility of a more prolonged downturn in the global economy; and fifth, the threat of a destabilizing unwinding of global financial imbalances. Let me now spend a few minutes discussing the first three of these risks in some detail, although I should stress that these are risks, and not the most likely outcomes. Funding and liquidity The current crisis began in the summer of 2007 as liquidity dried up, leading to major disruptions in money and bond markets. In response, the Bank of Canada provided exceptional liquidity to core financial institutions, with the expectation that this liquidity would cascade through the financial system. This was indeed the case this past spring. With the intensification of the crisis since September, our liquidity efforts have been significantly expanded. While these actions have sharply lowered money market spreads and encouraged some lending at longer maturities, conditions remain far from normal.  Bond issuance has been slow to return, which is putting greater pressure on banks as the sole source of lending growth. In tandem, financial institutions have curtailed their central roles as intermediaries and market-makers. This feeds illiquidity and volatility in financial markets and delays the return of confidence in the financial system. This could aggravate the adverse feedback loop between the financial system and the real economy. In essence, we have gone from one extreme – with overabundant liquidity leading to the misallocation of capital – to another – where, in some systemically important markets, capital is barely being allocated at all. The challenge for policy-makers is to provide transition support that effectively restarts rather than replaces markets. As I have argued elsewhere, this may require structural changes to some markets, including the greater use of clearing houses, and a re-thinking of the scale and frequency of central bank liquidity operations.6  Procyclical capital adequacy The second risk identified in the FSR is the procyclicality of bank capital. Put simply, banks characteristically increase leverage in a boom, further feeding the expansion, before reducing leverage in a downturn, exacerbating the slowdown. Regulation often reinforces these tendencies when it should lean against them. This is now a serious global problem. Banks outside of Canada are under enormous pressure to reduce leverage. Given the scope of likely ultimate losses from structured products alone, it would take an enormous amount of capital to reduce average leverage ratios to Canadian levels. Bank of Canada research estimates that U.S., U.K. and European banks would need to raise a combined US$1.2 trillion to bring their leverage ratios down to Canadian levels. These capital needs will rise linearly with any recession-induced writedowns. In this environment, banks are inclined to hoard capital, rather than deploy it. In a world with guarantees, liquidity and funding support, regulators should not reinforce this tendency.                                                   6  M. Carney, "Building Continuous Markets" (Speech to the Canada-United Kingdom Chamber of Commerce, London, England, 19 November 2008). 4 BIS Review 160/2008 
In Canada, our banks are not facing the same pressures to de-lever as their counterparts abroad. Still, their loan portfolios would experience higher credit losses in a deep or prolonged downturn. The risk identified in the FSR is that market forces could compel banks to maintain higher capital ratios than necessary to guard against the possibility of worse economic outcome. This could lead banks to slow balance sheet growth, which would tighten lending conditions for both households and businesses and weaken the economy. Ultimately, the financial institutions themselves would suffer from this self-fulfilling prophecy.  Given these concerns, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions last month took the welcome step of giving Canadian banks more flexibility by allowing them to raise the proportion of preferred shares that comprise their Tier 1 capital from 30 per cent to 40 per cent. The lower absolute leverage of Canadian institutions and the higher quality of their Tier 1 capital should mean that they can expand lending faster than their international peers. The value of this virtually unique advantage of our economy should not be underestimated. The Bank is working with its international counterparts to examine how the current regulatory capital framework may amplify fluctuations in economic and financial conditions.7 Under current rules, capital requirements are linked to the credit risk in an institution's portfolio. In an upturn, risk goes down, banks are required to hold less capital, and the growth of credit increases. The problem is that this can amplify swings in financial conditions and lead to the emergence of financial imbalances. Recall the link between credit growth and future financial stress that I just mentioned. Then, during the downturn when credit risk increases, banks are required to increase capital holdings, thus exacerbating the economic weakness and financial stress. This is the motivation for proposals to have capital requirements move procyclically. Banks could be required to build up capital buffers during times of rapid credit expansion. This would strengthen their balance sheets and reduce the risk that financial imbalances will develop from overly easy financial conditions. During a downturn, banks could then draw down these buffers, which would reduce the need to liquidate assets or restrict loan growth at a time when credit conditions and asset prices are already under stress. In this way, capital requirements would moderate the ups and downs of the credit cycle – the reverse of what currently happens – reducing the risk of a future crisis.  This macroprudential approach to capital requirements is tremendously important, but it is also complex, with a number of practical and logistical concerns. Such a system could be accomplished by linking capital requirements to movements in credit-cycle indicators, such as loan growth and asset prices. For example, our research on the determinants of financial stress that I mentioned a moment ago can help inform the development of such regulatory guidelines. It is probably unrealistic to think that ex ante a perfect formula can be derived. Ultimately, there are important questions regarding the balance of rules and discretion and, regarding the latter, who should exercise that discretion.  Household balance sheets The third risk relates to the health of Canadian household balance sheets. Household credit makes up about 60 per cent of the Canadian banking sector's total loan exposure, so losses on household lending would likely have an immediate impact on capital adequacy and forward profitability. The household sector could be an important channel through which global economic weakness affects the Canadian financial sector more widely. While the Canadian household sector remains relatively healthy, its resilience will be tested during the recession. Various indicators of financial stress, such as bankruptcies and loans in                                                  7  See "Recent Proposals for Procyclical Capital Requirements", Financial System Review (Ottawa: Bank of Canada, December 2008): 15. BIS Review 160/2008 5 
arrears, have increased recently from historically low levels. Falling equity markets and softening house prices have put pressure on household balance sheets at a time when the ratio of debt to income is already at a record high of 140 per cent. The household debt-to-asset ratio has risen as the credit crisis intensified, reaching 19 per cent at the end of the third quarter – the highest level since 1990. At the same time, the debt-service ratio of households actually declined modestly to 7.5 per cent, well below the historical average of 9.2 per cent seen since 1992, owing to lower effective borrowing costs. This gives a measure of assurance that most households can comfortably manage their debts.  The health of Canadian households is obviously important to our banking sector. If the global economic downturn were significantly more severe than projected, then household defaults in Canada could rise sharply. This risk would be magnified if banks begin to tighten credit conditions to households more significantly than they have so far. In the FSR, we examined these risks using a simulated stress test. Specifically, we examined an extreme scenario where nominal household income drops at an average annual rate of 2 per cent for six straight quarters as a result of global economic weakness. Such an event could double – from 3 per cent to 6 per cent – the proportion of Canadian households considered to be vulnerable; that is, with debt-service ratios above 40 per cent of income. Further, those vulnerable households would own 13 per cent of total household debt, a figure double the average of the past 10 years. If this scenario were to materialize, it would prompt significant losses among Canada's banks. However, it is important not to overplay this scenario, since it actually illustrates the strength of our system. First, the scenario is extreme – the annual growth of household income has not been negative during any quarter over the 37 years for which data are available. Second, while the average Tier 1 capital ratio of our banks would fall from 9.7 per cent to about 8.8 per cent, this figure is still more than two times the minimum ratio allowed under the Basel II Accord, and well above OSFI's 7 per cent threshold. There are a number of reasons why the risk posed by household balance sheets is significantly lower in Canada than elsewhere, not the least of which is Canada's more conservative lending culture. For example, subprime mortgages account for less than 5 per cent of Canadian mortgage lending, roughly one-third the level in the United States. Further, since Canada requires insurance on high-loan-to-value mortgages and Canada Mortgage Bonds carry an explicit sovereign guarantee, there has been no negative feedback loop between the housing market and the financial sector as has been all too apparent in other major economies. While Canada's debt-service ratio remains below its historical average, as I mentioned, the debt-service ratio in the United States remains above its historical average. Further, the absolute cost of household debt in Canada – both mortgage and other loans – has fallen by about 100 basis points since the onset of the crisis last year. Nonetheless, the Bank of Canada will continue to closely monitor the risk posed to financial stability from household balance sheets. In addition, the Bank will closely consider the possibility that households may be more sensitive to shocks to their income or wealth as it develops its outlook for Canadian growth and inflation. Conclusion In times of crisis, it is easy to understand the links between financial stability and the real economy. While these are all too apparent, it is sometimes hard to see the end of the crisis. But end it will. The actions that policy-makers are taking will be effective. The global economy will emerge from this period of weakness. In the years ahead, when times are better, the need to promote financial stability may not be as clear-cut, even though it will be no less important. The Bank of Canada will continue to take a macroprudential approach. We will use all the tools at our disposal to promote financial stability at home and abroad and, in so doing, continue to contribute to the economic and financial welfare of Canada. 6 BIS Review 160/2008 
Caleb M Fundanga: Supporting education in Zambia Remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the Masomo Education Foundation Scholarship Presentation, Lusaka, 21 November 2008. *      *      * • The President, Masomo Education Foundation, Mr. Chisanga Puta-Chekwe • Hon Members of Parliament present • The Chairman, Selection Committee, Dr Silane Mwenechanya • Managing Director of Barclays Bank (Z) Ltd, Mr Zafar Masud • Representatives from the University of Zambia • Mr. John Mwanakatwe • Representatives from the Canadian High Commission in Zambia • Members of the Press • Distinguished invited guests • Ladies and gentlemen It is an honour and privilege for me to officiate at this scholarship award presentation. I am most humbled because I am the second ever guest of honour to grace such an event following, a distinguished academician who officiated at the fist ceremony. This is someone who has inspired a lot of Zambians including me to be what we are today. He was one of the first Zambians to graduate with a university degree and has not looked back thereafter. He has continued to inspire and encourage others to climb the education ladder to the top. Ladies and Gentlemen, let us all stand and recognize the presence of one of Zambia’s finest academician, lawyer and writer, Mr. John Mwanakatwe. Ladies and Gentlemen, in the short history of post independence Zambia, we can take pride at the achievements scored in the area of education, thus far. While facing numerous and difficult challenges, the country has continued to produce university and college graduates of international standards year in year out. This situation would not have been possible, had it not be for the past tremendous contributions and personal sacrifices made by a number of citizens under the guidance of leaders who had great foresight and fortitude. The dedication and ingenuity of our teachers and lecturers both in the past and today, have also massively contributed to the economic development we have achieved to date. I have no doubt that our nation needs more of such outstanding and dedicated citizens at all levels of society to take our country’s development to a higher level. Mr President, as we speak, Zambia’s economy is facing numerous challenges emanating from the global financial turmoil. As you are no doubt aware, the crisis has already resulted in a reduction in commodity prices including that of copper. The Zambian foreign exchange market has also been partly affected as is reflected in the volatility and weakening of the Kwacha exchange rate in the recent past. The result of all this is lower Government revenues and more expensive imports which would in turn culminate in higher inflation. Unfortunately, for a low income country like Zambia, lower Government revenue entail lower spending on social amenities including Education and Health. High cost of goods and services also mean that most of our citizens would not afford to educate their families. Ladies and Gentlemen, as we strive to achieve the Vision of becoming a middle income country by the year 2030, we shall no doubt be confronted with such and many more similar challenges both economically and politically. To be well prepared for such trying times ahead, we need to groom our best talents to assume leadership positions in all sectors of the economy. To achieve this vital task of nurturing our future leaders, the Government is trying its level best to provide education to all Zambians. The Government has done well thus far and should be implored to continue doing so. BIS Review 160/2008 1 
However, providing education for the benefit of all citizens is never an easy task due to other budgetary pressures exerted by other competing sectors like Health, Agriculture, and Community Development etc. If we are to achieve education for the majority of our people, we need concerted efforts from all stakeholders including private institutions and charitable organisations like the Masomo Education Foundation. Mr President, I am informed that the objective of the Foundation is to educate young Zambians at local colleges. I am particularly pleased that the Foundation is utilizing local educational institutions. This should be commended as it demonstrates the confidence you have in the calibre of our learned colleagues at these institutions. Having been a lecturer at the University of Zambia in the earlier days of my career, puts me in a better position to understand the passion and deep knowledge of the local issues the Zambian teachers and lectures possesses. I have no doubt that supporting our local institutions will lead to a stronger motivation and morale in our teachers. To this end, my Institution, the Bank of Zambia, currently provides scholarships to the University of Zambia and the Copperbelt University. Additionally, we also provide salary supplements to relevant departments as a way of encouraging our Zambian academics who are working under very difficult and challenging situations. Furthermore, I am reliably told, that the Masomo Scholarship is conferred only on the best and intelligent young men and women. The stringent selection criteria ensure that only deserving candidates possessing outstanding performance in academic and co-curricular activities are selected. I am further informed that the candidates are of exemplary character and are committed to the betterment of their families, societies and the nation at large. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am also informed that this year, the Foundation received several applications from a wide section of candidates. It is gratifying to know that many young men and women wish to have an opportunity to better their education in these trying times. It is for this reason that I call on all of us to assist, foundations like Masomo, to increase the number of scholarships so that many more people could benefit from the scholarships. I therefore, urge the donors to the Foundation to increase their allocation in the coming year and in future. I also call on other well wishers in this room and outside to support this noble cause. Remember, an educated population is a pre-requisite to a country’s economic development. This year, the Masomo Scholarship is conferred on three exceptional and deserving young individuals in Ms Lenganji Nalwamba who is studying Electrical Engineering, Mr. Wapatwa Silungwe, studying Civil Engineering and Mr. Emmanuel Mwila who is pursuing Agricultural Economics. In congratulating you on this deserved achievement, let me remind you that as you accept this scholarship, you have an obligation and duty to the Masomo Foundation and to the nation at large. It is this strong sense of obligation, duty, and commitments to serve the nation that enabled our fathers and fore fathers serve the Nation wholeheartedly and brought us where we are today. As students with a Masomo Scholarship, each of you will be given a unique opportunity to prove yourself. I urge you to work hard and learn from others around you including those different from you and less endowed than you. Let me also mention that as a Masomo Scholar, your progress and performance will be closely monitored and you will be looked upon as role models. I urge you to set the standards for others to emulate. I am confident that all three of you will live up to the highest standards and will not disappoint us. I once again congratulate you and your parents, for it is only through their guidance and care that you shall continue to succeed. I wish you well in your studies and hope to see the day when all of you will graduate with flying colors. Lastly, let me commend the President of this Foundation, for the noble work that you undertaking. I hope others will emulate your commitment towards developing the youths so that they can contribute to the welfare of our country. Mr. President, I salute and urge you to keep up with the good work that you are doing. To the sponsors and the Board of Directors, 2 BIS Review 160/2008 
may the good Lord continue blessing your deeds and may he give more to those who had a hand in helping the cause.

Lucas Papademos: Opening remarks at the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2008 ECB Financial Stability Review Speech by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the European Central Bank, at the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2008 ECB Financial Stability Review, Frankfurt am Main, 15 December 2008. *      *      * I. Introduction  My colleagues and I would like to welcome you to today’s press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2008 edition of the ECB Financial Stability Review. The financial stability assessment contained in the Review has been prepared with the close involvement of the ESCB Banking Supervision Committee. It is for the most part based on information that was available up until the “cut-off” date of 28 November. The Review examines in some detail the main trends and events that characterised the euro area financial system over the past six months and it contains 14 boxes and five special feature articles that address topical financial stability issues in a more focused and analytical manner. The central objective of the ECB Financial Stability Review is to identify the main sources of risk and vulnerability to financial system stability and to provide a comprehensive assessment of the capacity of the euro area financial system to absorb adverse disturbances. For this edition of the Review, we made an additional effort to provide a summary that makes the key messages of our analysis more accessible. In my presentation, I will broadly follow this summary, but also provide additional explanations on some of the most topical issues. I will start with a brief review of the overall impact of the financial market turmoil on the global banking system and the current macroeconomic outlook. I will then examine the risks and vulnerabilities in: (1) the global macro-financial environment; (2) the euro area corporate and household sectors and; (3) the euro area financial system. Finally, I will conclude with our overall assessment of risks to euro area financial stability in the period ahead. II.  The financial market turmoil: overview Since the publication of the previous Financial Stability Review in June 2008, the financial crisis has intensified. Banks had to absorb further asset valuation write-downs in an environment where wholesale funding costs remained elevated. At the same time, the global economic outlook deteriorated and became more uncertain, risk aversion among financial market participants surged, and the prices of most financial assets fell.  The persistent liquidity stresses in the early phases of the turmoil eventually gave way to deeper concerns about creditworthiness and the adequacy of capital buffers. Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, investors and creditors lost confidence in the ability of some financial firms to meet their obligations. As a result, many key financial firms faced mounting challenges in accessing short-term funding and capital markets, which triggered sharp drops in their stock prices. Some of the world’s largest financial institutions were affected by this adverse dynamic and a number of them were ultimately declared bankrupt, purchased by other financial institutions, or provided with government support.  Central banks and governments have taken extraordinary remedial actions, which aim at addressing liquidity stresses and strengthening capital positions, thus contributing to restoring confidence in and improving the resilience of financial systems. These measures have succeeded in stabilising the euro area banking system. Over time, as some BIS Review 159/2008 1 
government measures are being fully implemented, they should contribute to lowering funding costs of banks and facilitate the provision of credit to the broader economy.  After these introductory remarks, let me first present the latest available figures regarding the total turmoil-related income losses and the new capital raised by major global banks since the beginning of the second quarter of 2007 up to and including the third quarter of 2008. Over this period, the total mark-to-market losses amounted to USD 720 billion globally. This figure includes losses related to holdings of structured finance instruments and mortgages which are reflected either in net income or in the value of equity or in other comprehensive income.1 As shown in Chart 1, the share of European banks in this total was 37% (or USD 239 billion). Euro area banks reported losses of USD 131.3 billion, which represented 18% of the global amount. North American banks bore the bulk (59%) of the global mark-to-market losses.  Within the same period, major global banks raised USD 765 billion in new capital, that is, more than the losses reported (see Chart 2). The capital raised includes common stock, preferred stock, and hybrid securities that are accepted as capital by regulators.2 The share of European banks in the total new capital raised globally is 39% and that of euro area financial institutions is 18%. These shares are, respectively, somewhat higher or the same as the corresponding figures for the total losses. However, bank losses in the euro area seem to be more widely spread across individual institutions than is the case in the US and other countries. This notwithstanding, the intense stresses that emerged after the failure of Lehman Brothers raised serious doubts among investors about the asset quality and the adequacy of the capital buffers of some euro area institutions and resulted in an abrupt and significant deterioration in money market conditions. Consequently, government and central bank actions were necessary to help stabilise the banking system.  Since September this year, tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector to the real economy. In the euro area, a number of the downside risks to economic activity that had been previously identified materialised. The significant weakening of economic activity could have a negative effect on borrowers’ ability to service their debt and thus on the credit risk faced by banks.  According to the December 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, global economic weakness will persist in the coming quarters; thereafter we expect a gradual recovery, supported by the fall in commodity prices and assuming that the external environment improves and the financial tensions weaken (see Chart 3).                                                   1  Losses related to banks’ operating activities are not included, to the extent that investments in related assets can be segregated from operating losses. If a bank’s core business involves mortgage-loan origination, securitisation, or otherwise requires the firm to hold related assets, these losses are included. Losses from investments in all other banks or firms are included only if the firms or banks in question are not included in the data used to compute these figures, or if the loss affects cash flows, as in the case of fixed income securities. Figures are pre-tax and net of any relevant financial hedges and off-setting gains, unless a bank does not report these factors. Most recorded losses are the quarterly or accumulated losses that were reported at quarter-end. One important exception is when the company reports provisions for credit losses and charge-offs. In this case, the year-over-year increase in provisions or charge-offs are used instead, in order to minimise the impact of normal operations on the figures. Unless it is certain that loan charge-offs are not included in new provisions for losses, these charge-offs are only recorded for 2007. The underlying assumption is that charge-offs after the end of 2007 are already included in previously recorded provisions. Some banks do not expect to fully realise these write-downs, especially in the case of unrealised losses, mark-to-market losses, and loss provisions. Inclusion in the figures is not meant to imply that the firm has already incurred such losses, and any reversals or realised gains are included to mitigate the effects on write-down figures. 2  Gains and losses from asset sales (gains/losses from assets sold) and divestitures (value of quantity sold) are also included. The after-tax gain on asset sales is reported so as to provide a more accurate picture of its effect on equity, if this data is provided by the firm. Otherwise, pre-tax gains or total proceeds from sales are used. A capital infusion may also be excluded if sufficient information is not available. Information on write-downs and capital raised is limited by the individual bank’s willingness and ability to report it. In general, data is included from the first quarter in which the bank reported related losses on, and the first observations are for Q2/2007. 2 BIS Review 159/2008 
III.  Sources of risk and vulnerability This leads me to the second part of my presentation that focuses on the main sources of risk and vulnerability that may affect the euro area financial stability outlook over the next six to twelve months.  III.1  The global macro-financial environment Let me start with the risks and vulnerabilities we have identified in the global macro-financial environment. Global imbalances, notably the persistently large US current account deficits and the recycling of surpluses from emerging Asia and oil-exporting countries continue to pose substantial risks to global financial stability. The cumulated net capital inflows to the United States remained relatively stable (as shown in Chart 4), because the lower capital inflows from private investors were counterbalanced by important official inflows stemming from the continued accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by major oil exporters and other surplus economies.  Another important source of risk stems from the US housing market which has been the epicentre of the financial market stresses. The outlook for US house prices is shown on Chart 5 using the Case-Shiller futures price indices. The market expects that house prices will bottom out in 2010, about six months later than had been expected at the beginning of 2008. The narrow index which measures developments in the largest US cities, also indicates that house prices are expected to drop to a level that is more than 30% below the peak recorded in mid-2006, before they start to stabilise. Estimates of the existing excess supply in the housing markets put the housing overhang at around 1 million houses. At the current rate of housing starts, it would take up to two years to eliminate the excess supply. Box I of the Review provides a more in-depth assessment of the current and expected future valuations in the US housing markets.  At the same time, the outlook for the US corporate sector has, on balance, also weakened substantially. By mid-September, corporate profits growth and default rates had already deteriorated rapidly. As financing conditions have tightened significantly, even some of the largest corporations have reported shortages of cash. As shown in Chart 6, the rest of the world has remained the only positive contributor sustaining corporate profit growth in the US. It is likely, however, that the slowdown of the global economy will also curb this contribution in the period ahead, while declining domestic demand will continue to depress corporate profits.  A further source of risks to financial stability has been the continued worsening of the average hedge fund investment performance amid prolonged and heightened financial market volatility. During times of stress, many hedge funds reduced risk-taking and instead concentrated on capital preservation, either voluntarily, or due to the reduced availability of bank funding and investor withdrawals. The deleveraging in the hedge fund sector has been widespread and rapid as illustrated in Chart 7. Looking forward, if hedge funds fail to retain their investors and cases of hedge fund closure become more frequent, the possibility of further sizeable position unwinds by the sector may pose a challenge to financial markets.  In a context of global de-leveraging and mounting risk aversion, foreign investors also markedly reduced their exposures to emerging market financial assets. Persistent turbulence in financial markets weighed on those emerging economies that rely on external financing to fund their current account deficits, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. This is of relevance for financial stability also in the euro area because of the sizeable cross-border exposures of European banks vis-à-vis new EU Member States. The pertinent facts and potential risks are presented in Box 2 of the Review. The share of assets in new EU Member States was the highest for banks in Austria, Greece, Sweden, Belgium and Italy, while other euro area countries were less exposed (as shown in Chart 8). In 2007, the growth of euro area banks’ assets in this region was, on average, 35 percentage points higher than their total asset growth. Furthermore, given the higher profit margins that can be realised in the BIS Review 159/2008 3 
banking markets of new EU Member States the contribution of some euro area banks’ subsidiaries in the new EU Member States to group profits have been substantial. Some large banks that are active in the region could, therefore, be negatively affected if macroeconomic conditions in new EU members were to deteriorate.  III.2 The euro area corporate and household sectors In the euro area household sector, pockets of vulnerability may have grown in the mortgage markets, mostly stemming from developments in income and house prices. Regarding the latter, Chart 9 indicates that house prices in the euro area – with the exception of Germany – increased more strongly than housing rents over the last decade. The 45-degree line depicts equal growths rates of house prices and rents. Box 5 of the Review analyses developments in selected euro area housing markets using a dynamic asset pricing model. The main findings are, first, that while the bulk of the variability of house price movements can be attributed to changes in rental yields, a generalised decline in expected returns on housing investments may permeate the housing markets of all euro area countries, irrespective of the evolution of fundamentals. A further interesting finding of this analysis is that house prices tend to overreact to news, especially when fundamentals are deteriorating. While the ongoing slowdown in the annual growth rate of euro area residential property prices has remained gradual so far, the possibility of a market overreaction to negative news might well apply to house price dynamics in some regions at the present juncture.  Euro area non-financial corporations tend to exhibit, at present, stronger balance sheets than just before the last credit cycle downturn. However, their operating environment has become more challenging and less favourable than six months ago. In the near term, balance sheets are likely to deteriorate due to the expected slowdown of earnings growth, in an environment of weak economic activity, persisting high leverage, and difficult funding conditions for the corporate sector. Reflecting this outlook, Chart 10 depicts forecasts of private entities which suggest that the default rates for European firms are likely to rise from the current low level over the next 12 months.  Many euro area financial institutions have large lending and investment exposures to euro area commercial property markets. In most euro area countries, commercial property inflation continued to decline in the first three quarters of 2008, and prices were even falling in seven out of the 12 countries for which data are available. Prices were affected by reduced commercial property investment activity in the latter part of 2007 and in 2008. Chart 11 shows that investment volumes declined by 63% in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the same quarter of the previous year although wide variations were observed across euro area countries. As a result of these developments, income risks for many commercial property investors have increased. Funding costs and risks have also grown, raising costs for leveraged property investors and, in turn, contributing to the observed negative price dynamics in some markets.  III.3  The euro area financial system Turning to the euro area financial system, conditions in the euro area and other major money markets deteriorated significantly in mid-September, as the default of Lehman Brothers fuelled concerns about counterparty credit risk and challenged the widely-held view that any large bank, which was considered too big or too interconnected to fail, would be supported by public authorities. This event triggered a sharp increase in the spreads between Euribor and EONIA swap rates across all maturities (as shown in Chart 12). Banks hoarded liquidity (or lent only for the shortest maturities) in view of growing concerns about the creditworthiness of counterparties and heightened uncertainty about their own liquidity positions. Conditions in money markets in other advanced economies exhibited similar developments.  4 BIS Review 159/2008 
Since mid-September, central banks have stepped up the already remarkable levels of cooperation and provided liquidity in coordinated actions. Moreover, the ECB and also other central banks have made extensive efforts to provide refinancing at longer maturities and to expand the lists of assets that are eligible as collateral in credit operations. Not least thanks to these actions, the recent weeks have seen a noticeable improvement in the euro money market. For example, in the past week, the spreads between term deposit and overnight index swap rates declined considerably, by 15 to 20 basis points along all maturities, reflecting the continued fall in the Euribor rates. The spreads fell to 80 basis points for the one-month maturity and 160 basis points for the 12-month maturity.  An interesting analysis related to the current problems in the money markets is presented in Box 7 of the Review which highlights the link between market liquidity and funding liquidity risk, on the basis of evidence from recent data. The results show that a negative relationship between high funding liquidity risk and low market liquidity was established only after the financial turmoil had erupted, while in “normal” times, there is no obvious relationship between the two measures. This supports the theoretical proposition (advanced by recent academic research) that interactions between the two measures emerge only when banks face funding constraints, that is, when shocks to banks’ funding liquidity can lead to forced asset sales and may depress asset prices, with dire consequences for market liquidity.  The tensions in the money market, and more generally the fallout from the financial crisis, have had a significant negative impact on large and complex banking groups in the euro area. In the first three quarters of 2008, their profitability suffered further due to the unfavourable financial market conditions and, increasingly, by rising credit costs (i.e. gradually increasing provisions and loan losses). Chart 13 shows that the wide dispersion in the rate of return on equity across euro area LCBGs observed in the second half of 2007 persisted also in the first three quarters of 2008. Institutions in the lowest quartile of the profitability distribution of these major banks continued to see significantly lower profitability. Moreover, those LCBGs that suffered substantial losses in the second half of 2007 remained among the weakest ones in the first three quarters of 2008.  At the same time, however, the regulatory capital buffers of euro area LCBGs improved moderately as a consequence of additional capital raised and slower growth in risk-weighted assets (as shown in Chart 14). While this was largely due to the actions of individual banks aimed at reducing risks in their balance sheets, it also reflected, to a certain degree, the impact of the implementation of Basel II. In addition, some of the newly attracted capital came in the form of hybrid financing which is reaching prudential limits. Nevertheless, the actions that have been taken by governments and central banks since October 2008 to support the banking systems in euro area countries, despite comfortable solvency ratios, highlight the perceived fragility of the global financial markets.  Box 9 of the Review analyses alternative ways in which LCBGs can reduce leverage in the process of restoring their balance sheets. It shows that by cutting their dividend pay-out ratios, LCBGs could generate rather substantial additional capital buffers. On the other hand, if the banks decided to de-leverage mainly by shedding assets, this could imply a sharp contraction of credit to the private sector. It is therefore essential that banks use available opportunities to raise new capital, either from private sources or from the public funds provided by governments in the euro area.  The outlook for euro area insurers also deteriorated, as financial performance has weakened and some pre-existing risks facing the sector increased and some started to materialise. Investment income was reduced by the falling values of structured credit products, corporate bonds and equities. In addition, some insurers suffered losses on investments in commercial property. All in all, the information available for the first nine months of 2008 suggests that the shock-absorption capacity of euro area insurers in terms of their solvency positions has not been significantly affected, which should help them to cope with the possible materialisation of the risks they face.  BIS Review 159/2008 5 
The size of euro area insurers’ exposures to structured credit products differ considerable across institutions, as shown in Chart 15. In some cases, exposures to non-sub-prime structured credit products are rather large. This is a source of vulnerability in the event that the credit market problems were to affect also the valuations of prime or near-prime asset-backed securities. Since insurers can hold investments until maturity (to back liabilities), the key risks from insurers’ credit exposures are not temporary losses in value but defaults. Nevertheless, sharp downgrades of the ratings of structured credit products could force insurers to reduce their holdings or recognise impairments, which would affect their results and capital positions.  A summary measure of the risks faced by the euro area banking sector is provided by a market-based systemic risk indicator which is depicted in Chart 16. In September 2008, systemic risk increased sharply, driven by a further widening of banks’ credit default swap (CDS) spreads. However, it is important to emphasise that, since July 2008, participants in the CDS market have started to increasingly discriminate across institutions. This could be seen as first sign that the market is on its way to a gradual recovery, because the market no longer “penalises” all banks across the board with similarly high spreads. That said, CDS spreads are likely to remain high for some time to come. Following a series of defaults or near defaults of several global financial institutions after September 2008, the systemic risk indicator decreased substantially, as central banks took coordinated actions, guarantee schemes were approved and some euro area LCBGs were recapitalised. Nevertheless, the indicator has remained above the levels of summer of 2008, which suggests that market participants continued to assign a relatively high probability to systemic defaults by both euro area and global LCBGs.  The extraordinary measures that have been taken by central banks and governments since October 2008 are summarised in the table on this slide and are described in detail in the Review. In the euro area, the actions taken and the commitments made have helped to stabilise the banking system and should further mitigate counterparty credit risks from trading in the unsecured interbank money markets. Over time, and once they have been fully implemented, these measures should improve the functioning of the term money markets and the access of banks to wholesale funding markets. This should lower the cost of bank funding and facilitate the provision of credit to the economy. That said, in order to revive the process of efficient financial intermediation, financial institutions will need to play their part in the adjustment process by taking advantage of these measures to effectively recapitalise and repair their balance sheets.  IV.  Overall assessment Let me conclude with our overall assessment of financial stability at the current juncture: the euro area financial system has undergone a further significant test of its shock-absorbing capacity since the finalisation of the June 2008 Financial Stability Review. At the same time, there are a number of risks and vulnerabilities lying ahead with which the financial system may have to cope, notably the possibility of: • a further deterioration in the US and the euro area housing markets and the impact this may have on banks’ loan quality and the value of securities backed by mortgage-related assets; • a deeper and more prolonged slowdown in both the global and the euro area economy than currently expected that could cause a sharper and broader deterioration in borrowers’ ability to service their debt;  • a more pronounced de-leveraging by banks, due to persistently high funding costs and concerns about the adequacy of capital buffers, which could negatively affect the flow of credit extended to the broader economy; and  6 BIS Review 159/2008 
• an increase in financial market volatility caused by a further unwinding of positions by hedge funds.  All in all, given the risks that lie ahead, banks will need to be especially watchful in ensuring that they have adequate capital and liquidity buffers in place to cushion the challenges ahead.  Thank you very much for your attention. I am now at your disposal for questions.         BIS Review 159/2008 7

Ipumbu Shiimi: Namibia’s payment system reform initiative Speech by Mr Ipumbu Shiimi, Assistant Governor of the Bank of Namibia, at the NamSwitch Press Conference, Windhoek, 2 December 2008.  *      *      * Members of the Media  MDs and officials of Banking Institutions  My Colleagues, officials of the Bank of Namibia present  Ladies and Gentlemen  It is with great pleasure to welcome you to the Bank of Namibia this afternoon. We are especially grateful to the media practioners, who will share this wonderful news with members of the public, for responding positively to our invitation. We are also delighted that our partners in the payment system reform initiative, banking institutions, have joined us at this press conference. Once again welcome.  Ladies and gentlemen, one of the Bank of Namibia’s responsibilities is to ensure financial stability. An efficient and effective payment system is a key factor in achieving financial stability. This means individuals and businesses are able to pay for goods and services or transfer money from one entity to another entity in a manner that is safe, cost effective and reasonably fast. For example when a person pays with a cheque, a stable and effective payment system would ensure that payment is secure and the money will be received faster.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have invited you to share with you information on milestones achieved in the Namibian payment system reform initiative, undertaken jointly by the Bank of Namibia and commercial banks. Until not so long ago our payment system was highly integrated with that of South Africa. In fact Namibia dependent heavily on South Africa’s payment system infrastructures for clearing and settlements of most of the payment system instruments e.g. cards and ATMs. This dependency made the country vulnerable to risks that would affect the payment system in South Africa and placed the oversight of critical payment system infrastructures outside the jurisdiction of Namibia.  It is against this background that reforms were initiated. The efforts made towards the payment system reform project started to bear fruits after the implementation by the Bank of Namibia of the Namibia Inter-bank Settlement System (NISS) on 10 June 2002. After the settlement system was put in place, there was a need to reform the clearing side of the National Payment System (NPS). The establishment by the commercial banks of Namclear (Pty) Limited, in 2003, paved the way to modernise and automate various clearing systems starting with the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) System in 2004. The Cheque Processing System was rolled out in 2005 ending with the Card System (NamSwitch) in 2008.  The NamSwitch system was implemented in a phased approach because of the nature of payments, facilities, and systems that are involved. The Automated Teller Machine (ATM) solution went live on 21 April 2008 and the Point-of-Sale (POS) was recently rolled out on 16 November 2008, thus bringing the reform project on the clearing side, to an end. Ladies and Gentlemen this is an achievement worth mentioning as Namibia now has its own independent payment infrastructures, with the Bank of Namibia having adequate regulatory oversight over these systems. I am aware that to a normal eye, it is difficult to notice the changes that have taken place because this change was managed seamlessly. However with a careful eye significant benefits brought about by the reform are visible. For example it use to take about up two weeks to clear a cheque, now this only takes at most fives days and in most cases is less than that.  Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Bank of Namibia and indeed on my own behalf, let me thank and commend the banking industry for a job well done. The industry has shown commitment in ensuring that all the systems were implemented. Despite the slippages that BIS Review 159/2008 1 
we experienced along this journey, we have proven that in unison we can achieve greater things. It shows that with the spirit of teamwork we can achieve all what we intend to achieve. I believe that this is the path we will continue to follow in the future.  Ladies and gentlemen, we should all understand that reform projects are done with due regard to national interests. I do not believe that our intention to bring about reform initiatives will negatively affect the operation of the industry and NPS. The Bank of Namibia understands that such initiatives are expensive and sometimes costs involved run into millions of Namibia Dollars. Our position is that benefits far outweigh the costs incurred in the process. We all need a situation where if there are disruptions in the South African payment environment, for example, Namibia catches no cold. Building our own systems will also enable us manage inherent payment system risks and exposures sufficiently well.  In conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen, although milestones have been achieved in terms of implementing required clearing and settlement systems, certain issues remain to be addressed. I am aware that there are some card transactions that are still cleared and settled in South Africa. I am pleased to learn that there are measures in place to ensure that such transactions are cleared and settled in Namibia before the end of the first quarter of 2009.  With these few words, Ladies and Gentlemen, I thank you for listening. 2 BIS Review 159/2008 
Axel A Weber: Risk transfer – challenges for financial institutions and markets  Dinner speech by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Joint Bundesbank-CEPR-CFS conference “Risk Transfer: Challenges for Financial Institutions and Markets”, Frankfurt am Main, 11 December 2008. *      *      * 1 Introduction  Ladies and gentlemen I wish to extend a warm welcome to you at this conference dinner on the occasion of the joint Bundesbank-CEPR-CFS conference here in Frankfurt. The many aspects of credit risk transfer (CRT) that you addressed in your research papers – from the pricing of subprime mortgage risk through to counterparty risk in financial contracts – reveal just how broad and complex this topic is. And the current financial turmoil provides striking confirmation of how relevant this topic is, as CRT may adversely affect financial stability. The different forms of CRT are playing a key role, not least in the world wide discussion on regulatory responses to this crisis. I therefore believe that this conference presents a great opportunity for you as researchers to exchange your findings and views on risk transfer. However, I also hope that it makes a contribution to the current search for an adequate regulatory framework for the financial markets.  In my following remarks, I would like to comment briefly on CRT in the recent crisis and on some measures that are about to be taken. 2 Credit Risk Transfer (CRT) in the recent crisis When analysing an economic event such as the current financial crisis, it is usually very helpful to consult some economic theory. In the case of CRT general economic theory tells us that CRT is, in principal, beneficial. First, it may lead to a better risk allocation as it disconnects the originator of a risky asset from the ultimate risk taker. Second, referring to a result of the model by Hakenes and Schnabel presented at this conference, better risk allocation provides scope for socially beneficial projects that, otherwise, would not have been financed. Finally, as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision points out in The Joint Forum on Credit Risk Transfer (2008), “CRT has made the market pricing of credit risk more liquid and transparent”.  However, in the current financial crisis different methods of CRT applied by financial institutions have made for negative headlines in the newspapers: Securitisation – Financial institutions (for example, IKB) that were engaged in the American mortgage market through financial products such as RMBS suffered major unexpected losses when house prices in the US started to decline.  Credit Default Swaps (CDS) – Some insurance companies and other financial institutions are involved in insuring structured products linked to the US mortgage market in the form of CDS. Some of them experienced large losses and had to be rescued by the government (for example, AIG). The bankruptcy of a big credit risk insurer threatens the insured financial institutions, which often undervalue counterparty risk. The crisis may be exacerbated in this way.  Off-balance-sheet vehicles – Banks have transferred their credit risk to off-balance-sheet vehicles, such as SIVs and conduits, in order to save capital costs. The business model of these vehicles built on maturity transformation broke down leading to liquidity problems of the BIS Review 158/2008 1 
SIVs and conduits. Owing to reputation concerns, the banks took the suffering SIVs and conduits back on to their balance sheet. This transferred the credit and liquidity risk back to the banks and triggered the loss of confidence in the money market. All these examples show that we are experiencing severe problems with CRT. I would therefore like to pose two questions. What are the weaknesses in CRT markets? How can we change the institutional framework in order to profit from the social benefits of CRT? 3 Weaknesses in CRT markets Concerning weaknesses in CRT markets, I would like to draw your attention again to general economic theory as this enables us to identify fundamental problems that are well known to an economist. We deal with problems such as wrong incentives for economic agents, insufficient transparency, and regulatory arbitrage. Let me point out just a few examples. Moral hazard – One possible weakness in the CRT market results from the securitisation and subsequent distribution of credit risk. Once the credit risk is forwarded, there is no incentive for the originator of the credit risk to monitor the debtor. Hence, we are dealing with the classical phenomenon of moral hazard. The empirical results of a paper by Mora and Sowerbutts at the conference indicate that this is not only a theoretical reflection, but a present mechanism in the securitisation market. They show that retaining a greater fraction of credit risk in the balance sheet of the originator significantly lowers the probability of default of the underlying loan. The same problem may arise in the case of CRT via CDS, as Parlour and Winton show in their paper. In their theoretical model, the monitoring of the underlying loan is inefficiently low if a bank frees up regulatory capital by buying a CDS. The reason for this is that while the insured originator of the loan has no incentive to monitor, the insurer lacks the control rights. Transparency – Another weakness in the CRT market results from its potential opaqueness. During the past decade, we have experienced a hitherto unique process of credit risk dispersion that had its roots in the US subprime market. The decodification of the actual degree of entanglement is still in progress. In a recently published paper, Gary B. Gorton gives a very detailed description of the different steps of CRT. And he argues that while the interlinking of securities, structures and derivatives made it possible for risk to be spread among many capital market participants, it simultaneously resulted in a loss of transparency as to where these risks ultimately ended up.  This loss in transparency meant that market participants did not evaluate their credit risk adequately. In the CDO market, for example, the inherent systemic risk of certain CDO products, such as RMBS on US housing loans, was not taken into account. Market participants often relied solely on credit ratings and were attracted by the fact that these loan securities had larger spreads than similarly-rated corporate bonds. The resulting increase in demand for these products boosted their supply and allowed a decline in the quality of the underlying loans. Hence, securitisation and the “originate to distribute” business model became more and more attractive, which is highlighted by the fact that in 2005-06 dealer firms transferred more subprime risk to investors than was originated during this period.  In the case of credit derivatives, a further aspect heightens the lack of transparency. The vast majority of these agreements are made over the counter. This not only aggravates the misevaluation of counterparty risk, it also causes an evaluation problem concerning the systemic risk in the CDS market. This, in turn, exacerbates uncertainty and loss of confidence among market participants. Regulatory arbitrage – In addition, the well-functioning of markets in general is at stake as market participants usually try to find methods to evade regulatory regimes. Financial institutions shifting credit risk to off-balance-sheet vehicles was a typical form of such a regulatory arbitrage. In doing so, banks used a loophole in the old regulatory regime, which 2 BIS Review 158/2008 
did not capture these vehicles. This loophole has been closed with the introduction of Basel II. 4 Changes to the institutional framework But how can we change the institutional framework in order to avoid the mentioned frictions in the financial market and gain from the social benefits of CRT? For more than one year, international institutions, central banks, and politicians have been working together on the lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis. At the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy held in New York in November of this year, the Heads of State of the G20 agreed on “Common Principles for Reform of Financial Markets”. International Institutions, such as the IMF or FSF, published valuable reports and recommendations on possible improvement of the financial architecture. Furthermore, national central banks are contributing their expertise to the discussion. However, in order to achieve improvements in the financial architecture that substantially strengthen financial stability, an in-depth analysis of the underlying reasons for the crisis is essential. In this respect, the economic research that takes place at universities and various institutions is of great importance. For that reason, economic research should have a strong voice in the current debate. I therefore believe that events such as this conference are very important. But let me come back to my question about adequate changes to the institutional framework. As you can surely imagine, there are a great number of aspects that I could mention at this point. However, I fear that would go beyond the scope of my speech. I shall therefore confine myself to mentioning two measures, that are about to be taken. Central counterparty (CCP) for OTC derivatives – The first measure aims to enhance the transparency of the CDS market by implementing one or more CCPs for OTC derivatives. The advantages would be a reduction in market participants’ open positions due to netting as well as a better management and possible reduction of counterparty risk – for example, by guarantee funds or insurance schemes. In addition, the implementation of a CCP could be accompanied by disclosure requirements for CDS positions of the originator. These requirements could also mitigate the just mentioned moral hazard problem in the case of forwarded credit risk via CDS. As Parlour and Winton showed in their paper, reputation mechanisms may partly solve the problem of inefficient monitoring incentives of the originator. Disclosure requirements are a prerequisite for such a reputation mechanism, as the market participants have to know the track record of the originator. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic unanimously agree that there is a need for the implementation of a CCP for OTC derivatives. However, there is an ongoing debate on the specific design of such an institution. The first steps towards the implementation of a CCP were initiated by the New York FED aiming for a single CCP located in the US. More recently, the Governing Council of the ECB discussed the idea of an additional European CCP. The Bundesbank is in favour of this “European solution” as the Eurosystem should be able to influence and to oversee these market infrastructures without any restrictions, especially in times of financial turmoil.  Retention of a share of securitised products on the balance sheet of the originator – Another concept has the objective of solving the moral hazard problem arising from the securitisation of credit risk. The idea is that if the originator has to retain a share of the securitised products on his balance sheet, the incentive to monitor the underlying loan remains. European Commissioner McCreevy has proposed a 5% retention of securitised products on the balance sheet of the originator and the Ecofin Council has agreed to this proposal at its meeting on 2 December. Consequently, this issue will now be discussed in the European Parliament.  BIS Review 158/2008 3 
The Bundesbank in general agrees with the European Commission’s proposal as it is a step into the right direction in terms of avoiding moral hazard problems arising from securitisation. Therefore, the Bundesbank welcomes the decision taken by Ecofin. 5 Concluding remarks So this is my storyline concerning CRT – it is a story of the continual trade-off for financial regulators between the benefits of free markets and the threat of market failures.  And I would like to emphasise that I believe this struggle for the right regulatory framework will go on. Certainly, we will learn from this crisis and we will enhance regulation and supervision in order to erase the sources of this crisis. However, financial markets will generate new financial products; there will emerge new forms of incentive problems, insufficient transparency, and regulatory arbitrage. Financial regulators as well as researchers in the field of financial regulation have to bear this in mind so that those developments in the financial markets that threaten financial stability can be identified as soon as possible.   Thank you very much for your attention. 4 BIS Review 158/2008 
Savenaca Narube: Launching Fiji’s new coins Address by Mr Savenaca Narube, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the official launch of Fiji’s new coin series, Suva, 11 December 2008. *      *      * Cabinet Ministers Members of the Board of the Reserve Bank of Fiji Distinguished Guests Introduction Let me add my warm welcome to you all and thank you for accepting our invitation to the launch of our new coins. We believe that this is a noteworthy milestone in the history of our nation and the Reserve Bank of Fiji. As I will explain later, the change of coins is more complicated and difficult to do than changing currency notes. The logistics and arrangements are very different. We have changed our currency notes several times and will perhaps do so every ten years or so. However changing coins is a rare thing to do. We may be therefore witnessing a “once in a life time” event. For some of us, we may never experience it again. So, it is a very special occasion. We are therefore extremely glad that you could join us in this celebration. Christmas is also around the corner so it is a good time for celebration as well. History Coins date back to our earliest recorded history. Shells and even turtles were used for trading in the very early years. As traders came to our islands, they brought with them foreign coins. British, German, Mexican and even Russian coins co-circulated in Fiji for some time. Fiji minted our first coins in 1934. Some of us may still remember the pennies and half pennies with holes in the middle. They make very popular souvenirs now days. I am sure many of us still remember the three pence and the shillings. While we have changed our currency notes several times, it is almost 40 years since we changed our coins and this was from the pennies and shillings to decimal currency on 13 January 1969. In 1969 we had only 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents and the 20 cents. The 50 cents and the one dollar were still in banknote or paper form. We converted the 50 cents note to coin in 1975 and the one dollar in 1995. These coins have remained basically the same as they were then up until today. As I said, we do not change coins as frequently as we change currency notes. There is one good reason for this and that is coins do not get counterfeited as much as currency notes do. Why? There are two obvious reasons. The first is that minting coins as you saw in the video is a complicated and expansive process. Second, as you would imagine, the return from counterfeiting coins are pretty small. But interestingly these have not stopped some from setting up bogus minting presses in the past. Why are we changing coins now? You may ask: Why are we then changing our coins now? Let me explain: BIS Review 158/2008 1 
• Firstly, prices of base metals used in coin production have increased dramatically. This increase has made central banks change the metal composition of coins. This has significantly reduced the cost of minting them. • Secondly, technology has allowed innovative minting techniques to make more efficient use of base metals. Again, this has reduced costs. • Thirdly, we can reduce the size of the coins. Many countries have done this. Smaller and lighter coins are much cheaper to mint. Not only that, the handling costs are also reduced.  So, we are changing our coins basically to reduce the cost of minting and handling. These costs continue to increase as demand for cash continues to rise. The cashless society is yet to fully eventuate and I think that it will not do so for some time yet. Why are we dropping the one and two cent coins? We have taken the opportunity to also review the structure of our coins. In doing so, we are dropping the one and two cents. This is because of the following reasons:  • One, the value of lower denomination coins like the one and two cents have dropped significantly. This is because of the increase in the prices of goods and services. As a result, the one and two cent coins do not circulate well. People simply leave them in jars, drawers and so forth. It therefore makes good sense to stop minting them. • Two, the cost of minting the lower denomination coins are more than their face value. For instance, the cost of minting the one cent coin is four times its face value even with cheaper metal composition. So, while these coins are lying idle in jars and drawers, we spend a lot of money minting new ones. This is a clear waste of public funds. • Third, businesses and banks continue to incur higher cost in handling and transporting fresh supplies of these coins year in and year out.  A significant change such as this always incites people’s concerns. This is understandable. So let me take this opportunity to answer some concerns on the cessation of the one and two cents coins. • Some say that it will be inflationary. I say that the experience in New Zealand and around the world clearly shows that it is not. • Others say that, it will not allow a continuous series of currencies. I say that this is nice in theory. In reality, there is really no need whatsoever to have a continuous series. • Lastly, others say that the gains from the multiplier effects of money will negate the loss of minting these coins. I say that the gains will be much, much more if we do not mint them. They do not circulate any way and there is no point in minting them in the first place. I strongly believe that the benefits of ceasing the one and two cent coins far outweigh the cost of retaining them and the decision fully serves the interest of the nation. Should we coin the two dollars? On the other end of the coin scale, again because of the rise in prices, the lower denominated currency notes are now being converted to coins, again as a move to cut costs. The notes last for only about five years. Coins last much longer. For this precise reason we 2 BIS Review 158/2008 
had coined our fifty cents in 1975 and our one dollar note in 1995. In our public survey, we asked the people if they wanted to also coin the two dollars as Australia and New Zealand have done, but the answer was a clear no. Therefore, we have not coined the two dollars but my guess is that it will be seriously considered sooner rather than later. Learning from the rest of the world I would like to say that we have benefited a lot from the experience of other countries notably New Zealand who issued their new coins only two years ago. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand had done a lot of work to evaluate various options on coins. They willingly shared the results of their research with us. They also helped us by providing technical expertise. I would therefore like to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for their immense assistance and support. We are honoured today to have the company of Mr. Brian Lang, former Head of Currency at Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Mr. Lang visited Fiji in 2006 to help us during the technical evaluations. Currency review Today, we are launching Fiji’s new coins which are smaller, thinner and lighter than the existing ones.  This change has already commenced when we ceased issuing the one and two cents coins to commercial banks from October 13 of this year. Let me put this process in its bigger prospective. We decided back in 2002 to review our entire currency – both notes and coins. We decided to work on the notes first and this culminated last year when we issued the new currency banknotes including the One Hundred Dollar note. I am glad to say that the new paper currency has been widely accepted by the people of Fiji. The use of the one hundred dollar bill was much more rapid than the fifty dollar bill when it was first introduced. Today marks the completion of the whole currency review with the launch of the new series of coins. The entire journey has taken us about 7 years. We are pleased with the results so far. I am confident that the country will also accept the new coins that we are launching today. Unlike banknotes, changing our coins is a much more complex process. The logistical issues are many. For instance, when we stop issuing the one and two cents, there was a rush to return these coins to the commercial banks even though they are still legal tender. We have, up to now, collected around 120 tons of one and two cents. This is a lot of weight to transport. It also requires a lot of space to store 120 tons of coins. As we collect more old coins, these logistics will intensify. Cabinet approval I wish to assure everyone that we have obtained the necessary approval under the law. Under the Reserve Bank of Fiji Act, only the approval of the Minister for Finance is required before we can change our currency either they be notes or coins. We have kept the Minister and Cabinet fully informed of the progress throughout this currency review. We sought and obtained Cabinet’s approval of the new coins and the cessation of the one and two cents on 11 March 2008. BIS Review 158/2008 3 
Minting In March this year, the Board awarded the tender to the Royal Canadian Mint for the production of a five year supply of our new coins. The contract is valued at approximately 7.8 million Fiji dollars (US $4.2 million). Royal Canadian Mint has minted Fiji coins in the past and is recognised as one of the leading and innovative mints in the world. We are extremely happy to continue this association with the Royal Canadian Mint. How much will it save Fiji? Our new coins will be on average nine (9) percent smaller, forty three (43) percent lighter, and twenty one (21) percent thinner.  How much savings will we get from these changes in our coins? If we were to produce the same quantity of our current coins, it would have cost us about eight million Fiji dollars more. We save five million dollars by not minting the one and two cents coins and a further three million dollars by reducing the size, weight and metallic composition. These savings will also apply when we re-order these coins in future. Hence, if we assume that we will not change these coins in another forty years, these savings can amount to over 100 million dollars. Savings in handling, transportation and storage The benefits and savings do not end there. Due to the significant reduction in size and weight of these new coins, individuals and businesses will save substantial costs in terms of transportation, handling and storage. Assistance for the visually impaired Some have expressed concerns that the visually impaired will find it more difficult to differentiate the value of the new coins. But, as we did in the new currency notes, we have taken into account the needs of those of us that are visually impaired. For the first time, we have introduced the varied edge designs. These will serve as an effective identification and differentiating feature for the visually impaired as well as for the general public. Coins can now be differentiated not only by size but also by their edgings. Different coins will have different edgings. This will help greatly when the coins are about the same size. The five (5) cents coin will now have a plain edge while the ten (10) cents will have the serrated or rough edge. The twenty (20) cents being the closest in size to the ten (10) cents will have intermitted serrations. Designs Let me turn briefly to the designs on the coins. When we changed our currency notes we also changed their designs. However, for our new coins, we have retained the existing designs both on the front and back. Why? We think the current designs are still relevant and appropriate. They reflect directly on our culture and heritage. In addition, leaving the designs unchanged makes the change to the new coins much easier. They make the new coins easier to identify. Multi-ply technology and metal composition The metal composition of our coins is now different. Our new coins are manufactured by Royal Canadian Mint in “multi-ply” layers. Multi-ply technology is patented by Royal Canadian Mint and offers greater security, reliability and durability at reduced minting costs. 4 BIS Review 158/2008 
Multi-ply technology gives the coins unique electromagnetic signatures (EMS) which is how modern coin vending machines are programmed to differentiate different denominations. The technology enables coins of similar size and weight to have different electromagnetic signatures which allows a vending machine to be programmed to accept one and not the other. Simply put, you cannot put a foreign coin into our vending machines anymore. These machines can be easily programmed to recognise and accept Fiji coins only. These would give fewer headaches to city councils and vending machine operators let alone increase their revenue take. Are what we saying really work? Yes they do. We have already tested these coins in parking meters and vending machines and we have not encountered any problem at all. Durability I mentioned that we have achieved all these improvements at lower cost without sacrificing durability. Rigorous testing has shown that these coins are resistant to corrosion in tropical country like ours and to household products. On average, these coins have a life span of approximately 25 years. These test results have been corroborated by independent tests conducted by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand during their evaluation. Public awareness Such a major change as this requires a comprehensive public awareness campaigns. We have started this already. After the launch today, we are going all out to inform the public about our new coins and what we are going to do in the next three months. The campaign will commence with newspaper advertisements and supplements in December. Television advertisements will start in January 2009. All these will be conducted in three languages. We will also send teams to the rural areas to ensure the message filters down to all sections of the community. Issuance What are our plans to implementing the change over to our new coins? The new coins will be issued into circulation on 13 January 2009, the 40th anniversary of decimal currency in Fiji. The new and old coins will co-circulate for about three months until 31 March 2009. This gives the Reserve Bank of Fiji time to work with the commercial banks and the public on the logistics of extracting the old coins from circulation and replacing them with the new. We have received excellent cooperation from the commercial banks during the cessation exercise and we look forward to their continue cooperation. When we changed currency notes last year, the old and the new notes circulated side by side up to now. You may then ask: Why can we not do the same things for the new and old coins? The answer is that the new coins are of very different dimensions and weight than the old ones. If the old circulate with the new, this will create huge problems in identification, counting, handling and to some a lesser extent coin machines. That is why we will only allow a short time for the two sets of coins to circulate together before we withdraw the old ones. Old coins Our old coins, including the 1 and 2 cents coins will be officially demonetised on 31 March 2009 meaning they will cease to be a legal tender from 01 April 2009. From then onwards you can only get value of these old coins from the Reserve Bank of Fiji. As we approach this date, the public will be reminded through our public relations exercise. BIS Review 158/2008 5 
What will we do with the old coins? We intend to sell them for their metallic content and we have received several interests in this area. Concluding remarks I conclude by saying that I believe we have an excellent set of currency notes and coins which can fully serve our needs well into the future. The new currency notes have been well received. I am confident that new coins will also receive the same acceptance. I now have much pleasure in officially launching the new coins. I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year. 6 BIS Review 158/2008 
Jürgen Stark: Issues paper for the conference "The financial crisis and its consequences for the world economy" Speech by Mr Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the conference organised by Aktionsgemeinschaft Soziale Marktwirtschaft e.V. and Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen, Tübingen, 10 December 2008. *      *      * I.  Background For more than one year we have experienced a correction process of unsustainable trends in the financial sector. This correction process has deepened – in particular since Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 15 September 2008 – as regards its magnitude and complexity and has evolved into a fully fledged financial crisis. The recent intensification has increased the fear of a global slowdown and has also further negatively affected the outlook for economic growth in the euro area. The crisis started in the US with rising delinquencies in the subprime mortgage market which triggered turbulences in the subprime mortgage-backed securities market. These tensions then spread to other asset-backed markets, money markets, and financial institutions, with further effects gradually being felt in other market segments, across borders, and in other economies.  This crisis has already led to substantial structural changes in the financial sector in particular in the US. Some prominent financial firms have disappeared and the investment banking model in the US, once introduced by the Glass-Seagall Act in 1933 as a response to the Great Depression and tensions in the US banking sector, no longer exists. In other countries the financial sector is very likely to shrink, at least temporarily. Although the financial correction process is painful, it is unavoidable as it constitutes the correction of exuberances of the past induced by a search for yield and an underestimation of risks in an overly benign macroeconomic environment with low interest and inflation rates.  II.  Reasons for the emergence of the financial crisis A distinction has to be made between macroeconomic and microeconomic factors.  For too many years financial market participants were used to a macroeconomic environment with high global output growth, low inflation and very low interest rates. Macroeconomic policies led to global and domestic imbalances which became increasingly unsustainable with debt financed over-consumption in one region and high savings in other regions. An overall benign macroeconomic environment led to (i) a general carelessness or a tendency to under-price risks and (ii) to a search for yield which in turn accelerated financial innovation.  The main manifestation of financial innovation had been the extraordinary expansion of credit risk transfer instruments which permitted the transfer, hedging and active trading of credit risk as a separate asset class. The financial instruments became increasingly complex and the speed of innovation amplified. Examples included credit default swaps (CDSs) and, in particular, structured credit products, such as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), backed both by cash instruments, such as primitive securities, loans or asset-backed securities, and by derivative claims, such as CDSs and CDOs themselves.  The expansion of these products had both contributed to, and been supported by a strengthening of the originate-and-distribute (O&D) business model of financial BIS Review 158/2008 1 
intermediation. Rather than holding the credits they originated, credit institutions increasingly sold them off – possibly after repackaging them – to the capital market. The advocators of the new financial instruments praised them as facilitators of an efficient distribution of risk. However, these instruments do not eliminate credit risk. Therefore, the high speed of innovation and the instruments’ increasing complexity as well as the exploding trade also pointed to potential weaknesses that required significant vigilance by all parties involved, i.e. originators, investors, rating agencies and supervisors. Thus, “creative destruction” turned into “destructive creation”. However, the crisis proves that the institutional framework has not kept pace with the fast speed of innovation. In particular, the lack of adequate checks and balances at all levels of control has led to increased vulnerabilities and risks.  • Financial institutions: weak risk and liquidity management frameworks; specifically, management and supervisory boards of the financial institutions did not live up to their ultimate responsibilities as regards risk management; risk management models did not keep pace with the increasing complexity of financial instruments and did not properly take into account the potential illiquidity of some market segments.  • Rating agencies and external auditors: their models and assessments failed to adequately evaluate the financial risks attached to financial innovations.  • Supervisory authorities: no serious attempts were made to stem against the trend of searching for yield that accelerated financial innovation in good times; no adequate monitoring systems were in place in particular as regards ultimate exposure to mortgage backed securities and other new complex structured financial products and as regards off-balance sheet entities.  III.  Effects of the financial crisis on the real economy External environment At the global level, the outlook for advanced economies has worsened significantly while the financial crisis has started to spread to emerging markets. In 2009, all major advanced economies will experience weak or zero growth at the same time. The outlook for the US economy remains very gloomy. Forecasts by international organisations see 2009 average growth near or below zero. The growth outlook for emerging market economies has weakened dramatically. The IMF and the EU Commission see global growth at 2.2 and 2.3% in 2009, respectively, after 3.7% this year.  The depth and duration of the global economic downturn will crucially depend on the development of the financial crisis. At the current juncture, market volatility and uncertainty remain extremely high.  Global inflationary pressures are easing due to the global economic downturn and the falling commodity prices. All in all, the global inflation outlook has improved. Euro area The significant intensification of the financial crisis since mid September has greatly affected the outlook for short-term economic growth in the euro area. However, the economy was already hit by significant commodity price increases and the ongoing correction in the housing market in some euro area countries. 2 BIS Review 158/2008 
After two negative quarters of economic growth, GDP growth in the 4th quarter 2008 and in the coming quarters will be very weak. This reflects a subdued outlook for external and domestic demand and tighter financing conditions. The assumptions for the December 2008 Broad Macroeconomic Projection Exercise had to be significantly revised compared to the September 2008 ECB Staff Macroeconomic Projection Exercise. However, it should be born in mind that uncertainty surrounding the projections is particularly high at this juncture.  According to the projection results for the euro area, GDP growth is projected to experience a protracted period of subdued growth (2008: 0.8%-1.2%; 2009: -1.0%-0.0%; 2010: 0.5%-1.5%), with dampened domestic and external demand. The European Commission forecasts growth near zero in 2009 and quarterly growth rates to remain very low until Q2 2010. More recently, the IMF and the OECD see the euro area in recession in 2009 (around -1/2%). Uncertainty is extremely high and risks are further to the downside. Inflationary pressures and risks in the euro area have diminished amidst weakening demand, declining commodity prices and receding pipeline pressures. Since July this year – when HICP inflation was at 4% – inflation most recently has substantially declined, reading 2.1% in November. In this process of disinflation we might even see negative inflation rates for a couple of months in some regions of the euro area. Over the policy-relevant horizon, inflation rates are expected to be in line with price stability, supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. The Eurosystem staff projections foresee annual HICP inflation rates of between 3.2% and 3.4% for 2008 and declining rates of between 1.1% and 1.7% for 2009. Monthly inflation is expected to reach a trough in summer before rebounding again at the end of 2009. For 2010, HICP is projected to lie between 1.5% and 2.1%.  In this context, some financial analysts discuss the risk of deflation. However, this term should be used with caution and not be mixed up with disinflation. It is important to distinguish between: • On the one hand “strong disinflation” or “temporary and mild deflation”, which is of a transitory nature and which stems primarily from substantial declines in energy prices. • On the other hand, genuine “deflationary dynamics”, which are characterised by their persistent and self-sustaining character, their broad based effects across most price components, and their entrenchment in expectations.  However, it should be stressed that risks appear very limited given the continued anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability, wage and price stickiness and the still sustained pace of monetary dynamics. By contrast, upside tail-risks to inflation receive less attention – but may be more relevant and a stronger source of concern in the medium to longer term.  Various estimates of underlying broad money point to a sustained but moderating rate of monetary expansion in the euro area. Monetary trends therefore support the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing further, with some risks remaining on the upside in the medium to longer term. The latest monetary data up to end October 2008 point to a continued moderation of the growth rate of loans to the non-financial sector. So far, the hard data does not support the view of a drying up in the availability of loans.  IV.  Crisis management and resolution Whatever politicians have decided already or are going to decide: they have to consider the medium to longer term effects of their actions. The measures taken today should not prepare the ground for future imbalances. This is true for both, monetary and fiscal policy. BIS Review 158/2008 3 
What the ECB has done since the beginning of the financial turmoil The mandate of the ECB is to maintain price stability over the medium term. This mandate must be adhered to both in normal times and in times of crisis. The monetary policy stance appropriate to fulfil the ECB’s mandate depends exclusively on its assessment of the balance of risks to price stability, and nothing else.  The ECB has shown remarkable flexibility in terms of liquidity provision. This flexibility was necessary in order to avoid the breakdown of the interbank market, which is a very important transmission channel for monetary policy. Given the extraordinary situation, we took extraordinary decisions. However, measures are all of a temporary nature only, i.e. market participants should not get accustomed to the enhanced role of central banks in intermediation.  Since 8 October we have cut the policy rate three times with an overall reduction by 175 basis points. These moves in a very short period of time are unprecedented. As monetary policy decisions are forward looking and medium term oriented, the recent rate cut by 75 basis points takes into account that the inflation rate will decline further in the quarters to come and that the risks to inflation are on the downside over the medium term. By adopting this forward looking attitude any “double counting” of news, which may first influence our decisions via their anticipation and then again when they materialise, is avoided. After this substantial rate cut the remaining room for manoeuvre is very limited, potentially allowing for small steps only. Having only one instrument at hand the limits of what can be achieved and what cannot be achieved with a single instrument should be recognised. The key ECB interest rate is currently 2.5%. The President of the ECB has made it very clear that the decrease of 175 basis points within two months is exactly what is appropriate taking into account all available information. New relevant information for the euro area which allows for a serious re-assessment of the outlook for price stability will very likely not be available before February or March 2009. Fiscal policies’ reaction The write downs1 and losses by the banking sector have reduced the capital base of banks and implicitly their capacity to lend. In a welcome coordinated effort, euro area governments have provided support for the banking system, most notably by offering funds for recapitalisation and guarantees for interbank loans. To date, the envelope of funds for possible recapitalisations and guarantees amounts to some €2,000 billion, or roughly 20% of euro area GDP.  These measures are crucial to protecting economies from harm, and they are key to stimulating economic activity. At the same time, they may imply a considerable fiscal burden. Public debt and deficit ratios may increase substantially, and fiscal sustainability may come under pressure. On top of this, there are calls for substantial fiscal stimulus programmes in the euro area countries, and a number of countries have already announced or approved significant fiscal support. For instance, the German parliament approved a fiscal stimulus package (1.3% of GDP) for 2009 and 2010 and the French government announced a stimulus package in total of 1.5% of GDP (2009-2011). But, many euro-area governments failed to use the past boom times to consolidate their public finances. As a consequence, they are entering the current downturn with high deficit                                                  1  In the euro area the total writedowns and capital raised of large and complex banking groups and other banks since the second quarter of 2007 amount to $129.2 bn and $138.7 bn respectively (US: writedowns: $421.4 bn, capital raised: $354.7 bn; UK and Switzerland: writedowns: $136.4 bn, capital raised: $164.1 bn). Source: Bloomberg. 4 BIS Review 158/2008 
and debt ratios. Given the weak growth ahead and the costs of the bank bailouts, these ratios are set to increase. It is very likely that, in a year’s time, the deficits in many euro-area countries will be between 5% and 7% up from 3% now, while public debt may rise by 10 to 20 percentage points.  Against this backdrop, the current calls for a particularly loose application of the European Union’s framework of fiscal rules questions the credibility of politicians’ commitment to sound public finances. In this environment, there is a clear risk that any additional stimulus programme may erode, rather than restore, public confidence. As a result, households may prefer to raise their savings, and thus counteract any fiscal stimulus because they know that they will soon have to pay for today’s fiscal deficits. From the experience gained in the 1970s, it is known that promises to reverse stimulus measures once the crisis is over are frequently not kept. In many European countries, this has resulted in ever-increasing public expenditure and debt ratios, which are placing a burden on these economies even today. The introduction of the Stability and Growth Pact in 1998 marks a break with the undisciplined policies of the past. It also provides the necessary flexibility to allow budgets to be adjusted in line with economic fluctuations. But the pact does not provide for governments to attempt to fine-tune the economy by means of fiscal policies. The experience of the first 10 years of the pact shows that some governments found it challenging to comply with the rules they had set for themselves. But the pact did help correcting very high deficits and reversing the increase in debt ratios. It is essential that the public’s confidence in the soundness of fiscal policies is preserved. This requires that fiscal sustainability is guaranteed. The Stability and Growth Pact must be fully applied and its integrity preserved. The automatic fiscal stabilizers in the euro area amount to about 1% of GDP. They provide a powerful source of fiscal support for a weakening economy. And this type of stimulus is automatically reversed when economic conditions improve. Only a few countries have the scope to take additional action. Where such room for manoeuvre exists, additional budgetary measures have to be targeted, timely and temporary (“three T’s”) in order to be effective. In the current circumstances, we cannot, and should not, risk adding a fiscal crisis to the financial turmoil and economic downturn. V.  Lessons to be learned from the current financial turmoil There is no need for a new global financial system (Bretton-Woods II) or for creating new international institutions from scratch. Rather, there is a need for strengthening the existing institutional framework by enhancing those general principles that ensure a smooth functioning of market economies: stability-oriented macroeconomic policies; high competition on all markets; the protection of property rights; freedom of contract; and unlimited liability. As regards macroeconomic policies, they have to be medium term oriented and geared towards price stability and sound public finances. The commitment to price stability and sound public finances is the best contribution monetary and fiscal policies in the euro area can make to financial stability. There is no trade-off between price stability and financial stability and there is also no trade-off between sound public finances and financial stability.  As regards the institutional framework for the financial sector, we have to accept that even the tightest regulation cannot prevent a financial crisis. However, it is clear that the benefits of tighter regulation are larger than thought some quarters ago. Hence, there is a need for a realistic assessment of the costs and benefits of tighter regulation. New regulation should set general principles rather than drawing up long lists of discretionary measures, which are necessarily incomplete and invite renewed regulatory arbitrage. New regulations should  BIS Review 158/2008 5 
• not cover all possible states of nature but rather provide automatic stabilisers for the financial system in general term;  • strengthen incentives that improve the disciplining forces of competition;  • discourage “short-termism” and promote a medium to long-term attitude of financial agents towards success and stability;  • not prevent financial innovation as it is important for growth and employment; • but strengthen at the same time the concept of liability and responsibility. It must be clear for those who engage in risky activities that they will be held accountable if these risks materialise.  There are already some important initiatives that provide some guidance for consistent regulatory standards on an international basis: • The G20 has approved a set of international standards and codes for a sound regulatory framework. However, implementation is lagging behind.  • The Financial Stability Forum has already developed recommendations for the resilience of markets and institutions that have caused the financial turmoil.  There are in particular five areas of concern that should be addressed to strengthen the institutional framework for the financial sector:  • Risk management of banks: Both bank management and supervisors will have to play a more active role in scrutinising risk management practices (internal checks and balances, clear lines of responsibilities, etc.), especially with regard to off-balance sheet entities and structured products. This should hold true not only in times of crisis but maybe even more important in good times when risks are less obvious.  • Management of liquidity risk: Bank management should enhance their liquidity management practices to address the liquidity risks in their day-to-day business along the line of the “Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision” provided by the Basel Committee. • Credit rating agencies: Rating methodologies failed to capture risks embodied in structured products and investors relied too heavily on those external ratings. Rating agencies should enhance their transparency and should comply with relevant codes of conduct. More differentiated rating systems for structured products should be adopted. Conflicts of interest are to be avoided which are in particular acute when a rating agency also offers consulting services.  • Valuation, disclosure and accounting: Weaknesses in accounting standards and gaps with regard to valuation of structured products contributed to the current crisis. Banks will have to develop robust pricing, risk management and stress testing models and improve disclosure practices. Supervisors and accounting standard setters should advance the transparency and the disclosure standards for off-balance sheet vehicles. They should further reassess the valuation of assets, with a special focus on the mark-to-market approach given its potentially pro-cyclical effects.  • Strengthen capital adequacy: Supervisors did not adequately account for the risks associated with new complex financial instruments. Some financial engineering in recent years focused on repackaging weak credits into high-rated securities, receiving a favourable risk weighing for capital adequacy standards. The respective prudential norms and rating schemes should be reassessed also with a view to make the financial instruments less complex. 6 BIS Review 158/2008 
The O&D business model of financial intermediation should not disappear but it should become more transparent. It should also be considered whether the originator should always keep a certain percentage of an offloaded credit package on the own balance sheet.  In order to increase the capital buffers that banks need to hold with regard to illiquid structured products and off-balance sheet activities, the capital adequacy provisions within the Basel II framework should be also enhanced in these areas.  VI.  Conclusions The current global financial distress and the economic downturn pose challenges of a significant and unprecedented nature to the ECB, other central banks and policy makers around the globe. During the financial turmoil the euro area, the monetary union and its institutional set up have proved their resilience and the capacity to act decisively and promptly. National measures have been co-ordinated in a pragmatic manner with a view to enhancing their effectiveness through mutual reinforcement. All this is not self-evident. We should not forget how Europe would look today without the euro. The euro area countries would be significantly worse off. Multiple crises would arise simultaneously: currency crises would go hand in hand with banking crises and real economy disruptions at country level, potentially ending up in political tensions between countries. By eliminating the exchange rate channel, the euro has mitigated the risk of contagion stemming from national economic or financial crises. In this sense, the euro has been a very important stabilising element in difficult times. BIS Review 158/2008 7 
Jean-Claude Trichet: European financial integration Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the 23. Internationales ZinsFORUM ”Zinsen 2009”, Frankfurt am Main, 11 December 2008. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank the organisers for the invitation to speak about European financial integration here at the Zinsforum. The challenging times we are now experiencing provide an excellent opportunity to exchange thoughts on this topic that is of great interest to the ECB. More integrated financial markets are important for realising the full potential of the single market. But they also make the execution of the single monetary policy in the euro area more efficient, which is obviously of key importance to the ECB. My speech today has two major themes. I will start by addressing the current stage of the financial integration process in Europe. The introduction of the euro as a single currency was a quantum leap for the integration process; but I believe that further efforts are still needed to make the objective of a competitive and safe single market in financial services come true. I am convinced that this process should be first and foremost market-driven. But I also believe that public authorities have a role in fostering financial integration in Europe. This is particularly true when it comes to supporting the private sector to coordinate their action and to reducing policy-related obstacles to cross-border activities.  The second theme I will address today against the backdrop of European financial integration are the regulatory and supervisory initiatives that have been taken recently in light of the ongoing financial crisis. These pertain both to managing the crisis and to preventing a recurrence in the future. I do believe that continued efforts are needed in this regard, in particular to enhance cooperation among the authorities. The state of European financial integration  But before going into our assessment on the state of financial integration, I will briefly elaborate on the reasons behind our interest in this topic. For the ECB, financial integration is not an end in itself, but it is relevant for a number of issues that are important to us.  First, financial integration matters for the ECB as it contributes to the efficient functioning of the monetary union. Integrated financial markets support the effective transmission of the single monetary policy throughout the euro area and the smooth operation of the underlying payment systems. Financial integration also increases the depth and liquidity of financial markets, and consequently enhances the resilience of the European financial system. In addition, it offers more possibilities for geographical risk diversification. Obviously, a more resilient financial system is highly relevant for the ECB’s task of contributing to the safeguarding of financial stability. Second, and more generally, integrated financial markets help to realise the full economic potential of the European Union, as also recalled in the Lisbon strategy. Financial integration contributes to the development of the financial system by increasing competition and expanding markets, which results in lower intermediation costs and a more efficient allocation of capital. These effects, in turn, raise the potential for increased economic growth.1                                                   1  For example, a study by London Economics once estimated that the integration of the European bond and equity markets could result in an additional GDP growth of around 1% over a ten-year period, or BIS Review 157/2008 1 
For the reasons I come to mention, the ECB has always been a very strong supporter of the European financial integration process. We therefore monitor developments in this area closely, and present our view in our annual report on Financial Integration in Europe.2 As a matter of fact, we have now just started the work on our third report, which we intend to publish in Spring 2009.  Let me now give you an overview of our assessment on the current state of play in the various financial markets. We have developed a number of quantitative indicators to track the integration of the money, bond, equity and banking markets in the euro area. These indicators show that, since the introduction of the single currency, integration has advanced significantly. However, progress has also been uneven across financial markets. Two main conclusions stand out in this regard: First, integration is typically more advanced in those markets that are closer to the single monetary policy. Second, it also depends on the degree of integration of the related market infrastructures.  In order to highlight the role of infrastructures, I would in particular like to mention the long history and success of TARGET, the Eurosystem real-time gross settlement facility for euro payments. This system has since 1999 enabled the safe and efficient euro-area wide handling of interbank payment transactions. The enhanced version of this system, TARGET2, provides since the completion of the migration of the national central banks in May 2008 a single shared platform for euro wholesale payments. As a result, we now have an even more integrated and efficient payments landscape. Indeed, TARGET2 is the first market infrastructure to be completely integrated and harmonised at the European level! TARGET2 processes a daily average of nearly 400,000 transactions, for a daily average value of 2.6 trillion euro. This positions TARGET2 as one of the largest payment systems in the world – together with Fedwire in the United States, and CLS, the international system for settling foreign exchange transactions. This success of large-value payment systems integration has been instrumental in achieving and sustaining financial integration in the money market. The evolution towards a single market can be observed in terms of cross-country standard deviation of the unsecured interbank lending rates. These decreased to negligible levels of two to three basis points almost immediately after the introduction of the euro, indicating near-perfect integration.  Bond markets also show clear signs of integration. We observe that over the past ten years, bond yields are being increasingly driven by factors common to the euro area, rather than by purely local factors. At the same time, euro area investors are seen to be progressively diversifying their portfolios on a cross-border basis. Currently, euro area residents have almost 60% of their total bond portfolios in euro area cross-border bond holdings.  It is interesting to see how the recent financial crisis has affected the evolution of our financial integration indicators in the money and government bond markets. In both markets, spreads and standard deviations of rates across euro area countries increased in 2008. The turmoil in 2007 only seemed to affect the unsecured money market rates. The recent intensification, however, has led to a rise in the cross-country standard deviations of one- and twelve-month secured money market rates as well, from their usual level of 1.5 basis points to 5-6 basis points.  The key question is how much of this recent divergence should be allocated to factors related to financial integration, and how much of it has its origin in other factors. To be                                                                                                                                                          approximately 100 billion euro. See London Economics (2002), “Quantification of the macroeconomic impact of integration of EU financial markets”, Report to the European Commission. 2  See the Report on Financial Integration in Europe at http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/financialintegrationineurope200804en.pdf. 2 BIS Review 157/2008 
more precise, higher spreads that result from higher counterparty risk or increased risk aversion do not necessarily point to a more segmented market, but are rather rooted in a general change in investor behaviour. Increased liquidity risk, on the other hand, could well indicate more market segmentation. Our preliminary analysis confirms that, although these general factors have played a large role in the increased spreads and standard deviations, we also find some indication of increased liquidity risk. However, I would like to stress that all assessments we can make at this juncture are still preliminary. We are not yet out of the storm, and a more complete and thorough analysis will have to wait for some time to come. My message at this point of time is for us all to remain committed to a continuous integration process in the European financial markets, and resist the tendency to focus on national markets under tension. Let us therefore not lose the momentum in these uncertain times. I now turn to the equity markets, where it is considerably harder to measure financial integration. This is not least because stock returns are less directly comparable across countries than returns in the money and government bond markets. Notwithstanding this difficulty, our assessment shows signs of continuously increasing integration, and currently, there is no indication that this trend has been affected by the financial crisis. For example, euro area residents doubled their share of euro area cross-border holdings over the past ten years to slightly below one third of their total equity holdings. Moreover, according to our indicators, integration here seems to advance faster at the European than at the global level. At the same time, country-specific factors still play a significant role in the equity markets, not least because of the continued fragmentation in the post-trading infrastructure. A pan-European infrastructure for securities clearing and settlement in the EU would therefore certainly provide new impetus for further integration. Equity markets offer me a nice entry point to make you aware of a new type of indicators that we are currently developing. Financial integration is an important, but not the only factor that contributes to the efficiency of the financial system. There are indeed other relevant factors, such as the degree of financial development or the quality of the framework within which financial markets operate. In the ECB we are now in the process of extending our analysis from financial integration to the development of financial markets. We understand financial development broadly as a process of financial innovation and organisational improvements. This includes developments that reduce asymmetric information; increase the completeness of markets; add possibilities to engage in financial transactions through contracts; reduce transaction costs; and increase competition. The idea to extend our work from financial integration to financial development goes back to the ECOFIN Council’s invitation in 2006 to “monitor and assess relevant institutional features that hinder the efficient functioning of the financial system”.  One of these financial development indicators measures the level of venture capital financing. Venture capital is indeed an attractive additional source of corporate financing, as it provides financing to young and small, research-based firms, which typically face constraints in the more traditional markets. Our indicator shows a rise in venture capital financing in Europe in the recent years; however, the starting level is very low. More precisely, the euro area average for the last five years amounts to 0.02% of GDP, compared with 0.1% in the United States. Therefore, I see more room for investigating ways to promote the development of this type of markets as well.  The final market I want to include in my overview of the state of financial integration is the banking market. Again, banking markets offer a nice illustration of how important the underlying infrastructure is. The wholesale and capital market-related segments are supported by TARGET2 and, not surprisingly, are well integrated. For example, cross-border interbank loans account for a quarter of total interbank loans, and banks’ intra euro area cross-border holdings of bank securities have almost tripled over the past decade. By contrast, the corporate and retail banking markets have remained more fragmented so far, BIS Review 157/2008 3 
also reflecting the multiplicity of existing payment systems. For instance, the euro area cross-border loans to non-banks have remained at low levels, currently at below 6% of the total. Similarly, the cross-country dispersion of banks’ interest rates on loans to firms and households has remained relatively high, especially with regard to consumer loans.  Now, the ECB and the Eurosystem are working hard to address the remaining gaps in financial integration, in particular when it comes to market infrastructures. The year 2008 has marked the launches of two important projects in this regard: TARGET2-Securities and SEPA.  The Eurosystem’s TARGET2-Securities, or T2S, initiative establishes a pan-European securities settlement platform, in which cross-border transactions will be settled at the same price and as efficiently as domestic transactions. Moreover, the T2S settlement cost will be significantly lower than the cost of domestic transactions today. In addition to the pure settlement cost, banks and other users would also achieve back-office and collateral savings.  The T2S User Requirements are a result of intensive cooperation by hundreds of experts from market participants, service providers and central bankers. By July 2008, we had received support of all euro area central securities depositories to the continuation of the project, subject to certain conditions. Consequently, on 17 July the Governing Council of the ECB formally approved the T2S project. The pan-European settlement platform is scheduled to go live by 2013. Importantly for the retail banking sector, the Single Euro Payments Area, or SEPA, was launched in January 2008. SEPA aims to achieve a fully integrated market for retail payment services in the euro area, with the means of harmonised technical standards and market practices. With SEPA, there is no distinction anymore between cross-border and domestic payments. The European Commission estimates that SEPA could bring substantial benefits over the next six years. Moreover, these benefits would be further very significantly increased if SEPA can be used for electronic invoicing!  The main priority for all the stakeholders is now to make every possible effort to implement SEPA timely and in full. The final hurdles – which by definition are the most difficult in a market integration project of this ambition, size and complexity – need to be overcome. Without going into too much detail, banks and competition authorities urgently need to come to an understanding with regard to the future inter-bank pricing models in the retail payments market. Finally, the studies by the ECB and the European Commission have clearly shown that a long parallel processing of the old national and the new SEPA instruments is costly for both banks and their customers. Consequently, the period of dual processing should be kept as short as possible. The Eurosystem therefore has voiced its support for setting a realistic but ambitious end-date for the SEPA migration.  Regulatory and supervisory initiatives  I now turn to the second major theme of my speech. These are the recent regulatory and supervisory initiatives in Europe that are closely related to financial integration and that are particularly relevant in light of the ongoing financial crisis.  As I mentioned earlier, financial integration presents large potential benefits for the European economy. At the same time, it also poses important challenges to supervisory authorities and central banks. Indeed, while more integrated markets increase the shock-absorbing capacity of the financial system, such shocks may propagate more quickly, thereby affecting a wider number and range of market participants. In the same way, a large, systemically relevant cross-border financial institution would clearly have implications for financial stability in the event that it runs into problems.  4 BIS Review 157/2008 
These challenges have become quite evident in the past months. The financial crisis has underscored the importance of appropriate public policy in both crisis prevention and crisis management. I will start with crisis prevention. In the face of increased market integration, European supervisors are confronted with the long-standing challenge of ensuring that their actions are both effective and efficient. Or to put it differently: they have to balance the need that their actions contribute to preserving financial stability, while at the same time avoiding creating any unnecessary regulatory burden for the supervised entities.  A major step to achieve this was the introduction of the Lamfalussy process, which has promoted more efficient and effective regulation and supervision in the EU financial services sector in the past years. The Lamfalussy process was initially created with the purpose to accelerate the adoption of regulatory measures related to the Financial Services Action Plan in the securities sector. Over time it has in addition assumed a very important function in supervisory convergence and cooperation in the whole financial sector. The Eurosystem has from the outset fully supported the Lamfalussy process. A review of the Lamfalussy process by the EU institutions led the ECOFIN to adopt a number of recommendations in December 2007 to better exploit the full potential of the approach. The implementation of these recommendations is currently well under way. To begin with, earlier this year the Level 3 committees of supervisors have introduced the possibility for qualified majority voting into their charters; the members that do not comply are obliged to explain their decision not to do so. This will improve the effectiveness of the committees’ decision-making processes. Moreover, the committees have to submit their annual work programmes to the Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament, thereby enhancing accountability of their activities. Finally, the European Commission will include explicit references to specific tasks, such as mediation or facilitation of information exchange, into the Decisions establishing these committees.  A lot of emphasis has recently been placed on the creation and strengthening of colleges of supervisors for European cross-border banks. As you may know, the main task of these colleges is to organise cooperation and sharing of information between the home and host supervisory authorities of those Member States in which the cross-border banks have significant activities. In May 2008, the ECOFIN recommended to strengthen the role of the colleges and to extend their use to all banking groups with cross-border activities in the EU.  The establishment of the colleges of supervisors will be accompanied by a clarification of the legal framework. The Commission has proposed amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) to enhance the legal underpinnings of the colleges. These amendments pertain in particular to the interplay between the consolidating supervisor, which is chairing the college, and the authorities that are responsible for the significant branches and subsidiaries of the cross-border group.  Now allow me to make some comments as regards the envisaged role of the colleges of supervisors and the Commission’s proposal. In general, I believe that the colleges will improve supervisory cooperation, in particular as regards the effectiveness, efficiency and consistency of the supervisory action. First, in terms of effectiveness, the colleges should facilitate the information exchange on a cross-border group and enable all the involved supervisors to have full knowledge of the overall risk profile of the group. Moreover, the colleges should improve the coordination of supervision and risk assessment, both as regards consolidated and solo supervision, and arrange for the division of tasks.  Second, the colleges should over time become the main supervisory interface for the banking groups. This would lead to higher efficiency, as any unnecessary duplication of supervisory requirements should be avoided. BIS Review 157/2008 5 
Third, the common legal underpinnings for the colleges in the revised CRD will ensure consistency across colleges. In addition, the ECB supports the work by the CEBS on developing operational guidelines. These guidelines have the aim to further align the working procedures of the colleges, the efficacy of their decision-making bodies, and the coherence of the practices used across colleges.  However, it remains to be seen whether such a framework will suffice, or whether further improvements will be needed. The key challenges now lie in its implementation. Let me mention some examples in this regard.  First, the effectiveness of the colleges depends on their ability to facilitate decision-making for the banking group as a whole. The CRD is expected to introduce some rules on the decision-making process should the authorities disagree on essential decisions concerning supervision of cross-border banking groups. Recent events clearly underscore that swift decision-making is of the essence; we cannot afford to have a cumbersome decision-making process in case of disagreements.  Second, the coordination role of Level 3 committees would be of critical importance to ensure consistency of supervisory actions across colleges.  Finally, let me stress the importance of effective information exchange. First, communication between the home and host supervisors within the colleges is crucial for the full understanding of the risk profile of the group. Second, the financial turmoil has highlighted the importance of information sharing between central banks and supervisors for the identification and assessment of risks to financial stability.  Moving from crisis prevention to crisis management, I would like to stress that the well coordinated action by public authorities was instrumental in limiting possible cross-border spillovers in the recent crisis.  To illustrate this point, let me just quickly recall that the Eurosystem and other central banks have ensured adequate access to central bank funding to liquidity-constrained but solvent banks. Governments, on their part, in a concerted and coordinated manner granted guarantees on new issuances of bank debt. They in addition committed to providing banks with additional capital resources, and jointly decided to raise the level of protection of deposits. The Eurosystem has contributed to this work by proposing a set of recommendations on the appropriate framework for both the granting of government guarantees and the recapitalisation measures for financially sound banks.  With regard to the government guarantees, the Eurosystem recommendations provided not only overarching objectives but also specific parameters for the pricing system. In these recommendations, we have stressed the importance of supporting solvent but liquidity constrained banks and preserving the level playing field. In addition, consistency with the Eurosystem’s liquidity management should be ensured so as not to impair the implementation of the single monetary policy.  With regard to the recapitalisation measures, the Eurosystem, in collaboration with the European Commission, also contributed by elaborating a common framework for the pricing of different forms of capitalisation instruments. These measures aim to strengthen the capital position of fundamentally sound banks and to restore a smooth flow of credit to the economy. At the same time, they aim to preserve a level playing field and avoid undue distortions in competition. It is in addition important to ensure that the temporary nature of the government measures is preserved and that private investors are not being discouraged. The methodology of the Eurosystem has been incorporated in the Commission’s communication on the recapitalisation of financial institutions.  Finally, coordinated action was very important in the granting of state deposit guarantees. We all saw how initially uncoordinated initiatives immediately led to spill-overs with potential 6 BIS Review 157/2008 
detrimental effects for banks in other countries that did not enjoy a similar level of protection. Timely concerted action among Member States led to a joint decision to raise the level of protection of deposits. The action was accompanied by a prompt initiative by the Commission to amend the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive. This amendment had the full support of the ECB.  The recent events have shown how the Member States and the EU institutions can act in a rapid and coordinated manner when necessary. However, there is no room for complacency. Consideration of the lessons from the financial crisis and the introduction of improvements to the EU framework for supervision and crisis management has already started. In October, the European Commission set up an independent High Level Group to develop proposals to strengthen the supervision of European financial institutions and markets and financial stability arrangements. The Group shall present its report to the European Commission in view of the Spring European Council 2009. I will assure you that the ECB Governing council will examine very carefully all proposals which will be made by the high level group, as well as by the European Parliament and by the industry itself.  Conclusion  Ladies and gentlemen, continued financial integration is of key importance for Europe. The financial crisis that we are currently facing may have caused a freeze on this development in some markets; all the more I urge us all to keep the momentum in this important process.  The ECB remains firmly committed to fostering further financial integration. The successes of TARGET and TARGET2 demonstrate the importance of the work done in the field of market infrastructures. We will now continue working hard in order to address the still remaining gaps. Finally, the financial crisis confirmed the importance of an appropriate public policy response, both in terms of crisis prevention and crisis management, to avoid cross-border spillovers in the single market. Stronger coordination among Member States and EU institutions for crisis prevention and crisis management is needed. The ECB will closely follow the debate and contribute to it where necessary. I thank you for your attention. BIS Review 157/2008 7 
Philipp Hildebrand: Current state of the Swiss financial system and lessons learnt  Introductory remarks by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 11 December 2008. *      *      * When we published our report on financial stability six months ago, I talked to you about the most important lessons that the SNB had learned from the financial crisis. Today, after a brief assessment of the current state of the financial system, I would like to tell you about progress in the follow-up from these lessons. The focus here is on capital and liquidity regulation. Finally, I will speak briefly about a more cheerful topic that is unrelated to the financial crisis – the launching of a new series of Swiss banknotes.  The economic environment has sharply deteriorated ... As you have already heard from Mr Roth, the economic environment has sharply deteriorated. The three big economic blocs – Europe, Japan and the US – are in recession, and growth in the emerging economies has slowed markedly. For Switzerland, we also expect a period of negative growth.  The situation on the US real estate market has not yet stabilised. Futures on the Case-Shiller index indicate a further drop in prices of around 15% until 2010. Thereafter, the contracts suggest that prices will stabilise. Falling prices can also be observed in some European countries, in particular in the English and the Irish real estate markets. The past few weeks have seen some calming of global financial markets, but we are still a long way away from normalisation. With the worldwide deterioration in the economy, credit risks at banks will rise considerably. Attention was drawn to this in June 2008, in our last report on financial stability. Bank provisions for credit risks are currently at a historically low level, and they will need to be substantially increased. This will have a negative impact on their profitability. In the case of the big banks, the situation also involves considerable risks for trading portfolios.   The worldwide economic downturn comes at a time when the international financial system is already in bad shape. In particular the big banks that have been hit especially hard by the crisis could be forced to curtail, or further curtail, their lending. This, in turn, could have additional negative effects on the real economy. In order to put a halt to this negative spiral, we consider it important that the economy be supported with monetary and fiscal measures. The interest rate reductions carried out by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) should be seen as part of these measures.  ... but the resilience of the big banks has been increased Given this situation, the fact that it has been possible to increase the resilience of the Swiss big banks is crucial. Credit Suisse boosted its capital through private investors by a total of CHF 10 billion. It thereby strengthened its equity position substantially and increased its capacity for absorbing additional shocks. The losses of CHF 3 billion announced by the bank for the fourth quarter show how important it was to reinforce the capital base.  At UBS, the government package provided significant relief to the balance sheet from the burden of illiquid positions particularly affected by the crisis. With this package, the SNB made it possible for UBS to transfer illiquid positions to a special purpose vehicle. The UBS provided this special purpose vehicle with equity amounting to USD 6 billion. The Confederation compensated UBS for the capital requirement arising for this purpose by BIS Review 157/2008 1 
subscribing to mandatory convertible notes (MCN). Since the announcement of the package, the UBS liquidity situation has stabilised.  The numerous international measures aimed at stabilising the financial system have also had a positive effect on the position of the Swiss big banks. Nevertheless, further losses cannot be ruled out in view of the difficult market conditions. The situation remains serious, and the SNB will continue monitoring it closely together with the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC) and the Federal Department of Finance.  Lessons from the crisis and reforms in Switzerland I would now like to speak about the lessons learned from the crisis. The continuing financial crisis is almost unprecedented, in terms of both extent and duration. It is also unprecedented in terms of the measures taken by the authorities and the central banks with the aim of stabilising the situation and minimising the impact on the real economy. This also applies to Switzerland.  At the presentation of the last report on financial stability, we expressed our conviction that the financial system needs to be made more resilient to possible shocks. This is all the more valid if we consider the hundreds of billions of taxpayers’ money that had to be spent worldwide on stabilising the financial system over the past few months. The focus is on the need for improvement in the “shock absorbers”: capital and liquidity. The crisis has shown that the current regulation in these areas is no longer sufficient in the case of the big banks. Their level of capital is inadequate when set in relation to their risks. In the area of liquidity, events have occurred that were not taken into account in any of the big banks’ scenarios.  The reform of the capital adequacy regulation for big banks, drawn up by the SFBC with the support of the SNB, represents an important step in the right direction – for the area of capital. It specifies an increase in risk-weighted capital together with the introduction of a leverage ratio. The leverage ratio is a supplementary instrument and does not call into question the principle of risk-sensitivity with regard to the capital regulation. An essential constituent of the reform are countercyclical mechanisms whereby, in good times, banks are required to considerably exceed the minimum requirements for capital and the leverage ratio. This ensures that a buffer is created to absorb losses during crises. This kind of flexibility is explicitly provided for in the new SFBC capital regulation. The orders already issued by the SFBC relating to the reform of the capital regulation state that the big banks will not be required to comply with the higher risk-weighted capital ratio and the leverage ratio until 2013. However, if the situation on the capital markets or the individual earnings position of the big banks make it impossible to achieve the objectives by 2013, it may be possible to defer this date. The long time period allowed for implementation is crucial. It will prevent the new regulation from having a procyclical effect. In the short term, priority will clearly be devoted to managing the crisis. In the area of liquidity, the SFBC and the SNB are in the process of drawing up a new regulation. The basic objective is to obtain higher liquidity buffers that better reflect the great complexity of liquidity risks. When calculating liquidity requirements for various crisis scenarios, the authorities use internal model calculations by the banks. In order to ensure the comparability and transparency of the internal calculations, the new regime foresees certain standardisations. The conclusion of the project is scheduled for early 2009.  Both regulatory measures – capital regulation and liquidity regulation – are in line with proposals made by the Financial Stability Forum and the G20 action plan. The reforms are also compatible with the strategy of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for implementing the lessons from the crisis. In a recent speech in Beijing, the chairman of the 2 BIS Review 157/2008 
committee, Nout Wellink, said that the main objectives of the strategy were to strengthen capital and liquidity buffers and to restrict leverage in the banking system.1 In the area of capital regulation, he also stressed the importance of countercyclical mechanisms and the possibility of combining risk-weighted and simple unweighted instruments. We believe that the crisis should prompt the big banks to consider where the core competences of bankers lie, and that it should not be left to the authorities alone to think about the lessons to be drawn from the turmoil. In our view, long-term risk-adjusted considerations should take on more of a leading role in bankers’ decisions. In this situation, we believe, the apparent contradiction between supervisory demands for more capital and liquidity, on the one hand, and banks’ competitiveness, on the other, will be dissipated.  Preparations for the new series of banknotes running according to plan As announced, I would like to close with a more cheerful topic that is unrelated to the financial crisis. A number of you will remember the SNB’s artistic design competition for a new series of Swiss banknotes, which was held in 2005. Since then, design work has continued and the technical requirements for the creation of an innovative series of new banknotes have now been fulfilled.  Manuela Pfrunder, the graphic artist, has further developed her drafts and completed the design for the CHF 50 note, taking the technical aspects of banknote production into account. At its meeting of 29 August 2008, the SNB Bank Council approved the design of the new CHF 50 banknote and gave the go-ahead for the further work that is to be done.  Preparations for the technical aspects of implementation of banknote production are now in full swing. A particular challenge is posed by the security features that will be used in the new banknote series for the first time. Based on the progress of work to date, the SNB is confident that the first banknote in the new series will be ready for production within the planned time period. The CHF 50 banknote will mark the beginning of the new series of banknotes and is scheduled to be issued in autumn 2010. The appearance of the new banknote and the security details for the entire series will be presented shortly before the scheduled issue date.                                                  1  Nout Wellink, The Importance of Banking Supervision in Financial Stability, High Level Meeting, 17 November 2008, Beijing BIS Review 157/2008 3 
Glenn Stevens: Interesting times Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Australian Business Economists Annual Dinner, Sydney, 9 December 2008. *      *      * It is a pleasure once again to address the Australian Business Economists. It was to this group that I gave my first speech as Governor, in October 2006. Tonight is my 23rd speech since then. Between the two occasions, quite a lot has changed, globally and domestically (though I doubt the speeches have become any more exciting). Many people have said to me recently that the times are “interesting”. My response has been that they are, perhaps, a little too interesting. I need not remind this audience of the international financial turmoil through which we have lived over the past almost year and a half, nor of the intensity of the events since mid September this year, in particular. I do not know anyone who predicted this course of events. This should give us cause to reflect on how hard a job it is to make genuinely useful forecasts. What we have seen is truly a “tail” outcome – the kind of outcome that the routine forecasting process never predicts. But it has occurred, it has implications, and so we must reflect on it. In that spirit, I shall set out a few features of this episode that make it “interesting”. The most obvious one is the prominence of financial events and particularly financial sector impairment in key countries. There have been other episodes where individual financial institutions or sectors, or even the whole banking systems of small countries, have needed recapitalisation. But the scale of capital needed, the number of countries where it is needed and the extent of counterparty risk aversion because of concerns over solvency have been outside the range of experience of the past half century. In the near term, financial stress brings the obvious concern about the ability of the financial system to provide credit to the economies in question. As one measure of this concern, the number of loans approved for housing in the United Kingdom in October was 65 per cent lower than a year earlier, and about 50 per cent lower than during the downturn of the early 1990s. The immediate need is to keep ample liquidity, strengthen banks’ balance sheets by adding capital and to help confidence, including by lending the strength of the sovereign’s credit rating where necessary. All this has been occurring. What may still be needed internationally is attention to the remaining problem assets, since if their prices continue to decline, the capital position of the banks will continue to deteriorate. So while the UK solution has emphasised new capital and the initial US approach emphasised excising the “troubled” assets, the Swiss solution has been to do both: to recapitalise the banks, while getting the worst of the bad assets off their balance sheets. The United States has moved in this direction also more recently. Continued efforts to provide clarity on the state of balance sheets is also important. Surely the lingering counterparty risk aversion reflects uncertainty on this score. Longer term, some of the implications of the past year’s events will be seen in the regulatory environment. In those countries where the public purse has had to be used to support bank solvency, it can be expected that there will be significant regulatory reform – and rightly so. The real trick, however, will be to make sure that the reforms are not just knee jerk reactions to the symptoms of financial excess – as clear as they are – but well considered, durable and tractable changes that appropriately contain, but do not crush, the financial system’s capacity and appetite to take risk. Certainly, over the past five or so years, too much risk was taken, of the wrong sort. The danger in the next several years, however, will not be too much risk taking, but too little. Regulators will want to avoid compounding that. BIS Review 156/2008 1 
While the prominence of financial events has been clear, there has also been a set of “interesting” events in the real economy unfolding at the same time. The fortunes of the Chinese economy are increasingly important, particularly for Australia and other countries in our time zone. The most striking real economic fact of the past several months is not continued US economic weakness, but that China’s economy has slowed much more quickly than anyone had forecast. Our own estimates suggest that Chinese industrial production probably declined over the four months to October. Some of this might be attributable to the effects of the Olympics but surely not much. Some of it reflects the weakening in Chinese exports to major countries. But more than that seems to have been occurring. I am not sure that many economic forecasters have fully appreciated this yet. There is every chance that the rate of growth of China’s GDP is currently noticeably below the 8 per cent pace that is embodied in various forecasts for 2009. The Chinese authorities, having sought a slowing of their economy after it was clearly overheating, are now moving policies quickly in an expansionary direction. So there is a good chance that China’s economy will be looking stronger in a year’s time than it does today. It is important, though, that this is done in the right way – specifically by boosting domestic demand. China’s slowing may be part of a third striking fact, namely, the simultaneity of the weakening in economic activity around the world during recent months. When this occurs, one is naturally led to look for a common shock. The noticeable slowing in many economies in the June quarter seemed at the time to be attributable to the sharp run up in oil prices. That rise has now been more than reversed, but the slowing has, if anything, intensified during the past several months. The more recent weakening might be the result of more widespread and intense tightening of credit conditions that has occurred in some of the major countries. But the state of domestic financial sectors differs across countries. In Australia or Japan or much of east Asia or Canada, while credit conditions have become more difficult, the banks are in much stronger condition than in the United States or Europe or the United Kingdom. One thing that stands out as closely related across countries, however, is the fall in share markets. These changes are to some extent themselves a reflection of a weaker set of expected economic outcomes. But with closely linked financial markets and rapid communication, changes in sentiment are transmitted very quickly across countries and it appears that those changes in sentiment are themselves affecting behaviour. People have, understandably, become very uncertain about the outlook and are correspondingly more cautious in their spending behaviour. In essence, we are now in a period when the essential nature of events is not so much a crisis in the financial system. It is a crisis of confidence on the part of households and businesses, and it is global in nature. Hence the need for actions that are internationally consistent to deal with the situation. On that score, a fourth “interesting” feature is the speed with which official institutions seem to be reacting to the economic fallout now unfolding. To take one example, IMF forecasts, and associated policy advice, are being revised more often and faster than I can recall in the past. Perhaps this is simply because of the greater number of international meetings at which the Fund is asked for its view, but my sense is that international official bodies and their domestic counterparts are shifting their assessments unusually quickly as they attempt to grapple with the unfolding situation. Monetary policy is being eased aggressively around the world. So is fiscal policy. One of the striking features of the recent G 20 meetings was the way the need for fiscal stimulus, where debt levels permitted, was readily agreed between participants, and actively encouraged by the IMF. Of course, agreeing to things in general at a meeting is only the first, and the easiest, step. Actual policies have to be delivered and in a timely and effective – and hopefully consistent – way. I use the word “consistent” because it is preferable, in my 2 BIS Review 156/2008 
judgment, for action to be broadly consistent and timely, than for it to be precisely co ordinated but delayed. It also remains to calibrate the extent of the measures appropriately for the circumstances, which is no easy matter. Nonetheless, it seems to me that all this is happening faster than on previous occasions. It would not be realistic to suggest that this response has been, or ever could be, so fast and so well targeted that significant near term weakness in the global economy can be avoided. The data coming in by the day confirm that there is an international downturn taking place, and that it shows every sign of being a deeper one than the rather shallow affair of 2001. The question is whether we have reasonable grounds to expect that the combination of private and public efforts to address the financial problems, a subsidence of the sheer panic in financial markets and the use of macroeconomic policy to provide stimulus to weak economies will establish sound foundations for a renewed period of expansion beginning some time in 2009. The inauguration of a new US Administration is a key opportunity. The economic downturn has been deepening during the transition period. But if the new team can announce credible plans to accommodate the required adjustments in the US economy, confidence in medium term prospects can be re built. This would assist both the US economic recovery and conditions elsewhere. Thinking ahead, the next international expansion will no doubt have some different characteristics from the previous one. It cannot be based on a continual gearing up by consumers in developed countries and associated asset price escalation. For that reason, neither can it be characterised by the continued large build up of balance of payments surpluses by the emerging world. The secular increase in living standards in emerging countries ought to play a bigger role in driving global demand – and that will depend on appropriate policies in both those countries and the developed world. It looks like there will be a fairly prominent role in the near term, in many advanced countries, for the government sector through the recapitalisation and/or guarantees of banks, or fiscal expansion, or both. But for sustained growth, there will also need to be a role for innovation and prudent risk taking in the private sector – even though, at present, that is in retreat. Turning closer to home, the Australian economy has seen a significant change in circumstances over the past six months. The biggest terms of trade boom in half a century is over, and has partly unwound. I still think that China’s emergence is far from complete and that, as a result, the terms of trade will be higher on average than they were until a few years ago. But over the next year they will be well below their peak. Our households, like those elsewhere, have observed financial turmoil and a decline in share prices and have become more cautious. Consumer spending, which slowed significantly in the period from about February to June as interest rates and petrol prices rose, has remained slow since, even as interest rates and petrol prices have fallen significantly. I think we can expect that households will be more cautious about debt over the next couple of years. Business investment and government spending have remained pretty strong – so that domestic demand was still 4 per cent higher in the latest data than a year earlier. But businesses are currently in the process of scaling back plans for investment and hiring. This is partly in response to slower consumer demand, but the dramatic change of view about international conditions and the general uncertainty reflected in financial market prices are surely playing a major role. So in the period ahead, private demand could look weaker than it has for some years. What then do we need to be doing to ensure as far as we can that the period of weakness is brief, and that prospects for longer-term sustainable growth are maintained? Of course, we cannot change the course of the world economy. But we can keep our own house in order to maximise our chances of good performance. On this score, as I have remarked before, Australia has scope to use macroeconomic policy to support the economy BIS Review 156/2008 3 
in the weak part of the cycle. That scope was earned by being prepared to run budget surpluses and run down public debt when revenues were strong, and by raising interest rates to contain inflation when the economy overheated. The scope to ease policies is now being used. On the fiscal side, the “automatic stabilisers” will reduce the budget surplus as the economy weakens, cushioning the economy in the process. That is what they are designed to do. There has also been a front loaded, discretionary easing that is starting to arrive in recipients’ bank accounts this week. Of course, a good deal of this may be saved, but even if it is, that presumably takes the place of private saving that would otherwise have been done over a longer period, so it brings forward the point at which households become confident enough to lift spending. Also on the fiscal front, there is no reason why worthwhile public investment decisions that are currently planned should not proceed, as long as they really are worthwhile. On the monetary front, interest rates right across the spectrum have fallen. Some fairly elementary calculations suggest that, as a result of the decline in interest rates that has occurred already, the fall in the household sector’s gross debt-servicing burden will be almost 3 per cent of household income. This is roughly equal to that seen in the early 1990s, when the cash rate fell from 18 per cent to 4.75 per cent. But on that occasion it took two and a half years; this time it will take place over about four or five months. The decline in borrowing costs for businesses has generally been smaller and slower to appear, but there has been some faster pass through of the most recent reduction in the cash rate. These transmission channels of monetary policy are still operating in Australia, unlike in some other countries. In addition, the exchange rate is playing its normal role of adjusting to changed circumstances in a way that stabilises the economy. It has declined by about 25 per cent in trade weighted terms since mid year, just about the largest movement we have seen in such a short period. These are quite big changes. They will take time to have their full effect, but they will be making a significant difference to conditions over the next year. There is scope to do more with macroeconomic policy settings, if needed, given the strength of the public accounts at the federal level, and the outlook for declining inflation. In assessing whether more is needed, and if so, how much, we will naturally need both to maintain a close watch on the data and to remember the extent of stimulus that is still in the pipeline as a result of past actions. Other supportive factors include the state of the financial system. This has been said many times but bears repeating. Of course credit conditions for some sectors, notably property, have tightened. And overall, credit to business is rising much more slowly now than a year ago. But even so, over the three months to October, credit provided by intermediaries rose at an annualised pace of about 12-13 per cent. On a broader definition, which includes capital market raisings, the pace was about 9 per cent. Both numbers are actually a bit higher than they were around mid year. In most developed countries, this would be considered a very satisfactory pace (if not a little fast). Credit growth to households has recently been very slow, by historical standards, at about 4 to 5 per cent. Margin loans in particular are contracting quickly as people reduce their leverage. Lending for housing is starting to pick up now, however, from the early impact of interest rate reductions. Australian banks, having raised very large quantities of deposits in the past couple of months, are now turning back to offshore markets, making use of the government guarantee. They do not appear to have had much trouble raising capital from private markets when they wanted it. Overall, while not without its difficulties, this situation remains a much better one than seen in a number of other countries. These are the key elements of handling the cyclical episode. Longer term, performance will depend on the quality of investment, both public and private, on productivity increasing innovation and reform, and on getting the right balance on regulation. All that is hard, but at various times over the past couple of decades, Australia has made considerable progress in 4 BIS Review 156/2008 
these areas, and has a pretty good record overall of responding to the need for change, especially in times of adversity. There is no reason we should not maintain that record. As I said at the outset, we are indeed living through “interesting” times. They are tough times, for businesses, financial markets, households and policy makers. Given the global situation, we have a very difficult period to negotiate. But we can negotiate it. The long run prospects for the Australian economy have not deteriorated to the extent that some people may presently be feeling. We do have reasonable grounds for some quiet confidence about the future, however bad the storm at present may be. A period of reflection and recharging of batteries over the break will be helpful. At the conclusion of a hectic year, therefore, I wish all of you a Merry Christmas – and a much less interesting 2009. BIS Review 156/2008 5 
Tarisa Watanagase: Combating the global financial crisis – role of international cooperation Remarks by Dr Tarisa Watanagase, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the HKMA Distinguished Lecture, Hong Kong, 16 December 2008.  *      *      * Governor Draghi, Governor Yam, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am honored and delighted to be here among this gathering of distinguished policymakers, financial experts and academia, at this year’s HKMA Distinguished Lecture and would like to thank Governor Yam for the kind invitation. This lecture truly provides an excellent opportunity for us to share our views on the topical issues that are at the center of international financial community.  Ten years ago, we had the Asian financial crisis. In Thailand, there were plenty of discussions about the causes and remedies of the crisis, some of which still continued until these days. To me, the Thai crisis had 4 main causes, namely, we had weaknesses in the macroeconomic management leading up to bubbles, lax supervision, excessive risk taking of both the financial sector and the private sector in general, and the inadequate legal and information infrastructure. The crisis we are facing now has many surprises as pointed out by Governor Draghi, but I also see plenty of similarities in the underlying root causes. Because of the crisis’s global scale and its severity, this time around we have seen unprecedented efforts taking at both the national, regional and international levels.  Today, one decade after the Asian financial crisis, emerging markets look less vulnerable to financial disturbances. Emerging markets, in particular in Asia, are learning to live with heightened uncertainty in the world where the extent and the whereabouts of benefits from financial globalization to promote growth and development while ensuring our economic and financial stability. This, of course, necessitates that we have to be very focused on risk management. Ladies and Gentlemen,  Asian economies have come a long way since 1997 in promoting economic and financial resiliency. We see a region-wide move toward a more flexible exchange rate regime, with a disciplined framework in the conduct of monetary and fiscal policies. As for the financial sector, the framework of policy has moved toward risk-based supervision, to an adherence to international standards, and to the undertakings of formal financial sector assessments under Financial Sector Assessment Program of FSAP. The macroeconomic policies also become more flexible, yet proactive, in dealing with changes in the market conditions and practices. When necessary, a tradition fiscal-monetary policy mix has been augmented by appropriate prudential measures of financial institutions. More importantly, legal and information infrastructure, including credit bureaus, has also been put in place to strengthen the foundation for financial system capacity for crisis prevention and resolution.  These intensive reforms and institution building during the past decade may make it less likely that financial turbulence will trigger a sharp and broad-based dent to real economic outcomes, especially, since there is no significant build-up of sectoral imbalances in the region. But, challenges remain as we have learnt that the key pressure points that can lead to difficulties for small-open economies can be externally-induced, particularly when we do BIS Review 163/2008 1 
not know if we are still caught in the eye of the financial storm or whether the turbulence has ceased.  Let me now turn the focus of my discussion to the need for closer cooperation as we all face challenges on how to combat the global financial crisis. The ongoing global financial crisis is not dissimilar to other crises as it is and will be followed by intensive reforms at international level. It also highlights that international cooperation remains important and necessary in maintaining global financial stability. In fact, it has become more and more important given globalization process, which makes us better interconnected.  However, we might have taken it for granted that international cooperation is the first best solution and could solve global crisis. We have all learnt that in a number of occasions, when a solution is needed, good implementation comes too little too late.  Taking the International Monetary Fund’s or the (IMF) Short-term Liquidity Facility as an example, this new facility is somewhat similar to the swap lines extended among central banks to fellow members that do not call for typical IMF-supported adjustment programs. Emerging markets have been proponents of this facility for several years, but the IMF has previously been reluctant to endorse it due to fear of moral hazard. It is ironic that only when problems in advanced economies led to contagion elsewhere and large number of central banks entered into such swap agreements with the Federal Reserve, did the IMF agree to such an instrument. This also reconfirms the need for greater voice and representation of emerging markets in important international financial institutions (IFIs) as highlighted in the recent G-20 Summit Declaration. While the reform is underway under the IMF, it is only with hope that other fora, including, the FSF will take the issue into consideration more seriously.  Let me elaborate further on the importance of having emerging markets participated in the systemically important international fora.  I think you all agree at this advanced economies or emerging markets are all prone to sectoral imbalances, which, if left unchecked, can lead to a full-blown crisis, anywhere, any time, when the bubbles burst. The impact of a crisis in an advanced, systemically important country can be much broader and deeper, creating a larger scale of world-wide externality.  Emerging markets, unlike others, have had our share of coping with new challenges brought on by this phenomenon as well as those created by us one decade ago. It is, therefore, not only the responsibility of advanced countries to be in charge of global surveillance but also the responsibility of emerging markets to share our views and experiences of how to reform ourselves to be better prepared for greater uncertainty.  Against this background, this calls into question whether the surveillance mechanisms available at the moment and the role played by emerging markets in international cooperation are adequate in ensuring international financial stability, the essence of the mission of IFIs.  It is therefore in times of crisis that the value of the international cooperation be measured and the voice and representation of emerging markets be heard IFIs. The unprecedented events of the past months present a historic opportunity for the international bodies to rise to the challenge. The time has come for them to be more proactive and become truly global institutions.  Apart from strengthening the roles of IFIs, I believe that regional cooperation can play an important role in supplementing both national and global responses. I’d like to raise two observations on this issue. First, the global financial crisis highlights the need to put in place an effective regional surveillance mechanism that can detect weakness early on. International financial institutions will remain useful for global surveillance and financing balance of payments need when necessary. However, waiting for the global community 2 BIS Review 163/2008 
through international financial institutions for regional surveillance may be too little too late for timely policy measures that can safeguard the region from contagion from other parts of the world.  Indeed, it is very important for policymakers with common challenges to put greater efforts in having a clear and in depth understanding of one another’s policy and practices. This will, in turn, help raise the comfort level and can usefully avoid potential policy missteps and create policy synergies that eventually foster confidence of investors. This is the kind of trust that no amount of legal text, conditions precedent, or covenants can match, but is developed through the friendship and goodwill among friends within the region. Countries in the same region tend to possess better understanding and coordination, and therefore, policies and initiatives at the regional level can be more effective and timely. Second, while the Asian financial crisis was a wake up call for Asia on the need for regional liquidity facility, Asian countries need to consider making such facility sufficiently large and effective with timely disbursement in light of the current global crisis.  During the Asian financial crisis, more than 75% of the IMF’s financial package for Thailand came from the funding within the region. The present global situation has also reconfirmed the vision set for the by the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) that Asia needs to have its own regional liquidity facility to protect itself from contagion, be it caused within the region or from outside.  It is therefore timely that coordination and cooperation among countries be further strengthened to ensure that prompt remedial actions can be put in place in light of the ongoing global financial crisis.  Ladies and Gentlemen, To conclude, I wish to remind you that the present situation calls for the need to greater international cooperation, which requires concerted efforts by international organizations, regional cooperation and national governments, in combating the global financial crisis. Regional cooperation must be coherent with national policy and work hand-in-hand with international cooperation.  The impact of crisis today and the effect of the unwinding of measures taken would not be a zero-sum game, and all players could potentially lose. Thus, going forward, finding the right balance and creating ties between these three, namely international, regional and national interests, will be an important task for national authorities. Thank you. BIS Review 163/2008 3 
Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj: Building a sound framework for the fund management industry Keynote guest address by His Excellency Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, at the FundForum Middle East 2008: "Building a Sound Framework for the Fund Management Industry", Manama, 2 December 2008. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen: I would like to thank the organisers of this Second Annual Fund Forum Middle East for their kind invitation to speak to you today. My topic is “Building a Sound Framework for the Fund Management Industry”, and a sound framework involves both macro-economic and micro-prudential elements. The macro-economic elements are obviously the uppermost in everyone’s thoughts at the moment. The global financial and economic system is currently experiencing what is generally accepted are the worst conditions for the last 50 years. Until only a few months ago, many commentators and analysts believed that the economies of the GCC would be an oasis of calm in the on-going financial turmoil. We also tended to hear a great deal about the so-called “decoupling” thesis. This was the idea that the emerging economies would continue their recent strong growth despite the economic downturn in Europe and the United States. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September we now know that these scenarios were too optimistic. It has become clear that no part of the world will be immune to the current crisis, and the IMF expects that this will be the first time in fifty years that all of the advanced economies will experience a synchronized recession. This cannot fail to have an impact on the rest of the global economy.  Although the GCC countries enjoy strong fundamentals, we have not been immune to the credit crisis. One consequence of the financial market disruption in the wake of the Lehman collapse was a substantial outflow of dollar liquidity from all of the emerging markets, including the GCC. The liquidity impact of the crisis has also combined with a general risk aversion which has had an adverse impact on the supply of credit to many emerging economies, including to the GCC countries.  As a result of these global financial market developments there have been significant stock market corrections in several GCC countries. Some GCC members have needed to provide support for banking sectors, in the form of recapitalization funds, or by providing blanket guarantees of the deposits, or by a combination of both. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that the credit is becoming more restricted, and that investment projects are being delayed or scaled back.  Nonetheless, compared with many other regions of the world, the GCC countries remain in a strong position to withstand the current crisis. They now form a $1 trillion economy. In the first five years of this decade an economy the size of Sweden was added to the GCC in terms of aggregate output. The GCC is a net capital exporter, its Governments have surplus fiscal positions, and the GCC countries collectively are one of the world’s largest holders of foreign exchange reserves. Although oil prices have recently declined sharply from their highs in July of this year, when the price peaked at 147 dollars per barrel, the economic outlook for the GCC remains sound. A range of economic forecasts, including from the IMF, suggest that the GCC can expect economic growth in excess of five percent next year. This will be lower than the 6.5 percent projected for 2008, but would, nonetheless, represent a solid performance when set against the background of current global economic conditions. BIS Review 163/2008 1 
At the Central Bank of Bahrain we have been monitoring domestic and international developments very closely. However, our domestic financial markets have continued to function normally despite the enormous stresses of recent months resulting from international events. It is true that domestic liquidity conditions have become tighter, but this has been mainly due to outflows of capital linked to earlier speculation on the revaluation of GCC currencies. Our financial system has shown its resilience by absorbing both large capital inflows and outflows over the past year. In recognition of tighter domestic liquidity conditions the Central Bank has taken a number of measures to provide additional liquidity to the market. However, we have not seen the need to take exceptional measures to support our banks, which remain liquid and well capitalized.  We will, of course, continue to keep the situation under review and will take appropriate monetary policy and liquidity measures to continue to protect the stability of the markets here in Bahrain. Ensuring macro-economic stability is, of course, vital for the development of the fund management industry. The measures that the Central Bank has taken to ensure financial stability within Bahrain will continue to provide the conditions within which a vibrant and growing fund management industry needs for its further development. The second component that the fund management industry needs for its development is a sound regulatory framework. Let me devote some remarks to this subject, as it is an area to which the Central Bank has devoted substantial resources in recent years. The Central Bank of Bahrain is the single regulator for the financial services sector. We are the only central bank in the region with responsibility for regulating all banking, capital markets, fund management and insurance business under one roof. We have a policy of following international standards very closely, and in the area of Islamic finance, we have been a pioneer in developing prudential standards. We were the first regulator in the world to issue a comprehensive set of regulations tailored to the needs of Islamic financial institutions. We see the development of the fund management industry as a vital part of Bahrain’s strategy to remain the strategic financial hub for the MENA region. Our position was confirmed by the recent announcement that assets under management by Bahrain’s mutual fund industry, surged by 73.7 percent to over US 17.2 billion dollars from September 2007 to September 2008. This growth in volume has come from both overseas funds and from mutual funds that are locally incorporated. The locally incorporated funds have been established by domestic and international asset management companies and banks based in Bahrain and abroad. Although our domestic market is small, many of the asset management firms and banks use their presence in Bahrain as a hub from which to tap into the enormous opportunities that exist in both the GCC and the wider Middle East. These firms also tell us that they are attracted by the maturity and efficiency of our financial markets, and by our comprehensive and transparent regulatory framework. Bahrain, via the CBB and the Economic Development Board, has actively encouraged inward investment, and the success of this strategy is evident in both the predominance of foreign funds – both regional and international – in Bahrain’s capital markets. Of the 2,746 funds registered as of September 2008, 95 percent of them are domiciled overseas. The total assets of all funds are US$17.2, while the total assets of foreign funds are US$ 10.2 billion. Recent changes that we have made to the CBB Rulebook have increased transparency across all types of investment. Our new rules aim to differentiate between the various categories of collective investment undertakings and to provide appropriate levels of protection for investors. Besides retail schemes, the new regulations also authorize expert schemes which are suitable for medium size investors. Also, the regulations create a new category of “exempt” schemes, under which hedge funds, leveraged buyouts, and other high risk funds could be established.  2 BIS Review 163/2008 
The creation of the exempt category, in particular, demonstrates that we understand the complex nature of investors’ requirements, as well as those of market players. We are determined to offer the necessary amount of regulation without stifling innovation and, provided that they satisfy certain criteria, to allow financial institutions to set up various types of funds. These changes promise to be a catalyst for the development of specialist funds, such as hedge funds and other alternative investment products, for which investors have an increasing appetite. Specialist funds are quickly becoming a market niche in which Bahrain is becoming increasingly active. We have also been developing our Rulebook as it applies to capital markets activities. We have made significant progress in the past year in developing a suitably comprehensive set of regulations for the capital markets, which will be issued as Volume 6 of the CBB Rulebook. The Capital Markets volume will include 13 modules which will contain regulations based on international best practice standards. We have recently finalized the Module on “Markets and Exchanges”, and the consultation period for the Module on “Takeovers, Mergers and Acquisitions”, ended at the end of October of this year. The Module on “Clearing Settlement and Central Depository”, has now been issued for consultation.  I would like to end by mentioning a final development in the capital markets to which we attach great significance. This concerns the agreement that has just been entered into between the Bahrain Stock Exchange and the Singapore Exchange. The agreement between the two exchanges provides a platform for the further development of the Bahrain Stock Exchange, using the world renowned technical expertise of its counterpart in Singapore. To conclude, in Bahrain we are taking a wide variety of measures to strengthen the framework for the fund management industry. These include: maintaining a sound macro-economic environment, developing our regulatory framework, and enhancing the role of the Bahrain Stock Exchange. Although we may now be entering the down-swing of the global business cycle, there will, I am sure, be many investment opportunities that will continue to arise in the region. As the leading financial centre in the region, Bahrain offers a strong platform from which to access these opportunities. Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 163/2008 3 
Denny H Kalyalya: Zambian financial sector – responding to the needs of business Speech by Dr Denny H Kalyalya, Deputy Governor-Operations of the Bank of Zambia; at the opening of Standard Chartered Bank Zambia Solwezi Branch, Solwezi, 10 December 2008. *      *      * The Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry, Hon. Felix Mutati The Minister, North-Western Province, Hon. Joseph Mulyata The Chairman of the Board of Standard Chartered Bank Zambia, Mr. George Sokota His Worship the mayor of Solwezi The Managing Director of Standard Chartered Bank, Mrs. Mizinga Melu Distinguished guests Members of the press Ladies and Gentlemen I am pleased to be here at the official opening of the new Solwezi Branch of Standard Chartered Bank Zambia Limited. Ladies and Gentlemen, recent times have shown a proliferation of commercial bank branches in areas which had previously been considered unattractive for business. Rural areas had even experienced closures where banks felt that they were unable to establish a case for business. The economic environment that the Government created through the reforms instituted in the early 1990’s has given new confidence to investors and has provided an opportunity for businesses to grow, thereby attracting banks to the areas which were deprived of basic financial services. The opening of this branch today, in a town which has attracted major investments, is a demonstration that the financial sector is indeed, now responding to the needs of business. The world’s financial markets have been plunged into turmoil which some say is unprecedented, or at least comparable to the levels experienced in the most severe financial crises of the last century. Notwithstanding this, our financial system has demonstrated a level of stability which to an extent has been derived from the strong capital positions that have characterised the Zambian banking industry in the past few years. However, this turbulence has already resulted in a reduction in projected global economic growth and a decline in demand for Africa’s exports. Notwithstanding this, we remain confident that the banking sector will continue to show resilience and expansion through branch networks, thereby acting as a channel through which services will be extended to the financially excluded. Ladies and Gentlemen, a recent survey established that fewer than 15% of the Zambian adult population have access to the services provided by commercial banks. The key reasons for this low level of access were cited as the distance that needs to be overcome in order to access the services and the cost of these services. It is therefore a welcome development that commercial banks have responded to these challenges by reaching out through new branches. However, banks need to be mindful of the fact that the many of our people who need these services most of all are not able to bear the heavy charges that are sometimes levied, and the goal of inclusion will stand to be compromised if this matter is not addressed. The Bank of Zambia is in the process of engaging the banks with a view to finding a solution to the high cost of banking which is often cited as the main hindrance to access to finance. I therefore appeal to all the banks operating in Zambia to critically assess the level of their charges and to continue playing the supportive role to development that they have in the past. In this regard, I am particularly pleased to make mention of the spirited efforts that Standard Chartered Bank continues to make in financing SME’s and Micro-finance. The experiences of many economies show that these sub sectors have the capacity to create a middle class and BIS Review 163/2008 1
to emancipate both rural and urban dwellers from their poverty trap. Zambia has many promising entrepreneurs whose only constraint is affordable funding. As you explore the opportunities that this new venture will bring you, I urge you to focus on the customers who may appear small today, but could grow with the bank if they are given the right support. I wish you every success as you embark on this journey into North Western Province. 2 BIS Review 163/2008 
Mugur Isărescu: Issues related to real convergence on the path to euro adoption Presentation by Mr Mugur Isărescu, Governor of the National Bank of Romania, on the occasion of the session organised by the Romanian Academy on “The Euro Adoption Strategy and the International Financial Crisis”, Bucharest, 2 October 2008. *      *      * The Romanian authorities set as a strategic economic policy objective the fulfilment of all the requirements that would allow the adoption of the euro as the national currency in 2014. Although this is an ambitious objective, it can be achieved provided that a coherent economic policy mix is adopted and maintained to support both nominal and real convergence with the euro area countries. Mention should be made that, in order to join the euro area, only the nominal convergence criteria need to be considered: a stable exchange rate, subdued inflation, interest rates close to those applied by euro area countries, moderate budget deficit and public debt. Nevertheless, the maintenance of the convergence of nominal indicators in the long run and even the turning to good account of all the advantages derived from being part of a well-functioning monetary system compel us to equally consider the accomplishment of real convergence between the European developed economies and the Romanian economy. In this context, Romania’s adoption of the single currency before achieving a minimum level of real economic convergence would be risky and counterproductive. We have to make sure that when achieving the nominal criteria a substantial progress in real convergence will have been achieved as well. Thus, in my presentation today I thought that, by giving an analysis of the Romanian economy’s path to the adoption of the European single currency, it is adequate to focus not only on nominal convergence, a topic which I have repeatedly approached, but also on several issues pertaining to real economic convergence. Or, this means, in a plain language, to put in place the conditions necessary for a rapid, sound and sustainable economic growth. The large disparities between the performance of the Romanian economy and that of European Union countries compel us to do that. In this context, allow me to approach a topic less debated during public meetings in our country, but which is deeply linked to the capacity of the Romanian economy to maintain a rapid and sustainable growth. It is all about the general problems relative to structural reforms and, in particular, about labour market flexibility, the imperative need for this to come into line with the most modern practices applied in successful countries, by taking into account both the realities of the Romanian economy, and the requirements of competition on an increasingly demanding international market. At first glance, there are few connections between the changeover to the euro and labour market flexibility. In fact, the connection is strong, even essential, I would say. Before proceeding to a more in-depth analysis of the topic, allow me to clarify an issue that was subject to previous public debate. The National Bank of Romania has nothing against wage hikes. Quite the opposite, we might say. The Romanian economy could only benefit from an increasingly fast rise in wages, in order to enjoy a higher living standard, surmount the historical disparities that separate us from the Western economies and put a stop to labour force migration. Nonetheless, we must analyse with a clear mind and assert bluntly that a mismatch between pay rises and labour productivity gains is unsustainable. Wage hikes in excess of labour productivity are not likely to bring about a higher living standard, but on the contrary, they may lead to a lower living standard, given that, sooner or later, the disparity between the two fundamental indicators will entail a fast-paced rise in prices, the weakening of domestic currency, external indebtedness. All this has a negative influence on BIS Review 162/2008 1 
investment and delays the achievement of real convergence of the economy rather than speed it up. Over the past few years, annual productivity gains came in at impressive 10% and beyond each year. Multiple factors stood behind this performance, such as the initial low level, the significant decline – even if not always illustrated by statistical indicators – in the population working in agriculture and, highly important, the strong increase in investment. However, this increase was exceeded by far by the wage hikes, which explains the sizeable widening of the external deficit, as well as the increasing inflationary pressures over the past year and a half. So, we embark upon this path, carrying a serious burden on our shoulders. I wonder what will happen the moment the increase in labour productivity slows down. Such a trend is closely connected to economic rigidities, the infrastructure-related issues, the slowdown in economic restructuring. In view of all these issues, the NBR does not embrace the idea of slowing down wage increases, but rather it advocates the creation of conditions likely to render this hike sustainable and maintain its actual nature. After all, from a nominal point of view, there is no limit to increasing wages. However, the market will admit only pay rises matched by labour productivity gains. The rest fuels inflation and the depreciation of domestic currency, taking the real level of wage rises to where it is matched by output and labour productivity. Next, I would like to make reference to the factors that establish the direct connection between the NBR’s legal tasks concerning wage increases, on the one hand, and the rise in labour productivity, on the other. In this vein, I must specify that, once Romania joined the European Union and the National Bank of Romania became a member of the European System of Central Banks, we are not only entitled, but also bound to present our viewpoint where we see that fundamental equilibria of the economy may be jeopardised by a particular development. Hence, I will refer to the NBR’s objective to ensure and maintain price stability and bring inflation rate down to a level compatible with its capacity as a member of the Eurosystem. Generally, a lower inflation rate is associated with a slower economic growth and even with recession. However, this phenomenon occurs only when there is a contradiction in the economic policy mix and when subdued inflation is not the primary objective of other policies, particularly fiscal and income policies. When the policy mix is balanced, inflation rate may be curbed while maintaining a sustained growth pace. Behind this development stand mainly foreign direct investment inflows which enhance the productive capacity of the economy and ensure the sustainable financing of a relatively high external deficit. In Romania’s case, the experts working with the central bank as well as the independent analysts estimated that the national economy may further rise at a fast clip amid alleviating inflationary pressures, even in the context of a current account deficit of 8-10% of GDP. Nevertheless, in order for capital inflows to continue, Romania’s economy must stay attractive. This attractiveness may no longer be objectively related to low unit labour cost or disproportionate tax facilities which would not comply with EU norms. Therefore, an investor-friendly environment should be the result of a different set of characteristics such as increased flexibility in the fiscal regime and in the labour market. Thus, the NBR’s primary objective to ensure and maintain price stability is closely linked to the policy mix pursued by the Romanian authorities. Another nominal objective which is essential for joining the euro area is exchange rate stability. In recent years, the improved performance of the Romanian economy enabled the significant alleviation of exchange rate fluctuation as compared with the situation in the last decade. In fact, the foreign exchange regime adopted by the Romanian authorities, namely a flexible exchange rate requiring far lesser interventions in the forex market by the central bank, bolstered the national economy. Even the over-appreciation episode in early 2007, generated by massive capital inflows following Romania’s accession to the EU, was corrected via autonomous forex market movements. We may state that, at present, there are no significant pressure-inducing factors in relation to the exchange rate in terms of 2 BIS Review 162/2008 
appreciation or depreciation, despite the temporary two way movements caused by global financial market turmoil. However, the foreign exchange market has come into balance in the context of a policy mix featuring a restrictive monetary policy, with high interest rates, an insufficiently tight fiscal policy, subject to further pressures to increase public spending, concurrently with the drop in incomes, whereas pay rises have been in excess of productivity gains for a long time. This policy mix is unsustainable. One could hardly speak about long-run forex market equilibrium, even though in the nearer term, high interest rates may offset the effects of other policies. Nonetheless, it is clear that exchange rate stability in the context of worsening competitiveness of the Romanian products, following the increase in wages faster than that in productivity, leads inevitably to widening trade deficit and ultimately to exchange rate depreciation. Should this occur, I would not be surprised to hear voices blaming the central bank for this outcome, without trying to identify the actual, deep reasons behind the unfavourable developments.  Therefore, both subdued inflation and exchange rate stability are strongly related to the coherence of the policy mix adopted by the authorities. In particular, the run-up to elections laid the groundwork for making empty promises and even for adopting pieces of legislation that are likely to have a significant impact on macroeconomic equilibria. In this case, the NBR’s task is to identify major risks arising from the implementation of ill-designed policies. Unfortunately, credibility is hard to gain, but easy to lose. Losing credibility can have more severe effects than, let us say, the temporary government deficit widening. The world economy is facing tremendous difficulties. I express my confidence that, the coordinated and appropriate policies of the most developed international economies will help prevent a crisis similar in size to that of 1929-1933. It is beyond any shadow of a doubt that this period will have a decisive impact on the world economic model. During such hard times worldwide, it is necessary, now more than ever, that the Romanian authorities should exert caution and wisdom as concerns both public spending and specific promises. The run-up to elections is usually a period when hard to keep promises are easily made. At present, however, despite the most difficult international economic conditions in the post-war period, the pre-election public promises seem far more unrealistic. I would like to reiterate the fact that the NBR policies focus on the euro adoption in 2014. In the medium run, we envisage not only the resumption of disinflation and bringing price hikes in line with the European standards, but also the alleviation of imbalances, especially the gradual narrowing of external deficit, in order to render disinflation sustainable. In terms of monetary policy, it is crucial to foster savings with a view to narrowing the current gap in relation to investment. The increased contribution of the domestic component, amid the rise in saving ratio, can ensure the same high investment rate. In fact, the increase in interest rates, which is part of the current monetary policy stance, was aimed at fostering savings. The results are visible, even though – for statistical reasons – the NBR calculations appear to give a different picture. In order to avoid possible confusions, allow me to present several technical details. The data released indicate a faster dynamics of demand deposits compared to time deposits, apparently hinting at the emergence of additional inflationary pressures. We are dealing in fact with two developments related to statistical evidence rather than real economic substance. One such development is the transfer, since 2007, of forex-denominated demand deposits from “quasi-money”, which is part of M2, into M1 (narrow money). This is merely a matter of compliance with EU definitions. The economic substance has not changed: the Romanians do not resort to foreign currency accounts for current transactions, but rather as a means of saving. Another development weighs heavier and it is also manifest in the case of forex-denominated current accounts, while being extremely significant from a quantitative perspective for RON-BIS Review 162/2008 3 
denominated ones. Since deposit accounts are subject to income tax, while current accounts are not, banks have developed a way to attract customers: current accounts whose yields are higher than deposit rates. This led to massive portfolio shifts to the detriment of traditional deposits, as households placed their savings in the so-called current accounts, or even card accounts, which are highly remunerated conditional upon maintaining a balance higher than a certain floor. Central bank experts have adjusted the figures based on the assumption that actual demand accounts should see a growth similar to that of currency in circulation, as it was the case in previous years. Hence, it would appear that quasi-money rose over 80% December 2004 through August 2008 versus only 40% as indicated by statistical data. In other words, both household and corporate savings in domestic currency expanded at a pace much faster than that of time deposits. These statistics led the media to comment on a would-be stalemate in RON-denominated savings. The NBR specialists will make sure these developments are explained in further detail. This is how a fiscal policy slippage entails both a contraction in budget revenues and potential errors in assessing monetary developments. Given the heightened turbulences on the international financial markets in the last few weeks and the fact that the NBR is vigilantly monitoring these developments, I believe we should refer to their potential impact on the domestic financial system and on the Romanian economy as a whole. The Romanian banking sector is still affected mainly by increased external financing costs. The limited impact is due to domestic financial environment characteristics, as well as to the prudential monetary policy and financial stability strengthening measures adopted by the central bank over the years. Let me highlight the most important of these measures. First and foremost, credit institutions in Romania do not have exposures to subprime instruments, which lie at the root of the turmoil. This is particularly due to the profitability given by wide interest rate margins on the domestic market as well as to the fast-paced increase in lending via traditional banking products. Secondly, the overwhelming majority of banks operating in Romania, including those with foreign capital, are legal entities subject to NBR licensing, regulation and prudential supervision. Similarly to foreign bank branches having their main office in other EU Member States, these banks abide by the Basel II prudential and capital adequacy standards. Thirdly, some regulations issued by the National Bank of Romania have often proved more restrictive than the Basel II standards. More specifically, initial capital requirements for licensing a credit institution in Romania are almost twice as much as the minimum level laid down in EU regulations. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the NBR representatives are part of the competent EU structures involved in the review and improvement of EU regulations governing the financial system architecture. Last but not least, the minimum reserve requirement ratios are still high at 20% on RON-denominated liabilities with maturities of up to 2 years and 40% on foreign currency-denominated liabilities. In addition to their contribution to curbing credit expansion, reserve requirements also play a prudential role in credit institutions maintaining an adequate liquidity level. Finally, let me point out the measures recently taken by the central bank with a view to ensuring sustainable credit growth in the longer-run. These measures are all the more useful amid the persistent turbulences on global financial markets. As a matter of fact, liquidity in the credit institutions sector in Romania – albeit relatively on the wane compared to previous years – is at a comfortable level to guarantee smooth market functioning, while the NBR has the necessary tools and mechanisms available to ensure liquidity in line with the applicable European norms. All of the above are an indication that the domestic banking system runs a relatively limited risk of contagion amid the persistent turmoil on world financial markets. However, adverse 4 BIS Review 162/2008 
effects may become manifest in Romania as well, among which: (i) more pronounced exchange rate volatility, following the trend seen by other countries in the region, given the increased risk aversion of investors on emerging markets, (ii) still rising costs of external financing and a decline in its volume, (iii) the likely moderation in the volume of autonomous capital inflows and the possible early repatriation of capital gains, (iv) potentially flagging demand for Romanian exports amid downward growth prospects in the other EU Member States. The National Bank of Romania will continue to carry out its mandate with utmost vigilance as regards both price stability and safeguarding financial stability. Allow me now to conclude by reiterating that the objective of joining the euro area in 2014 is within reach. By pursuing appropriate policies, the authorities could also meet the objective of rapidly raising the standards of living. However, breaking the fundamental equilibria through inadequate measures does not entail more welfare. On the contrary, it may put both real and nominal economic convergence in jeopardy. The strategic objective of euro adoption in 2014 is equally at risk. BIS Review 162/2008 5 
Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj: Impact of the current global financial crisis on Bahrain’s economy  Address by His Excellency Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, at the BCCI Seminar “Impact of the Current Global Financial Crisis on Bahrain’s Economy”, Manama, 18 November 2008. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen: I would like to thank the Chamber of Commerce and Industry for their kind invitation to speak to you at today’s Seminar. The topic that they have chosen, “Impact of the Current Global Crisis on Bahrain’s Economy” is very timely. Until only a month or so ago, many commentators and analysts believed that the economies of the GCC would be an oasis of calm in the on-going financial turmoil. We also tended to hear a great deal about the so-called “decoupling” thesis. This was the idea that the emerging economies would continue their recent strong growth despite the economic downturn in Europe and the United States. However, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September, it has become clear that no part of the world will be immune to the current crisis.  What began in September of last year as a crisis in the US real estate market – the so-called “sub-prime” crisis – earlier in this year turned into what we began to call the “Credit Crunch.” The losses that US and European banks suffered as the result of their exposure to sub-prime assets reduced their capital and hence their ability to lend. This sharply reduced the availability of credit in Europe and the US, while at the same time both corporate and household borrowers attempted to de-leverage – that is, to reduce the amount of debt outstanding on their balance sheets. This was the situation that the world economy and financial system was facing until the middle of September. It pointed to a global economic slowdown, but the worst effects would be concentrated in the developed markets. The emerging economies were expected to continue their recent strong growth. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September moved the financial crisis into a new and much more unpredictable phase. The immediate effect was a scramble for liquidity in the main international financial centres, and by the large international banks. There was a massive rise in risk aversion in financial markets, reflected in a variety of indicators, including a rise in risk premiums – the margin that financial intermediaries demand for holding riskier assets – and steep falls in global stock markets. Even in the GCC the crisis has begun to have an impact. Although the GCC countries enjoy strong fundamentals, this has not shielded them from the crisis. Several have experienced significant stock market corrections. Some GCC members have needed to provide support to their banking sectors, either in the form of recapitalization funds, or by providing blanket guarantees of deposits, or by a combination of both. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that investment projects are being delayed or scaled back. In the immediate term the CBB’s objective has been to ensure that Bahrain’s banking system remains on a sound footing. We receive daily reports from the banks of their liquidity positions, and weekly reports of their exposures. We have also encouraged them to bring forward the disclosures of their third quarter results, many of which have now been published. In the longer term the Global Financial Crisis contains many lessons for both regulators and the financial industry. In particular, it helps to underscore the need for sound risk BIS Review 162/2008 1 
management, effective internal controls and strong corporate governance at financial institutions. All of these elements are essential to ensure the stability of individual financial institutions and of financial systems. The role of the regulator in addressing these challenges is crucial. We can provide the guidance and create the appropriate regulatory framework to enable the sound and stable conduct of financial services and financial institutions. The 6-volume CBB Rulebook is at the very core of our regulatory development and enhancement programme. The importance of sound corporate governance is one issue brought to prominence by the recent global financial turmoil. As Alan Greenspan acknowledged last month in testimony to the United States Congress, an important cause of the crisis was the failure of internal monitoring and control in financial firms. He had assumed, he said, that shareholders in financial firms had adequate incentives to ensure that the firms they owned did not take excessive risks. As shareholders have subsequently found out, risk taking that goes wrong can be very costly to them.  However, Greenspan acknowledged, his assumption turned out to be flawed. Shareholders did not act to prevent excessive risk-taking. The conclusion is clear. If firms lack the incentives for adequate self-regulation then the regulator must step in. This is the aim of our Rulebook requirements on corporate governance and internal controls.  The financial crisis also points to the need for high standards of risk management in financial firms. Improving the risk management practices of banks was an important component of the work already being undertaken by the Central Bank before the financial crisis, and as a result of the crisis we plan to step up our efforts. In late 2007 we directed all locally-incorporated banks to carry out internal risk management assessments. The initial reports indicated that Bahraini banks have good internal control systems overall. We have also required all locally-incorporated banks to submit risk concentration policy documents. We carried out a review of all banks’ policies and risk limits in the summer of 2008, and we are in the process of notifying all banks with observed deficiencies or gaps to address these matters by the end of the year. A particular issue for risk concentration concerns the extent to which banks are exposed to the real estate sector. Since 2005, we have required banks to report their exposure to the sector in order that we can discuss real estate concentrations by individual banks, and to monitor the system’s overall exposure to real estate.  Since late 2007, we have been consulting with the local banks on measures to limit their exposure to the real estate sector. We have issued three consultation papers on real estate with regard to setting formal rules in due course. We have also increased the regulatory risk weighting to real estate to 200% to act as a regulatory constraint on excessive real estate expansion. Regulation that limits banks’ risk taking will never be universally popular. Some shareholders might see it as reducing their ability to make profits, at least in the short-term. But as Alan Greenspan’s admission clearly indicates, the pursuit of short-term profitability without regard to the risks that it involves is in no one’s interest – particularly not the interests of the shareholders themselves. I should emphasize, however, that it is not the regulator’s job to protect shareholders against excessive risk-taking. Shareholders are the providers of risk capital and should expect to share in losses when risk-taking goes wrong. Instead, we aim to limit risk taking because our responsibility is to protect a bank’s depositors against losses. Depositors are a special category of a bank’s creditors for two main reasons. Bank deposits are the main form of savings for many people, especially the less wealthy. Bank deposits are also money, and the insolvency of a bank – especially a large one – can have serious economic side effects by sharply reducing the supply of money and credit to the economy. 2 BIS Review 162/2008 
Because of their importance to both individual savers and to the wider economy, bank deposits are subject to a special form of protection in the event that a bank becomes insolvent. This protection is usually referred to as deposit insurance. In Bahrain we have had a deposit insurance system for some years. Until now this has protected deposits up to a maximum of 75% of BD15,000. It is also what is know as an “ex-post” funded scheme in that the required funds can be collected from the other banks only after a bank has already failed. This takes time, and one of the lessons of the recent financial crisis is that it is important that depositors should be compensated promptly after their bank fails. Reflecting the lessons of the financial crisis, and also the recent development of international best practice standards on deposit insurance, the Central Bank is in the process of finalizing a new regulation on reform of the existing deposit protection arrangements. The purpose of this reform will be to establish a pre-funded scheme. This will be a scheme in which a fund of money is accumulated in advance of the scheme needing to make any payouts to depositors. The fund will be accumulated by regular contributions from the banks that are members of the scheme. The purpose of all the measures I have described to you is to ensure that Bahrain’s financial system remains sound, stable and able to provide the credit that the domestic economy needs. Sometimes these measures might lead to complaints from particular sectors or groups that their access to credit is being impeded, but as a central bank we need to take a broader view of the overall stability of the system. It would be in no one’s interests to allow banks in Bahrain to take excessive risks. A sound banking system is one in which firms are well-diversified, have many different revenue sources, and do not concentrate their risks in one particular economic sector. This is one of the most important lessons we can draw from the financial crisis. Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 162/2008 3 
Denny H Kalyalya: Expansion of Zambia’s banking sector Remarks by Dr Denny H Kalyalya, Deputy Governor-Operations of the Bank of Zambia; at the official opening of Bank of China’s new premises, Lusaka, 9 December 2008. *      *      * •Honourable Minister of Finance and National Planning, Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane, MP;•His Excellency – the Chinese Ambassador to the Republic of Zambia; Mr. Li Qiangmin;•Managing Director of the Bank of China (Zambia) Limited; Mr Du Qiang;•Distinguished Invited Guests;•Ladies and Gentlemen.I am greatly honoured for having been invited to speak on the occasion of the official opening ceremony of Bank of China’s new premises. Ladies and Gentlemen As part of the on-going Zambia-Chinese relationship, the Bank of China was established in 1997. Since then the Bank has recorded tremendous progress. Distinguished Invited Guests During the past 8 years, the overall financial performance and condition of the banking sector has been satisfactory. The sector has continued to expand and we anticipate increased economic and investment activity in the period ahead. Banks are expected to continue to provide the required level of finance to consolidate the economic gains registered so far. The Bank has achieved tremendous growth since its inception in 1997. During the last eleven years, total assets have increased by 325% to K507.9 billion in October 2008 from K13.8 billion in December 1997. Regulatory capital increased by about 1,000% to K41.9 billion in October 2008 from K3.8 billion December 1997. Similarly, the bank’s profitability has steadily increased over the years. The Bank has been a good supporter of a number of economic activities in Zambia, especially in the mining, textile, construction, banking and agriculture sectors. However, going forward, we wish to encourage the Bank to invest more in loans and advances, which have remained low at 4% of total assets as at end of October 2008 compared to the industry average of 45%. Ladies and Gentlemen The new offices being commissioned today should enhance the Bank’s service delivery to its customers. We therefore wish to encourage the Bank to continue playing an active and effective role in stimulating economic activity through the provision of well structured financial products and services. Thus, boost growth in key sectors of the economy as well as enhancing access to finance and encourage more indigenous Zambians to establish relationships with the Bank. It is our expectation also that the Bank will expand beyond one branch and broaden its customer base and operations swiftly in order to consolidate the gains that have been achieved over the last 11 years. I thank you for your attention. BIS Review 162/2008 1
Mugur Isărescu: 10 years since the launch of Ziarul Financiar Speech by Mr Mugur Isărescu, Governor of the National Bank of Romania, on the occasion of 10 years since the launch of Ziarul Financiar, Bucarest, 16 December 2008. *      *      * It is a great pleasure for me to be present at this special anniversary of Ziarul Financiar. The one-decade long presence of this prestigious economic daily newspaper overlapped a turbulent period in the history of Romania. Allow me to dwell for a while upon a series of events that occurred shortly after the release of the first issue of Ziarul Financiar. In the wake of the crises in Russia and Southeast Asia, Romania’s need for external financing was much more difficult to cover, while the then level of foreign currency reserves left the authorities with little room for manoeuvre. Back then, the same as today, the rating agencies were extremely cautious in assessing Romania’s country risk, and according to the headlines disseminated obsessively by international agencies for over a year, Romania would have faced an imminent payment default. At that moment, the situation became even more complex due to the fact that the International Monetary Fund resorted to a new approach to indebted countries, called P.S.I. (private sector involvement) or “burden sharing”. This approach, which was tested in four countries including Romania, proved to be a failure, and the IMF later abandoned it. However, Romania had to choose between adjusting its external deficit by its own means or take foreign borrowings under unacceptable conditions. Romania adopted the former solution and subsequently signed an agreement with the IMF. Nevertheless, Standard&Poor’s, which had promptly downgraded Romania’s rating to one notch above a level which would have indicated external debt payment default – which had not occurred in the case of Romania – maintained this low rating for a long time, even after the crisis had been overcome band the country’s reserves had resumed growth. I reminisced this event that occurred ten years ago as I have been experiencing a particularly strong déjà-vu feeling during recent months. First came the bleak assessments of some foreign analysts, followed by the failed speculative attack against the RON. The next stage of the game was the downgrading of the sovereign rating to below investment grade, Romania being the only EU Member State in such a situation. Yesterday, I read another comment anticipating neither more nor less that Romania and Bulgaria risk a default on sovereign foreign debt payments even though most of the foreign debt stock is private. In order to underpin this viewpoint, the most far-fetched reasons are put forward, such as the cases of other countries in the region that concluded agreements with the IMF or the statement that the Bulgarian and Romanian currencies have depreciated against the US dollar, even though the Bulgarian currency is pegged to the euro and fluctuates against the US dollar at the same rate as the euro, while the RON is traded against the euro. To a certain extent, this approach is similar to that used during 1998-1999. There is however a fundamental difference, despite its being mentioned only occasionally, namely that Romania’s foreign exchange reserves are currently higher than its whole stock of public debt. Therefore, by implementing appropriate domestic policies, Romania is likely to move past this period in better conditions than in 1999. I strongly believe this for yet another reason: the past decade as a whole – covered together with Ziarul Financiar – marked significant progress for Romania. We should not overlook that our country witnessed economic growth in nine years out of ten, while annual GDP growth rates exceeded 5 percent in seven years out of ten. The three-digit inflation rates of the early ’90s dropped to single-digit levels in recent years. Moreover, Romania’s joining NATO and the European Union also places it in a political context underpinning sustainable economic growth. This year’s gross domestic product will BIS Review 161/2008 1 
amount to nearly EUR 140 billion, i.e. EUR 6,500 per capita. In 1999, Romania’s GDP stood at merely EUR 33 billion, while GDP per capita was lower than EUR 1,500. This leap, which led to significant changes including higher consumer standards, will have to be accompanied by similar progress in understanding economic issues, so that the path forward should be as smooth as possible. If we look at the long-term development of the Romanian society, the decade elapsed since the launch of Ziarul Financiar is a significant landmark, which can be compared with the significant upturn after World War I and the achievement of the Grand Union of 1918. At such turning points, the quantitative developments, which are nonetheless important, need to be accompanied by qualitative changes that are related to social philosophy as a whole, as well as to progress in national standards and values. From this perspective, the opinion-makers and the press in general play a major role. Economic newspapers in particular find themselves in a very special position. As a matter of fact, the National Bank of Romania has steadily promoted economic education and has done its best to raise journalists’ level of professionalism when approaching economic issues. Let us remember that Ziarul Financiar was launched ten years ago in the very Marble Hall of the NBR. Numerous occasions have arisen over the years when NBR representatives participated in events organised by Ziarul Financiar and vice versa. There has been a steadfast dialogue benefiting, in my opinion, both Ziarul Financiar journalists and central bank experts. And, if it is true that the central bank should not be confined to an ivory tower, it holds equally true that economic media should avoid slipping into cheap sensationalism, which only yields short-term gains. Eventually, the media should help its public take informed decisions, to the benefit of overall economic developments. I am well aware that shaping the public opinion is neither simple, nor linear. It is hard for a generation that has learnt that prices are formed by adding the planned benefit to the planned cost to grow accustomed to today’s reality, when price formation depends on demand and supply. Hence the greater difficulties faced by economic policymakers, analysts and the media alike. Disseminating – sometimes in good faith – the statements of certain market participants may equally generate confusion. For instance, let us recall that representatives of some edible oil producers claimed a few months ago that the price of their products would be on the rise, although this year’s market supply is several times higher than a year earlier. As it was normal, edible oil prices entered a downtrend which is likely to persist given the change in the supply-demand ratio. Another example is that of a businessman who said that weaker demand in a particular industry would entail higher prices in the producers’ attempt to safeguard their profits. This was another statement that did not receive an adequate response, so that the message conveyed to the market is that prices will rise no matter what. Another instance I would like to briefly refer to relates to the assertion of several colleagues from credit institutions, who claim that the NBR performed some sort of a trick in October 2008, making the liquidity in the banking system vanish. In other words, in its attempt to sanction those having orchestrated the speculative attack on the domestic currency, the central bank actually hit domestic credit institutions. Understanding the channels whereby RON-denominated liquidity moves about in the system is, indeed, quite complex and hence likely to easily generate confusion and twist the true meanings of words and actions. In fact, one cannot speak of a liquidity crunch as long as banks have complied with the 20 percent level of reserve requirements in both October and November (according to preliminary data). At most, relative decreases might occur temporarily relative primarily to corporate tax payments to the government budget. But even in such situations the NBR provides a lending facility, allowing immediate access to all banks capable of setting up the required collateral. The fact that some banks have not taken due care to set up a stock of government securities in a timely manner only means that the management of these credit institutions has decided 2 BIS Review 161/2008 
to take chances for higher profit and increased market share. However, it is often the case that taking chances does not necessarily bring profit alone. The role of specialised media in grasping the actual dimensions of the phenomena under review is equally important. Furthermore, a specialised newspaper boasting the strength and the prestige of Ziarul Financiar has the obligation to judiciously calibrate any piece of information with an analysis of its significance. For instance, the media have adopted a bleak, sometimes apocalyptic, tone these past few days amid an abundance of news alerts on the likely number of unemployed over the upcoming months, i.e. around 30,000 individuals. Of course, taken individually, anyone being made redundant is faced with a tough issue. However, from an economy-wide perspective, the rise in unemployment by 30,000 people only accounts for about 0.5 percent of the workforce. Coupled with the very low level of unemployment (3-4 percent) prior to the outbreak of the ongoing global recession, the economic analyst will conclude that unemployment is hardly a pressing issue in Romania for the time being. On the other hand, it is equally true that the short-term outlook for the domestic economy is not and cannot be too favourable. To the bleak international environment added what we may also call the irrational exuberance of both markets and, on many occasions, state authorities. In my opinion, the mixture between a hostile external environment and what seems to be an inadequate domestic response to this environment stands out as the underlying reason for which rating agencies have downgraded, sometimes rather severely, our sovereign rating. Of course, we may voice our discontent with the rating agencies’ evaluation. At times, rating agencies themselves have facilitated our criticism. Indeed, I find it hard to understand how an earnest rating agency might assess sovereign risk without even referring to that country’s level of public debt and international reserves. As a professor, I can safely assume that the “subject is not treated”, hence the conclusion is unsubstantiated. As concerns these assessments, I must say however that things are not in the least that simple. Of course, we could assert that at present our economy is in a better position than those of other countries in the region rated within the “investment grade” range. But those countries have at least adopted austerity measures at domestic level. How do things stand in our country? After two consecutive years of wage increases in a range from 20 percent to 25 percent per year – i.e. more than twice the labour productivity gains – the wage rises envisaged for 2009 ranged between 50 percent and 60 percent, whereas the agreements with the trade unions, whenever struck, do not provide for hikes lower than 35 percent. Such an approach reveals a dangerous decoupling between aspirations and reality. In the current international context and given the already dangerously high level of external deficit, we must not aim at further increases in domestic consumption above labour productivity gains, since there are no more financing sources for something like that. And unless we understand this state of affairs ourselves, rating agencies are going to warn us. And if we act so as to reach wage agreements and even compile laws that are not backed by real economic resources, and if demand – potential at this moment – becomes real and immediate, we might witness some of the worst effects possible. The wage rise will not bring about a higher living standard – on the contrary, all the accomplishments made in terms of economic stability, investment expansion and growth potential over the past years might dissipate very easily. As I have already stated before the Parliament of Romania, should the improvement of the living standard boil down to a matter of willingness and political decisions, there would no longer be poor countries anywhere in the world. It is true that the economic press tackles this issue in a balanced manner. The economic press evolved significantly over the past decade. Now we have dedicated publications, even dedicated TV channels, a financial analysts’ market, which is ultimately indicative of a mature Romanian society. I would even dare say that economic journalists and analysts are generally more connected to reality than most decision-makers. BIS Review 161/2008 3 
I must be very clear about one thing: Romania has no alternative to adjusting domestic demand in order to visibly cut down external deficit. I know how painful this is and I am well aware of the difficulties that every government encounters in putting this measure into practice. I was head of government during the critical period of 1999-2000 and I know exactly how difficult it is to adjust domestic consumption, even by two percentage points of GDP only. This time, the difficulty posed by the adjustment will be perceived as rather big, because it must be accomplished after several years of significant increases in consumption. The trend seemed to go on forever, which led to the decoupling between aspirations and real possibilities to fulfil them. Therefore, it is adequate to adjust domestic demand sooner rather than later, as long as we still enjoy a marked economic growth, given that at this point adjustment implies only resizing and not amputation. An essential issue that the Romanian society must solve without delay refers to what should be adjusted first: consumption or investment. I realise that we must ponder on this matter. The question is whether we should opt for buying an increasing number of cars or set aside resources in order to build the adequate road infrastructure. In a few years, the former choice could lead us to a total traffic jam, and the only additional consumption left for us could be that of carbon monoxide released by the exhaust pipes. This example is not only metaphorical. We can see everywhere that the imbalance between domestic consumption and saving, as an investment financing resource, is already posing serious problems, both to the economy as a whole and to citizens – whose true living standard is paradoxically amputated precisely as a result of the imbalance between consumption and investment. The current state-of-affairs is undoubtedly a critical one and therefore the adjustment of domestic demand cannot be delayed. It is not my intention to dramatise or to give any unjustified warning. But, as I have pointed out on other occasions as well, either we will proceed to a soft landing via wise domestic policies or we will face an adjustment triggered from outside, by the external capital market, and in this case the adjustment will be neither smooth nor reasonably sized. I have only one thing to add to my previous statements on this topic: the international context no longer leaves too much time for hesitations. I would like to end on an optimistic note. As a matter of fact, Ziarul Financiar has adopted more often than not a positive note, which I wish it can keep unaltered. With you by my side, I have confidence in our country’s future. And I wish, as much as you do, that wisdom prevail in front of impatience, and that the risk of a severe slippage fail to materialise in the forthcoming months. With these thoughts, I wish the best of luck to all the editors of Ziarul Financiar as well as professionalism in dealing with the difficult economic issues to all the economic media. 4 BIS Review 161/2008 
Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj: Prospects for the Islamic financial industry against the background of the current global financial turmoil Keynote address by His Excellency Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, at the AAOIFI-World Bank Annual Conference on Islamic Banking and Finance, Manama, 10 November 2008. *      *      * Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a pleasure to participate in the Opening Ceremony of this Conference and in the Graduation Ceremony for the “Certified Shari’a Adviser and Auditor”, and “Certified Islamic Professional Accountant’ programmes. In addition to congratulating the graduating students, I should like to thank the many distinguished speakers who will be appearing during the Conference, as well as the event organisers. Particular thanks are due to the World Bank for their support for this event. Against the background of the current global financial turmoil, it appears good time to take stock of the prospects for the Islamic financial industry. In recent months, as the global financial crisis has deepened, there have been many commentators who have pointed to the relative success of the Islamic financial sector. So far, Islamic financial institutions have escaped relatively unscathed from the severe downturn which is affecting most conventional financial institutions. This certainly presents the industry with an opportunity to continue its successful growth of recent decades. Because interest-based transactions are prohibited, Islamic finance encourages business and trade activities that generate fair and legitimate profit. The prohibition on speculative activity also helps to ensure that there is a close link between financial flows and productive activities. These intrinsic properties of Islamic finance contribute towards insulating it from the potential risks resulting from excess leverage and speculative financial activities. But while Islamic financial institutions have been largely sheltered from the present crisis, there is no room for complacency. It is inevitable that they will be affected to some degree, as they are part of the wider global economic system. The effects of the global financial crisis on the real economy has the potential to transmit shocks to Shari’a compliant institutions as well. This means that there must be a very high priority placed on sound management and risk management practices at Islamic financial institutions. As I have pointed out in the past, the sensational growth of the industry in recent years, combined with high levels of liquidity, has meant that Islamic banks have not needed to fight for funding or ideas. New entrants to the industry have merely tended to copy the strategies they see being successfully pursued by their more established rivals. As a result, a very high percentage of Islamic banks have a strategy that is heavily weighted towards real estate and asset finance. The downturn in global economic conditions will provide these business models with a stern test. Project-driven business strategies will be affected by the reduction in global liquidity and the slowing of global economic growth. Islamic financial institutions will need to plan and prepare for these more challenging operating conditions. The industry needs to respond to this challenge by developing a greater diversity of business models, more diverse and stable income sources, and more rigorous risk management and stress testing techniques to assess its preparedness to deal with any downturn in economic activity. The essential consideration in Islamic finance, as in all forms of finance, is to find the right balance between business development and risk management. There are certain measures BIS Review 161/2008 1 
that the Central Bank of Bahrain can take to assist Islamic financial institutions in this process. We have recently launched an Islamic Sukuk liquidity instrument, which is a repurchase agreement that enables financial institutions, both conventional and Islamic, to access short-term liquidity against the Government of Bahrain Ijara Sukuk. At the same time, however, the primary responsibility for sound risk management and control resides with the firms themselves. The principles and standards developed by AAOIFI provide Islamic financial institutions with a sound basis on which to manage their activities. Those of you today, who are graduating with the qualification of “Certified Shari’a Adviser and Auditor”, and “Certified Islamic Professional Accountant”, will be at the forefront of Islamic financial institutions’ ability to manage, monitor and control their risks in the future. There is a continuing need for high quality human resources in the industry. Islamic banking has been growing so fast that it has been difficult for institutions to find enough skilled or qualified staff. This is why the CBB has participated with Islamic institutions in Bahrain in setting up the Waqf Fund to provide financial and technical support in upgrading training programmes and introducing new ones. We are now beginning to see a larger number of financiers qualified in Shari’a related subjects and this can only be to the benefit of the Islamic finance industry. The two courses which are graduating today, are both challenging study programmes, and congratulations belong first and foremost to those students who have successfully completed them. Doing so has required hard work and commitment. It is an achievement to be proud of, and one that I am sure will serve you in good stead, as you further develop your professional careers. Let me conclude by wishing the graduating students all the best in their future careers, and to wish you all a very successful Conference. 2 BIS Review 161/2008 
W A Wijewardena: Scientific research – what researchers should do and should not  Keynote address by Mr W A Wijewardena, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the 3rd International Research Conference, organized by the Faculty of Management & Finance, University of Colombo, Colombo, 11 December 2008. The views expressed in this paper are those of the author and should not be construed as those of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. *      *      * A Master Debater has once boasted that he normally employs three ploys to subdue his difficult customers. “When I find that my opponent is not easily surmountable, I use mathematics, philosophy and religion to subdue him”. He has confessed. “Mathematical equations frighten him, philosophical expressions confuse him and religious sayings make him feel guilty. After that, he is an easy prey for the final onslaught”. He has further elaborated triumphantly. The superior property of mathematical equations in frightening intellectual opponents is not without precedent. An example in this connection has been presented by Astro-physicist Carl Sagan in his Broca’s Brain (p. 151). According to the story, the French encyclopaedist Diderot, being an atheist himself, had challenged anyone to prove the existence of God during a visit to Russian Empress Catherine’s court. When he became an embarrassment to everyone, Euler, the master mathematician and also a temporary visitor to the Court, is said to have accepted the challenge. Euler has said, “Sir, (a + bn)/n = x, therefore God exists. Disprove”. The mathematics-phobic Diderot, being unable to respond, is said to have fled the Court! These examples suggest that people can sometimes use gimmicks to confuse opponents and win arguments. Such winnings do not prove or disprove any proposition. They do not add knowledge to the extant body of knowledge. They simply help a crafty person to make a temporary escape from an existing difficult situation.  Scientific research is different from the employment of gimmicks to gain temporary winnings. It is the method of using human intellect to discover new knowledge and add that wisdom to the existing body of knowledge until it is disproved by a new discovery. Hence, those who are engaged in scientific research have to conform to a set of accepted principles, guidelines and a code of ethics and morality. To follow such a set of rules when playing the game called scientific inquiry is not an easy task. Yet, one has to do so in order to separate science from what is sometimes known as pseudo-science. Why scientific research? Human knowledge is as old as the history of human beings. Human beings have attempted to understand Nature, by using human intellect and experience, so that they could find answers to questions that had been puzzling them constantly. Some of these questions have been beyond direct observation such as “who created the world?” or “what caused rains?”. Hence, it is quite natural for them to hypothesise answers by using both intellect and experience. When they do so, it is also inevitable for them to base their conclusions on personal biases, fears and prejudices they have been harbouring in their minds. Such conclusions are tainted by biased or prejudiced views held by the person making the conclusions. Hence, such findings are simply an imposition of personal views on the society and, therefore, fail to explain reality and Nature. Therefore, discoveries made in that manner do not enhance the human knowledge. In this background, it is necessary to build the knowledge base of mankind free from biases, fears and prejudices. This could be attained by pursuing scientific inquiry which bases itself on a set of principles, guidelines and an ethical and moral code that discipline the BIS Review 161/2008 1 
researchers. It should, however, be noted that the conclusions derived through scientific inquiry are not static and permanent. The very nature of scientific inquiry is that conclusions derived from a given research study, as Karl Popper pointed out, should be capable of being refuted by a new inquiry. Hence, results produced by scientific research carry with them the property of refutability and are valid only until a new research study would replace them with new results. In this sense, the knowledge base developed through scientific inquiry could be equated to a reservoir from which water would flow out and fresh water would flow in continuously. But the core knowledge, just like the permanently stored water in the reservoir, would remain intact. The mind of a researcher engaged in scientific inquiry There are certain qualities and prerequisites which a researcher engaged in scientific inquiry should possess. The most important of these is the open mind with which the researcher should commence his inquiry. The researcher is not a propagandist, nor is he a person bent on superimposing his views on others. He should be humble enough to reject even the views he would have held for long, if his inquiry does not support them. In other words, he should conduct his inquiry, not with the objective of establishing the views held by him, but with the objective of subjecting them to a free inquiry. This is known as rational and objective thinking. The Buddha, in a discourse He preached to members of Kalama clan, outlined the nature of rational and objective thinking, though its purpose was to guide them to distinguish good from bad. “Oh, Members of Kalama clan…” the Buddha said. “…Do not rely on an opinion because you have heard it often and you are familiar with it. Do not accept it because it is in accord with tradition or found in the scriptures or logical or conforms to theory. Do not accept it because it is preached by your teachers or by a respected priest” (Anguththara Nikaya). The researcher who plans to engage himself in scientific inquiry should be free from the influence of previous knowledge or the traditions and should not be guided by mere logical considerations. How could an individual understand the nature of the real world? There are two approaches suggested for this purpose, namely, classicism or romanticism. Classicism shows the world by means of its underlying form. It proceeds by reason or by laws governing Nature. If a motor car engine is presented to a classicist, he would be interested in finding out its underlying mechanism as determined by mechanical laws governing the working of the engine. A romantic, on the other hand, would simply be interested only on the outer surface of the world. He would look at the world from the point of its immediate appearance. Hence, a romantic would find a motor car engine with wires and cables strewn everywhere in a disorderly manner as a dull appearance.  A person with a scientific mind would get himself embroiled in classicism and not in romanticism. This is because romanticism is concerned about emotions – feelings like biases, fears or prejudices which a scientist should avoid when undertaking a scientific inquiry. What is scientific method? Robert M Pirsig, the philosopher-novelist, in his novel titled Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, raises a very pertinent question regarding scientists and scientific inquiry. Is a sideway motorcycle mechanic a scientist? The answer depends on how the motorcycle mechanic would apply himself to the problem at hand. According to Pirsig, if a motorcycle mechanic does a lousy job, then he does not qualify himself to be called a scientist. There are many mechanics of this type. When a faulty motorcycle is brought to a mechanic, he may simply jump to conclusions based on his 2 BIS Review 161/2008 
previous knowledge. Instead of subjecting the motorcycle to a thorough scientific inquiry, he may conclude that the fault lies in a certain part or a certain mechanism. To reach this conclusion, he has not gathered the relevant information. The chances are that he may be correct or may not be correct. If he is correct, the repair performed on the basis of the diagnosis made with imperfect information will prove to be a success. But the mechanic in that case has behaved like a speculator and the outcome of speculation may have the chance of being a success or a failure. If it turns out to be a failure, the cost to the owner of the motorcycle would be enormous. In that case, since the correct repair has not been performed, the motorcycle will continue to remain faulty. Hence, a true scientist engaging himself in scientific inquiry should not be a speculator. Instead, he should be a person willing to follow the scientific method to arrive at conclusions. Decisions could be made by a mechanic attending to a faulty motorcycle by resorting to either inductivism or deductivism. The inductive approach requires the mechanic to look for evidence in the real world and come to conclusions. For instance, if we see crows that are black and if we continue to see black crows, we may conclude that all crows are black. A motorcycle mechanic may likewise see the faulty part and conclude that the fault lies in that part. The deductive approach, on the other hand, requires the mechanic to theorise in his mind and come to conclusions based on empirical findings he would make to support his theory. In the previous black crow example, we may theorise that crows are black and then look for black crows in the real world. When we find one black crow, our theory is proved. A motorcycle mechanic becomes a scientist, if he follows the scientific method in the diagnosis of the fault and the subsequent repair of the motorcycle. It involves starting with an open mind. There are no previously made conclusions or prejudgments. The approach is simply classical, that is, guided by underlying principles and not by the immediate appearance. There are several steps which a scientist should follow when he adopts the scientific method. A good motorcycle mechanic would also follow the same steps.  The steps involved in a scientific inquiry are as follows.  First, the identified problem has to be stated in clear terms. In the case of a motorcycle, the problem may be that the engine does not start. Second, based on the problem, one hypothesis or several hypotheses as required regarding the cause of the problem should be made. The motorcycle engine does not start because there is no fuel in the tank. Or there is a blockage of the tube that distributes fuel to the engine. Or the electrical system may have failed. Or carburettor would have been blocked. The mechanic would hypothesise all possible reasons for the failure of the engine. Third, experiments are designed to test each hypothesis made. The mechanic may open the fuel tank to see whether there is fuel. If there is no fuel, he will try to start the engine having filled the tank with fuel. If there is fuel in the tank, then he would examine the second hypothesis, that is, whether there is a blockage in the tube that distributes fuel to the engine. If there is a blockage, he will clean it and try to start the engine. If there is no blockage, then he would experiment the third hypothesis, namely, the working of the electrical system. In this manner, he would experiment all the hypotheses he has made one by one and make relevant conclusions. Fourth, the results of the experiments are analysed in order to ascertain whether the hypothesis is proved. Or else, when several hypotheses have been made, to ascertain which hypothesis has been proved. Fifth, making final conclusions out of the observed results of the experiments.  A disciplined motorcycle mechanic would follow these steps involved in the scientific method and attend to the required repair of the fault in the motorcycle. In this sense, a sideway motorcycle mechanic is not different from a trained scientist, since both follow the scientific method in reaching conclusions. BIS Review 161/2008 3 
The use of techniques and technology It has been fashionable for scientists to make use of scientific techniques and technology to facilitate the decision making process, when undertaking scientific inquiries. Extreme care should be exercised by scientists in this instance. Every technique has its own methodology and limitations and the scientist should be fully aware of same when such techniques are used. Inappropriate use of the techniques or wrong conclusions made on the basis of the results derived amount to misuse of science by the researchers. It also paves way for crafty individuals to use the results to their advantage and gullible individuals to get victimised.  The use of econometrics has been one of the techniques employed by scientists to prove or disprove their hypotheses. This has also been one of the sources of misuse of science, either because wrong calculations are made or wrong conclusions are arrived at, due to the failure of the researcher to analyse the error term appropriately. Wikipedia, the cyber-encyclopaedia, is full of the instances of such misuse of econometric methods in research. It is noteworthy to refer to two studies done by Deirdre N McCloskey and Stephen T Ziliak of the University of Iowa on the status of econometric studies in research articles published in the reputed journal American Economic Review in 1980s. They have found fault with authors for not analysing the error term properly and using the statistical term “significance” inappropriately. One of their papers published in the Journal of Economic Literature in March, 1996 under the title “The Standard Error of Regressions” has made the following eye-opening comment: “Such misuses of statistical significance appear to depend in part on a vintage effect, measured by date of Ph.D. conferral. The papers authored by Ph.D.s conferred between 1975 and 1979, when inexpensively generated t-tests first reached the masses, were considerably worse than the papers of others at making a distinction between economic and statistical significance. They used the word “significance” in ambiguous ways more often than did early or later Ph.D.s and they were less likely to separate statistical significance from other types of significance in the sections on scientific and policy implications” (p 111). The other findings of McCloskey and Ziliak are also startling. Of the 182 articles in the American Economic Review they have surveyed, 70 percent had not distinguished statistical significance from economic, policy or scientific significance. While they had referred to largeness of the estimators, 72 percent had not asked “how large was large?” At the same time, 59 percent had used the word “significance” in ambiguous ways. A more pronounced failure has been the non-reporting of descriptive statistics such as the means of the regression variables by 69 percent of the authors. (p 106).  The problem with econometric studies is that the computations made by authors remain as a “black box” to ordinary readers. It is the responsibility of the editors of journals to verify the black box and assure quality on behalf the general public who consumes the outcome of research studies. It is, therefore, disheartening that learned journals have published such papers without due reference and consideration of the methodology adopted in conducting the research under reference. Today, of course, with advanced statistical packages available, it is possible for the editors of the journals to check on the appropriateness of the statistical calculations made by the paper writers. Since the ordinary readers of scientific papers are unable to gauge the wrongful way of handling econometrics by researchers, such studies by editors before papers are published become all the more important. In view of the gullibility of general readers, the misuse of econometrics in learned papers is akin to “mis-selling” that one finds in the market place when a seller has not fully apprised a buyer of the risks of buying a product. This type of mis-selling by researchers could be termed “econometric dishonesty” which they are not supposed to practise. Researchers find a truth and not the truth The real world is vast and complex. Hence, it cannot be mapped out by scientific research adequately, just like neurologists are unable to map out the human brain completely. What 4 BIS Review 161/2008 
the science does is to discover only a flint of the truth in the vast real world. As such, there is no dearth of hypotheses which scientists could make and a dearth of theories which they can formulate. That is good news for prospective scientists. However, one theory which is valid today could be disproved by another theory to be formulated tomorrow. Hence, all theories are subject to the same property: the property of refutability. In fact, Karl Popper’s argument was that if a theory cannot be refuted, then it does not become a theory. Hence, any scientific research will discover only a truth and not the truth. This means that all scientific research studies undertaken in all the disciplines would produce only a relative truth and not the absolute truth. With all the scientific apparatuses, techniques and computing capacity available today, science still cannot reach out to the absolute truth. As such, the task of finding the absolute truth has been relegated to religion and mystics. This may be discouraging news for those who are engaged in scientific research. But, that has been the way of science throughout its history and such discovery of relative truth has been adequate for the purpose of building the human knowledge base and putting it to practical use by mankind. In the modern world, the discovery of absolute truth may therefore be irrelevant. Conclusions A researcher is not a propagandist or a dictator. His task is to follow an accepted set of principles, guidelines and an ethical and moral code to discover a truth, and not the truth, and add it to the extant knowledge base. He should start his inquiry with an open mind and be ready to reject even the long held views if empirical studies do not support them. But to do so, a researcher should display a fair degree of maturity and necessarily cultivate within himself self-discipline, wisdom, objectivity and equanimity. In this sense, a perfect researcher is like the Buddha who is not guided by biased or prejudiced emotions.  Hence, the most important requirement of a researcher is that he should be honest to himself.  BIS Review 161/2008 5 
Mario Draghi: Combating the global financial crisis – the role of international cooperation Text of the HKMA Distinguished Lecture by Mr Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy and Chairman of the Financial Stability Forum, Hong Kong, 16 December 2008. *      *      * Introduction It is an honour and a pleasure to be giving this HKMA distinguished lecture. I thank Joseph Yam for his kind invitation. I also thank Joseph and his colleagues at the HKMA for hosting the FSF Asia-Pacific Regional Meeting that has just concluded.  The crisis afflicting the global financial system has now reached a critical stage. On the one hand the combined responses of governments, central banks, regulatory authorities and the private sector have created a base of stability, admittedly still fragile, for the world financial system. On the other hand, the sharp slowdown in global growth will necessarily translate into credit losses that will have a further impact on the banking industry. To mitigate the recession and break this vicious circle a further round of responses – including fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies – is proving necessary. Shortcomings in assessment ahead of the crisis One striking aspect of the crisis is precisely how its unfolding has continued to catch both policy makers and private sector players by surprise. It started with defaults in a marginal segment of the financial services industry, then quickly spread to virtually all assets. From being a US-only event, it has become global, and in fact it is forcing and accelerating the redressing of world macro imbalances that have been with us for 15 years. The current recession is the result. None of these steps had been anticipated in a timely way by the relevant actors. And when I say “in a timely way” I mean with enough lead-time to permit action that could have affected the outcomes. Policies that were reactive, and sometimes even very effective, but never proactive, seem to have been the rule. This is of course not the approach to policy-making that we try to employ when it comes to controlling inflation or meeting other objectives of macroeconomic policy. One reason for this asymmetry is that our knowledge of all the interactions within the financial services industry in a global world was quite superficial at the beginning of the crisis. The private sector has not done any better. The immediate outcome of the private sector’s own shortcomings in assessment has been the sudden death of many businesses and a generalized credit contraction. Our collective understanding of these processes has certainly deepened during the last year but we do not yet have a conscious and fully-fledged view of how the financial sector will look in the years to come. Much of the effort has gone so far into initiatives to address the short-term and medium-weaknesses in the system, but now we may be approaching the time when it will be appropriate to start thinking about reconstruction. To do so, however, we first have to see when and how reality eluded our or the market’s perceptions ahead of the crisis. First, the underlying reason why problems in US subprime loans led to the current broad-based macrofinancial crisis was the global nature of exposures to increasing risk aversion and deleveraging. Risk is now priced and traded at the global level. Over the years preceding the crisis, the overall price of risk fell significantly, and risky, illiquid positions were accumulated in many different national and international markets. When problems emerged in the specific category of US subprime, this started a process which ultimately led to a BIS Review 160/2008 1 
repricing of risk across all asset classes. As Tim Geithner noted when he delivered this lecture two years ago, this pattern is not a new one: in times of financial crisis, when investors cut risk-taking, they cut it everywhere, and the differing fundamentals of individual markets become irrelevant. Second, many saw risks and leverage increasing, but an optimistic view that overestimated the true degree of risk dispersion and diversification in credit markets had become the conventional wisdom. In particular, even when it became apparent that credit standards had deteriorated, neither capital markets, nor bankers, nor regulators perceived the extent to which the risk exposures generated by securitisation stayed on bank balance sheets. Also we collectively overestimated the ability of the system to absorb, rather than amplify, pressure for de-risking and deleveraging. On another front, it was only once the crisis was underway that the world seems to have discovered the risks inherent in business models that relied excessively on wholesale funding markets, both for specific institutions and for the system. And, given that these risks were misunderstood at the domestic level, all the more so was this the case at the international level, where firms, investors and regulators were farther from the markets where these bad risks were originated. One way to explain this collective blindness is to review those market developments that, in the years leading to the crisis, made both the regulators’ and market’s knowledge suddenly obsolete, while increasing the opacity of the financial system as a whole. Let me give you a few examples.  • For the first time in recent years securitization was applied to lower quality mortgages. Monitoring by capital markets of this lower quality was made difficult by the fact that the probability of default did not factor in i) the probability of a drop in real estate prices in the US at the national level, which had not occurred since the Great Depression, ii) the effects of changes in lending standards on probabilities of default in these markets, or iii) the cross correlation across defaults and between defaults and the rest of the economy.  • Second, especially after 2004, the massive amount of issuance of collateralized obligations by a few players increased both the market power of these players over the credit rating agencies and their dependence on this source of revenue.  • Third, the SEC’s relaxation in 2004 of pre-existing limits on leverage for investment banks vastly increased the complexity of their risk management. For some time neither banks nor regulators seemed to have fully perceived how this decision would radically change the industry.  • Finally, the rapid growth of the CDS market, which in ten years went from zero to 44 trillion dollars in notional amounts, created an entirely new definition of counterparty risk that was much more difficult to assess, evaluate and collateralize. With the benefit of hindsight one may be tempted to say that regulators should have probed more deeply, for example, into the risk characteristics of triple-A rated super senior CDO tranches, and should have realised that the risk of a very sharp fall in the credit quality and market value of such instrument was much greater than that of a triple-A rated bond. And, since it is the responsibility of supervisors to be especially attentive to tail risks and extreme events, they should have required banks to make appropriate capital charges against these instruments. This might have been the right thing to do but, as the previous discussion has shown, the knowledge leading to that type of behaviour simply was not there.  There are many lessons that one should draw from the current crisis but one especially stands out for its general and all-encompassing character. In the future we will all be much more alert to the systemic implications of both market developments and of our own decisions, and this will have profound implications in many different ways. For one thing, financial innovation will not simply be welcomed for its narrow, specific benefits, as has been the case in the past, but it will be carefully scrutinized for its potential systemic risks. This 2 BIS Review 160/2008 
may well dampen the growth of the financial service industry, while enhancing its survival in the long term. Furthermore, it is no longer true that the threat to let a financial institution fail is the most effective weapon against moral hazard. When implications of defaults are systemic, and in a global world this is the case much more often than in the past, this threat is not credible to say the least. And with this goes our reliance on the financial system’s incentive to credibly regulate itself, unless we can find other mitigants of moral hazard that are immune to systemic implications. Finally, we as regulators have to take a closer look at ourselves, with a view to eliminating everything that contributes to our segmented perception of events in the financial system. Response to the crisis A financial crisis – an event in which the financial system fails at its core tasks, including allocating savings, financing investment, pricing assets, and transferring risk – poses difficult challenges to policy in terms of assessment and the calibration of responses. These tasks are difficult at the domestic level, and still more complex at the global level.  A critical set of challenges relate to information gaps. We have made progress in recent years in developing analytical tools and metrics for assessing risks ahead of a crisis. Unfortunately, almost by definition, a crisis involves events and processes that are unexpected. And once problems emerge, their dimensions and implications are impossible to gauge quickly. At the international level, assessment is more challenging still. Cross-border exposures are difficult to assess, and it is especially difficult to anticipate confidence effects, which are often the primary means of cross-border contagion.  Also, determining how to calibrate the response is a classic case of decision-making under limited information and uncertainty. There is no way to know either ex ante or ex post whether one made the right choice. A too hasty response in some countries may increase moral hazard in others. But, when we have reached the stage where a forceful response is needed, a delay by some countries in joining the others will dilute the impact of this response and delay prompt resolution.  In summary our own vastly imperfect knowledge and its segmented nature would have made a faster and more effective crisis response unlikely, since we were just learning what to do while the crisis unfolded. Under the circumstances, I think governments and central banks have been remarkably flexible and open-minded in developing and implementing creative responses to the conditions that we have faced.  We can identify four distinct areas where authorities have needed to act: funding liquidity pressures in interbank markets; solvency risks facing systemically important institutions; medium- and long-term measures to strengthen the system; and the slowdown in the macroeconomy. Each has featured a number of critical information gaps that have had to be overcome, and each has presented its own challenges in terms of international coordination.  Liquidity pressures were the primary focus of policymakers in the early stages of the crisis, starting in August 2007, and have remained a concern ever since. Central banks understood at an early stage that they needed to act, and act quickly, given the sudden and rapid rise in the market’s demand for liquid funds, an asset for which they are ultimately the only source of supply. Central banks initially focused on their own markets, but given cross-border confidence effects as well as the need for foreign currency liquidity in many markets, they rapidly developed a number of channels of cooperation, including coordinated policy announcements and foreign currency swap lines.  After the collapse of Lehman in September, the systemic nature of the crisis has manifested itself with unprecedented force. In financial markets, we have observed a rapid shift from liquidity to credit risks, from a prevalent recourse to the market and central banks to massive governments’ intervention. Responses have included varying combinations of deposit guarantees, debt guarantees, capital injections, and asset purchases. While these have BIS Review 160/2008 3 
varied with local conditions, the need for coordination is well understood, and work to make these responses consistent is well underway.  What have been the lessons of the experiences of recent months in dealing with the liquidity and solvency problems that have buffeted financial systems? For one thing, we have learned that in this new global risk environment the speed of developments has increased dramatically and correspondingly reduced the time that authorities have for an effective response. This has further increased our reliance on preventative measures ahead of a crisis. Second, we have learned that the international aspects of crisis response have become many times more important than before. The transmission of shocks across borders now happens through more diverse channels than even a few years ago. Given the many international externalities involved in the measures that might be taken by national authorities, the mechanisms for coordinating crisis response need to be in place well in advance. Plans need to be formulated and potential consequences must be thought through. Resolution procedures and bankruptcy arrangements also need to be harmonised better across markets.  Strengthening the system From the start of the current crisis, it has been clear that short-term measures to address liquidity and solvency have had to be complemented by actions to strengthen the system in the longer term. Just as there are critical externalities in short-term response measures that call for international coordination, these longer term actions have needed to address the cross-border effects of regulatory policies in order to assure the maintenance of a level playing field.  The work to strengthen global systemic resilience is proceeding with a degree of international cooperation and at a speed that would have been unthinkable only one year ago. In developing these initiatives, there has been a broad underlying consensus among authorities that the goal should be to create a financial system that is less leveraged, better capitalised, and more transparent, and that features stronger incentives for all participants in the system.  The FSF has proven to be an effective vehicle for coordinating these actions at the international level. Thanks to our broad sectoral membership, which encompasses finance ministries, central banks, top regulators, international institutions, international standard-setting bodies, and expert groupings, we are able to keep one another apprised of the risks facing different sectors and of our respective work programs. Importantly, our membership includes most of the key actors responsible for implementing the actions that we recommend. The willingness of our members to exchange information and views, and to alter and accelerate work programs, has been truly remarkable. However, the crisis has also pointed up the need for us to expand our membership geographically, particularly with respect to the larger emerging economies. This is an issue that we are working on very seriously and on which we expect to make progress soon. A first set of initiatives taken by the FSF has focused on reducing information gaps: in terms of the raw data available to authorities and the market; in terms of the mechanisms, such as credit ratings, through which this information is compiled and used by the market; and in terms of the analytical work we do in the official sector to assess risks and vulnerabilities in the system. Improved international accounting and disclosure practices should help markets and authorities understand risks and exposures better. Accounting standard setters have been taking important steps to address weaknesses in such areas as the valuation of illiquid securities and the treatment of off-balance sheet vehicles. Securities regulators have taken a number of actions intended to improve the role of credit ratings in the system, to clarify their appropriate use by investors and regulators, and to address concerns about conflicts of interest in the ratings process.  4 BIS Review 160/2008 
Closer collaboration between the IMF and FSF is one way that we in the global community hope to improve our ability to stay on top of risks in the future. A second set of initiatives has focused on prudential regulation and oversight. I believe strengthened capital and liquidity frameworks will be seen as a central achievement of the work to enhance systemic resilience. More capital will be required against trading and securitisation risks, and more intense oversight will be applied on liquidity risk management by banks. These improvements will be phased in carefully, so as not to exacerbate situations that are still fragile. Given the importance of preserving a level playing field, this work has necessarily been coordinated internationally. Third, the FSF has initiated different work streams directed at reducing procyclicality in the financial system, i.e. the tendency of the financial system to accumulate excessive risk and leverage in good times and to shed risks excessively in a downturn. Efforts are also underway to improve the incentives created by compensation systems in financial firms. Fourth, supervisors have agreed to cooperate more closely in overseeing internationally active banks, through such vehicles as supervisory colleges.  Finally, going forward, it will be crucial to review the perimeter of regulation, in order to reduce gaps and inconsistencies in regulatory regimes and to address potential systemic issues that are present in sectors currently not regulated. New challenges for macroeconomic policies While this structural response is clearly an essential part of the cure, as it helps to renew confidence in the markets, it is also clear that many of the measures we are taking or discussing will only have an impact over the medium term. This is in the very nature of a structural response, which is foremost concentrated on the regulatory framework. Today the immediate challenge we face is to avoid a situation where the recessive forces deepen and combine with the impairment of financial markets in creating a vicious spiral. Over the last few months, the outlook has quickly shifted from slowdown to recession, from supply to demand shock, and from inflation to deflation risks.  This new situation requires not only further and bolder actions, but also to step up the level of cooperation and common understanding between policy makers both at the national level and internationally. Let me briefly review the main challenges confronting the conduct of macroeconomic policies looking forward. Monetary policies Monetary policies in response to the drying up of global liquidity have been extremely responsive and fully cooperative. On October 8, coordination in the monetary field reached new heights, with the simultaneous reduction of interest rates in eight major central banks.  Since then official interest rates have been reduced in rapid and successive waves across the globe, responding to the deterioration of the economic outlook and the rapid receding of inflation. Today the margins for further action are rapidly shrinking particularly in the US and Japan where policy rates are close to their zero lower bound.  Rapidly falling inflation expectations and, in some areas, deflation risks, together with the impossibility of lowering rates below zero, pose the most challenging test for the effectiveness of monetary policies. We know that the inability to maintain sufficiently low real interest rates has aggravated crises in the past. At the start of the Great Depression, for example, short term real interest rates actually increased in the US (up to more than 10 per cent!) until 1933, because of the rapid fall in inflation. In the Japan of the “lost decade” short term real interest rates remained relatively high until 1995. Such developments have been often pointed to as key factors driving these economies into prolonged depression. BIS Review 160/2008 5 
The list of monetary policy instruments available to central banks to reflate the economy when official rates are close to or at zero is fairly wide. It includes:  • a “quantitative easing” policy, i.e. expanding the money base beyond what is strictly needed to keep the official rates at zero, in order to reduce liquidity risks and provide incentives for financial intermediaries to expand their credit (elements of this policy, amply used in Japan until recently, are visible in the exceptional actions of many central banks today);  • measures to reduce longer term interest rates, through direct purchase of long term government securities and/or carefully designed communication to influence market expectations (Bank of Japan and the Fed in 2002-03); and • the purchase of a wide range of private assets from securities to equity (as our guest, the HKMA, experienced during the Asian crisis ten years ago). As effective these unconventional monetary policy instruments may be in boosting the economy when price stability is at stake, we have to be aware of their limits and of their broader implications. First, the effects of many such policies are not well-known: the conduct of monetary policy is bound to be surrounded by much more uncertainty than is normally the case. It is for example unclear how far longer term rates, and in particular the risk premia embedded in those rates, can be brought down by liquidity injections in a situation of widespread uncertainty about economic prospects. Well designed communication by central banks may be crucial in this respect.  Second, and most importantly, we should always keep in mind that the responsiveness of the economy depends to a large extent on the health of financial intermediaries, in the absence of which even powerful liquidity injections are not greatly effective. Third, there is a risk of introducing distortions in financial prices, and this calls for particular care in designing the measures. Fourth, unconventional measures may have a more direct redistributive impact on specific sectors of the economy or categories in society than normal monetary policy actions. This implies a high degree of common understanding and cooperation between fiscal and monetary authorities, as part of a clear definition of respective responsibilities and fields of action. Fiscal policies As the effectiveness of action in the monetary field becomes less certain, fiscal stimulus becomes more necessary. When financial markets are not working properly and credit constraints are widespread, private spending is more sensitive to current disposable income, and the impact of a fiscal stimulus is therefore greater.  To maximize their effectiveness, fiscal actions should not affect the longer term sustainability of public finances, in order to avoid the expectations of higher future taxes; moreover, the stimulus has to be directed where its impact is strongest and fastest.  In the current circumstances, the size and quality of international coordination is crucial. Uncoordinated moves create spillovers and relative price or exchange rate movements that can greatly reduce the incentives to implement a fiscal stimulus at the individual country level. On the contrary, with coordinated action taken globally, an individual country’s measures will be more significant with the joint benefit of an increase in foreign demand. The quantitative effects of the spillovers can be quite substantial. Recent simulations conducted at the Bank of Italy find that a coordinated fiscal action at the European level could increase 6 BIS Review 160/2008 
by some 30 per cent the impact of the same measure taken in Italy alone.1 The results reported by the IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook are also quite telling in this respect.2Moreover, in the case of concerted action, country level risk premia may remain more stable than otherwise. But coordination does not imply that every country has to do the same. Starting conditions need to be taken into account. Countries that are net creditors vis-à-vis the rest of the world and with sound public finances, in Asia and Europe, obviously have the possibility to take a frontline position. By doing so they would not only reduce the consequences of the crises for their own economies but also help to contain the weakening of net debtors’ economies and currencies. Moreover, bolstering internal demand in these countries goes in the direction of reducing the large global imbalances accumulated so far and thus may help to set the foundations for a more sustainable growth looking forward. In other countries, where public finances and/or net external positions are less sound, the margins for action are obviously more limited. This does not mean that they are nil. But it implies that medium term growth-enhancing and debt-reducing policies become more crucial. For example, compensating actions may be taken to bolster pension reforms, in order to lighten the burden coming from an aging population and increase participation rates; or to implement deep restructuring measures in the public sector to enhance the efficiency and quality of public spending. If taken with determination, such actions can create room for maneuver in these countries so that they can alleviate the effects of the crisis and improve growth prospects.  As fiscal measures are being taken in many countries to counteract the economic contraction, the need to ensure that individual actions come to form a coherent approach is more pressing. In Europe, the European Commission has proposed a plan, currently under discussion, for a concerted action of fiscal authorities, that is very much in line with the principles I have just outlined. In the context of the European single market this is an absolute necessity. But I think that great benefits could derive from adopting a similar approach at the global level.  Conclusion The main theme of this conversation is that at the origin of the crisis we find a variety of market developments spurred by financial innovation that were not understood neither by the market actors, banks, and capital markets, nor by regulators. The future challenge lies in producing an environment that is innovation friendly but where knowledge of market participants is adequate. This objective is certainly not realistic for all sorts of financial innovation, for some of the products we discussed, a model taking into account and pricing all risks simply doesn’t exist. In other cases the limits to how much financial innovation will be accepted or allowed may come from the unwillingness of the relevant private sector players to provide all the necessary information. Whatever the case it is likely that the future financial system will have more prudential oversight and more standardisation than in the past. This crisis, as painful as it is, provides all of us with valuable experience that we at the FSF and more generally the supervisory community are building on in designing the future financial system. However the crisis has been remarkable in raising the awareness of all                                                  1  The exercise is conducted using a DSGE model described in L. Forni, A.

Jean-Claude Trichet: The changing role of communication Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at a dinner with members of the “Internationaler Club Frankfurter Wirtschaftsjournalisten”, Frankfurt am Main, 15 December 2008. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen,  A very warm welcome to all of you and thank you very much for your invitation to this club evening. I am happy to see many familiar faces in the audience tonight. Communication is a very important issue for all times. Being here in Frankfurt I am thinking of the very profound remark by Goethe: “Niemand würde in Gesellschaften viel sprechen, wenn er sich bewuβt wäre, wie oft er die anderen missversteht“. Nevertheless let me be bold enough to share with you some thoughts on communication and central banks. Communication is a key element for central banks to enhance the effectiveness, predictability and credibility of their monetary policy decisions. It becomes even more important in difficult times, when the economic outlook darkens and confidence weakens.  It seems to me that central banks have improved their communication significantly in good times – and also in bad times – while some years ago communication was almost seen as a breach of their professional code. Why this change? Why did central banks decide to become transparent? Prior to the 1990s, central banks were very much working on the assumption that monetary policy effectiveness is greatest when the central bank systematically surprises the markets. The old belief was based on the notion that a central bank would measure the success of its actions by the extent to which economic activity could be raised and maintained above potential. If rational individuals already expect a certain change, they adjust their behaviour to that expectation. And that means that a monetary policy change would have no effect.  In the past fifteen years, however, two important developments changed the theory and practice of central banking. First, the assumption that successful monetary policy acts by surprises and is made by a sequence of isolated steps has been the subject of thorough theoretical scrutiny and is now close to oblivion.  It became clear that policy-making by surprises and isolated steps will bear no lasting effect on the economy once the public recognises the intentions that motivate the monetary authority. A monetary policy strategy made of isolated actions with the intention of boosting output above potential is bound to lose effectiveness because the short-term inflationary impact of that policy soon becomes embedded in price and wage expectations. Output and employment react in the very short-run, but in the medium term the economy suffers from a permanently higher inflation.  The drive toward central bank independence provided an additional encouragement for transparency. Today an overwhelming majority of central banks across the globe is independent. The political and functional independence of central banks has been an important milestone in the way towards separating the authority to tax and spend from the power to control credit conditions. This separation has been the critical factor behind the BIS Review 160/2008 1 
general decline in inflation that we have observed over the past decades.1 But independence makes democratic accountability by the monetary authority all the more important.  Many central banks have gone well beyond strict legal requirements in their pronouncements and communications than imposed by statutory accountability duties. The question is: Why? The reason rests on a simple though powerful insight: transparency renders monetary policy more effective. In a world in which policy-making by surprises has lost purpose, wide knowledge of the central bank’s preferences and objectives can only serve as a coordination device for private beliefs. Anchoring expectations around the objectives of policy help coordinate the reactions of economic behaviours to the macroeconomic shocks along the appropriate path of adjustment that the central bank wants the economy to follow. Many central banks have therefore started to communicate their firm commitment to a nominal anchor, through the announcement of a precise definition of price stability. In many cases, central banks have gone further and spelled out a more general monetary policy strategy, and the analytical framework that is used by policy makers to assess the risks to the achievement of the central bank’s objectives.  A growing body of empirical evidence supports the assumption that transparent quantitative objectives and communication about the strategy reinforces monetary policy. For instance, a recent ECB study has shown that, following the introduction of a quantitative definition of price stability, inflation persistence has considerably diminished in the euro area, in Switzerland and in five inflation-targeting countries.2 While a large component of the switch in expectations formation is due to the genuine regime change, the exceptional speed of the adjustment would not have been possible without extensive communication about the onset of a new regime. Communication in difficult times Central bank communication – if supported by an established strategy – might well be a quiet and uneventful activity.  In difficult times, however, when the economic outlook darkens exceptionally and confidence falters, communication becomes even more important to explain how the central bank intends to gear its policy. We have, on the one hand, the need to take and communicate swift action in implementing the appropriate monetary policy and in refinancing commercial banks. On the other hand, we need to communicate clearly the adherence of the central bank to the long-term objectives of policy and the way it intends to steer the policy course back to a normal path once the abnormal circumstances and risks have subsided.  Communication in difficult times is inherently challenging for all central banks. However, it is facilitated by two fundamental components of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.  The first is the quantification of a price stability objective. This grants a very significant level of predictability. The monetary policy easing that we enacted in the last two months – on a scale that is unprecedented in such a short period of time – was motivated by a sharp easing of inflation pressures looking into the future. The fact that markets could predict our moves with a fair degree of precision – despite the exceptional cloud of uncertainty that surrounds economic projections in present conditions – is a proof that our main mode of                                                  1  See, for example, Alesina, A. and L. Summers (1993), 'Central bank independence and macroeconomic performance: some comparative evidence', Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, Vol. 25, No. 2, May. 2  Benati, L. (2008), “Investigating inflation persistence across monetary regimes”, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 123:3, August 2008, 1005-1060. For instance, estimates of the inflation persistence in the euro area fell by around two-thirds from the period before (until the Bretton Woods arrangement) and after the launch of EMU. 2 BIS Review 160/2008 
communication, via disclosure of the economic outlook as we perceive it, is effective and robust to extreme occurrences.  The second component of the strategy which helps in times when expectations become disoriented is what we have called the “separation principle”. In view of safeguarding its credibility and firmly anchoring long-term inflation expectations, it is crucial that the Governing Council sets the appropriate monetary policy stance on the basis of no other considerations than the delivery of price stability in the medium term. Once the appropriate level of the key interest rates has been set, the Executive Board of the ECB implements its monetary policy stance so that the effects of its interest rate decisions are transmitted to the financial markets and the real economy effectively. In this sense, the ECB had to act swiftly and decisively to avoid that tensions in the money market would spill-over to other markets and adversely affect the real economy.  So we had to clearly convey two complementary messages. One was that the ECB was determined – from the onset of the financial crises in August 2007 – to ensure the orderly functioning of the euro area inter-bank money market by offering supplementary liquidity-providing refinancing operations or – more recently – by widening the collateral framework to facilitate the provision of liquidity to merchant banks and to engage in unlimited provision of liquidity for all our refinancing operations at a fixed rate. The other message which is fundamental was to raise the public’s awareness that the exceptional interventions aimed to alleviate the tensions in the money market would not compromise the longer-term achievement of price stability in line with our definition less than 2%, but close to 2%.  Conclusions Let me conclude. The fundamental changes in central bank communication have helped to enhance the effectiveness, predictability and credibility of monetary policy and have notably contributed to lowering both inflation rates and volatility in the real economy. For its part, the ECB has established a practise of making its policy transparent and in setting new benchmarks in the area of central banking communication. That being said, on each occasion, a central bank has to carefully assess the relevance, clarity and timeliness of the information. Transparency is a key ingredient of an effective monetary policy. Communication is an ongoing challenge and effective communication will always be characterised by a degree of flexibility and adaptability in order to respond swiftly to a rapidly changing economic environment.  Thank you very much for your attention.  BIS Review 160/2008 3 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Interview with the Financial Times Interview with Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, conducted by Mr Lionel Barber, FT Editor, and Mr Ralph Atkins, FT Frankfurt Bureau Chief, on 10 December 2008 in Frankfurt, published on 15 December 2008. *      *      * FT: Mr Trichet, this has been the Eurozone’s first real crisis. How do you think the authorities have coped?  Mr Trichet: I’m not sure it is really the Eurozone’s first crisis, because you remember we also had the bursting of the internet bubble, and we had to cope with the oil and the commodity price shock. Moreover, we also had other sets of difficulties here and there, including when we were told in 2004 by some large countries that we had to unravel the Stability and Growth Pact. So I would say we had to face up to a series of circumstances that were certainly not easy. But it remains true, of course, not only for us but for all the authorities in the world – central banks, executive branches and perhaps also parliaments – that we now have to cope with a truly exceptional situation. In that sense I would say that we are all being tested. In a way the ECB is being no more or less tested than the Federal Reserve, because these exceptional circumstances are calling for exceptional decisions and responses by a large number of central banks. But to the extent that we are only ten years old, this test is of course particularly important for a young institution. FT: What was the most difficult moment for you at the ECB in terms of crisis management? Trichet: I would certainly say that these were the first hours at the outset of the financial turmoil. The Executive Board had to make a diagnosis of the situation in a very short time span, assess what kind of problem we had to deal with, and take decisions almost instantaneously.  FT: …this is July/August 2007, yes…. Trichet: This was on 9 August 2007. We had a very important decision to take, which was in a way the first important decision that central banks had to take in order to confront these exceptional circumstances. I remember I was keen on thinking, “This is a grave situation that calls for appropriate responses”. And then we had a great number of important decisions to take in the subsequent months, which were largely “firsts”, in terms of supplying liquidity at fixed rates and even in terms of expanding our collateral framework which, from the outset, was already a very comprehensive collateral framework. It has been a big challenge. One of our challenges is that we had to take decisions very rapidly at the level of the Governing Council. And we again proved that, thanks to teleconferencing, in one hour and a half or two hours we could make a full judgment and take a decision. We had to test the capacity to have such teleconferences at very short notice, in order to be sure that we could confront any new situation. We had a large number of teleconferences with the Governing Council. You see there…[points to telephones on table] If the situation were to demand now that we had in one hour and a half a teleconference with the Governing Council, we will then indeed have a teleconference in one hour and a half. The full continent would be there. That’s very impressive, because this would mean all members of the Governing Council from Ljubljana to Helsinki and from Lisbon to Dublin.  FT: And as you say, an exceptional crisis, a global crisis. How much worse would it have been without the euro? Trichet: It is very difficult to reconstruct history with new assumptions. But my memory of what we experienced together in the old days is certainly that we would have had a situation which would have been very difficult, because on top of all of these global challenges that are without precedent, we would have had to cope with the intra-European tensions, the BIS Review 159/2008 1 
equivalent of the intra-ERM 1 tensions, and that would have been demanding. There is no doubt from that standpoint that the enormous challenges we had at the level of the euro area as a whole were, very fortunately, not the result of intra-euro-area tensions, and that is something which is important. FT: And that would have put the single market at risk? Trichet: And that would have put the single market at risk, sure. Not only have the central banks had to cope with exceptional situations. Governments were called upon to take action in various forms, and the fact that Europe is a union of sovereign states means that a lot of decisions implying taxpayers’ money or risks to taxpayers are taken at the level of governments and parliaments. Hence there is a constant need to ensure that we maintain the single market and its level playing-field, and that we do not re-nationalise segments of the market. This is a big challenge at the level of the institutional framework of Europe, but it has been done well so far. FT: In the past, some warned that the first test for the euro would also perhaps put intolerable strains on the currency union, and some academics even suggested it would fall apart. This has not happened, but are you worried about some member states in the currency union that are facing greater challenges, say, than others? Trichet: Europe’s institutional framework is solid, and it has proved its solidity. The euro itself has functioned, by and large, as a protection against these intense international challenges. On the other hand it is clear that each economy has to be run as properly as possible. We are in a market system that punishes those who behave improperly. That is the reason why we ourselves are telling all members of the euro area to respect the Stability and Growth Pact. It is the legal framework that we have as a quid pro quo for the fact that we do not have a federal budget and a federal government. And it is economically based on solid ground. Consider the spreads for the refinancing of the various government’s treasuries: they are taking into account the various fiscal policies. Consider the Ricardian effects, the level of confidence or the lack of confidence that you observe in the various constituencies of economic agents, particularly at the level of households: they suggest that there are certain situations where if you do not behave properly you might lose more in terms of confidence than what you are supposed to gain through the additional spending. We also say regularly to the various members of the euro area that they must be aware of the unit labour cost evolution, of the relative competitiveness of the various economies inside the euro area, and inside the single market of the 27 EU members. This is something which is also very important. FT: But of course the Stability and Growth Pact, thanks to the French government, 1997, is still very constricting. Trichet: It is supposed to function so as to prevent the various fiscal policies from loosening during the positive part of the business cycle in order to provide appropriate room for manoeuvre when we are in the downbeat episode of the business cycle. FT: You mean the exceptional circumstances clause? Trichet: In any case you are supposed to be close to balance or much better in surplus when you are in the… FT: … upswing… Trichet: … yes, affluent episode of the business cycle, so that you have at least 3% of GDP of room for manoeuvre to cope with the difficulty when the business cycle reverses. But on top of that there has been this mention of exceptional circumstances, which has been added to the Stability and Growth Pact. The Pact has been designed to cope with all episodes of the business cycle I was mentioning, and that is the reason why we ourselves say that the room for manoeuvre that is embedded in the Pact exists and can be utilised.  FT: Do you think Germany is utilising it to the extent it should? 2 BIS Review 159/2008 
Trichet: Every nation has its own Ricardian effects and its own assessment of the situation. I do not want to comment on any particular country, because my duty is to look at the continent of 320 million fellow citizens as a whole. But I fully accept that there are differences in the capacity of households in various cultures to accept a deterioration of their situation, and again, the Ricardian channel tells us that one might lose more by loss of confidence than one might gain by additional spending. Every nation has to assess its own situation. We are a union of sovereign states, so you have to take into account the sovereign decision-making process at the level of each nation. The process requires the approval of parliaments. In some cases you might have decisions that are taken very expeditiously because the democratic institutions are functioning very rapidly. In other cases you have to accept that it takes longer to take decisions that would be fully in line with the effective functioning of the democracies concerned. But I do not judge any country.  FT: But what role do you believe, then, should a fiscal stimulus play in mitigating the effects of this crisis and moving us towards a recovery? Trichet: I believe that the existing room for manoeuvre according to the Stability and Growth Pact rules can be fully utilised. And there is a great coherence between the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact on the one hand, and what – at least speaking for the euro area – an attentive economic analysis would recommend on the other. Again we have to be mindful of the spreads on the various treasuries, and of the fact that the market is aware of the room for manoeuvre of the various countries. We also have to be mindful of the Ricardian effects which are very important. When you look at the level of savings as a proportion of household revenue in the various countries, you see to what extent some of them are already largely taking into account the expectation that tomorrow you’ll have to face up to additional taxation and additional financing needs for public funds. FT: In the US, what is really striking about Europeans is that some of them understand that this crisis is so exceptional that in a way you may have to put aside the rules. These are exceptional circumstances. But on the other hand there are other Europeans who just feel that we’ve used so much effort and political will to put together and agree on those rules that whatever we do, we mustn’t abandon them. Now, where do you come down on these two sides of the equation? Trichet: Incidentally, we had an exceptional relationship with the other side of the Atlantic in a large number of areas, including the supply of dollar liquidity. We have had a lot of “premiers” in terms of our own decisions, and “premiers” in terms of the close cooperation and very confident cooperation with other central banks. This is something which is important. But I’m cautious. I take the Stability and Growth Pact as it is, with its provision for exceptional circumstances. But it would be a mistake not to take into account fully the situation of the various economies. We have an exceptional situation, but understanding where exactly the limits are of the fiscal room for manoeuvre also depends on the culture. I see some cultures where people are very anxious that in the medium and long run the fiscal situation would be unsustainable, others that are reasoning short term. The “discount rate” which is implicit in the various cultures is not the same. We have to also take that into account. We don’t have a federal government. We don’t have a federal budget. If we unravel the Stability and Growth Pact we won’t rebuild it afterwards. It would have been unravelled. And what would I say then to American friends telling me, “you put the cart before the horse – you don’t have a federal budget or a federal government – but you have a single currency”? I understand that from the outside our setup might seem a little surprising, but taking everything into account, the credibility of the euro area, the fact that there has been a quid pro quo at the birth of the euro area in terms of the institutional framework, our setup is very solid. And don’t forget that there is also something which is not negligible. The role of automatic stabilisers is also important, and I urge the members of the euro area to display to which BIS Review 159/2008 3 
degree the worsening fiscal balances represent the functioning of automatic stabilisers. If I compare the euro area – but I think this would also be true for Europe as a whole – with the US, we have public spending as a proportion of GDP that is significantly higher than in the US. We have a social safety net and social protection in general which is more comprehensive than in the US, and hence the role of automatic stabilisers is significantly more important. It represents a much larger part of GDP. An order of magnitude could be that for the same decrease of GDP, you would have perhaps twice as much influence of automatic stabilisers as a percentage of GDP in the euro area as compared with the US. A large level of public spending as a proportion of GDP is not something that we necessarily have to be very proud of, but it is some kind of “amortiser” in periods that are very difficult.  FT: In Britain you’re looking at a potential 8 per cent budget deficit next year of GDP, and in America the word is for the next fiscal boost, name a number and go higher. And the doctrine of overwhelming force, the Powell doctrine, will be used to throw everything at this problem. Now, do you see risks in that approach, or are you sympathetic? Trichet: If I stick to my own understanding of the difficulties we face, I would say we are certainly paying a price for the absence during a long period of time of appropriate balances in the various economies the world over. I’m not mentioning one economy or another in particular, because I think that we have had a phenomenon in the industrialised world which is very complex and which has manifested itself not only in the US but also in a significant number of industrialised economies including the European economies, where you see a permanent tendency to have domestic imbalances between savings and investment, with the mirror image of large external imbalances. I think we have to be aware of that. It seems to me that what we are told presently is – and again it is a message for all industrialised countries in my understanding – that it is not a normal position, that it is a dangerous position to be domestically and externally significantly in imbalance. Reflecting on what you call the “overwhelming force”… I don’t know. I have no memory of colleagues on the other side of the Atlantic telling me that as if there were no limit … All colleagues trust that there are limits, in any case. I would echo that and I would say that there are always limits. There are limits as regards the structural features and the permanent features of the functioning of the various economies. And if you think that you have no limits, then you are taught that there are limits by the Ricardian effects, by the financial markets themselves.  FT: If you look to the medium term, how do we get to achieve a better balance? How do we avoid, if you like, another wave of volatility based around unrealistic asset prices, or an asset bubble?  Trichet: Let us look at the time of the bursting of the internet bubble. There was a degree of excessive pessimism, if I can analyse the real situation after the internet bubble burst. I do not exclude that in terms of macroeconomic policies that were… FT: …in other words that we assumed things were really bad after the bubble burst, and therefore we erred maybe on the monetary side, perhaps…. Trichet: I am not criticising anybody, and I know to what pressure the ECB was resisting at the time. I was appointed at the end of 2003. As early as the beginning of 2004 three Heads of State and Government of large countries were calling publicly on the ECB to decrease interest rates. I suppose with the benefit of hindsight it would appear extraordinary, taking into account what happened afterwards, but it is documented. Central banks are permanently asymmetrically called on to privilege more the short term to the detriment of the medium and long term and this by all sensitivities, all constituencies whether private or public … We were made independent precisely because our democracies rely on us to reason also medium to long term, and to avoid being exclusively trapped in short-term considerations. In my own experience, this is both a national and international experience in the euro area: I know practically of no constituency which would call on us to increase rates at any time!  I experienced all the consequences in the 1980s of the second oil shock and the defaults of sovereign states, which were the mark of the 1980s. We had a very negative consequence of 4 BIS Review 159/2008 
these dramatic oil shocks and commodity price shocks that we had to cope with in the 2000s, because there has been, on top of the savings glut, an additional pot of forced savings that were accumulated at the level of the global economy by the oil and commodity producers. That created an additional element of capital chasing investment and hunting for yields. You then had a very low level of spread, a very low level of volatility and a very low level of risk premia, which contributed to create an asset bubble, asset price inflation. FT: Are there measures that you could take or policies that you should adopt in order to avoid another wave of volatility? Trichet: I would say that it is impossible in market economies to avoid fluctuations. We have to accept that we have ups and downs. What is an overwhelming duty is to eliminate, as completely as possible, all the in-built elements in global finance that are amplifying the booms and the busts. Such pro-cyclical elements are everywhere. They are in the behaviour of the various private entities themselves. We have to draw the appropriate lessons from that, including in terms of risk management. We have to reflect on accounting rules. Now we have to see exactly how accounting rules could best reflect the reality of the situation, and how they would avoid augmenting booms and busts as has been the case. We have to reflect in the Basel Committee on prudential rules for banks and also for insurance companies. As regards market rules in general they might have been, all taken into account, too geared towards short-termism and too pro-cyclical.  All of these are the avenues that we see in front of us when we meet in the context of the Financial Stability Forum, the G20, the IFMC, G7, G8 or the G10 grouping of Central Bank Governors. I think we very much agree on the appropriate avenues. I used to sum them up by saying that we first have to improve transparency dramatically for financial instruments, for markets and for institutions. We second have to combat pro-cyclicality everywhere in the global financial system, we third have to combat short-termism and we fourth have to very significantly improve risk management in the private sector in general. Moreover, we have to improve surveillance, at a global level, of the economies that are systematically important. It is not only China, the US and Europe, but it is also the other members of the G20, because they are systematically important. If everything is settled as regards the financial system, and if we really go without any taboos in the directions that are presently suggested we can succeed. This includes the 67 measures suggested by the Financial Stability Forum that have been accepted by the international community. But on the other hand, if we maintain the possibility of the global economy having big imbalances that would pile up for years, we know that there will be recurrent corrections which will be equivalent to the earthquake that you have when continents are moving, which at some point leads to a collision. We have to prevent that too. We do not speak too much about that, but it is extremely important.  FT: Have the politicians lagged behind the financial markets? Certainly, the technocrats, the central banks understood… The politics has lacked, hasn't it?  Trichet: I would not say that. The Central Banks have indeed been instrumental in organising what I would call a line of defense against the “systemic liquidity risk”. The executive branches have taken the decision to organise a line of defense against the “systemic solvency risk” that was threatening national, continental and global finance. We had asked ourselves for such decisions to be taken. But I certainly will not underestimate the difficulty of the tasks of governments to put taxpayers’ money and risk at stake for the guarantees and the recapitalisation that were necessary. In the euro area, in the UK, in the US, it called for courageous decisions.  FT: Are there limits to the effectiveness of monetary policy because of the situation we're in, and if so, should the reaction of central bankers be to do more or less in such circumstances? And then what is the role that should be played by exceptional measures that you have at your disposal, the quantitative easing debate essentially?  Trichet: First of all, we made the point clearly that there was a clear separation between monetary policy stance, which was designed to deliver price stability in the medium term in BIS Review 159/2008 5 
line with our definition, and our interventions in the money market aiming at permitting a smooth functioning of this market at the level of the short term interest rates that we had decided. And we have continued to look at inflation expectations with extreme care during the entire period. And I was very satisfied, I have to say, that we had regained control of inflation expectations before the event of mid September, because it permitted us to decrease rates and to accompany the alleviation of inflationary pressure without hesitation. We participated in the collegial decrease of rates which we had organised with the other major central banks in the world. So that is a very important first point. Second point, as regards the present situation, we consider that the decisions we have taken were exactly what was necessary. Taking into account the alleviation of inflationary pressures, we have to be very mindful of the spreads that we are still observing in the money market. I said at my last press conference on 4 December, you remember, we have to concentrate on obtaining from the interest rates effectively practised the intended consequences. The transmission channel is not functioning as usual, but it is functioning. There is no doubt that the decisions that we are taking have an impact, but it's made more complicated, more complex by the present situation, in particular by the fact that we do not have a money market which functions normally. We do all we can, in particular through our supply of liquidity, for this money market to function as well as possible. But we observe these challenges at a global level on both sides of the Atlantic; it is a phenomenon that we are all observing and that we all are trying to counter. It is certainly not easy to eliminate, otherwise we wouldn't see the same phenomenon in the US and in Europe, but at least we are progressively attenuating the problem.  FT: You said last week that you have an opportunity next week to view the operational framework, liquidity regime. You seem to contain a hint that maybe changes might be planned. Can you tell us about that without…? I don't expect you to tell us what you decide, but what would the aim be? Would it be perhaps to apply more whip on banks to encourage…? Trichet: I can say nothing at this stage. FT: What about buying debt, though; buying government debt? Would you consider such a move at the ECB? Trichet: Again, I have said that experience has demonstrated that we had to prepare for unexpected exceptional situations, and I would say that I would not eliminate anything ex ante, and equally I will not pre-commit to anything ex ante. We'll always look at the situation on the basis of our own analysis, taking everything into account. Today, we will certainly not consider that it will be appropriate at all. You were speaking of quantitative measures. There is a measure of quantity, which is impressive today – I'm speaking of both sides of the Atlantic, and both sides of the Channel – which is the size of the balance sheet of the central bank. This is explained by the fact that we are supplying liquidity on an unlimited basis and that we have allowed collateral in a way which is more forthcoming. And this is true for all central banks. But for us, our weekly balance sheet in comparison with that of one year ago has increased by around 55 % [from around 1.3 trillion to 2 trillion euro]. Of course, this increase does not imply an increase in net liquidity, because a significant part of the liquidity we provide comes back in the central bank through the deposit facility. FT: That’s less than the Fed. Trichet: Yes, true. For the ECB part of it comes also from the fact that we have the counterparts of the dollar that we are supplying ourselves, and a counterpart of the dollar is our own collateral. The central banks are in a situation where they are playing a much more quantitative role than they used to play, and it is true for all of us. FT: Should there be more centralised supervision within the Eurozone, and should the ECB take responsibility? Is the ECB willing to take that responsibility if the politicians so desire? 6 BIS Review 159/2008 
Trichet: As you know, we have always been in favour of a very close relationship between the central bank and the banking surveillance authorities. We said that long, long before any new problems, any new difficulties. We had a Governing Council position close to the start of the ECB, which we made public. So on that point, there is no ambiguity at all. We are also strongly thinking that better coordination for big cross-border institutions is absolutely necessary; even if we could cope with all the issues at stake in the present circumstances, we should not forget that. It's clear that we can improve the present framework and we have to improve it. Some avenues have already been suggested by Ecofin. There has already been a consensus on appropriate Memoranda of Understanding. But going further in this direction also seems important. At this stage, I have to say, I do not have a full-fledged Governing Council position. We are still reflecting, and we will see what will be the position of the Governing Council. But I understand that the European Parliament has carried out several works which have been done within the suggestion that the ECB would play a particular role in this domain for the coordination of surveillance for cross-border institutions – a little bit like in the US. The Federal Reserve has a position which concentrates very much on the big cross-border institutions. And I see also suggestions coming from the private sector, coming from the industry, that we could play a more important role in this domain. As President of the ECB’s Governing Council, I would say again, I have no position of the Governing Council, but I think it's flattering for the Governing Council that we are called to reflect on that, by both parliament and perhaps the high-level group that has been set up by the Commission and where you have a number of eminent personalities. We will see. A little bit of philosophy again. We cannot afford to put in the future the concept of the market economy at risk as we did. I have known myself a world where you had an east and a west, a north and a south. In this matrix, we were only one square out of four where you could say they are in favour of market economies. The others were devising other ideas, which failed, and it's very good that they failed. However, the trust which was put in the resilience of the market economy is at stake now. I think we were, again, quite lucid on this. I have permanently with me the first page of the Financial Times warning of it, it was January 2007, in Davos, where I was providing the sentiment of my colleagues, as it has arisen from the governors’ meeting in Basel on the fact that market participants had to prepare for a significant correction because risks were underassessed and underestimated in global finance. But the fragility, not only of global finance but of the global economy itself, is something that we should reflect on. You know, there are some key intermediate inputs that are produced in only three factories in the world. This is not reliable. We have this just-in-time system, with minimum inventories, which in case of a shock might make the full body of the real economy more immediately vulnerable. In the financial system we have eliminated a number of cushions and shock-absorbers that we had here and there. This morning, I was telling our staff, that this is as if we had been keen on eliminating a number of air bags from the [global finance] “car”. So now that we have an accident, we are surprised to see that we have a lot of scars. The scars of the current crisis on the global financial system are significant. All investment banks in New York have either been purchased, or gone under, or changed by their legal framework. That is saying something. A new concept of resilience for the market economy is of the essence. BIS Review 159/2008 7 
Fabrizio Saccomanni: Managing international financial stability Edited text of remarks by Mr Fabrizio Saccomanni, Director General of the Bank of Italy, at a meeting at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington DC, 11 December 2008. *      *      * I am delighted to be here at the Peterson Institute to present my views on international financial instability before such a distinguished audience of eminent scholars and officials, among which I am fortunate to count many old friends. This is my first visit to the Institute since I was invited to join its Advisory Committee and I would like to express my gratitude to Fred Bergsten for the invitation. I am honoured to participate in this important body of the Institute and I look forward to contributing to its activity in the promotion of policy–oriented research in the field of international economics. Instability in the age of globalization International financial instability is a subject that has fascinated and intrigued me since when I was a young economist at the IMF and witnessed with considerable anxiety the collapse of the Bretton Woods system on August 15, 1971. The ensuing decade of instability was mostly attributable to the shock of the downward floating of the dollar and the resulting two oil-shocks of 1974 and 1979. After some unsuccessful attempts to rebuild Bretton Woods, the negotiations for the reform of the international monetary system ended in 1976 with the legalization of freely floating exchange rates and that seemed sufficient to fix the problem. A tired US Treasury Secretary, William Simon, commented: “All is well that ends”. At the beginning of the 1980s, following the process of liberalization, deregulation and privatisation set in motion by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, it was widely expected that full international capital mobility would interact with floating exchange rates to ensure adjustment of balance of payments disequilibria and a stable financial environment. Instead, these new conditions paved the way for the emergence of a global financial system in which financial innovation and the ICT revolution combined to produce an extraordinary expansion of financial sectors and markets compared with the real sector in both industrialized and emerging countries. The seeds of instability were thus planted on fertile soil. Indeed since the 1980s financial disturbances have occurred with increased frequency and intensity and have entailed major international repercussions. I will not review here the long list of debt crises, currency misalignments, illiquidity in credit markets, asset price bubbles, that have characterized the age of globalization, a subject to which I have devoted considerable attention in the last few years.1 I would rather quote from a paper written by Michael Bordo, Barry Eichengreen and others in 2001 on “the crisis problem”: since 1973 crisis frequency has been double that of the Bretton Woods and classical gold standard periods and matched only by the crisis-ridden 1920s and 1930s. History thus confirms that there is something different and disturbing about our age.2                                                 1  See Saccomanni F. (2008), Managing International Financial Instability. National Tamers versus Global Tigers, Cheltenham, UK and Northampton, Ma: Edward Elgar. 2  See Bordo M., B. Eichengreen, D. Klingebiel and M.S. Martinez-Peria (2001), “Is the Crisis Problem Growing more Severe”, Economic Policy, April, pp. 53-82. BIS Review 159/2008 1 
So, given that the situation has not improved since 2001, what is different and disturbing about the age of globalization? Here are some features that I regard as crucial. What is different • The world economy operates under a “market-led international monetary system” in which market forces determine exchange rates and the international allocation of capital. This is the key point of a paper Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa and I wrote for a conference organized by Fred Bergsten and Peter Kenen at this Institute to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Bretton Woods System in 1994.3 In the paper we underlined the risk that the increased globalization of financial markets could lead to “disturbances that may have an impact on the stability of the financial system”. • Global financial intermediaries operate in a highly competitive environment, but with essentially uniform credit allocation strategies, risk management models and reaction functions to macroeconomic developments and credit events. • Financial innovation (mainly through securitization and derivatives) has greatly enhanced the ability of global players to manage market and credit risks. What is disturbing • There is no stability-oriented anchor for the macroeconomic policies pursued by systemically relevant countries. • Monetary policies targeted exclusively to consumer price inflation are not likely to prevent unsustainable trends in credit flows and in asset prices (equity, real estate, bonds, foreign exchange). • The procyclicality of the financial system has been enhanced by factors leading to excessive credit creation followed by sharp credit contraction. These factors are related to both market dynamics (underpricing of risk, overestimation of market liquidity, uniformity of financial strategies and of risk management models, information asymmetries, herd behaviour) and to financial regulation (capital requirement, fair value accounting). • Perverse incentives and loopholes in the regulatory system have made it possible for financial innovation to transfer credit risks to unregulated entities. • Widespread conflict of interest, between originators of financial products, credit rating agencies and law firms, has facilitated the dissemination of highly complex, risky and opaque instruments among investors with inadequate risk management culture. The response to financial instability The response of the international community to the episodes of instability that have affected the world’s monetary and financial system since the 1980s has been on the whole conducted on a case-by-case basis, with an emphasis on “domestic” factors and circumstances, rather than on “systemic” determinants. This has reflected the prevailing conventional wisdom                                                  3  See Padoa-Schioppa T. and F. Saccomanni (1994), “Managing a market-led global financial system” in P.B. Kenen (ed.), Managing the World Economy. Fifty Years After Bretton Woods, Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics, pp. 235-68. 2 BIS Review 159/2008 
according to which crises are inevitable as they are mostly the result of immutable human factors like greed and gullibility. Crises are also seen as part of a physiological process whereby “unfit” market participants are eliminated and the “fittest” survive and become stronger. In this context, market excesses are tolerated in the conviction that they will self-correct in a relatively short time.  From a policy point of view, the conventional wisdom recommended the so-called “house-in order-approach”. This assumes that all imbalances have a domestic origin and that, if all countries adopt appropriate policies at home, there would be no systemic problems to cope with and therefore no need for an internationally coordinated response. Obviously, domestic factors do play a role in triggering crisis situations, but they are often amplified and propagated by the operation of global financial markets. Thus a balanced response to crises should ideally address both types of factors. In reality, the policy response has been generally biased towards adjusting the domestic causes of imbalances, such as in the case of IMF financial support packages to emerging countries during the 1990s. Actions targeted to tackle systemic problems have been sporadic or partial in scope. Occasional interventions to correct exchange rate misalignments of major currencies have been conducted by G7 countries, but have been mostly of an “oral” kind in recent years, despite some evidence of success in arresting unsustainable or unwarranted trends, such as the appreciation of the dollar in the mid-1980s, the appreciation of the yen in 1995 or the depreciation of the euro in 2000.  Also the much-hyped “reform of the international financial architecture” (IFA), launched by the G7 countries after the Asian-Russian crisis of the 1990s, turned out to be focused essentially on the need to strengthen financial systems in emerging market countries, mostly through the adoption of a series of standards and codes of good conduct. The plan drew criticism from a high level Task Force, set up by the Council on Foreign Relations and led by Morris Goldstein,4 for not addressing more fundamental issues, like the moral hazard implied by IMF sponsored bail-outs or the overlapping of roles of the IMF and the World Bank in crisis management and resolution. A minority of that Task Force, including Fred Bergsten and Paul Volcker, criticized the plan for ignoring the question of reforming the world’s exchange rate regime, an omission that they equated to “watching Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark”. In the end the IFA reform obliged the IMF to invest a large amount of resources in a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) which produced reports, highly valuable but not widely read, on almost all its member countries, but with the significant omission of the United States and China. Another main objective of the reform, that of closing loopholes in the financial regulatory regime, again forced the IMF to concentrate mostly on the activity of off-shore financial centres based in exotic islands, rather than on hedge funds and other unregulated financial market participants of greater systemic relevance. At a conference on “Reforming the IMF for the 21st Century”,5 organized in 2006 by this Institute, the mandate of the Fund, its governance and resources, were thoroughly reviewed by an impressive range of academics and officials, including the Managing Director of the Fund. In that context it was recalled that financial sector supervision had led to “a mission creep” in the IMF, diverting resources from its key institutional task of conducting surveillance on macroeconomic and exchange rate policies of member countries. This concern way bluntly underlined by a senior US Treasury official, claiming that the IMF had been “asleep at the wheel of its most fundamental responsibility – exchange rate surveillance”.6 However,                                                  4  See Goldstein M.

this unexpected “wake-up call” turned out to be less motivated by global stability considerations, than by more prosaic concerns about the widening bilateral trade gap of the United States with China, entirely attributed to the undervaluation of the renminbi. Ted Truman, who had chaired the conference, concluded that: “The IMF is in eclipse as the pre-eminent institution of international financial cooperation. Consequently, the world is worse off.” To have permitted this “eclipse” is probably the most crucial flaw in the response of the international community to the challenges of globalization. It led to the perception by the markets, and the public opinion in general, that widening global payments imbalances, exchange rate misalignments, fast growing monetary and credit aggregates, exceptionally low risk premia, were not seen as posing a threat to global financial stability. This perception was reinforced by the recent decision taken by the IMF shareholders to “downsize” the institution because its lending activity to members had shrunk to almost nil in the high tide of international liquidity, as if it had nothing else to do. The international community thus went on to confront the worst economic and financial crisis since the 1930’s with unjustified complacency, ill-prepared, and with its key institution weakened by internal policy disagreements. The response to the current crisis In reviewing the response to the current crisis, I will not address the unprecedented array of immediate crisis management measures undertaken by central banks and national Governments in the major countries to underpin banking and financial systems and to support economic activity. I will rather concentrate on the longer-term work being undertaken in the IMF context, in the G20 and in the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) to reform the international monetary and financial system in order to make it less crisis-prone than the present one and more resilient to shocks. On this more systemic issue, a lively debate has developed involving politicians, academic economists and financial analysts. A recurrent theme in the debate is the call for a “new Bretton Woods” and the recent meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the G20 here in Washington last November was seen by many observers as the starting point of a process that could lead to a fundamental reform of the world’s monetary and financial system.7  If by a “new Bretton Woods” one means a system built upon the foundations of the “old” one, it may be appropriate to recall how this was shaped. In essence, the Bretton Woods system was based on three main pillars: (i) a stability-oriented anchor for macroeconomic policies, operating through the par-value regime for member currencies in terms of gold and the US dollar; (ii) an obligation to maintain freedom from restrictions for trade and other current international transactions; (iii) the possibility of introducing restrictions on capital movements for restoring equilibrium in the balance of payments. Obviously, in any reform project, these pillars would have to be adapted to the new reality of financial globalization. Leaving aside for a moment the “anchor” question of the first pillar, it must be noted that in the G20 Summit Declaration of November 15, 2008 one can find encouraging language on the issues covered by the two other pillars. As regards free trade, paragraph 13 of the G20 Declaration has strong words on the “importance of rejecting protectionism” and a firm commitment both to “refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods and services” and to strive for “a successful conclusion of the WTO’s Doha Development Agenda with an ambitious and balanced                                                  7  See, for example, Eichengreen B. and R. Baldwin (eds) (2008), “What G20 Leaders Must Do to Stabilise our Economy and Fix the Financial System”, London: Centre for Economic Policy Research, a VoxEU.org publication circulated on the web on the eve of the G20 meeting. 4 BIS Review 159/2008 
outcome”. This is a rather non ritual language and it sounds pleasantly out of tune with the widespread feeling that protectionism is on the rise again as a result of the crisis. As regards financial regulation, paragraph 9 of the G20 Declaration broadly outlines an approach that rules out any form of old-time restrictions that would impede or distort the operation of financial markets. This is good, and it should allay the fears of a return to the past. However there is a strong commitment “to ensure that all financial markets, products and participants are regulated or subject to oversight as appropriate to their circumstances”. The G20 further outlined the need to strengthen transparency and accountability, to promote integrity in financial markets and to reinforce international cooperation in the regulatory field, broadly endorsing the program and the division of labour agreed upon in this field by the Managing Director of the IMF and the Chairman of the FSF. The FSF, in the words of Chairman Draghi, is working in particular to ensure that financial systems would have more capital, less leverage and would be subject to more effective regulation. This would imply, inter alia, reducing the procyclicality of the regulatory framework and its reliance on “self-regulation” by market participants, which paves the way to “regulatory capture”. This is a welcome change from the attitude that allowed in the past a growing proportion of markets, products and participants to go unregulated on the grounds that “they have no systemic impact”. This is the attitude that brought to us the “shadow banking system” made up of unregulated SIVs and conduits, distributing opaque structured products containing subprimes and other risky assets with the active marketing of unregulated rating agencies.  Obviously, the systemic impact of these G20 commitments will depend on the actual outcome of the negotiations underway in the relevant trade and regulatory bodies.  Turning, finally, to the anchor question I must say at the outset that this is the area where little progress has been made so far in official fora. The G20 Declaration mentions the need to reform international financial institutions, but mostly to reflect more adequately “changing economic weights in the world economy in order to increase their legitimacy and effectiveness”. How can we be sure that these steps will ensure that a global crisis such as the present one will not happen again? Pro-cyclicality is an inherent feature of all financial systems and it is likely that a mere rebalancing of power would not achieve significant results in the absence of effective supra-national mechanisms to promote stability-oriented macroeconomic policies at the national level, especially by systemically important countries. Unfortunately, the G20 Declaration has placed insufficient emphasis on measures against the perpetuation of policies that led to unsustainable imbalances at the global level in the recent past.  These are difficult problems, but the time has now come, perhaps, to have a fresh look at what are the possible technical solutions. I do not think that the “old Bretton Woods” can offer a viable arrangement for the 21st Century: fixed exchange rates are gone. And yet one must admit that freely floating exchange rates have not really helped the adjustment of global imbalances. Perhaps this is because currencies have now become financial assets that are traded for profit motives with little or no relation to the economic situation or the balance of payments of the issuing country: the exchange rate has thus become more part of the problem than of the solution. From this point of view it would appear more logical to look again at anchors based on a system of target zones for key currencies or to a substitution account that would replace national reserve currencies with the SDR, which I presume is still alive somewhere. But although logical, a revival of these proposals seems hardly promising for reasons that are perhaps more ideological than practical but that are still strongly held. Realistically, the only anchor that one can think of today is an institutional anchor, i.e. an anchor based on institutions endowed with effective multilateral surveillance powers. This, BIS Review 159/2008 5 
again, is easier said than done. Willem Buiter, with his typical bluntness recently wrote: ”Don’t waste time on multilateral surveillance. The IMF will never have any influence on large member states with strong government budgetary positions and strong external positions”.8 This is a valid point and indeed so far IMF surveillance has not been very effective despite various attempts to strengthen it. Yet, in my view, a further effort by the international community in this direction is needed.  As I argue in my book, the IMF, drawing also from the expertise of the FSF and other relevant international institutions and standard-setting bodies, must be entrusted with the task of identifying unsustainable trends in payment imbalances, credit flows, asset prices, exchange rates, and of formulating specific policy advice to the relevant member countries to promote monetary and financial stability. This is an area where additional research is required and where the IMF could supplement the analytical work conducted by the Bank for International Settlements and in the central banks’ community. Monetary policies and regulatory measures should be designed to complement each other in the context of a “macro prudential approach”, whereby the objectives of fighting inflation and preserving stability in financial systems could be jointly pursued. If the policy indications formulated in the context of IMF multilateral surveillance are not followed, the IMF should make its own assessment known to the public opinion. It is possible that this may create a certain volatility in financial markets, but it will also strengthen the market perception of a two-way risk, thus contributing to brake unidirectional unsustainable market trends that inevitably lead to credit booms (and busts), bubbles, and misalignments. In the end, I think that the gravity of the present crisis requires a strong determination to correct the flaws and the inadequacies of the present market-led international monetary and financial system. In embarking in this difficult effort, the international community should follow the good suggestions that Barry Eichengreen and Richard Baldwin outline in the Introduction to the book I have already quoted: “strengthen existing institutions; start thinking outside the box; do no harm”.9                                                 8  See Buiter W.

Denny H Kalyalya: Effective banking supervision – a risk based approach Opening remarks by Dr Denny H Kalyalya, Deputy Governor-Operations of the Bank of Zambia; at the workshop on “Effective banking supervision: a risk based approach”, Livingstone, 1 December 2008. *      *      * •The Chairperson•Resource Persons•Distinguished Workshop Participants•Ladies and GentlemenOn behalf of Crown Agents and the Bank of Zambia, I wish to welcome you all to this important workshop on Effective Banking Supervision: A Risk Based Approach and to Zambia’s Tourist Capital, Livingstone. In particular, I welcome our resource persons from Crown Agents and participants from the region. Looking at the programme, it is obvious that you will have a tight schedule. However, I urge all of you to find time in your busy schedule to visit some interesting places that our Tourist City of Livingstone has to offer, especially the mighty Victoria Falls, which although not at its best at this time of the year, still presents a spectacle to behold. The ongoing global financial crisis has brought tremendous and unexpected challenges to regulatory and supervisory authorities. As you are all well aware, in any economy, more so in market-driven economy, financial institutions play a critical role in the allocation of resources through intermediating between those with surplus resources (depositors) and those in need of resources (investors). Effective and efficient supervision is therefore, crucial to manage risk and avert possible loss to depositors/investors and hence maintain public confidence in the financial system. Ladies and Gentlemen This workshop is being held at a time when the global economy has come under serious strain caused by the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US. Appetite for profit and poor credit risk underwriting standards led to a surge in sub-prime mortgages. This brought about a real estate price bubble as demand for residential properties grew. The situation culminated into a liquidity and credit crunch in financial markets. The financial crisis has spread to other countries directly through financial market linkages and indirectly through trade. Recent projections indicate that the global financial crisis will lead to global contraction in economic output with a corresponding reduction in incomes, a rise in unemployment and decline in volumes of trade. Ladies and Gentlemen The current state our financial sector calls for a new approach to the supervision of banks and other financial institutions. Risk Based Supervision (RBS) represents a paradigm shift from the traditional rules based, historical, standardised and point-in-time assessments to a process-oriented, forward looking, continuous and risk profile driven approach to supervision and regulation of the financial sector. RBS is a structured and forward looking process designed to identify risk factors to which individual banks and other financial institutions and the entire financial industry are exposed. This approach enables supervisors to critically assess various risks and the risk management systems of banks and other financial institutions in order to assess the risk profile of these institutions. It also enables the regulator to focus supervisory attention on the areas and institutions that pose the greatest risk to financial system stability. BIS Review 159/2008 1
Thus, the supervisory authorities are in a position to identify systemic risk factors and devise intervention measures aimed at forestalling systemic failures. The added advantage of this approach is that it brings about optimal utilisation of supervisory resources. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am happy to inform you that following our initial efforts dating back to 1999 to introduce risk based supervision, the Bank of Zambia has this year fully adopted RBS. As a result it is expected that there will be enhanced supervision of banks and other financial institutions. Let me also state that the BoZ is committed to implementing the Basel II Capital Accord but stands ready to review this stance in the face of the ongoing global financial crisis. As you know Basel II is intended to make banks operate at capital levels which are commensurate with their risk profiles. To this end, the BoZ just issued risk management guidelines. Distinguished Workshop Participants As I conclude, I wish to urge the workshop participants to participate actively in the deliberations and use this opportunity to tap knowledge and skills from the vast experience of the resource persons. This workshop provides us with a unique opportunity to share our respective country experiences and challenges. It is my hope that we will develop the supervisory systems in the region to a level where they will be able to interact effectively. This uniformity in the supervisory systems will prepare us to respond better to regional and global financial challenges. With these few remarks, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is now my honour and privilege to declare this important regional workshop on Effective Banking Supervision: A Risk Based Approach officially open. I thank you!!! 2 BIS Review 159/2008 
Marion Williams: Safeguarding our future in the face of global economic challenges Opening remarks by Dr Marion Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Barbados, at the Seminar "Safeguarding Our Future in the Face of Global Economic Challenges" to the Caribbean Association of Indigenous Banks, Bridgetown, 17 November 2008. *      *      * Mr. Chairman, Honourable Ministers, Chief Minister of Anguilla, Minister of State, President and Board of Caribbean Association of Indigenous Banks, Distinguished guests, I first would like to congratulate the organisers of this conference for the foresight and the tenacity in keeping this annual conference going. Thirty five years is a long time to have kept this up. Indigenous banks are a most important part of our economic landscape and even though, as we become more regional it seems we have tended to change our definition to a regional definition of indigenous, they remain as important as before. Indigenous institutions tend to have an ethos which is Caribbean and which I trust helps them to focus on the longer term goals of the region and not just on profitability and market share. Today more so than ever, it is necessary for financial institutions to take the long view about where they are going. It has been fortunate for the Caribbean that we have so avoided the impact of much of the global financial turbulence. This is partly because we were not on the cutting edge of the financial technology but also because we did not stray too far from the basics of good credit assessments and sound financial management. I would like to believe that the Central Banks within the region contributed to this approach and I know too that the calibre of managers which we have within the region make their regulations sound. After all this is your home. Indigenous banks will not leave at the sign of a downturn. They will stay and overcome any challenges. Having said that, the world has become a global village, and we cannot isolate ourselves from global developments. Given the unprecedented events that have occurred in the global economy over the past eighteen months, the theme for this year's conference is quite appropriate. In my opening remarks this evening, I will restrict my focus to the main sources of risk and vulnerability which have emanated from four areas: (i) the global macro-financial environment; (ii) financial markets; (iii) the balance sheets the region's households and businesses; and (iv) financial intermediaries. At this time, I am sure many do not envy our respective positions, since policies at both the micro and macro level face no shortage of challenges. Internationally, with economic growth slowing in the major developed economies, the problems in international credit markets are still serious, and inflation rates still strong, and although there are signs of some deflationary trends, the task for policy makers is as delicate as any faced in many years. Though the region has over the years substantially improved its macroeconomic fundamentals and is better suited to face external shocks, there will be fallout from the current turmoil. Market volatility will undoubtedly lead to sharp downward growth revisions for 2008 and 2009, as the decline in global demand will tend to reduce regional exports of goods and services. In addition, the fall in interest rates in the U.S. will impact on both fixed and floating exchange rate regimes, while the decline in global liquidity will force curtailment of Foreign Direct Investment and cross border flows. How we respond to the problems posed to us by the recent upheaval will be important for the robustness of the regional economy going forward. BIS Review 158/2008 1 
Though the direct impact on the regional domestic banking sector has not been significant, largely because of the lack of sophistication and the relative of risk aversion if our regional banks, there are lessons we can draw from these events. We must respond to these changes by further strengthening our efforts at maintaining financial system stability with adequate rules and regulations while avoiding over-regulation. It happened after Enron with Sarbannes Oxley which tended to go overboard without, some would say, achieving sufficient strengthening of the system – the results of which we are seeing today. Many have now related the current crisis to market over-exuberance, coupled with less than all-encompassing regulation which was necessary to monitor the very rapid changes in derivative and structured finance instruments. The innovations and developments which spawned such instruments increased the complexity of financial transactions and made their traceability difficult. Such changes were also supported by increasing levels of excess liquidity, low interest rates in the global financial market and the increased demand for variations in financial instruments, given different consumers' risk profiles. Consequently, there was a further blurring of financial intermediation roles between the traditional banks and non-bank market players. Risk-shifting and risk transfer eventually forced the collapse we are witnessing today. What these developments have demonstrated is that adequate regulation of the financial system in the US is important to the rest of the world. While these guidelines are set in the developed world the failure of regulation impacts us all. Developing countries therefore have an interest in making sure that the US gets it right. While the global recession will have significant implications for the region, inflation continues to be a regional concern though there is evidence that this should ameliorate in the future. It is our hope that with oil and other commodity prices falling, the region will be a beneficiary of a substantially lower inflation rate in 2009. In some of the Caribbean islands, demand growth evidenced by still strong credit, has not dropped dramatically, and in many instances, interest rates are below inflation rates. That is to say, real interest rates are negative; and this has occurred at a time when banks anticipate heightened levels of delinquencies, and would prudently adjust their credit standards. This has the potential to force individuals to use their savings to cope with normal activities. As a regulator it is important that we encourage the right balance, that is both the concerns of the depositor as it affects his earnings on the one hand, and the borrower as it affects his costs on the other. Over the most recent past, we have also seen a tighter level of integration between international markets and regional economies, which is reflected in a higher volume of cross-border financial flows, FDI or otherwise. Greater integration between the markets is supported by the emergence of new players, who operate across borders and are often privately-owned, or are subsidiary companies of state-owned institutions. This has important implications for us in the Caribbean in the current situation. As we have witnessed, that changes in the global financial markets have the potential to rapidly alter levels of global liquidity. The sharp growth in excess liquidity that started in the early 2000's, and cheaper financing costs which fuelled the export of wealth and capital from the financial capitals to all parts of the globe is now at a premium. This boom in growth, liquidity and employment served to fuel heightened levels of Foreign Direct Investment flows to the region through interests in real estate and other forms of investment. These “boom” conditions also led to strong performances in the flow of remittances, which has been a vital component of virtually all regional economies' balance of payments. With the turmoil in the international markets, there has been a liquidity crunch, coupled with the higher-than-usual levels of risk aversion. As a result, access to this kind of funding has contracted sharply. The excess liquidity which we observed in the past few weeks could well be called upon and could contract as players who had previously been accessing the international markets turn to the local market now that these markets are closed. While we do need Foreign Direct Investment and value it highly, thankfully, the region has not been overly reliant on portfolio cross-border flows. This was a direct consequence of the thinness of our financial markets but has turned out to be a benefit. A decline in net inflows of 2 BIS Review 158/2008 
funds into the region would have had large spillover effects on the domestic economy, and some impact on the international business sector had the region been more securitised. Although short-term capital inflows can be useful to meet short-term national financial requirements, they can also be very volatile and vulnerable to sudden reversal. Short term borrowers are more influenced by market expectations. The factor of expectations is currently clearly evidenced in the sensitivity of some regional currencies towards changes in the risk appetite of global investors towards US dollar-denominated debt instruments in the region. At least one central bank in the region had to provide support for issuers of national bonds denominated in US dollars as a result of this volatility. We may therefore need to turn increasingly to the region and support each other. It would seem obvious that what I have outlined so far implies that maintaining regional macroeconomic stability is clearly one of the supporting pillars of overall financial system stability. As for the resilience of the banking system, I can say that the regulatory actions of the regional central banks have categorically shown that our banks are able to overcome the market risk related to the current macro instability in the global market. However, we need to constantly reinforce the resilience of the banking industry and guard against over-confidence. Ladies and gentlemen, we should be grateful for the strength and resilience of the banking industry when confronting these various risks and shocks. Industry performance has steadily improved. Bank profits remain healthy and are in line with expansion of the intermediation function and with efficiency improvements, as well as effective risk management. Although much has been accomplished, a lot more still remains to be done. In this current globalisation era, the speed of change is rapid. Our achievements up until now do not guarantee success tomorrow. We have always relied on this awareness as the foundation of banking industry policy. From here every step needs to be carefully and cautiously calculated. It is imperative that we remain always sensitive to our long term goals and to the impact on the financial system when addressing the changes and dynamics of the current crisis. We also have to be able to calculate the implications of each step, prioritize policy, and maintain a good balance in the implementation. I know that the negative credit trends will filter through to our markets and is likely to affect corporations in some key sectors, particularly those who entered this phase with low levels of liquidity. This underscores the challenges of slower economic growth and, shrinking liquidity in the global economy and may mean that they turn to regional banks and to indigenous banks in particular. These challenges facing regional macroeconomic policy makers look more difficult than they have been for a long time; but with the collaborative efforts at the micro level, the region will weather the storm. I am sure that the discussion over the next few days will help us focus on the severity of the issues, and will help us to find viable solutions to head off any potential adverse impacts. I wish again to congratulate the CAIB for their commitment to commercial banking in the region and to the exchange of views and ideas on the safeguarding of our future, given the global financial challenges. Sometimes collaboration is important in order to make a breakthrough. I thank you and wish you a successful conference. BIS Review 158/2008 3 
Philipp M Hildebrand: Is Basel II enough? The benefits of a leverage ratio Speech by Mr Philipp M Hildebrand, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Financial Markets Group Lecture, London School of Economics, London, 15 December 2008. *      *      * 1. Introduction It is a pleasure to be at the London School of Economics this evening. I am very grateful to Professor Goodhart for his generous invitation. As many of you know, Charles is a kind of godfather to an entire generation of central bankers. His 1988 book, The Evolution of Central Banks, remains a classic and is still required reading for aspiring central bankers. Let me take this opportunity to thank Charles for tonight’s wonderful platform and, more importantly, for his long-standing contributions to the art, science, and craft of central banking.  Recurring financial crises have become a hallmark of the modern financial system. It would seem that, every five years or so, a 100-year event destabilises the system. Moreover, each crisis appears more violent than the previous one. With the current crisis as my showcase, I will argue that excessively high leverage has been a key factor in making banks and ultimately the financial system much more fragile and vulnerable than most observers, regulators, or market participants ever imagined. Based on this diagnosis, I will argue in favour of restricting the leverage of core financial institutions, i.e., banks. Needless to say, banks have a tendency to oppose regulation. I will therefore discuss in some detail why regulating banks’ capital is necessary and why it promotes financial stability. 2.  High leverage as a main cause of financial fragility The Swiss economy is far from the epicentre of the current financial crisis. Yet, the two big Swiss banks have been hit particularly hard by recent events. This is to a large extent the consequence of their extraordinarily high leverage. For some years now, we have argued that their high leverage makes them particularly vulnerable to extreme financial shocks.1 Looking at risk-based capital measures, the two large Swiss banks were among the best-capitalised large international banks in the world. Looking at simple leverage, however, these institutions were among the worst-capitalised banks. With the benefit of hindsight, we clearly should have put even greater emphasis on the risks of excessive leverage.  Excessive leverage is by no means a problem uniquely associated with the two big Swiss banks. There is increasing international recognition that excessive leverage has been a crucial contributing factor to the current crisis. In April, the Chairman of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), Governor Mario Draghi, summarised the view of the FSF when he said: “Our conviction is that […] institutions have accumulated a level of leverage that was both misperceived and excessive.”2 Gerald Corrigan argues that “leverage, in its many forms clearly was a driving force in creating the market conditions that would trigger the crisis, just as the inevitable de-leveraging on the downside of the cycle would severely amplify the magnitude of the crisis.”3 In a similar vein, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stresses that the dramatic deleveraging of financial institutions is exacerbating the downward spiral so                                                  1  See every issue of the Swiss National Bank’s Financial Stability Reports since 2003. 2  Mario Draghi, chairman of the Financial Stability Forum, in his address to the G7 ministers and governors, April 2008. 3  E.

prevalent in the current crisis.4 Hence, by implication, the high starting levels of leverage are a major source of the severe and ongoing adjustment problems. Finally, the leaders of the G20 declared only last month that “excessive leverage” was a root cause of “vulnerabilities in the system”.5Moreover, the problem of excessive leverage is not limited to the current crisis. It has been a pivotal feature of most previous financial crises. John Galbraith, for instance, has carefully documented the role of debt and leverage in crises going back to the 17th century.6 More recently, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets concluded in 1999 that, “The principal policy issue arising out of the events surrounding the near collapse of Long-Term Capital Management is how to constrain excessive leverage.”73. Is there a need for better regulation? Assuming there is agreement that excessive leverage has been a major factor in past crises, what ought to be done about it? An obvious response is to limit leverage. But is it really that obvious? After all, some people would argue that regulation is at least partly to blame for past crises. Before I go any further, I want to clarify where I stand in the debate on regulation vs. free markets – my ideological baggage, so to speak. I believe that free markets are the best available mechanism to allocate resources and that they are ultimately the best way to promote welfare and economic growth. Fundamentally, I am therefore wary of elaborate efforts to interfere with the functioning of free, competitive markets. At the same time, it is obvious to me that, under certain conditions, free markets produce inefficient outcomes. If these market failures are apparent and important enough, they justify and indeed require interference in the market mechanism. As Joseph Stiglitz put it, “Whenever there are “externalities”– where the actions of an individual have impacts on others for which they do not pay or for which they are not compensated – markets will not work well.”8In the real world of banking, potential market failures are particularly relevant. An important market failure stems from the fact that banks enjoy the benefits of a safety net. Many countries have explicit deposit insurance schemes, which limit depositors’ losses. Moreover, in almost every country there is some degree of implicit government protection for large banks. In the current crisis, government protection has become manifest and explicit in the form of the recent G7 and G20 communiqués. Most notably, in October the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors declared unambiguously that they “agree to take decisive action and use all available tools to support systemically important financial institutions and prevent their failure.”9 In other words, governments imply that large banks are simply “too big to fail”.  Clearly, there are benefits to banks having safety nets. But there are also serious costs. It is a fact that the presence of insurance leads to less careful behaviour, otherwise known as moral hazard.

Naturally, therefore, rental cars have a much shorter life span than non-rental cars. The same reasoning applies to banks. No sane banker will intentionally manage his bank into insolvency. But he or she has a lower incentive to avoid insolvency than if he were not insured. This sub-optimal level of caution is immediately apparent in banks’ balance sheets: Banks tend to hold very low levels of capital. In a cross-sectional comparison, banks have much lower capital cushions than uninsured firms. On average, listed non-financial firms have capital-to-asset ratios of 30 to 40 percent.10 In stark contrast, before the onset of the current crisis, all of the world’s top 50 banking institutions held, on average, only 4 percent of capital. None of them held more than 8 percent.11In short, banks have a preference for very high leverage. This highlights a fundamental dilemma of capital regulation: Banks don’t like it. Bankers will typically argue that high leverage is beneficial or even necessary. Therefore, banks will naturally oppose any regulation aimed at restricting leverage. I find this neither upsetting nor surprising. If regulation is to be effective, we must expect it to impact on behaviour and restrict action. This will solicit complaints. If it doesn’t, regulation would, by definition, be superfluous.  4.  From Basel I to Basel II For all these reasons, I strongly support bank capital regulation that puts a meaningful limit on banks’ leverage. But what is the best way to restrict leverage? In an ideal world, we would, of course, also want to take into account the riskiness of banks’ assets.12 As you know, banks can increase their risk not only by increasing their leverage but also by increasing the riskiness of their assets. To compensate for differences in banks’ assets, we would ideally require banks with riskier assets to hold more capital. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has embraced precisely such a risk-weighted approach. More risk, more capital. If we lived in an ideal world, this simple principle would work well. By “ideal”, I mean a world in which risks can be observed by everybody and assessed precisely. What has become abundantly clear in recent months is that we do not live in an ideal world. Banks and the risks they incur are far from transparent. In fact, banks exist because of asymmetries of information.13 A core function of banks is to “produce information”. For instance, banks screen potential borrowers. Furthermore, banks monitor ongoing lending relationships. Without any asymmetries of information, banks would not be necessary, since households could invest their savings directly or through mutual funds. Therefore, by definition we cannot have banking with full transparency.14  Fortunately, banks are not totally opaque either. Some risks can be assessed more or less readily. A US Treasury bill is clearly less risky than an unsecured loan to an obscure software company. Therefore, capital requirements can at least partially be based on the relative riskiness of various types of assets, even in our non-ideal world. “Basel I”, the first Basel Accord of 1988, introduced “risk buckets” for this purpose. For instance, loans received a risk weight of 100%, government bonds a risk weight of 0%. “Basel II” – the revision of the                                                  10  Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales (1995): “What Do We Know about Capital Structure?

first Basel Accord – which is currently being implemented, tries to go beyond what were perceived to be rather crude risk buckets. Under Basel II, risks are differentiated in more detail. For example, a loan to a large, international AAA rated firm is typically not as risky as a loan to a local restaurant. While sensible, the higher risk sensitivity of Basel II comes at a price. First, banks and supervisors alike incur significant operational costs to implement the new, highly complex regulation. Second, but in my view more importantly, Basel II creates new risks: Risks about risk assessments. I am tempted to call them the unknowable unknowns. Under Basel II, we increase our dependence on risk models. What if we didn’t pick the correct models? What if the data used to calibrate these models turn out to be of poor quality? What if the models were correct in the past, but the future is different? What if certain tail events simply cannot be modelled? These are all important considerations that we have to keep in mind when we interpret the risk figures from complex models. As it turns out, to view the model outputs as a true representation of reality has proven to be a grave mistake. Furthermore, the increased reliance on banks’ internal models has rendered the job of supervisors extraordinarily difficult. First, supervisors have to examine banks’ exposures. Second, they have to evaluate highly complex models. Third, they have to gauge the quality of the data that goes into the computation of these models. To put it diplomatically, this constitutes a formidable task for outsiders with limited resources.155.  Strengthening Basel II: introducing a leverage ratio So where does that leave us? Based on what we know and understand today, I would suggest that risk-weighted capital requirements, broadly as proposed under Basel II, probably remain the most rigorous way to address banks’ tendencies to incur excessive risks and, ultimately, to ensure adequate capital levels. However, we must address the serious short-comings of the risk-weighted approach, which have become so powerfully manifest during this crisis. What Basel II needs, therefore, is a safeguard to provide the financial system with additional protection against the negative consequences of these short-comings. I want to stress that a safeguard of this kind is needed in addition to the improvements to Basel II that are currently under way as a result of the recent FSF Report to the G7 ministers and governors.16 Which brings me back to the obvious and simple response to excessive leverage: The imposition of a limit on banks’ leverage as a complement to the risk-weighted approach reflected in the current Basel framework. The regulation of banks’ leverage is usually referred to as a “leverage ratio”. Specifically, the idea is to set a lower limit to the capital-to-assets ratio of banks. Let me stress again that this instrument is not meant to and should not replace Basel II. There is no reason to eliminate the benefits of risk-weighted capital requirements. The leverage ratio should be applied as a complement to the risk-weighted approach as reflected in the current Basel framework. That means we would have two independent measures of capital adequacy. And banks would have to meet a minimum requirement for both measures. To some extent, such a capital regulatory framework is old news. Historically, capital requirements in most countries took the form of simple leverage ratios. Risk-weighted requirements were only introduced following the first Basel Accord of 1988. The “old-fashioned” leverage ratios were replaced by “modern” risk-sensitive requirements. Some                                                  15  For a discussion of potential short-comings of Basel II, see Robert Bichsel and Jürg Blum (2005): “Capital Regulation of Banks: Where Do We Stand and Where Are We Going?”, Swiss National Bank Quarterly Bulletin. 16  “Report of the Financial Stability Forum on Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience”, Financial Stability Forum, 7 April 2008. 4 BIS Review 158/2008 
countries, however, have maintained leverage ratios as essential elements of banking regulation. Notable examples are the US and Canada. Despite being somewhat old news, I am convinced that the introduction of a leverage ratio is fully compatible with the ongoing efforts to strengthen banks’ capital. We must not forget that Basel II aims to secure a minimum level of capital. It’s up to every bank and every national supervisor to exceed this minimum. As the G20 has put it, “regulation is first and foremost the responsibility of national regulators”.176.  The pros and cons of a leverage ratio Let me now highlight the most important benefits of a leverage ratio. Equally, I would like to address the most commonly expressed concerns about a leverage ratio. Having a leverage ratio to complement risk-weighted capital requirements has many advantages. Some of them I have already alluded to. Most significantly, a leverage ratio can operate fully independently of any complex modelling assumptions and calibration procedures. As such, it serves as a complementary instrument to risk-weighted requirements when assessing banks’ capital adequacy. This is of considerable value. During the recent crisis those banks and supervisors, which took several instruments into account, including volume limits and restrictions on asset growth, clearly performed better.18 More generally, research has shown that risk-weighted capital ratios and leverage ratios contain complementary information about banks’ condition.19 Hence, by looking at both risk-weighted capital ratios and leverage ratios, supervisors and banks can be expected to make better judgments in a systematic way. Moreover, it is much more difficult for banks to arbitrage around two capital ratios than around just one. Can we say anything about the role of leverage ratios in the recent credit crisis? While a rigorous analysis would reach beyond the scope of my comments today, it seems clear that the leverage ratio has helped protect the US banking system from even greater calamity. This is not necessarily because the leverage ratio encourages more prudent behaviour, but because the leverage ratio ensures a minimal buffer to absorb the negative consequences of imprudent behaviour. I leave it to your imagination what would have happened if the US banks had entered the current crisis with leverage ratios of only 2 percent instead of well over 5 percent. It is interesting to note that Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, is convinced that Canadian banks, which are also subject to a leverage ratio, are “healthier than their international peers” because “their leverage is markedly lower”.20Given these positive effects of a leverage ratio, what are the arguments against it? In my view, there are three potential short-comings. They are the treatment of off-balance-sheet exposures, pro-cyclicality, and banks’ profitability. Let me briefly address these in turn. • Off-balance-sheet exposures: To obtain the leverage ratio, capital is divided by total assets. Obviously, such a simple calculation fails to take into account off-balance-sheet items. The introduction of a leverage ratio could therefore encourage banks to build up large off-balance-sheet exposures. There are two responses to this potential problem. First, this is precisely why it is important that a leverage ratio only                                                  17  G20, “Declaration of the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy”, 15 November 2008. 18  See “Observations on Risk Management Practices During the Recent Market Turbulence”, Senior Supervisors Group, March 2008. 19  See, e.g., Arturo Estrella, Sangkyun Park, and Stavros Peristiani (2000): “Capital Ratios as Predictors of Bank Failure”, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review. 20  Mark Carney, “Building Continuous Markets”, Remarks to the Canada – United Kingdom Chamber of Commerce, London, 19 November 2008. BIS Review 158/2008 5 
be used as a supplement to Basel II. To the extent that a move to off-balance-sheet activities raises banks’ risk, Basel II will result in higher capital charges – and thereby reduce banks’ incentives and possibilities to arbitrage around a leverage ratio. More importantly, the Basel Committee is now in the process of improving the treatment of off-balance-sheet items under Basel II. Second, if we conclude that despite the ongoing reforms of Basel II, off-balance-sheet exposures continue to undermine adequate capital provisioning, the leverage ratio can easily be enhanced to include such exposures. In Canada, for instance, some off-balance-sheet items are added to banks’ total assets when calculating the leverage ratio. Alternatively, we could go further and consider defining a “managed leverage ratio” as proposed by Professor Joseph Mason of Louisiana State University, “which takes all the securitisations and puts them back on the balance sheet”.21 • Pro-cyclicality: There are valid concerns that a leverage ratio may amplify the financial cycle. First, the imposition of a leverage ratio in the middle of the current crisis would put additional de-leveraging pressure on banks. Second, in the long run it would make the availability of credit more volatile. Banks would be forced to cut down on lending in a downturn in order to comply with the leverage ratio requirements. Unfortunately, this so-called pro-cyclicality is inherent to all forms of capital regulation. The problem stems from the fact that in most cases, specific capital minima have to be respected throughout the cycle. In Switzerland, in a recent reform of the large banks’ capital requirements, the Federal Banking Commission embarked upon a pragmatic approach to address this dilemma. In normal times, banks will be required to hold capital significantly in excess of the regulatory minima. Conversely, when the cycle turns, they will be allowed to dip into the capital cushion. Naturally, the Swiss authorities are acutely aware that imposing tighter capital requirements right now would be pro-cyclical. Under the new regime, the capital requirements have to be met by 2013. If necessary, this implementation window will be extended further.  • Finally, let me address the question of banks’ profitability: This is a tricky question, which requires a two-part answer. o First, capital requirements effectively reduce the value of a bank’s explicit or implicit government safety net. If we think of the safety net as a put option for the owner of the bank, capital requirements effectively reduce the price of that put option. In other words, banks have to bear a larger share of their potential losses themselves. This, of course, is bad news for the banks. Distortions due to the safety net are the main rationale for capital regulation. Capital requirements aim to correct these distortions and strengthen the motivation of banks to avoid excessive risks. While this comes at a cost to banks, it increases overall efficiency and economic welfare. o Second, capital requirements reduce the tax shield of debt. Debt has an advantage over equity capital in the sense that payments to debt holders are deducted from profits. In contrast, payments to shareholders, i.e., dividends, are made out of profits and hence are subject to corporate taxes. Forcing banks to hold more capital reduces their tax shield and thereby diminishes banks’ market value. What are the orders of magnitude we are talking about here? Let me offer you a very rough back-of-the-envelope calculation using publicly available data in Switzerland. Assume that a bank has to increase its leverage ratio from 1% to 5%. If this bank is subject to                                                  21 ”Capital Ratios Helped Mask Looming Crisis”, The Wall Street Journal Europe, 11 November 2008. 6 BIS Review 158/2008 
an effective tax rate of 20%, the increase in capital will reduce the bank’s total market value by less than 1%.  However, these costs notwithstanding, banks and shareholders may also benefit from holding more capital. For instance, banks that were more conservatively capitalised before the outset of the current crisis have now benefited from their relative strength. In the area of wealth management, for instance, stronger banks have been successful in attracting clients from weaker banks. Moreover, looking at the poor performance of thinly capitalised banks’ stocks over the last decade or so, low leverage ratios do not seem very attractive. Our empirical analysis suggests that risk-adjusted stock returns of banks do not increase with leverage. A cross-sectional comparison of risk-adjusted returns with other industries is also sobering. The performance of the relatively low-capitalised banking sector has been devastating during the last decade. 7.  Conclusion To conclude, leverage has been a major contributing factor in the current financial crisis. Excessive leverage has amplified the shocks to the financial system. Moreover, the now inevitable de-leveraging is imposing further stress on the system. To enhance the longer-term resilience of the financial system, effective regulation to curtail banks’ leverage is required. In an attempt to put a lower bound on banks’ leverage, I strongly support enhancing current risk-weighted capital requirements with a simple leverage ratio. A leverage ratio effectively serves as a safety valve against the weaknesses and shortcomings of risk-weighted requirements. It ensures a minimum capital buffer that protects banks against unexpected losses and underestimation of risk. As we have learned from the current crisis, the failure of risk models may quickly turn banks that seem comfortably capitalised into poorly capitalised banks. Let me emphasise again that I don’t advocate replacing the current Basel II regime with a leverage ratio. This would be unwise, as we would forgo all the advantages of the risk-weighted requirements. In particular, we would lose valuable indicators of banks’ levels of risk. And, quite frankly, there is no real alternative in sight, at least not readily. In discussions with my central banking and regulatory colleagues I detect increasing interest and willingness to examine and consider the proposal of a leverage ratio as a complement to the risk-weighted capital regime under Basel II. Governor Nout Wellink, the Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, has recently said that the committee is currently considering measures to strengthen Basel II by supplementing it “with simple, transparent gross measures of risk”.22 Last month, the German Council of Economic Experts advised the German government and parliament to introduce a leverage ratio as a robust supplement to Basel II.23 Other countries may also find it worthwhile to consider introducing a leverage ratio, even if any formal international agreement should fail to materialise. In doing so they would not only enhance financial stability in their own banking systems, but would also contribute to a more stable international financial system. Finally, it is encouraging to note that a number of banks have made voluntary commitments not to exceed certain predefined leverage limits. Adding a leverage ratio to Basel II will reinforce banks’ capital and strengthen capital regulation. However, we must remain realistic. Introducing a leverage ratio doesn’t solve everything. A leverage ratio addresses excessive leverage in the banking system. It does not                                                  22  Nout Wellink, “The Importance of Banking Supervision in Financial Stability”, speech given on 17 November 2008. 23  German Council of Economic Experts, “Mastering the Financial Crisis – Strengthening the Forces for Growth”, 12 November 2008.

address credit concentration, excessive maturity mismatch or undue reliance on asset market liquidity. Financial crises, let alone financial cycles will never be eliminated. Our aim must be to ensure that the negative consequences, both to banks and to the real economy, remain manageable. Putting in place a shock-absorbing leverage ratio to complement the risk-weighted framework of Basel II will help us get one step closer to this goal.  8 BIS Review 158/2008 
Jean-Pierre Roth: Recent economic and financial developments in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 11 December 2008. *      *      * Our assessment of the economic and monetary situation has changed considerably since our last assessment of 18 September 2008. Already back then, we had emphasised that there were substantial risks attached to developments in the global economy, in financial markets and in energy prices. We had also stressed that our forecasts for economic activity and inflation in Switzerland involved considerable uncertainties. We had announced our intention to monitor developments closely, in order to react swiftly should the need arise. As you know, this eventuality did indeed materialise. This led us to relax monetary policy decisively as the uncertainties faded and the deterioration in the economic situation became more concrete. We first lowered the Libor target range on 8 October, by 25 basis points; then on 6 November, by 50 points; and a third time on 20 November, by 100 points. With the new cut announced today, the Libor target range now lies between 0% and 1%, reflecting a firmly expansionary monetary policy. Today’s press conference gives me the opportunity to explain in detail the rationale behind our actions. Since our assessment of 18 September, the situation has changed in three key areas. First, the international economic outlook has deteriorated markedly, impacting heavily on forecasts for the Swiss economy. Second, the financial market crisis has intensified since mid-September. Finally, prices for raw materials and oil have plummeted and this, combined with the worsening of the economic outlook, has led to a marked improvement in the inflation outlook. I will deal with these three points in turn. Global economic outlook In September, our main focus was the possibility of sharply contracting growth in the most advanced economies. Now, we know that economic activity will decline simultaneously in the US and Europe, while it will slow appreciably in emerging economies. Whether one can call this a recession or not depends on the definition used, and is now merely a question of semantics. In the US, GDP is likely to decline substantially during the current quarter, following its slight contraction in the third quarter. Industrial production, which had hitherto been remarkably stable, fell sharply by 4% between July and October. Moreover, unemployment, which had also been stable for some time, rose rapidly, reaching 6.7% in November – a level not seen since 1994.  The sudden worsening of the situation is above all due to the fall in household spending. Households saw their financial situation deteriorate sharply due to the loss in value of their real estate and financial assets, while also suffering – until recently – a progressive erosion of their purchasing power through the continuous rise in fuel prices. Although fuel prices have since receded, the effects of the price correction in the real estate sector – the root cause of the financial crisis – as well as the fall in stock market prices continue to be felt. In Europe in the third quarter, GDP recorded a second successive fall. Despite the recent depreciation of the euro, exports have been hit by the slowdown in global demand. This is especially true of Germany, which is highly export-dependent. By prompting a revision of plans to expand production capacity, first in the export industry and then in the upstream production chain, the fall in exports has led to a downturn in demand for equipment BIS Review 157/2008 1 
investment. Moreover, in some countries, for instance Spain and Ireland, construction activity has been affected by a significant correction in property prices. The picture is more mixed in Asia. Japan and some emerging economies in the region will probably not be able to escape a brief recession, but on the whole economic activity should continue to advance, albeit less strongly than previously expected. In addition, the emerging economies in Latin America and Eastern Europe, which until now have been heavily dependent on capital inflows, could experience a marked slowdown in growth. Thus, what was merely a risk scenario at our September assessment is now becoming reality. The advanced economies have more or less moved into recession simultaneously. The crisis in the financial sector has finally spread to the rest of the economy. With the decline in global demand, prices for food, raw materials and oil have fallen sharply. This is the positive flipside of the coin, since this development will boost real incomes and consumption in most countries. Swiss economic outlook The Swiss economy is of course affected by this worsening of the international environment. At our September assessment, we were still projecting a marked slowdown in activity, but with growth remaining positive in 2009. We are now forecasting that GDP growth will be negative, not only during the first two quarters of next year, but also on average for 2009 as a whole. With the probable exception of consumption, all demand components should decline.  Exports of equipment goods, demand for which is known to be cyclical, will be affected. In most countries, difficulties in sales and distribution, on the one hand, and restrictions on lending conditions, on the other hand, have prompted a downward revision of investment plans. The US and Europe are cases in point, but a loss of momentum is also being observed in emerging markets. These developments will weigh heavily on our exports of equipment and intermediate goods. The substantial decline in demand for vehicles made by US and European manufacturers will also impact on their Swiss-based suppliers. The metals, machinery and electronics industry was the first to experience a sharp correction in new orders. The worsening outlook for sales will lead to an adjustment of investment plans in Switzerland as well. Domestic demand for equipment goods could even turn out to be the most severely affected component of final demand. Developments have been slightly different for the construction sector and its most important component, residential investment. Housing construction has been in decline for the past few years, although the cut in interest rates could now halt this trend. All these factors have brought about a sharp deterioration in business confidence, which should put a damper on job creation in our country. Unemployment will start to rise again. Consumption should continue to grow, but at a considerably slower pace. The household sentiment indicator was sharply down at the beginning of the fourth quarter, reflecting expectations of greater job insecurity. In contrast, the unexpected fall in inflation will contribute to an increase in real income, which will support consumption. For 2009 as a whole, the SNB is forecasting a decline in real GDP. This decline is likely to lie between 0.5% and 1%. Changes in monetary and financial conditions As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the target range for the three-month Libor has already been cut by 175 basis points in three steps since our September assessment. These successive cuts were rendered necessary by a number of factors that contributed to a tightening of monetary conditions, whereas the deteriorating general economic environment 2 BIS Review 157/2008 
called for relaxation. I need only mention, in this regard, the brief but rapid ascent of the Swiss franc in October, or the surge in credit risk premia on the bond markets. These movements have since been partly reversed, but tensions remain. These remarks serve to illustrate a more general observation: unfavourable economic developments combined with a financial crisis can impair the transmission of monetary policy, and hence compromise its effectiveness. The expansionary effect of an interest rate cut can be diluted. When confronted with such a risk, monetary authorities have to take rapid and decisive action in order to exert the desired influence on final demand. This is what we have done over the past few months. In order to monitor lending conditions since the outbreak of the financial crisis, the SNB has been conducting regular surveys of the 20 major Swiss banks. By providing us with information on these banks’ intentions and expectations, the survey complements the analysis of lending volumes. In the vast majority of the institutions surveyed, no lending restrictions were announced in the third quarter. Only 15% of the banks reported that their lending practice had become slightly more restrictive.  Data for October on lending volumes in Switzerland confirm this picture. Mortgage lending is growing steadily, most recently at a rate of 3.4%. Growth in other lending remains strong, albeit advancing at a slightly slower pace. Large companies have increasingly drawn down their lines of credit, owing to difficulties in sourcing financing on the capital markets. All in all, there is, at present, no reason to speak of a credit crunch. However, this favourable situation could soon worsen, as has been observed in other countries. I will now conclude this second section with a few brief remarks on movements in monetary aggregates. Having declined until recently, monetary aggregates are now rising slightly. Following the interest rate cuts, we expect that growth in monetary aggregates will gather pace over the coming months. Given the current heavy demand for liquidity, higher money growth does not, of itself, indicate an increase in inflation risks. Only if money growth were to become excessive over a longer period would this pose a threat to price stability in the medium term. Inflation outlook In addition to the rapid worsening of the global economy and the financial crisis, the third factor behind our policy of successive rate cuts since October is the radical change in the inflation outlook. Inflation risks have largely dissipated since our last quarterly assessment on 18 September, leaving considerable room for manoeuvre in monetary policy, which we have firmly exploited. As you know, last December inflation breached the 2% ceiling above which the SNB considers that the conditions for price stability are no longer met. The rapid rise in inflation – indeed, at the beginning of 2007, we still had zero inflation – was due to the combined effect of a virtually unbroken rise in oil prices and the healthy state of the economy. In July this year, inflation reached 3.1%, a level not seen for 15 years. This was a matter for concern, as there was a risk that such a level would alter households’ inflation expectations, potentially leading to a sharp rise in nominal wages at year-end and resulting in a certain stickiness of inflation. However, these two elements behind the recent rise in inflation have since reversed. First, oil prices collapsed, falling below the USD 50 mark in mid-November after peaking at USD 145 in early July. The plummeting oil price can be explained both by a drop in global demand as a result of the economic slowdown we have just described, and by the unwinding of speculative positions. Second, the Swiss economy will soon be operating below potential, and we will see a renewed rise in unemployment. This situation will have a moderating effect on both price and wage-setting behaviour.  BIS Review 157/2008 3 
Thus, we are now forecasting – as the graph presentation will show in just a moment – that inflation will decline almost continuously throughout 2009. Despite the interest rate cuts made since October and the cut announced today, inflation will remain low in 2010 and 2011. As of now, and for the current forecast horizon, upside and downside inflation risks have become symmetrical. Monetary policy decision We have just explained the rationale behind our recent monetary policy: first, the global economic situation has worsened, which will hit the Swiss economy as from this quarter, and in particular next year. By contrast, the inflation outlook has improved appreciably. This has increased the SNB’s room for manoeuvre. Finally, there is a risk that the financial crisis will cause a deterioration in financing conditions for the economy as a whole. These are the considerations that have prompted today’s decision to cut the three-month Libor target range by another 50 basis points. Given the expected deterioration in the Swiss economy and the imponderables linked to the long and variable monetary policy transmission lags, a further rate cut appears appropriate. With this action we are reducing, to the extent possible, the risk of an even more pronounced economic downturn. Inflation forecast chart How has our inflation forecast been revised? The dashed red curve on the chart represents the new forecast. It covers the period from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the third quarter of 2011, and maps the future development of inflation on the assumption that the three-month Libor remains unchanged at 0.5% over the forecasting period. For purposes of comparison, the dash-dotted green curve shows the inflation forecast of the September monetary assessment, based on a three-month Libor of 2.75%. The new forecast shows a rapid fall in inflation over the next few quarters. It drops back below the 2% mark as from the fourth quarter of this year. In the light of economic developments, it will continue to decline until the end of the third quarter of 2009, and will then rise slightly over the next two quarters as a result of the base effect caused by oil price movements. Inflation will subsequently fall even further, to lie around 0.5% in 2010, before increasing somewhat over the course of 2011. This slight uptick in inflation at the end of 2011 is explained by the fact that a Libor of 0.5% does not represent an equilibrium level capable of guaranteeing price stability in the long term.  4 BIS Review 157/2008

Radovan Jelašić: Challenges for Serbia during the global economic turmoil Speech by Mr Radovan Jelašić, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, at the 4th Annual Forum – “Financial Services in South East Europe”, Belgrade, 4 December 2008. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is only four weeks until the end of the year and we may safely say that 2008 to date has been more eventful than the past 2 or 3 years taken together! Namely, no sooner had inflationary pressures subsided on the back of falling food and fuel prices than we were faced with another, even greater challenge. Global financial markets went into unprecedented turmoil, which has already affected Serbia and is likely to produce further effects in 2009. At times like these, however, it is of vital importance to be fully aware of the real state of things, and to adopt a pragmatic rather than a populist approach.  As we were well aware that Serbia had no political buffers, we made use of the relatively good times in the banking sector to prepare for the more difficult times we are now facing. Or as Warren Buffet famously said: “It is only when the tide goes out that you know who was swimming naked!” The unfortunate circumstances of late have given us a chance to prove that we were well prepared for the challenges, i.e. that we were not swimming “naked” on the tide of liquidity. And as usual we received no commendations for the strength of the country’s banking system which, though faced with high deposit withdrawals, successfully withstood the challenge, greater maybe than that faced by other banking systems of the region. The success of our banking sector, however, is obvious: a) Serbian taxpayers did not have to spend a single dinar on rescuing banks; b) NBS’ measures did not destabilize our banking sector – reserve requirement on domestic savings has remained at 40%; c) and the bank ownership structure has proved adequate in times of crisis.  For Serbia, a key question remains – what further steps to take in view of the global economic turmoil:  1. We should finally understand that the current macroeconomic policy cannot be continued: it is completely unrealistic to expect that the time of a) cheap foreign funds and b) plentiful foreign investment will suddenly return to help us finance our current account deficit of 15 – 20%. Now is the time of reckoning, and the sooner we accept this fact, the better it will be for all concerned: enterprises, banks, households, state, etc.  2. We must admit that current challenges are fast spilling over to Serbia, first as psychological effects and, as of late, as economic effects as well;  3. We must take emergency measures, both on a macro and on a micro level, to alleviate the effects of the financial turbulences. The budget of the Republic of Serbia will play a key role in that respect. And I am no longer talking about plans and intentions in general, but about building up concrete mechanisms and targeting figures to ensure not only sufficient liquidity levels but also an adequate volume of lending to enterprises.  Until about two months ago, I was often labeled a great pessimist who uses turbulences in international markets as a pretext for opposing an increase in pensions, which is, by the way, not based on real earnings. In the meantime, however, my pessimism has been surpassed by many, including those who had earlier argued that an increase in pensions would actually do us good. The reason for this is simple – the turmoil in international markets is now a good pretext for a U-turn in their economic policies! So, by a weird twist of events, I have suddenly been turned into an optimist again! BIS Review 157/2008 1 
The grounds for my cautious optimism are as follows:  - On 19 December this year, the IMF Executive Board is to approve an arrangement with Serbia, which will buttress macroeconomic stability in the country;  - The drafting of the Memorandum between the Government of the Republic of Serbia, National Bank of Serbia and Deposit Insurance Agency relating to stability and liquidity of the financial sector is expected to complete this week. The Memorandum will contain not only concrete mechanisms, but also exact figures.  - Full support of international financial institutions to Serbia will continue in 2009: • European Investment Bank: loans to SMEs; • European Bank for Reconstruction and Development: capital increases by banks, loans to SMEs and large enterprises; • German Reconstruction Bank (KfW): financing energy efficiency projects and SMEs through commercial banks; • Loans of the Government of the Republic of Italy. All of the above, of course, is an add-on to domestic bank loans and foreign loans.  - Measures taken so far by the NBS have not worked to the detriment of the stability of the banking sector, or better still, our reserve requirements have not been lowered, which means that we are ready to get to grips with any additional challenges ahead!  However, there are things that keep me awake at night:  - First, the media – their unprofessional, sensational and incomplete reporting on the crisis has played a significant role in the withdrawal of household deposits. Thus, in percentage terms, more money was withdrawn from banks in Serbia than in countries that have three times lower capital adequacy ratios and which saw government rescue packages worth a dozen billion euros! It is as if the media were competing in the dissemination of bad economic news, trying to convince the public that everything “is the same as it was two decades ago” even though everybody knows it is not!  - Second area of concern is action taken outside Serbia: Measures taken by some governments within the EU, and by the Brussels itself, have been only half-measures. They were not targeted enough and it will take quite a while before they kick in. Hence, it is very difficult for us in Serbia to take any measures that would complement those taken abroad! Although everyone seems to be falling over themselves in making promises, substantive details are scarce and the money even scarcer: save in England! Let me illustrate this by asking: Will the interbank market in Serbia revive or just liven up briefly if banks in Frankfurt, Vienna or Athens continue to mistrust one another? Somehow, I doubt it.  - The third reason for concern are the financial systems of the neighbouring countries: A stable banking system in Serbia is not sufficient in itself because if anything goes wrong in the region, it is bound to produce consequences for Serbia as well. To foreign institutional investors looking for emerging market opportunities it is all one and the same thing, although we, of course, know it is not.  - And finally, how much longer will this last and how much further will it go? I truly hope that the pessimists will be proved wrong and that the sums invested by central banks and governments of major world countries will manage to prevent the worst-case scenario.  Let us be clear – there are no magic bullets, just as there are no absolutely good or bad solutions. We should, however, keep our mind on the objectives of the National Bank of 2 BIS Review 157/2008 
Serbia – the primary being price stability and the secondary, financial stability. For this very reason, the National Bank of Serbia’s Monetary Policy Committee will, next Monday at the latest, consider the enactment of the following measures:  - To increase the share of foreign currency required reserves kept in dinars from 20 to 40 percent with a view to providing banks with extra foreign currency liquidity and withdrawing any excess dinars from circulation;  - To encourage banks to keep the released excess foreign currency liquidity in the domestic banking sector, rather than to use it to repay foreign debts or to reduce foreign deposits;  - To resume organizing fixing sessions as early as today since the current level of margins and trading volumes are not satisfactory;  - To lower the net open position of banks from 20 to only 10 percent, in order to reduce their exposure to the exchange rate risk.  In parallel, we have been drafting a decision to be adopted by mid-December to relax in 2009 requirements from some of the NBS regulations (e.g. 30%, 50% and 150% limits). Everybody says that Serbia performs best when backed into a corner. Well, we have been in that position for quite a while and some seem to have realized it only now. Understanding your position is necessary, but not in itself sufficient. In most difficult times during the process of transition, one should step up and not rest on one’s oars. Everybody is willing to help us, but no one will nor should do our job for us.  Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 157/2008 3 
Thomas Jordan: Swiss National Bank monetary policy in light of financial market disruptions  Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 11 December 2008. *      *      * Situation in the financial markets Looking at the financial markets, we currently find ourselves in a historically unprecedented situation. The financial crisis has escalated dramatically since September. In the course of the past three months, it has taken hold in almost every market segment around the globe. At the time of the last news conference in June, we had already experienced three waves of money market turbulence; now, a fourth wave has eclipsed all others (cf. chart 1).1The situation in the money markets has calmed somewhat since November. This is due in part to the measures taken by central banks and governments, in particular the generous amounts of liquidity injected into the system, the recapitalisation of banks, the provision of state guarantees for bank liabilities and the transfer of risk positions. After unsecured money markets had all but frozen in the autumn, central banks increasingly found themselves acting as lender of first resort, in other words, they were becoming the primary supplier of liquidity to the financial system. To this end, new monetary policy instruments and facilities were introduced, and the liquidity supply was expanded significantly. Despite the calming in the money markets, the situation in the stock and credit markets continued to worsen as a result of the rapid deterioration in economic conditions. I would like to illustrate the unique nature of the current situation with a comparison of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from five stock market crises (cf. chart 2).2 Price declines this time round are significantly steeper than those in 2000 and 1973 and not at all comparable with 1987, when the stock markets recovered very quickly. Measured by the extent of the Dow Jones losses, the current crisis can only be compared to that of 1929. Although the financial losses suffered this time have probably already far exceeded those of 1929. The reason for this is the considerably higher market capitalisation of the stock markets, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). What is more, the losses suffered today are not merely limited to the stock markets, they also affect practically every other type of asset, of which there are significantly more nowadays than back then. Prices have plummeted across the board, from corporate bonds to structured products, from raw materials and emerging market currencies to real estate investments. While US property prices dropped by 2% in 1929 and 4% in 1930, they are currently falling at a rate of 17%.3 Never before have so many assets been wiped out worldwide in the space of a few months as they were this year.                                                  1  Chart 1 shows the “fever curve” of the money market, i.e. the difference between the three-month Libor and the three-month (T)OIS rate (tom-next/overnight indexed swap). This difference reflects the credit and liquidity risk premium on unsecured money market trades. It is a barometer of the health of the money market and, in the broader sense, also for that of the financial markets in general. 2  The five crises in the comparison are the stock market crash of 1929, the oil crisis of 1973, Black Monday in 1987, the bursting of the IT bubble in 2000, and the current crisis. In each case, we look at price performance in and around the index’s highest recorded level prior to the crisis, which does not necessarily coincide with the onset of the turmoil. The highest levels were reached on 3 September 1929 (Black Tuesday was on 29 October 1929), on 11 January 1973 (oil crisis), on 25 August 1987 (Black Monday was on 19 October 1987), on 14 January 2000 (IT bubble), and on 9 October 2007. 3  For annual data and the Case-Shiller Composite 20 Index, cf. Robert J. Shiller, Irrational Exuberance (2006, 2nd edition). BIS Review 157/2008 1 
These financial losses alone will continue to have a major impact on the real economy for some time to come, owing to the fact that their full effect is not generally felt immediately.  Despite the historic disruptions in the financial markets, this is not the 1930s. The main differences to back then being the decisive way in which monetary and fiscal policy reacted and the far-reaching government intervention aimed at bolstering the financial system. As a result, the financial markets have been able to continue functioning, albeit to a much lesser extent. Yet the extraordinary circumstances pose a huge challenge to all market participants, not least to central banks. Both the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) monetary policy strategy and its instruments have been thoroughly put to the test. Over the past few months, several observers have remarked that the SNB’s monetary policy had occasionally slipped from its control. We do not share this view. While it cannot be ruled out that we will be faced with new challenges, our strategy and instruments have so far proved very flexible and well suited in this crisis. Implementation of monetary policy The SNB implements its monetary policy by defining a target range for the three-month Libor; an interest rate for an unsecured transaction. We cannot influence the three-month Libor directly, but rather indirectly through secured money market trades, such as repo transactions and swaps. Before the onset of the crisis, there was very little difference between the interest rates for secured and unsecured transactions. Rising risk premia have since widened the gap between the two rates, however. The high and volatile risk premia have made steering the three-month Libor increasingly challenging.  Tensions resulting from demand for the Swiss franc abroad have recently made steering the Libor even more difficult. In the past few years, a large number of Swiss franc loans have been granted in Europe that were refinanced through the Swiss banking system. Then, last October, many Swiss banks were suddenly no longer prepared to continue refinancing to the same extent, which put a considerable strain on the international Swiss franc money market. To solve the problem, we decided to offer other central banks a foreign exchange swap facility. Since 20 October, the SNB has been providing the European Central Bank (ECB) with Swiss francs in exchange for euros through its swap facility. The ECB then allocates the Swiss francs to its counterparties in the euro area through swap transactions. A similar agreement has been in operation with the National Bank of Poland since 17 November. In October, the turbulence in the money market caused the three-month Libor to overshoot the upper limit of the SNB’s target range for a few days (cf. chart 3). We do not, however, consider this a strategy failure. The overshoot was preceded by an interest rate reduction that had come as a surprise to the markets. The three-month Libor cannot be expected to return immediately to the middle of the new target range. Even in periods of calm, the Libor does not react instantly to an SNB interest rate reduction and the associated lowering of the repo rates. Considering the historic dimensions of the money market crisis, the three-month Libor managed to return remarkably quickly to the target range – just one day after the two interest rate reductions of 6 and 20 November the Libor had already moved into the new range in both cases. The turmoil in the money market prompted the SNB to conduct money market operations to an extent that had never before been witnessed. There were days when up to five auctions were held. The volume of the operations varied considerably. On record days, we carried out operations worth over CHF 100 billion. The reason for these sizeable operations can be found in our interest rate management – we first inject large amounts of liquidity into the market and later absorb it again. Until just a few weeks ago, the liquidity actually remaining in the system was not considerably higher than before the crisis. It was not until the SNB adopted a policy of very low money market rates that the sight deposit balances increased markedly. The low interest rate level means that the opportunity costs for banks to hold 2 BIS Review 157/2008 
liquidity are lower, thus prompting them to hold more money in sight deposits. The extent of the money market operations also has a major impact on the size of the SNB’s balance sheet. Before the crisis, approximately CHF 20 billion of the balance sheet went towards monetary policy; today, we are looking at around CHF 80 billion.  In recent weeks, the SNB has pursued a policy which has brought the repo rates close to zero. This does not mean, however, that our monetary policy will cease to transmit further expansionary impulses. In addition to the short-term repo rate, we use a whole range of other methods to pursue a more expansionary monetary policy. We can, for instance, extend the maturities of our money market transactions or intervene in markets other than the money market. Updates to monetary policy instruments The SNB’s monetary policy instruments have fared quite well since the onset of the crisis. However, a review has highlighted two areas in need of adjustment. First, a liquidity-absorbing instrument was found to be necessary, and second, the conditions of the liquidity-shortage financing facility were no longer deemed appropriate. The liquidity-shortage financing facility serves to bridge unexpected, short-term liquidity bottlenecks. It can only be accessed if a bank has a corresponding limit and if that limit is fully covered by securities at all times. Let’s start with the liquidity-absorbing instrument: The crisis has made it clear that a central bank must be able to offer large quantities of liquidity at short notice and do so via a number of channels and with different maturities. Repo transactions and foreign exchange swaps meet these requirements very well. However, the SNB lacked a separate liquidity-absorbing instrument to handle large volumes. We therefore introduced our own debt certificates – SNB Bills – to our range of instruments in October. SNB Bills allow us to be more flexible in steering liquidity. Consequently, we are now in a position to offer more long-term transactions, which help calm the money markets and facilitate the steering of the three-month Libor.  The financial market crisis has also shown us that the liquidity-shortage financing facility can only contribute to calming the situation in the money markets if it is actually used when needed. However, even during the crisis, it was rarely called upon. The reason for this being that the direct costs of drawing on it were relatively high, as were the indirect costs ensuing from the stigma associated with using the facility.  The SNB has thus decided to lower the direct and indirect costs of using the facility. To start with, we will reduce the special-rate interest premium from 200 basis points to 50 basis points. This will become effective from 1 January 2009. The SNB will also make some changes to its reporting methods. In order to protect the borrower’s reputation, claims from the liquidity-shortage financing facility will, in future, no longer be reported separately. These two measures should encourage banks to utilise the facility’s limits more frequently and therefore increase their liquidity provisioning.  We have also found that, in periods of turbulence, some of the data reported in our weekly publication Important monetary policy data are misinterpreted, which can have a destabilising effect. To remedy this, we have decided to discontinue the real-time announcement of individual transactions and facilities. The only data relevant for the assessment of the situation in the money market are those on sight deposits and interest rates. We will therefore continue to publish these on a weekly basis. From now on, data on individual balance sheet items and monetary policy operations will only be published in the SNB’s Monthly Statistical Bulletin. Thus, the SNB essentially continues to report on its monetary policy operations in a transparent manner, the only difference being that certain data will be published less frequently. Our Guidelines on monetary policy instruments have been revised accordingly. These will enter into effect on 1 January 2009. BIS Review 157/2008 3 
Transaction with UBS On 16 October, the SNB announced that it had concluded an agreement with UBS on the long-term financing and orderly liquidation of troubled assets in the amount of no more than USD 60 billion. To facilitate this transaction, a special purpose vehicle was set up at the end of November called SNB StabFund Limited Partnership for Collective Investments, which is domiciled in Berne. The company is structured as a two-party limited partnership. It comprises a general partner, which bears unlimited liability, and a limited partner, bearing limited liability. Both will be wholly owned by the SNB. The SNB and UBS formed a joint project management team, which is supported when necessary by external specialists.  In the meantime, the SNB chose Northern Trust to act as custodian of the securities. We also commissioned specialised agencies to carry out an independent valuation of the portfolio. An initial tranche of assets is due to be transferred to StabFund before the end of this year. As regards the financing of StabFund, the SNB will contribute 90% of the funding in the form a loan; UBS, 10% in the form of equity capital. The SNB is currently securing the initial financing for the operation via its swap agreement with the Federal Reserve, but also on the foreign exchange market. It has also initiated steps to later be able to obtain funding on the market, independent of agreements with other central banks.  The transfer of assets to the StabFund will be based on prices as at 30 September 2008, with the UBS book value being compared to the value determined by SNB on the basis of the independent expert opinions. The lower value will apply. In October and November, following the intensification of the financial market crisis and the global economic downturn, the prices for these assets were pushed down further. The extent of any potential loss in this initial phase of StabFund’s existence will only become apparent at the end of 2008 or at the end of March 2009, once the asset transfer has been completed and another comprehensive valuation has been carried out. It is important to note that StabFund is primarily pursuing a buy-and-hold-to-maturity strategy with the portfolio at present. Short-term price movements have no bearing on the strategy’s success. A recovery of the affected markets in the long term is by far the more decisive factor here. Furthermore, the SNB has put in place two safety nets to cushion any losses on its loan to StabFund. First, with the 10% of equity capital from the UBS, and second, with a payment of up to 100 million UBS shares in the event that StabFund needs to be liquidated at a loss. The volatile price movements and severe illiquidity of the markets go to show just how important it was to have unburdened UBS of these risks when we did.  4 BIS Review 157/2008

Randall S Kroszner: Assessing the potential for instability in financial markets Speech by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Risk Minds Conference, International Center for Business Information, Geneva, 8 December 2008. The original speech, which contains a link to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. *      *      * Good morning. I am honored to give the opening remarks at this impressive conference. Today, I would like to offer some thoughts about risks in financial markets and the manner in which banking organizations need to assess those risks.1 In particular, I will note the problems that can arise when the safeguards that market participants employ for their individual positions can have the unintended effect of actually exacerbating market-wide distress and amplifying losses among multiple market participants during times of market turbulence. But before offering recommendations that might serve to address these problems for banking institutions, I believe it is worthwhile to take a step back and explore some conceptual issues about the organization of markets.  A conceptual framework for the organization of markets In the simplified world of an introductory economics class, a market brings together the potential buyers and sellers of a product to negotiate prices and quantities. In this paradigm, the invisible hand of the market matches all willing buyers and sellers at a single, market-clearing price. Transactions occur instantaneously and costlessly. While this stripped-down story is remarkably powerful in its essential predictions about the behavior of markets and economic agents, it leaves the operation of the market itself as a mystery. Any real-world market must deal with at least two fundamental questions: first, how do the buyers and sellers find one another? And second, how can buyers be assured that sellers will deliver as promised, and that the goods will be of the quality and value that the buyer expects? To understand how markets deal with the fundamental issues of transaction costs and information costs is an important and enduring challenge for economists. Market institutions arise to overcome these barriers to trade, but do not arise wholly-formed and perfect. Market institutions evolve. Buyers and sellers gravitate towards markets that prove most effective in fostering transactions, and this rewards successful innovation and refinement in the institutional forms of markets. As market institutions adapt to serve the particular needs of their participants, they grow more varied and specialized. The imperfections and ongoing evolution of market institutions have inspired a rich and insightful literature within economics. Returning to the first question, how do buyers and sellers find one another in the real world? Each side might be aware that potential counterparties exist, but not where and when to find them. Information problems of this sort, often termed search costs, have since ancient times been overcome by designating a market by location, time and product. The Pushkar camel fair, which draws 50,000 camels for trade to a small desert town in western India at the full moon in November, is a colorful but not atypical example. In the financial world, a corresponding institution is the exchange. Many exchanges have their historical roots as                                                  1  In my remarks, I will use the terms "banks," "banking institutions," and "banking organizations" interchangeably. BIS Review 156/2008 1 
gatherings of speculators at a coffee house or other designated public place for a daily or weekly session to buy and sell securities.2  The introduction of new technology can change the institutional structure of markets. Improved telecommunications has made it possible to relax coordination on the physical location of markets. Once a building, the exchange is now a network of screens. Furthermore, by dramatically reducing the cost of locating counterparties and comparing prices, technology has increased the scope for decentralized markets such as OTC derivative markets. Decentralized markets excel at providing variety and thus at accommodating the idiosyncratic needs of investors and consumers.  Returning to our second question, then, how can buyers be assured of quality goods in a real-world marketplace? Whenever quality and value are costly to verify, how can buyers be assured that the seller will not deliver subpar goods? Market institutions have arisen to address these concerns. A seller might invest in bolstering its reputation for delivering quality goods or offer a warranty. Standardized grading is a convention that facilitates the unambiguous specification of quality in a contract. An important milestone in the development of commodity markets was the promulgation in 1856 by the Chicago Board of Trade of standardized grades of wheat.3 This allowed buyers and sellers of wheat to trade in standardized "warehouse receipts," rather than specific lots, with inexpensive quality verification by third-party policy and certification. The idea of standardized grading and third-party assessment was introduced to credit markets by rating agencies in the early 20th century. Of course, as recent events have made clear, the qualitative and multi-faceted nature of credit risk limits the extent to which investors can or should rely on ratings as the sole measure of quality.  A more subtle form of the quality assurance problem arises when a transaction results in future contingent obligations by the counterparties. Future obligations are common in financial markets, where the risk of nonperformance is known as counterparty credit risk. In a credit default swap, for example, each side is seeking to alter credit exposure to the reference entity. The resulting contingent credit exposure to the counterparty is entirely incidental to the reason for the transaction, yet may be a first-order determinant of future performance.  Financial markets have developed mechanisms that are specific to the control of counterparty risk. The simplest of these is the posting of collateral against counterparty exposures. Ensuring the efficacy of collateral is challenging even under ordinary circumstances, and may leave counterparties especially vulnerable to large sudden changes in market prices, also called gap risk.  A more sophisticated convention for mitigating counterparty credit risk is a central counterparty or a clearinghouse. In markets with a clearinghouse, all trades are intermediated through a central counterparty. This arrangement can and, in practice, does vastly reduce counterparty risk. The central counterparty runs a balanced book, so generally has no direct market exposure. In the case of a member's default, the central counterparty can draw upon the proprietary margin of the defaulting member, its own reserve fund, and the assessment of members for share purchase. As you know, plans are currently being developed to establish one or more central counterparties in the credit derivatives market. So why do we not find a central counterparty in every financial market? A key reason is that the gain in safety may come at the expense of flexibility. Like an exchange, a central                                                  2  The early antecedents to the New York Stock Exchange and other fascinating stories of market formation are elegantly and insightfully recounted in John McMillan, "Reinventing the Bazaar," W.W. Norton & Co, 2002. 3  See section 1 in Randall S. Kroszner, "Can the Financial Markets Privately Regulate Risk?", Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking 31(3), August 1999. 2 BIS Review 156/2008 
counterparty imposes a degree of standardization upon contracts. As noted earlier, OTC derivative markets have grown so rapidly in large part due to the demand for variety and customization of contracts. That said, many OTC contracts are already eligible for clearing through a central counterparty. For example, SwapClear, a central counterparty for interest rate swaps, clears about half of global single-currency swaps between dealers.  Assessing recent financial market performance Now that I have laid out a conceptual framework about markets and how participants ensure the quality of transactions, I would like briefly to apply that conceptual framework to the events of the past 18 months. Financial crisis can serve as a powerful stimulant to the evolution of market mechanisms, and I expect that the aftermath of the present turmoil will see both innovation and incremental refinement to quality assurance in credit markets and in counterparty credit risk management. I would like to highlight two themes that I believe will influence this process. First, for quality assurance to be effective, some of the products traded in financial markets have to become simpler and more transparent. Product complexity and a lack of transparency are at the root of many of the problems that have emerged, especially in the markets for securitizations and structured credit products. I elaborated on these themes in remarks I made at a Federal Reserve conference last week on the future of the mortgage market.4 There I argued that a recovery in the market for mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) will require greater transparency and less complexity, and importantly, comprehensive and standardized loan-level data that will allow more independent credit analysis. For example, the structures of cash flows from mortgage payments in the pool to the various tranches of MBSs should be much less complex than some of those created in recent years, and securitization contracts will need to be made more homogeneous so as to allow greater comparability of risk profiles across deals and perhaps promote more robust liquidity.  I believe that a new infrastructure for MBSs built upon these foundations might be reasonably expected to lower the costs of information production and processing in the marketplace. The reduction of these costs will facilitate broader independent credit analyses, greater due diligence by potential purchasers, and, hence, greater ability to provide a double check on credit rating agencies' evaluation of the riskiness of the securities. In other words, market participants would be more likely to acquire the expertise to evaluate securities issues that were more homogeneous and less complex.  A second key factor for effective quality assurance relates to the institutional and contractual framework for ensuring future performance on financial transactions, namely counterparty credit risk management. Counterparty credit risk management should be focused on its effectiveness in different market situations and its implications for financial stability. There is a broad class of market practices that can provide useful protections when an individual firm experiences trouble but these practices may not provide useful protections – and could be potentially harmful – when the trouble is marketwide.  A representative example is the use of rating triggers in counterparty credit risk management. Some debt contracts and OTC derivative contracts link collateral requirements to a counterparty's credit rating. If a counterparty is downgraded past some threshold, it may become subject to an immediate margin call. Counterparty credit risk appears to remain contained so long as the rating trigger is breached long before the counterparty could reach insolvency – that is, the trigger is set at a relatively high rating. In such cases, this type of                                                  4  Randall S.

clause can be quite valuable in mitigating counterparty credit risk and in giving the counterparty strong incentives to try to maintain its financial health and, hence, its rating.  This type of protection against counterparty risk is most effective when changes in risk are specific to the counterparty and not correlated with increases in risks to other counterparties and in other markets. In this case, the posting of additional collateral long before a firm reaches insolvency can provide valuable protection. Such a provision may not provide protection, however, if the rating change comes too late, the firm is on the brink of insolvency, and the requirement to post the margin can push it into insolvency.  More importantly, such a provision may also fail to provide protection if the trouble at the counterparty is correlated with trouble at other institutions and in other markets, that is, due to marketwide distress. In times of widespread distress, many counterparties may have to sell assets simultaneously to post margin. This occurrence can potentially lead to a situation in the market in which assets are sold quickly and below their fundamental values. When many counterparties are forced to liquidate similar assets, prices for those assets are pushed down. If these assets are used as collateral on other positions, then the decline in value leads to additional margin calls. This set of circumstances, in turn, forces further liquidation and price declines. A widespread use of rating triggers can accelerate this downward slide, with further losses in asset values triggering additional downgrades and requirements to post collateral and liquidate positions. Recent events have demonstrated this potentially destabilizing dynamic at work. Rating triggers are certainly only one example of market practices that can exacerbate the impact of a systemic event and make financial markets less stable. Credit enhancements and guarantees can also create fragility while seeming to offer protection. A highly-rated guarantor, for example, could offer effective protection against the default of a small number of instruments. In the event of a market-wide increase in credit risk, however, there is an increased probability that the guarantor would be required to pay out on many positions simultaneously. As the market comes to realize that the credit enhancement may not be effective, further pressure may come upon the institutions that would be left exposed. Thus, widespread reliance on credit enhancements could induce a form of "wrong way risk" in which the seller of protection becomes most likely to default in precisely the circumstances where protection is most valued.  What might seem like a "herd" behavior in some markets may be at least in part a response to the fragile interconnections affecting the stability of those markets. Such apparent herding behavior, reflecting a collective loss of confidence, may be generated by a market infrastructure that induces co-movements across markets and institutions during times of stress. In these circumstances, contractual provisions that might seem on the surface to be prudent counterparty risk management could increase financial market stress. Improving banks' risk management for participation in financial markets Marketwide credit events and stresses, and how market infrastructure could exacerbate them, did not receive sufficient attention in risk management efforts in the period leading up to the current turmoil. For example, risk managers did not fully contemplate the possibility that many participants would need to unwind their positions at the same time, that such actions might present substantial losses for several key counterparties, and that collateral posted as protection for positions would fall in value at the same time. There was not sufficient understanding of the correlation between declines in collateral value and the likelihood that collateral would need to be called upon. Similar issues arose with third-party guarantees and with hedging strategies that had less effectiveness than anticipated. Even when risk managers had some understanding of these issues, each individually likely faced difficulty in demanding more collateral or guarantees during good times because no risk manager wanted to be the first. 4 BIS Review 156/2008 
A key factor for assuring market quality, as I noted above, is assessing the behavior of counterparties in stressful times. Not only do banks need to assess counterparty creditworthiness and behavior on an individual basis, they also need to assess counterparties on a collective basis. They need to understand how their own actions to protect positions can put pressure on key counterparties, especially when other market participants are likely to be taking similar action to protect themselves. So beyond ensuring that their own individual positions are sound and well protected, banks need to assess whether there is a systematic component to a market that could adversely affect multiple counterparties at the same time, and thereby affect their own risk exposures. As we have seen, a counterparty does not need to be technically insolvent for it to be shunned by other market participants. The anticipation of downgrades, triggers, and so forth could very quickly cause a firm to lose funding and fail. In short, banks and regulators need to understand the type of market conditions that will exist when there is likely to be reliance on collateral, guarantees, or other contract clauses. It is then important to assess the likelihood that the bank's safeguarding actions could worsen market conditions and actually increase its losses. Might the bank only realize collateral at substantially reduced prices? Would multiple counterparties suffer distress at the same time? Would guarantors perform in times of distress? In other words, would the collateral, guarantee, insurance, hedge, and so forth work in precisely the time the institution would need it most, that is, during a market stress event? These are important questions that regulators and supervisors are asking in the Basel Committee and in the Financial Stability Forum, and I represent the Federal Reserve System on both of these bodies. Naturally, these types of questions underscore the importance of stress testing and scenario analysis that focus on market-wide events. Such stress tests would include the potential for key counterparties to fail or suffer difficulty at the same time, for market liquidity to erode and remain low for some time, and for market participants to view the bank itself as an impaired counterparty. And these stress tests, when properly designed, can provide information that typical statistical models may leave out or have trouble capturing, such as abnormally large jumps or market moves, evaporation of liquidity, prolonged periods of market distress, or structural changes in markets. Stress tests are most useful when they aim to include potential secondary or "knock-on" effects, which are also often difficult to model with standard techniques. In these ways, stress tests can serve as a complementary tool to other risk measures.  Even if the ex ante estimate of the probability of joint distress among counterparties appears small, it is still useful to know the severity of such an outcome, since it may clearly reveal an unacceptable loss. Importantly, banks should also conduct stress tests across several markets, since some counterparties are key players across many financial markets and their inability to repay could cascade across those markets.  Of course, based on their consideration of the factors noted above and the results of their stress tests, banks may reassess their participation in certain markets and exercise greater caution to account for potential "tail" risks and better protect themselves in times of market-wide stress. One of the first things they may do is increase their internal assessments of capital needs for these activities, given the added risks that stress tests reveal. They may wish to restructure contracts or alter terms. Institutions also might ask for higher initial margin, given that subsequent calls may not provide as much risk mitigation during distress. They may wish to ask for more collateral, or ensure that the collateral is less linked to the counterparty's condition or broader market distress. Or they might look for other ways to enhance their assessment of counterparties, and, perhaps more importantly, the potential for counterparties to encounter difficulties during marketwide stresses. Additionally, they may wish to conduct more of their trading and hedging on more organized exchanges or with clearinghouses, to benefit from the safeguards I noted earlier in my remarks.

Some banks, acting on a collective basis, may decide to take action to improve the quality assurance performance of markets during future times of stress. Trade associations in the banking industry may consider additional safeguards to reduce the impact of systematic risks among counterparties; for example, banks may collectively act to remove uncertainty associated with back-office inefficiencies and related risks in the credit default swaps market. Another example, as I noted in remarks last week, is an attempt to enhance mortgage markets so that there is greater standardization of data and simpler, more homogeneous provisions in the securitizations, and less reliance on third-party monitoring.5  As a more general step, banks should hold higher liquidity and capital buffers, since the enhancements I just noted are still no guarantee against future market distress that could cause correlated and cascading losses among market participants. Finally, banks need to exercise strong discipline so that when good times return, they do not forget the current market difficulties and return to more profligate ways. Indeed, now is the time for banks to establish good risk management policies addressing the issues I have just discussed, so that strong risk discipline is codified.  Concluding thoughts  Of course, it is not just the banking industry, but also those of us in the public sector who have some key lessons to learn. Banks and supervisors alike need to undertake additional work to facilitate the building of robust methods of quality assurance in the financial markets that will help to restore and maintain confidence. Ensuring that banks exercise good risk management, of course, is an important job for bank supervisors, which includes overseeing their ability to properly capture the risks in the markets in which they operate, as well as their ability to conduct appropriate stress testing to explore potential consequences of different types of market distress. Doing so requires that supervisors themselves develop a strong understanding of the value, limits, and potential harms associated with banks' attempts to protect their exposures. At the Federal Reserve, we have already begun to enhance our supervisory work in this area and are communicating expectations to banks. At the international level, we are working with our colleagues in other countries and within international bodies, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision – which is meeting later this week – and the Financial Stability Forum, to investigate whether other practices could be adopted around the world to mitigate the challenges I have outlined above. This work will be a major focus during the next few months and over the course of 2009.                                                  5  Randall S.
