3% range. a definition full employment,i’ll use consensus estimate unemployment threshold, currently around 5½%. i mightadd considerable uncertainty estimate, particularly light consistentbis review 23/1998 -

4 -between target arise one two circumstances. a conflict arise begin inflation aboveour objective. unfortunately, monetary policy reduce inflation temporarily impose someslack economy. in case, low inflation would mean depart fullemployment. once inflation fall target level, economy could return full employmentand enjoy consistency two objectives. a second source conflict arise response asupply shock, increase oil prices. assume begin full employment pricestability sharp rise oil prices. this tend raise inflation short run anddepress output. what monetary policy do? tighten unwind increase inflation? or loosento counter increase unemployment?the natural hurdle make monetary policy challenge task, require application ofboth good judgment appropriate models, art science.operating strategy fomc meetingnow appreciate challenge nature monetary policy, ready todevelop strategy implement open market operations. the first question ask whether policyshould carry accord well-defined precise formula, rule, whether beimplemented judgmentally. my point recall longstanding debate rule vs.discretion, emphasize good policy systematic rule-like, even notformally tie specific rule. in addition, learn lot principle guide discretionarypolicy examine rule show effective stabilize property models.as i note earlier, monetary policy implement unite states, mostcentral banks, control interest rates. at meeting, fomc set intend federalfunds rate target. the federal fund rate interest rate overnight loan inter-bank market. itis therefore rate pay reserve borrow lend among banks. and natural target toachieve via open market operation since operation effect inject withdraw reserves.the federal fund rate currently 5.5%. the fomc announce change targetimmediately follow conclusion meetings. it also explicitly incorporate target fund ratein “directive” manager system open market account, position alan holmes hold atthe federal reserve bank new york. this directive instruct manager implement open marketoperations period next fomc meet maintain federal fundsrate close possible intend rate.point departure: constant money growth rulegiven federal reserve, like central bank today, operate set anear-term interest rate target, focus develop guide principle set interestrate target, precisely, adjust interest rate target response change economicconditions. i find useful begin search, perhaps surprisingly, develop propertiesof constant money supply growth rule. this help identify essential property amonetary policy strategy, apply interest rate target well, highlight practicaldifficulties carry monetary policy use money supply targets.another reason start monetary aggregate strategy monetaryaggregates play significant role implementation monetary policy holmes’service manager system open market account. the directive manager fomcduring period often specify term maintain change “money market conditions” (acode federal fund rate), unless growth monetary aggregate depart significantly themidpoints specify ranges. sometimes directive specify directly term desiredcourse monetary aggregates, case typically subject acceptable range federalfunds rate. this give money growth direct role conduct policy today.bis review 23/1998 - 5 -let’s see money growth might useful target implement monetarypolicy. economic theory suggest that, demand money stable, rate money growth willpin rate growth nominal income. under reasonable assumptions, constant rate moneygrowth yield growth nominal income, average, rate. the rate money growthshould set achieve rate nominal income growth equal rate trend growth realoutput rate inflation consistent policy objective. on average long run, thisrate money growth achieve fed’s inflation objective.so first proposition money growth target provide nominal anchor whichpins long-run inflation rate. this strategy immediately allow translation long-run pricestability objective near-term money supply growth target. and, implication, monetarypolicy strategy must mimic nominal anchor property money supply target, consistentwith federal reserve’s mandate price stability.next, let’s ask would happen economy subject shock move itaway price stability full employment. if real output increase fast trend and/or inflationincreases relative fed’s objective, result high nominal income growth, relative theconstant rate money growth, would result increase interest rates. the second property amoney supply target build stability economy insure pro-cyclical movement theinterest rate response demand shocks. another way say insure monetarypolicy automatically lean cyclical wind stabilize economy.the taylor rule strategy interest rate operate proceduredespite desirable property constant money growth rule, principle, mostcentral bank implement policy set short-term interest rate practice. this choice reflect leasttwo considerations. first, instability money demand reduce usefulness money supply targets.second, interest rate target allow central bank smooth effect transitory shock tofinancial markets.but feed vary interest rate “instrument” achieve ultimateobjectives? the simple answer interest rate vary imitate qualitatively way theywould behave feed implement money supply target. in words, interest rate need tobe vary systematically effectively impose nominal anchor insure policy lean thecyclical winds. set monetary policy manner via interest rate target, principle, allow thefed achieve best worlds. it impose nominal anchor short-run stabilizationproperties would case money growth rule, but, time, smooth shorter-runvolatility interest rates. in addition, careful choice degree response interest rate tochanging economic conditions, rule can, principle, improve upon stabilization property amoney supply rule.a simple specification strategy vary federal fund rate response tochanging economic condition provide taylor rule, rule develop john taylor, aprofessor stanford university.the appeal taylor rule simple specify federal fund rate(effectively fed’s instrument) vary directly response inflation deviation ofoutput inflation fed’s ultimate target full employment price stability. my point hereis extol virtue precise specification taylor rule, use highlight ofthe central principle guide decision set fund rate.it useful appreciate taylor derive rule view role inmonetary policy. the rule emerge taylor’s analysis simulation variety rule varietyof models. he conclude simple form embody taylor rule had, base work,excellent stabilize properties. the rule therefore initially develop normative guide, meaningbis review 23/1998 - 6 -a set principle guide policy that, followed, would result relatively good economicperformance, least compare rule perhaps relative historic u economic performance.subsequently, taylor find rule describe reasonably well way policy indeed carry outover last decade. that is, rule also descriptive recent policymaking.the taylor rule begin assume level real federal fund rateconsistent full employment stable inflation. the real interest rate nominal interest rate lesssome measure inflation expectation (measured taylor actual inflation last year) -- ameasure increase purchase power (rather dollars) associate hold asset.taylor call equilibrium real interest rate assume 2%. let’s assume economyis initially full employment price stability. then level real nominal interest rate wouldbe set 2%. i go quibble choice, i focus general principlesrather precise details.the economy is, course, always full employment price stability thepurpose taylor rule specify federal fund rate respond shock push theeconomy away price stability and/or full employment. because objective explicitlyincorporated rule, provide discipline approach juggle dual mandate monetarypolicy.the real equilibrium interest rate view consistent full employment anystable rate inflation. so first implication rule that, order consistent fullemployment, nominal interest rate adjust response inflation maintain theequilibrium real interest rate.the next message rule concern real federal fund rate adjustedin response deviation output inflation full employment price stability. accord tothe rule, output rise relative potential output, real interest rate rise. when inflation risesrelative inflation target, real interest rate also rise. these movement real interest ratesin response departure inflation output target level show stabilize outputand inflation relative targets.the danger interest rate strategythere natural danger inherent interest rate targeting, least absence arule guide adjustment change economic conditions. if cyclical movement output aredominated demand shocks, failure move interest rate aggressively enough response theshocks result monetary policy destabilize rather stabilize economy. for example, ifthere demand shock result high income and/or prices, demand money increase,putting upward pressure interest rates. if feed maintain unchanged nominal interest rate target,it add reserve support high money supply initial interest rate. this mean that,under constant interest rate target, demand shock would lead perverse monetary policy, specificallyto stimulative open market operations, reinforce rather damp demand shock.the inherent danger interest rate target reinforce preference centralbankers smooth interest rates. this preference take two forms. first, preference forimplementing rise rate series small change direction. second, areluctance change direction policy, without particularly strong rationale. nevertheless, interestrate target can, principle, implement way avoid pitfall, one value ofrules remind policymakers importance adjust interest rate response changingeconomic conditions, thereby prevent policy become destabilizing.bis review 23/1998 -

8 -risk high inflation future, raise interest rate today response observe increase inutilization rate forward-looking policy relative simply respond current inflation.forward-looking policy sometimes say pre-emptive. a movement interestrates response rise utilization rate would say pre-emptive move inflation. thetaylor rule thus allow combination pre-emptive policy, change interest rate response tochanges utilization rates, reactive policy, change interest rate response movement ininflation itself. so good policy pre-emptive reactive.a still forward-looking approach would policymakers respond toactual inflation utilization rates, taylor rule, forecast project inflation andutilization rates, assume unchanged nominal federal fund rate. a good reason respond toforecasts inflation effect monetary policy economy mostly occur yearfrom now. there considerable amount work way ass usefulness use forecastsas oppose past information unemployment inflation specification interest rate rules.there clear historical example forward-looking policy would animprovement. these episode illustrate simple rule guide good policy sometimesmeans follow rule sometimes mean use judgment improve upon rule. judgement isespecially call situation special event point future change output inflation thatwould ordinarily view unlikely. the current episode provide good example situationin much gain forward-looking policy. the economy enter 1998 withconsiderable forward momentum, already operate high utilization rates. this momentumreflected persistent strength domestic demand, particularly consumer spend business fixedinvestment. however, financial currency crisis asia project result sharp declinein net export would otherwise occur promise slow expansion absenceof policy action, perhaps substitute monetary tighten otherwise might beenjustified. in environment, backward-looking policy ignore potential drag futuredemand asia could risk magnify effect shift aggregate demand.rule no. 4: the appropriate policy response may depend source persistence ofthe shock. let distinguish two type shock economy. the first persistent demandshock -- example, increase aggregate demand result persistent departure trendgrowth persistent change utilization rates. this symmetric effects, raise outputand inflation, present relatively straightforward monetary policy problem well handle bythe first set rules.a second source shock supply shock, example would one-time,permanent increase oil prices. we several example sharp increase oil prices,especially 1970s, and, recently, oil price decline since end 1996. whenthere sharp rise oil prices, temporary burst inflation. in addition, adversesupply shock typically result decline aggregate demand hence output employment.this thus example situation conflict dual objective fullemployment price stability, and, such, represent one great challenge monetarypolicy. the surge inflation appear demand rise real interest rates, hence particularlysharp increase nominal rates; decline output employment appear call declinein real interest rates.experience suggest supply shock yield sharp transitory increase inflation,often follow smaller, permanent effect, though longer-run effect inflation willobviously importantly dictate response monetary policy. give transitory nature theinitial inflation surge, policy well look instead focus persistent (andmodest) inflation consequence shock. by policymakers respond expeditiously badnews, avoid mistake overreacting.bis review 23/1998 - 9 -one reason cautious approach policy cannot much affect inflation thenear term, instead primary effect come year two. hence policy today shouldfocus inflation next year. policy tighten, real interest rate rise, extent thatinflation expect high next year account supply shock. this might reflect effectof supply shock today’s oil price raise overall inflation, and, effect inflation wagebargaining, impact broad measure price change subsequent quarters.one way handle within taylor rule specify rule use measure ofcore inflation, mean one exclude oil food prices, price component subject tosupply shocks. this help policy “look through” initial burst inflation, may fail toproduce appropriate immediate adjustment counter permanent effect shock oninflation subsequent quarters. another perhaps good way respond supply shock beforward look respond forecast future inflation, rather current inflation. thisavoids overly aggressive response initial burst overall inflation insufficientimmediate response inappropriate focus measure inflation ignore currentrise oil prices.art sciencework policy rule experience implement policy interest rate regimehave, i believe, help define set principle i discussed. they are, i would remind you,only perspective strategy monetary policy, official doctrine fomc. we havemuch learn, structure economy best way implement policy.the role rule best view judgment inform monetary policydecision, dictate it. no single rule best policy circumstances, i hope i havedemonstrated discussion. sometimes respond recent trend data work well, butsometimes forward-looking policy critical, might case current environment.sometimes unusual circumstance dictate departure rule might suggested. anexample would maintain stimulative policy -- effectively zero real federal fundsrate -- 1992 1993, period well current expansion. this turn out, judgment,to excellent policy, though departure taylor rule, take account theunusual structural drag restrain expansion justify maintain monetary stimuluslonger normal expansion. and, finally, monetary policy sensitive potentialfor structural change alter fundamental relationships.science form economic theory, econometric models, carefully designedrules improve conduct monetary policy. but good policy always be, alan holmesunderstood well, blend art science. each u fomc strive become monetarypolicy artist alan holmes participate fomc distinguish career.bis review 23/1998 mr. ferguson look bank supervision consult perspectiveremarks mr. roger w. ferguson, jr., member board governor usfederal reserve system, conference state bank supervisor washington, dcon 9/3/98.it pleasure join today. the federal reserve long enjoy acooperative relationship conference state bank supervisors, i expect thatrelationship continue.as well aware, technological financial innovation become thenorm bank bank supervision. these innovation accelerate pace oftransactions increase complexity transaction see throughout bank system.this pattern expect continue year ahead. indeed, complexity andinnovation lead us, supervisors, toward risk-focused supervisory approach witha great emphasis sound management processes. only ensure bank’smanagement control process sound confident risk remaincontained throughout business market cycles.it intention today espouse merit risk-focused examinations,since i trust recognize value approach, especially case larger,more-complex bank institutions. i would like focus challenge face wemove toward risk-focused examinations. this challenge conundrum capture acomment i hear last year dinner host bank administration institute. a leadingbanker dinner compliment regulator supervisor examiner provided“consultations” end examinations. since review management control processesis much “consultative” activity, i suspect comment become morecommonplace.being perceive like consultant useful, unalloyedblessing. a i reflect compliment i heard, i wonder consult metaphor wasreally one encourage. we maintain strong vibrantbanking system responsive need public. that part role assupervisors. we also work hard ensure supervision examinationprocesses unduly burdensome bank examine. we supportive offinancial modernization, process overdue bank industry. we also want toprovide guidance bank sound practice evaluate extent conducttheir activity prudent ways. but cautious fully adopt label“consultants.”in comment morning, i would like draw experience aconsultant bank financial institution discus similarity differences,as i see them, role consultant role supervisor.i raise topic today recent turmoil asia root poorbanking performance poor bank supervision. i believe market ultimately thebest regulator financial services, still need supervision regulation offsetthe limitation inherent regulation market. the recent turmoil asia serf areminder risk financial institution take systemic impact emerge ifsupervisors mindful important role continue play contain thatrisk.bis review 24/1998 -

3 -organizations, appear warranted. in particular, i would note three: first, formal capital ratiorequirements, flow particular insolvency probability standard, are, forthe part, arbitrary. all corporate loans, example, place single 8 percent “bucket”.second, requirement account credit risk market risk, explicitly operate andother form risk may also important. third, except trade account activities, capitalstandards take account hedging, diversification, difference risk managementtechniques, especially portfolio management.these deficiency understand even accord crafted. indeed, wasin response concern that, much 1990s, regulatory agency focus onimproving supervisory oversight capital adequacy bank-by-bank basis. in recent years, thefocus supervisory effort unite state internal risk measurement andmanagement process banks. this emphasis internal process drive partly theneed make supervisory policy risk-focused light increase complexity bankingactivities. in addition, approach reinforce market incentive prompt banksthemselves invest heavily recent year improve management information system andinternal system quantifying, pricing, manage risk.while appropriate supervisory procedure evolve encompass change inindustry practices, must also sure improvement form content formalcapital regulation keep pace. inappropriate regulatory capital standards, whether low highin specific circumstances, entail significant economic costs. this resource allocation effect ofcapital regulation see clearly compare basle standard internal “economiccapital” allocation process large bank companies. for internal purposes, theselarge institution attempt explicitly quantify credit, market, operate risks, estimatingloss probability distribution various risk positions. enough economic, distinct regulatory,capital allocate risk position satisfy institution’s standard insolvencyprobability. within credit risk models, example, capital internal purpose often allocate soas hypothetically “cover” 99.9 percent estimate loss probability distribution.these internal capital allocation model much teach supervisor, arecritical understand possible misallocative effect inappropriate capital rules. for example,while basle standard lump corporate loan 8 percent capital “bucket”, banks’internal capital allocation individual loan vary considerably -- le 1 percent wellover 30 percent -- depend estimate riskiness position question. in case wherea group loan attract internal capital charge low compare basle eightpercent standard, bank strong incentive undertake regulatory capital arbitrage structurethe risk position manner allow reclassify low regulatory risk category. atpresent, securitization is, without doubt, major tool use large u.s. bank engage sucharbitrage.regulatory capital arbitrage, i emphasize, necessarily undesirable. in manycases, regulatory capital arbitrage act safety-valve attenuate adverse effect thoseregulatory capital requirement well excess level warrant specific activity’sunderlying economic risk. absent arbitrage, regulatory capital requirement isinappropriately high economic risk particular activity, could cause bank exit thatrelatively low-risk business, prevent bank earn acceptable rate return itscapital. that is, arbitrage may appropriately low effective capital requirement somesafe activity bank would otherwise force drop effect regulation.it clear major bank become quite efficient engage desirableforms regulatory capital arbitrage, securitization devices. however, sucharbitrage costless therefore without implication resource allocation. interestingly,bis review 16/1998 - 4 -one reason formal capital standard include many risk “buckets” thatregulators want influence bank make resource allocation decisions. ironically, the“one-size-fits-all” standard that, force bank expend effort negate thecapital standard, exploit it, whenever significant disparity relativelyarbitrary standard internal, economic capital requirements.the inconsistency internally require economic capital regulatorycapital standard create another type problem -- nominally high regulatory capital ratio usedto mask true level insolvency probability. for example, consider case bank’sown risk analysis call 15 percent internal economic capital assessment portfolio. ifthe bank actually hold 12 percent capital, would, likelihood, deem be“well-capitalized” regulatory sense, even though might undercapitalized economicsense.the possibility regulatory capital ratio may mask true insolvency probabilitybecomes acute bank arbitrage away inappropriately high capital requirement safestassets, remove asset balance sheet via securitization. the issue solelywhether capital requirement bank’s residual risk securitized asset appropriate. weshould also concern sufficiency regulatory capital requirement assetsremaining book. in extreme, “cherry-picking” would result asset leave onthe balance sheet economic capital allocation great 8 percent regulatorystandard.given difficulty one-size-fits-all nature current capital regulations,it understandable call arise reform basle standard. it is, however, prematureto try predict exactly next generation prudential standard evolve. one set ofpossibilities revolve around market-based tool incentives. indeed, banks’ internal riskmeasurement management technology improve, depth sophistication financialmarkets increase, bank supervisor continually find way incorporate market advance intotheir prudential policies, appropriate. two potentially promise application principlehave discuss conference. one use internal credit risk model possiblesubstitute for, complement to, current structure ratio-based capital regulations. anotherapproach go one step us market-like incentive reward encourageimprovements internal risk measurement management practices. a primary example theproposed pre-commitment approach set capital requirement bank trade activities. i mightadd pre-commitment capital design work trade account, bankingbook, strong, well-managed organizations.proponents internal-models-based approach capital regulation may theright track, moment regulatory development would seem full-fledged,bank-wide, internal-models approach could require substantial amount time effort todevelop. in paper give early today federal reserve board economist david jones johnmingo, author enumerate concern reliability current generation creditrisk models. they go suggest, however, model may, time, provide basis forsetting future regulatory capital requirements. even short term, argue, element ofinternal credit risk model may prove useful within supervisory process.still approach course possible, include combination ofmarket-based traditional, ratio-based approach prudential regulation. but regardless whathappens next stage, i note earlier, new capital standard likely supercededwithin continue process evolve prudential regulations. just manufacture companiesfollow product plan cycle, bank regulator expect begin work still anotherbis review 16/1998 -

case recent financial institution failures, bank judge appropriate toextend special loan thoroughly examine four points.while bank previously extend special loan depository institutions, loanextension

asian financial marketslet next discus recent development asian economies. in section, iwill refer asian economy basis exclude japan. to confront turmoil theasian financial market start summer 1997, various measure take -- countrybis review 12/1998 - 5 -has adjust macroeconomic policy set measure stabilize financial system,and international assistance provide leadership international monetary fund(imf). however, instability remain financial foreign exchange market countries, anduncertainty prevail economy evolve various economic measures. today,therefore, i would like examine background asian turmoil possible impact thejapanese economy.first, i would like emphasize appropriate perceive currencyturbulence asian country cause speculative attack global investor onspecific currency financial markets, emphasize instability international financialmarkets. turmoil international financial foreign exchange market occur several timesin past: demise postwar fix exchange-rate system, establish imf 1970s;and currency crisis european monetary system 1992 mexico 1994.in cases, turbulence arise markets, forsome time gap exchange rate country’s currency real economic condition ofthe country, gap expand gradually precede turbulence. immediate adjustment theforeign exchange rate inevitable market participant detect situation. in adjustmentprocess, exchange rate may overshoot, give impression market disruption.however, important grind large fluctuation clearly identified, otherwise,the warn signal send market, point expand gap case, beoverlooked.with emergence asian currency turmoil, question previousachievements east asian economies. this view also seem rather extreme. it appear thepotential growth rate east asia remain high, support high-quality labor, high save rate,and solid market industry infrastructures. although east asian economy face adjustmentpressures short term, expect establish foundation growth carryingout various structural reform base recent experiences.what, then, consider background recent turmoil asiancurrencies? while asian country differ many ways, one common factor mostasian currency peg u.s. dollar, peg, large amount foreign fundsflowed 1990s. this turn lead excessive financial investment activities, overheatingof economy, accordingly, deterioration external balance.it cannot deny sense euphoria, overexpectation economicgrowth, east asia. when influx abundant fund base expectations, upwardpressure exert foreign exchange rate country’s currency. to maintain peggedexchange rates, country pressure ease money low domestic interest rate leastavoid monetary tightening. such policy response fuel financial investment activities, mayhave uphold euphoria certain period time.inflation rate asian country rise due overheat economic activity, undertheir fix exchange rate system, currency become overvalued. consequently, internationalcompetitiveness economy decline gradually current account deficit expanded. thedeficits current account problem long finance foreign capital.however, soon market participant begin doubt sustainability external imbalance andthe economic boom area, foreign fund abruptly withdraw countries, put severepressures foreign exchange rate stock prices. against backdrop, many country werecompelled abandon exchange rate peg u.s. dollar adopt float rate system.bis review 12/1998 - 6 -several important lesson draw experience regard ensure thestability international financial markets. obviously, prevent overheat economic andfinancial activity proper macroeconomic policy important prerequisite securingthe stability one’s economy well international financial markets. it equally importantto ensure flexible foreign exchange developments, promote information disclosure allow marketmechanism check appropriateness economic policies, establish sound financial system by,for example, review framework financial institution supervision.based lessons, east asian country embark restoration theireconomies financial system international support. the bank japan, too, continue play anappropriate role framework imf take initiative. in term cooperation amongasian central banks, executives’ meet east asia pacific central bank (emeap) wasestablished 1991. the governors’ meet take place annually since 1996; first hold intokyo second shanghai. take opportunity meetings, bank intend tostrengthen tie asian central bank exchange view extend technical assistancein various fields.b. impact japanese economynext, i would like discus impact development asian economy thatof japan.the economic relation japan asian country intensifying,and region large trade partner japan. of japan’s total exports, asia’s newlyindustrializing economy (asian nies) member country association south eastasian nation (asean) account 35 percent, exceed share export unitedstates european union, 30 percent 15 percent respectively. a japan’s imports, theshare import asian ny asean country grow almost 20 percent, approachingthe 22 percent unite states, hold large share.accordingly, inevitable depreciation currency economicslowdown due implementation adjustment measure country affect realeconomy japan. at present, demand region china, unite states, europe isfirm, average exchange rate yen (weighted value trade country) remainsstable. thus, export environment significantly deteriorate whole. however, export toasia, especially thailand republic korea, start decreasing.furthermore, slowdown economic growth east asian country bring afall international commodity prices, especially raw materials. this begin affect theprofits material manufacturer japan, result, firm plan curtailproduction. thus, careful observation economic trend include kind indirect impact isnecessary.in addition development real economy, problem nonperforming loan issurfacing asian countries, although degree differ country country.according statistic compile bank international settlement (bis), thetotal credit exposure japanese bank asian country amount u $270 billion, accountsfor 30 percent total exposure world’s financial institution asia.however, figure include japanese banks’ credit asian branch affiliatesof japanese, u.s., european financial institutions. furthermore, large portion business credit ofbis review 12/1998 - 7 -japanese bank extend japanese affiliate guarantee give parent companies.according bank’s survey, japanese banks’ credit exposure non-japanese firm local banksin asia appear around 30 40 percent total credit exposure report bi statistics.moreover, credit loan sound major bank firm project finances, areunlikely turn nonperforming loans.as discuss above, impact currency financial turmoil asia realeconomy financial market japan limit date. however, economic situation thisregion remain unstable. therefore, degree economic slowdown development thenonperforming-loan problem country must continue monitored.iv. recent financial economic condition monetary policy management japana. domestic financial economic conditionsi would like move today’s last topic -- recent economic situation injapan.the decelerate trend japan’s economic growth since april 1997 beenintensifying recently. in final demand, export business fix investment continue anupward trend, support economic activity. however, household spend personalconsumption house investment, fell substantially follow rise consumption taxrate april 1997, recover slow pace. in personal consumption, outlay servicessuch travel service show moderate increase, outlay goods, indicate sale ofautomobiles household electric appliance well department store sales, remain sluggish.in addition, house start decline recently 1.3 million 1.5 million per annumlevel prevail spring 1997.with weakness final demand, inventory adjustment pressure remain theconsumer durables- construction-related industries, thus industrial production decliningslightly. such development seem gradually affect employment income.however, year’s temporary economic slowdown inevitable economy isat phase downward pressure fiscal tighten appear strongly. the concern ishow development affect momentum self-sustained economic recovery 1998. atpresent, corporate profit employment income, form basis self-sustained recovery,continue upward trend. therefore, unlikely economy enter recession.however, weaken virtuous circle production, income, expenditure, ifthis trend continues, may undermine strength self-sustained recovery. the bank willtherefore continue closely monitor pace recovery consumption, progress inventoryadjustment, development household corporate sentiment.meanwhile, price remain stable whole. domestic wholesale price havecontinued decline slowly, particularly construction materials. consumer prices, afterexcluding effect rise consumption tax rate, level slightly theprevious year, corporate service price remain previous year’s level.in view economic price conditions, bank determine observedevelopments carefully manage monetary policy, place emphasis strengthen foundationof economic recovery. in conduct market operations, bank intend continue supplyingsufficient liquidity financial market, thereby ensure smooth transaction stability marketinterest rates.bis review 12/1998 - 8 -b. lend attitude financial institutionswith regard recent financial situation, various discussionsconcerning cautious lend attitude financial institutions.today, financial institution face many challenge management issues, suchas expeditious disposal nonperforming loans, well implementation measure deal thejapanese “big bang” financial reform introduction prompt corrective action. therefore,with view enhance soundness efficiency management, increase number financialinstitutions strengthen risk management attach importance profitability intheir extension loans. these effort financial institution indispensable strengthen japan’sfinancial system. however, matter concern whether cautious lend attitude financialinstitutions reach point hind recovery economy whole.to date, partly weak corporate demand funds, neither anysignificant shortage fund corporate finance overall rise lend rate due squeeze inlending. therefore, bank belief cautious lend attitude financial institution nothampering economic recovery present. however, risk management system financial institution arebeing reinforced. in addition, influence development financial markets, lowstock price rise “japan premium”, financial institutions’ lend activity require dueattention.while current lend activity financial institution hamper economicrecovery, positively contribute recovery past period monetary easing.this fact offer significant point discussion consider interaction financialactivity real economic activity, expect role financial institution go beyondmerely respond passively corporate demand funds.financial institution expect actively support forward-looking businessactivities -- example, help corporation find new business opportunity accept financialrisks new business started. in fact, function financial institution play significantrole promote economic recovery past. while true financial institution go far inthese activities, lead emergence economic “bubble”, also undeniable thepresent phase economic recovery financial support economic activity weak. in order toensure economic recovery, important strengthen function financial institution thefinancial market, thereby restore strong efficient financial system. i would like point thatthe cautious lend attitude financial institutions, cause so-called “credit crunch”, shouldtherefore discuss connection issue strengthen financial system.c. the significance strong confidence economythe bank’s primary concern regard economy fact confidence offirms household japanese economy outlook seem deteriorating.it difficult measure accurately level confidence economic entities.however, financial asset market offer important information. asset values, example,reflect expectation market participant future profit may earn holdingsuch assets.how, then, see recent low level stock prices? corporate profit asignificantly high level today compare 1995, concern adeflationary spiral. however, stock price close 1995 level. this suggest confidence theeconomy weaken compare 1995. under circumstances, firm financialbis review 12/1998 - 9 -institutions would incline hold back forward-looking activity involve risks. weakenedconfidence would also reduce effect monetary easing.however, seem unnatural assume potential growth rate japaneseeconomy medium long term decline significantly past two years. in 1995, forexample, strong concern future japanese industry, due increase competitionwith asian economy anxiety hollowing-out industry, japanese firm areresponding build new global network production part procurement, utilize newinternational division labor. also, depreciation yen, apprehension theinternational competitiveness japanese industry seem recede considerably.in view conditions, weaken confidence economy reflect inthe low stock price must attributable factor. a clue find answer fact thatthe “outlook economy” reflect estimate potential growth rate, alsouncertainty regard realization.for example, even similar level profit growth expected, stock price willdecline great uncertainty realization expect profit growth, otherwords, risk premium expands. the phenomenon observe economy awhole. uncertainty regard future development significantly undermine confidence economy.thus, say present weakness confidence economy relate tothe fact japanese economy critical phase various structural reforms, include financialsystem reforms. there many uncertainty surround economic entity -- developmentsin financial system, progress structural reform economy deregulation, issuesregarding public pensions, substantial impact household income. therefore, theimportant issue clarify outlook factors, include prospect additionalburdens costs.i mention early confidence economic outlook base two factors,namely, expect growth risk premiums. it quite difficult boost potential growth rate orexpectation growth economic policy short term. however, possible reduceuncertainty economy, effective credible method reinforce confidence ina market economy. in regard, make steady progress structural reform deregulation andensuring stability financial system significant. if effort reduce uncertainty abouteconomic financial developments, present monetary ease effective instimulating economic activity, strengthen force virtuous circle economy.bis review 12/1998 mr. kelley discus federal reserve’s perspective year

economic policy issue raise foreurope sweden.2. the countdown europetimetable spring 1998perhaps principle issue spring is, course, country adoptingthe euro start. the selection process start end february member statessubmit national convergence data. what happen past year budget deficits,government debt, inflation interest rates, example? the european monetary institute thecommission independently ass national statistic light maastrichttreaty’s criteria. the find present two convergence report march 25th. on thesame day, moreover, commission present recommendation ecofin council

adopt single currency start in1999.as soon decide country participate euro area,the minister finance economic affair select country meet decide thebilateral exchange rate national currency apply 1st

arrive agreement simple matter. there general criterion withprofessional experience practice almost inevitable nationality also acriterion. during may june, european parliament emi express opinionon recommendation. the composition executive board finally decide theheads state government 1st july latest. this decision must unanimous.new central bank establishedonce ecb’s executive board appointed, work start build upthe new organisation. the executive board comprise president (the head ecb), avice-president four members. if member state adopt euro thestart, possible appoint small board enlarge late state join; boardmust consist initially least four members. the term office eight years. when membersare first appoint 1998, however, term differ avoid renew wholeboard simultaneously.the executive board central bank governor country adopt euroconstitute ecb’s high decision-making body, ecb govern council, meet atleast ten time year. monetary policy decision require simple majority; member onevote president cast vote.the executive board conduct monetary policy accordance decision andguidelines ecb govern council. but rather concentrate everything frankfurt, theintention arrange national central bank (ncbs) undertake much possible,including monetary policy’s implementation. the executive board accordingly issue theinstructions participate ncbs need order carry decisions. the executive boardwill also accountable day-to-day activity ecb.the central bank governor member state adopt euro, e.g. sweden,will represent ecb general council together colleague participatingcountries ecb president vice-president. the general council ecb’s thirddecision-making body exert influence single monetary policy; intend totake function currently perform emi. the general council exist aslong member state outside euro area. information decision take ecbgoverning council convey central bank governor outsider country via generalcouncil.these three decision-making body presumably supplement withcommittees representative ncbs, along line emi’s exist committees. thestructure still decided. there likely committee discussion monetarypolicy, payment systems, inflation forecast on. neither yet clear field towhat extent outsider country able participate committee work.bis review 9/1998 - 3 -the ecb large organisation. to begin with, around 500 people workcentrally frankfurt, 400 administrative staff. there clearly great deal ofdiscussion work divide ecb ncbs. the ecb isnaturally interest create strong highly competent central organisation uphold anoverall european perspective monetary policy. at time, many participatingcountries interest maintain competence, operation influence. one aspect thatis already colour discussion effect different way organise central

active part implementation monetary policy, itis ecb prepare make policy decisions. the ecb accordingly need ownanalytical capability work construct monetary policy decide appropriate levelof interest

cooperation, though ofcourse always simple. the community consist fifteen sovereign state withtraditions differ many respect affect central bank works. this matter ofattitudes monetary policy inflation; also concern approach regulations, free trade,administrative traditions, transparency on. each ncb veto, discussion beenlengthy. but main feature system clear, principle apply.there issues, however, could solve emi, matterhas refer ecb. in cases, alternative solution prepare theirnumber reduce far possible make easy reach final decision.1. the choice monetary policy strategy one matter refer theecb. the primary objective – price stability – stipulate treaty ecbbis review 9/1998 - 4 -to quantify objective, make operational choose strategy achieve it. to prepare forthe ecb’s decision, emi study alternative strategy whittle two: adirect inflation target intermediate target form monetary variable.2. the emi set target, european payment system freeway forintra-eu payments. all ncbs develop national payment system real-timesettlement linkage common network. a matter importance sweden beensettled whether non-euro country access credit payment system. somecountries fear do, may detrimental single monetary policy. the swedishposition, however, member state outside euro area ought access intraday crediton term euro participants. target payment system europe andwill compete efficient reliable. a smooth flow payment thesystem would accordingly benefit participants.3. the principle new system interest rate control known; systemwill resemble swedish arrangement interest rate corridor repo rate. but ecbwill also decide whether monetary policy instrument include minimum reserves.those favour argue minimum reserve facilitate construction monetary policy, forinstance reduce need fine-tune liquidity. in sweden, however, consider minimumreserves create unnecessary complication require control liquidity.3. economic policy emuwith preparation completed, monetary union establish 1stjanuary 1999. there single monetary exchange rate policy – inherent thenotion monetary union – fiscal policy continue conduct nationally. but thesituation new fiscal monetary policy; credibility must establish thenew condition way must find cooperate different component economicpolicy.monetary policythe escb independent status monetary policy focus onsustainable price stability immune short-run political considerations. the nationalgovernments enshrine principle maastricht treaty, every member state hasratified.independence, however, absolve ecb duty explain itspolicy public. it rather case high degree independence, plus fact theecb new institution store credibility draw, oblige new central bankto particularly transparent. if single monetary policy make comprehensible publicand politicians, ecb acquire desire credibility.a clear strategy single monetary policy therefore needed. the riksbankconsiders strategy include distinct explicit inflation target. one advantage thatsuch target comparatively easy explain monitor. we also argue inflation reportsshould publish regular basis order provide transparent picture possible thecurrent policy construct future background existingforecasts.opinions matter differ, however. monetary target likewise distinct thesense monitor fulfilment. but always show direct relationshipbis review 9/1998 - 5 -with inflation practice may abandon time time. that liable torender policy le transparent.without unduly partial, seem swedish arrangement aninflation target attract grow attention. it strongly support academic economist andmy european colleague also increasingly interest experience. but is,of course, bundesbank’s long favourable experience monetary target germany’sself-evident weight discussion.certain routine central bank’s policy presentation prescribe treaty.the annual report ecb present ecofin council europeanparliament, may hold general debate basis. the ecb president member ofthe executive board may, request european parliament initiative, beheard parliament’s committees. eu discussion progress arrangement thisand whether clarification feasible.under treaty, meet ecb’s govern council may attend thepresident ecofin council member commission without right vote.similarly, ecb president may attend ecofin council meet matter relate ecb’sobjectives tasks. the ecofin council president also entitle submit motion deliberationto ecb govern council.exchange rate policy monetary union another topic discussion. this ishardly surprise – interest rate policy exchange rate policy two side coin. aninterest rate adjustment, upwards downwards, normally affect exchange rate, theexchange rate consequence inflation thus appropriate level interest rate.the treaty entitle european council issue guideline exchange rate policy flexibleexchange rate euro currencies. discussion hold clarify thisentails. the member state agree guideline draw underexceptional circumstance general terms. the guideline jeopardise theprice stability target. still, entirely clear exchange rate policy implemented.fiscal policyfiscal policy continue national concern emu. the maastricht treaty isintended institute common objective preclude imbalance government finances. thisobjective specify great detail stability growth pact member statesconcluded last year, aim avoid fiscal irresponsibility member state move tostage three.in pact, eu country undertake avoid excessive governmentdeficit aim budget close balance surplus medium term. in principle, abudget deficit exceed 3 per cent gdp. a country euro area exceed limitwill normally liable fine. sanction waived, however, certain exceptionalcircumstances define member states.the reasonableness pact’s strict limit government finance beendiscussed doubt express whether fine impose practice. themonetary union accentuate need adjust europe’s economy way via theexchange rate, regard function labour market. but national fiscal policycan provide buff event shocks. provide medium-term objective met, moreover,there still scope fiscal policy pact.bis review 9/1998 - 6 -estimates oecd others indicate that, average eu countries,a retardation growth one percentage point enlarge budget deficit relative gdp half apercentage point. this imply normal conjunctural slowdown cause cyclical deficit toincrease 1–1.5 percentage points. stay ceiling impose stability pactthen presuppose limit structural deficit. today statistical picture troublesome anumber member states, include core countries, structural deficit than2 per cent. this leaf small margin cop economic slowdown.trade-off fiscal monetary policythe credibility success stability growth pact highly dependent onthe ability member state meet medium-term target. like single monetary policy, underthe pact fiscal policy closely scrutinise assess initial years. for monetarypolicy, high credibility confer great freedom make temporary allowance factorswithout impair expectation central bank’s target. similarly, build upcredibility, room create minister economic affair finance accept minordeviations pact.monetary policy component economic policy interdependent.safeguarding price stability, example, easy fiscal policy tight europe’s economicstructures function smoothly. from time time may direct call dialogue aboutpolicy dialogue must allow endanger price stability objective; neither needit, since ecb ultimately control instrument whereby low inflation maintained.let illustrate simple example. about year ago economistsconsidered british policy need tighten prevent inflation exceed targetedrate. however, pound already strong people believe british manufacturingwould ultimately suffer. if possible, therefore, fiscal policy tightened. a thingsturned out, however, adjustment make via monetary policy. the bank england live toits responsibility price stability raise interest rate prevent increase inflation.precisely discussion may call future european level.the ecb may perceive threat price stability even though euro “too strong” maytherefore advocate fiscal restrictions. the finance minister turn may want discus thisshould do burden adjustment allocate them. such mattersare far simple; i mention mainly illustrate i see grow need forcommunication cooperation, least aim construct policy best interest ofeurope mind.as know, dialogue cooperation call debateon monetary union’s policy arrangements. in december 1997 member state agree thesetting call euro x council. this body formaldecision-making power composition determine agenda. matter onlyconcern country euro area discuss minister countries;representatives outsider country may join matter also interest them. howparticipation euro x decide arrangement yet clear. what clearis ecofin council decision-making body formal decision bemade there.in opinion debate euro x tend extremes. it hardly deniedthat certain economic matter euro

xmight bring unfortunate circumstances.4. economic policy swedenit frequently claim establishment european monetary union thatsweden choose join impose new requirement swedish economic policy. this may betrue point. emu bring country europe close economicallyand accelerate accentuate internationalisation sweden’s economy. theconsequences essentially favourable: strong competition low prices, access largerlabour market, etc. at time, respect internationalisation restrict scope fornational economic policy. but context emu represent something radically different;it simply reinforce early tendencies.as regard economic policy, major step really take begin ofthis decade realignment policy stability. today, main feature swedisheconomic policy eu policy good grind believe willcontinue case. here i shall briefly consider three type argument:•firstly, result policy recent years; low inflation rapidimprovement government finances.•secondly, institutional changes; rule monetary fiscal policyhave change condition today conduct policy forstability considerably good before.•thirdly, sweden, whether adopt single currency, belong aeuropean context continue exert distinct pressure oureconomic policy markedly affect freedom action.good result growth inflationthe 1990 budget statement contain first clear statement low inflation wasone economic policy’s primary objectives: low inflation pave way future growth andemployment. the distinct message signal awareness turn back – thedevaluation policy long tenable matter policy focus long-termstability. this awareness naturally root swedish experience recent decade – acombination high inflation weak economic growth. but another important contribution theeu experience – many country policy focus low inflation since early 1980s bornefruit, instance term growth. a major drawback, however, good growth notgenerated good result term employment. after fall iron curtain, sweden nowbeginning draw close eu politically.since reduction inflation normal european level, happenedsoon policy realignment, rate price increase sweden match belowthe eu average. since announcement inflation target january 1993, cpi rise atan average annual rate 2.3 per cent. since target come force begin 1995, cpiinflation average 1.5 per cent. the picture even clear term underlie inflation,calculated exclude transitory effect like tax increases, interest rate adjustments, etc. this indicatorof inflation relatively stable inside tolerance interval 1–3 per cent surround theriksbank’s target.bis review 9/1998 - 8 -it worth underscore economic growth accompany thisperformance relatively good. since low economic activity sweden summerof 1993, 2.5–3 per cent average annual gdp growth rate high 1980s.however, employment pick growth desire extent. this withnumerous factors, one is, course, cut public sector activity connection withbudget consolidation, example. another factor problem labour market, partlyconcern rule process wage formation.the profound crisis early 1990s mean output sweden drop byaround 5 per cent, almost unparalleled post-war europe. the drop production theprimary cause dramatic weaken government finance period 1991–94. since thenthis situation also radically improved. have peak 12 per cent gdp, governmentdeficit swing sharply. strong economic activity make major contribution itwould possible without extensive consolidation government finances. taxincreases spend cut 1995 1997 total equivalent almost 7 per centof gdp. besides direct budgetary impact, measure lay foundation downward shiftin interest rates, considerably good exchange rate trend overall economic stabilisation thataided improvement appreciably.the massive budget deficit mean period 1990–96 public sector debt grewfrom 44 78 per cent gdp. this restrict future freedom action fiscal policy. forsweden constraint accentuate high revenue expenditure ratio render thebudget susceptible conjunctural factors. see light, government’s objective a2 per cent budget surplus medium term seem reasonable. it also provide margin safetyfor deficit criterion stability growth pact. a budget surplus lessen risk asizeable deficit economic activity weak. moreover, objective mean sweden fulfilsthe undertake pact budget close balance surplus medium term.institutional changesto extent, sweden’s problem government finance stem frominstitutional factors. in recent years, however, change improve conditionsfor sound budget policy. one change, institute purpose well, riksdag isnow elect four year instead three; long mandate render policy stable. a of1997, moreover, budget act alter budget process. a nominal spend ceiling beenintroduced apply move three-year period; mean additional spend one fieldhas finance via reassessment elsewhere overall ceiling exceeded.expenditures current fiscal year also monitor closely; item expect toexceed budget figure, competent ministry propose way prevent this.institutional change also way domain monetary policy. the statusof riksbank strengthen 1999. a result five-party agreement, inflationtarget force law. the ban give instruction statutory. the groundsfor dismiss riksbank governor serious misconduct inability continue fulfilthe condition require performance his/her duties. concern monetary exchange ratepolicy decision major importance, instead present

toconduct commercial transactions, generate new market revenue streams, low transactional costs,and forge new relationship business consumers.”nowadays, impossible speak potential explosion internet andelectronic commerce without discussion appropriate role government foster andregulating electronic commerce. in unite states, question government’s role globalelectronic commerce answer when, july 1997, white house release “framework forglobal electronic commerce” white paper. the framework clear comprehensivearticulation unite state government’s view role creation global informationinfrastructure vibrant international market-place. the override theme framework wassummed statement make president clinton upon release report. he say that:governments profound effect growth electronic commerce. by theiractions, facilitate trade inhibit it. government official respect theunique nature medium recognize widespread competition increasedconsumer choice define feature new digital market-place. theyshould adopt market-oriented approach electronic commerce facilitate theemergence global, transparent, predictable legal environment support businessand commerce.to ensure act unite state government comport view, theframework set forth five principle intend inform government’s action area. the firstprinciple private sector allow take lead. although government play asignificant role finance initial research development internet, white housebelieves subsequent expansion been, continue be, drive primarily theprivate sector. the framework take fundamental principle notion innovation, expandedservices, broad participation, low price arise market-driven arena. the naturaloutgrowth first principle see federal government’s hesitance issue regulationsgoverning use internet encouragement private sector self-regulation.the second principle framework really corollary first principle andprovides government avoid undue restriction global electronic commerce. thisprinciple base belief unnecessary regulation commercial activity internet willdistort development electronic market-place raise cost product service foraccording third framework principle, government involvement needed,its aim support enforce predictable, minimalistic, consistent, simple legalbis review 26/1998 - 2 -environment commerce. this legal environment base commercial law model thatallows private governance though decentralized, contractual relationship organize system rules,rather top-down regulation model. moreover, basic goal government regulation shouldbe ensure competition, protect intellectual property privacy, prevent fraud, foster transparency,support commercial transactions, facilitate dispute resolution.the fourth principle direct government recognize unique quality theinternet relation exist regulatory models. we assume, example, regulatoryframeworks establish past sixty year telecommunications, radio, television apply tothe internet. the framework specifically direct government review, revise eliminateexisting law regulation may hind electronic commerce reflect need newelectronic age.finally, fifth principle, framework announce what, many, mostimportant principle connection electronic commerce internet, namely electroniccommerce internet facilitate global basis. in regard, unite statesgovernment identify nine area international agreement need preserve internetas non-regulatory medium, one competition consumer choice largely shape themarket-place. the nine area are: (1) custom taxation; (2) electronic payments; (3) uniformcommercial code electronic commerce; (4) intellectual property protection; (5) privacy; (6) security;(7) telecommunication infrastructure information technology; (8) content; (9) technicalstandards. these nine area discuss detail framework. i would like spend restof time discuss two issue detail -- specifically, electronic payment auniform commercial code electronic commerce.my interest area reflect belief advancement essential thecontinued growth electronic commerce internet domestically globally. user ofelectronic commerce need safe reliable payment system link internet facilitate paymentfor good service contract internet. more fundamentally, contractual relationshipsforged internet must basis sound legal technological infrastructure.electronic paymentsover past year see emergence new technology allowsindividuals pay good service internet private networks. these paymentmethods develop along two lines. first, technology exist allow individual makepayments internet private network use traditional payment mechanism creditcards. when use way, internet simply next evolve line communicationsmedia use convey payment information. the underlie payment govern law thatwould govern credit card payment point-of-sale terminal telephone. moreover, andperhaps importantly central banker’s perspective, internet payment method remaintied exist payment system involve transfer balance among account financialinstitutions.“electronic money,” base stored-value smart card technologies, alsounder development. when use connection products, internet long act solely anaccess device communicate payment information merchant banks. instead, transfer of“value” internet become, practical purposes, modern day equivalent tenderingcurrency satisfaction debt. while private electronic money “legal tender” status,electronic money issuer use private contractual relationship effect discharge obligations.“electronic money” essentially re-emergence unite state ofprivately-issued currency, value depend financial health issuer. becauseelectronic value simply promise issuer pay demand, question arise whether theissuance electronic value limit bank supervise institutions. in unitedbis review 26/1998 - 3 -states, bank intricately link payment system and, result, subject uniqueregulatory burden reserve requirements, deposit insurance premiums, extensive supervision.some argue safety soundness payment system require limit issuance ofelectronic money banks. in fact, foreign jurisdictions, japan european union,have limit issuance electronic currency bank credit institution eu parlance.unlike europe japan, however, unite state is, least time being,remaining silent issue nonbank issuance electronic money. the white house belief thatthe commercial technological environment change far rapidly able developpolicy timely appropriate. in near term, therefore, white house call forcase-by-case monitor electronic payment experiments.in keep spirit white house framework, federal bank supervisor inthe unite state express clear willingness listen private sector say onissues involve emerge electronic payments. for example, 1996 board governor issuedproposed regulation concern applicability regulation e stored-value cards. a part thatproposed rule making, board request comment public whether part ofregulation e apply electronic money value reside computer system orpersonal-computer hard drive. similarly, fdic request public comment application offederal deposit-insurance coverage electronic value represent computer systems. this openness,combined increase willingness let bank industry partner technology otherindustries, reflect commitment part bank supervisor unite state allow privatesector direct future electronic commerce payments.from long term perspective, however, market-place industry self-regulationalone may fully address issue associate e-money. the white house frameworksuggests government action may necessary ensure safety soundness electronicpayments systems, protect consumer respond important law-enforcement objectives. ofcourse, white house would work closely private sector inform policy development andensure governmental activity flexibly accommodate need emerge market-place.from central bank perspective, one fundamental question raise byelectronic payment impact monetary policy, especially development widespread assome predicted. in near term, appear internet payment system significantlyimpact monetary policy. for part, internet communication network currentlybeing use facilitate exist bank transaction use traditional bank settlement channels. mostpayments internet simply result movement fund bank account one institutionto one another bank. this few, any, implication conduct unitedstates monetary policy measurement unite state money supply. “money” define bym1, m2, m3, would still hold account bank would report federal reservethrough exist report mechanisms.if, however, internet payment evolve point digital “coins” privateelectronic money begin widely use circulate like federal reserve bank notes, potentialimplications monetary policy could much greater. the effect store value, whether smart cardor computer based, monetary policy large part turn extent shift themoney supply bank sector. when store value issue banks, real risk. asgovernor edward kelly note 1996 speech cyber-payments conference, bank liabilitiesincurred issue stored-value card include statistical report bank mustcurrently submit federal reserve board.in addition monetary policy concerns, factor could trigger need thegovernment resolve issue bank versus nonbank issuance electronic value. for example, inoted earlier, bank subject extensive regulation supervision least part ensure safetyand soundness payment systems. if nonbanks begin take significant market share away frombis review 26/1998 - 4 -banks inherently low cost structure, raise serious question level playingfield whether bank ever fairly compete. if nonbanks begin offer internet many ofthe payment services, alternative payment services, offer exclusively banks, raisesa real question ultimate value bank charter, really mean bank. it couldbe argued, example, thing nonbank issuer e-money -- supervisedbank issuer unsupervised bank issuers.another relate concern emergence nonbank internet financial firm havebalance sheet closely resemble banks, access lender-of-last resort. whathappens institution liquidity crisis? what crisis large threaten togridlock entire payment system? what role supervisor play? what role thesupervisors play?in addition domestic policy concerns, administration’s position electronicpayments inform international developments. a number international organization inwhich federal reserve play role, bank international settlement g-10central bank governors, already complete important study aspect electronic bank andpayments. for example, multi-national task force security electronic money establishedby committee payment settlement systems, group computer experts, g-10central bank governors. this task force, chair israel sendrovic federal reservebank new york, issue report find entitle “security electronic money” august1996. the task force examine primarily consumer-oriented stored-value product survey theleading global supplier card-based software-based stored-value systems. the reportconcluded technology security measure system design achieve anadequate level security relative form common retail payments, assume areimplemented appropriately.what remain see whether infrastructure need create bind electroniccontracts previously unaffiliated party develop meet need consumer andmerchants globally. this lead second topic -- establishment uniform commercialcode electronic commerce.uniform commercial code for electronic commercethe white house framework state that, order “to encourage electronic commerce, theunited state government support development domestic global commerciallegal framework recognizes, facilitate enforce electronic transaction worldwide.” in keepingwith belief private sector take lead electronic commerce issues, white

internationally, unite state government work withorganizations unite nation commission international trade law, oecd,unidroit international chamber commerce achieve necessary global commercial

ucc locate inarticle 1. the draft committee’s mandate broad: consider draft revision addition toarticle 1 light development since adoption. one significant development hasoccurred since adoption article 1 shift paper electronic media. at minimum,therefore, expect article 1 revise recognize validity electronic signature andelectronic writings.another effort rapidly proceed auspex nccusl ali newucc article license govern traditional software contract license ofinformation (for example, books, movies, databases). in process address concern unique theinformation industry, drafter consider issues, electronic contracting, everyindustry likely need consider. for example, february 1998 draft article 2b provide a“record” cannot deny legal effect solely grind electronic. article 2b also addressesthe use “attribution procedures” signature substitute electronic commerce environment. inthis regard, article 2b, currently drafted, largely mirror concept commercially reasonablesecurity procedure find article 4a ucc govern fund transfers.article 2b not, however, address rather important aspect electronic recordsnamely, admissibility electronic record legal proceed use electronic record tosatisfy legal requirement original document retained. regardless whether article 2bultimately address issues, adoption 50 state article 2b still long way off.moreover, principle state article 2b restrict scope article 2b. thus, even whenarticle 2b adopted, affect significant portion electronic commerce. with mind,nccusl establish separate draft committee tackle electronic transaction issue generally anew uniform electronic transaction act. the eta, although “fast track”, still earlydrafting stage. several important decisions, include scope act, still debated.having say that, act expect provide legal recognition electronic signature andrecords commercial transactions, use electronic record evidence.in addition uniform state law effort nccusl/ali, aproliferation non-uniform unite state state law address electronic commerce generallyreferred “digital signature” “electronic signature” laws. there least 43 state haveenacted, currently considering, electronic signature legislation. these state law initiative varyconsiderably. for example, many state limit scope legislation specific type oftransactions (for example, transaction state, medical records, motor vehicle records). however,bis review 26/1998 - 6 -the big difference concern type signature covered, electronic signature versus digitalsignatures, effect signature electronic documents.the general term -- electronic signature -- use describe letters,characters, symbol manifest electronic similar mean execute adopt party withan intent authenticate writing. example electronic signature include name type end ofan e-mail message sender digitalize image handwritten signature sender. a“digital signature” subset electronic signature represent unique way “sign” electronicmessage.a digital signature simply

function handwritten signature many electronic signature may not. because useof hash function, digital signature allow receiver message determine whether themessage alter since digitally signed.state legislation area tend address either electronic signature (23 states) ordigital signature (16 states), both. state legislation electronic signature differ thequestion qualify electronic signature. several state take ucc article 1approach recognize form electronic mark intend serve electronic signature. otherstates, however, require several condition meet electronic signature legallyenforceable. generally, states, order electronic signature effective must: (1) beunique person use it; (2) capable verification; (3) sole control personusing it; (4) link data manner data change signature

world’s financialmarkets, development new risk management systems. furthermore, development intechnology financial products, combine increase depth liquidity domesticand global financial markets, enable bank change risk profile fast everbefore. a key goal federal reserve’s risk-focused approach enable bank tocompete effectively dynamic financial service sector, focus examiner onbanks’ ability

methods, free examiner time devote banks’ specificrisk exposures.bis review 24/1998 - 3 -in addition, bank supervisor need ass integrity independence ofa bank’s decision-making processes, give special attention conflict interest orinsider influence could distort process. the basle committee’s core principle foreffective bank supervision address point recognize need effectivemeasures control direct lend transaction affiliate anarm’s-length basis. specifically, core principle state that, prevent abuse arise fromconnected lending, bank supervisor require loan bank make relatedcompanies individual

grenville, deputy governor thereserve bank australia, australian business economist economic society ofaustralia (nsw branch) sydney 12/3/98.it much early draw definitive conclusion economic crisiscurrently play asia, point try bring together theemerging idea go wrong, might do fix immediate problems, andhow, fundamental sense, problem might avoid future. one thingsthat strike much think evolved, already, month since crisis broke.with mind, lesson seem appropriate will, doubt, modify overtime. historian wait compose definitive, fully-digested version dust settles,but others need call continuously, refine modify understand go along,knowing perfectly well write today may seem unperceptive simply wrong whenwe come back year’s time.ross garnaut recently write that: “the shock 1997 define event inthe economic history east asia. like great depression west, capacity tochange think economic development economic policy fundamental ways.”1. thisprocess currently underway, sound like damage report rather theanatomy paradigm shift, may reflect close range current perspective. amongthe jumble likely cause hypotheses, difficult fit piece together assignproper weights. that say (and anticipate one late conclusions), individual elementsof crisis neither new, ignore beforehand. but conjuncture eventsproduced outcome no-one forecast. and critical break come, notpossible restore status quo ante fix individual element go wrong.general lessonsthe first lesson, stem directly fact no-one forecast natureor extent crisis, need humility. while plenty observer worry aboutvarious aspect emerge markets, serious commentator could say haveforecast crises, sense define nature unfold story someprecision timing.2 generic weakness financial sector was, like mark twain’sweather, something everyone complain about, no-one much about. the relatedpoint remain much understand.this issue failure forecast especially embarrass countries,by large, thing economist say important. their budget werebalanced, keep inflation low, reduce (over time) protection increase theiropenness, trade capital accounts, embrace deregulation (although nevercompletely). even extent run look hindsight dangerously-largecurrent account deficit times, doubt “good” deficit - i.e. theyfunded high level investment, rather government expenditure private consumption. 1 garnaut (1998, p. 23).2 for example, paul krugman, sceptical aspect “asian miracle”, claimto foresee crisis: “speculative attack currency nothing new, u evenwarned couple year ago south-east asian country might risk. but scale anddepth crisis surprise everyone; disaster demonstrate financialdangers undreamt previous philosophy.” (krugman 1998b).bis review 22/1998 - 2 -the second general lesson turn much complex thanit seem initially. initially, crisis see relatively simple term (president clintondescribed “a little glitch road”). the belief exchange rate becomeover-valued, economy run bite fast productive capacity would allow,and case (most notably thailand) current account blow way thatmade vulnerable. the implication that, exchange rate floated, woulddepreciate modestly, fiscal monetary policy could tighten bite order slowgrowth, process current account deficit would shrink. there feel “thisisn’t problem; it’s opportunity”. at least, feel short-termpain, economy would emerge strong before: crisis would provide themotivation institutional improvement.these generalisations: let’s get specific thing mightexplain crisis.the exchange rateif “currency crisis”, exchange rate must key factor, mustn’tthey? there couple different aspect need separate discussion. first, someaspect initial exchange rate cause crisis? secondly, learn thebehaviour exchange rate crisis emerged?first, exchange rate regime cause crisis? the early diagnosis thatthe central problem exchange rate over-valued, fixed. most commentatorsassess exchange rate over-valued something order 10 per cent. weknow over-valued exchange rate vulnerable, clearly element story.but exchange rate level around half start point, case ofindonesia around quarter. whatever over-valuation exchange rate start,markets take much opposite direction. if 10 per cent exchange ratemisalignment one direction make country vulnerable crisis, leavethem now? in short, initial exchange rate over-valuation seem small, routine, thesubsequent behaviour inexplicable, carry full weight key cause.were fix rate culprit? again, fix rate raise issue vulnerability, butthese country stick fix rate regime perversity - felt neededthis anchor macro policies. at time, neighbour comethrough crisis well also fix rate - hong kong china. it might also note bythose believe exchange rate flexibility would avoid crisis thesecountries’ exchange rate substantial upward pressure first half the1990s. while policy pursue clearly turn unsustainable, thecounter-factual - early introduction float exchange rate - might also verybumpy ride.3in short, may routine refer currency crises, exchangerate movement symptomatic something else. that said, learn something, apathological sense, behaviour exchange rate observe behaviour intimes crisis. the first obvious lesson exchange rate regime shift fromfixed floating, transition may quite turbulent, market troubleestablishing sensible rate. it naive believe modest over-valuation would 3 grenville (1998, p. 33).bis review 22/1998 - 3 -smoothly correct floating. even deep, well-established markets, japan theusa, exchange rate routinely move 30 per cent more.perhaps extraordinary aspect degree contagion ofexchange rates. just thai baht move fair way, rupiah haveto move also (not mention ringgit peso)? two factor seem involve here. thefirst “wake-up call” argument: fall baht make market look currencies,and find matter concern. the second component argument that, oneexchange rate start move, others move maintain competitiveness.4while talk exchange rate extreme behaviour, i shouldsay something apparent failure high interest rate support exchange rates.interest rate country quite high (both nominal real terms) quite afew year (in fact, one important cause large capital inflows). when thecrisis arrived, interest rate put even higher. this appropriate, clear thatthey put high enough prevent depreciation over-shooting. why so?some argue thing go wrong authority preparedto put high enough job. there is, however, another side story.5 briefly: extremely high interest rate credible: market expect beabandoned quickly; foreign debt foreign currency denominated, high domestic interestrates would make foreign creditor even nervous thecredit risk faced, therefore likely withdraw money; high interest rate raise problem adverse selection - borrowersare intend repay.current account deficit capital flowsthe large current account deficit incur country see tohave major source vulnerability. we note early “good” deficits, andin defence korea indonesia, also note neither run particularlylarge deficit recent year (for korea 2 per cent gdp 1990-96, 3 per cent forindonesia). but thailand certainly - around 8 per cent gdp. what clear, ex post,is vulnerability extraordinary reversal capital flow (which not, example,seen australia). the inflow country around us$ 40 billion 1995, thandoubled nearly us$ 100 billion 1996, reverse outflow around us$ 12 billionin 1997. it hardly surprise major adjustment underway countries, adaptto reversal.before condemn current account deficit manifestation misguidedpolicies, note deficit “good” (in sense fundedinvestment, consumption), - large degree - normal work ofmarket processes. these country experience high productivity growth technology wasbrought bear, combine low labour costs. they “got act together” provide 4 those like argument would also point chinese effective depreciation 1994. this isclaimed disturb international competitiveness help set train exportshortfalls asian countries, turn contribute crisis.5 the follow argument set detail grenville (1998, p. 33).bis review 22/1998 - 4 -hospitable environment commerce investment. it hardly surprise been,over time, significant flow capital “old” high-saving country “new”investment opportunity east asia.6 if economic miracle take place, foreigninvestors want slice action. the fast-developing financial infrastructure provide theconduit domestic borrower foreign savers. there is, fact, early example ofthis. singapore go two decade current account deficit average 10 percent gdp, people look back era extraordinary success.in short, identify critical problem here, potential reversalof capital flow, rather current account deficit per se. this was, course,exacerbated two characteristic capital flow - short-term nature foreigncurrency denomination debt. these seen, time, natural-enoughcharacteristics institutional structure:7 interfere would go tide ofmarket-oriented policies. but identify major source vulnerability.8the financial sectora third key weakness, identify early on,9 fast-growingfinancial sector vulnerable, inevitably reflect lack experience, thecommercial bankers, borrower prudential supervisors. just rapidly-growing balancesheet

desirable thedepth financial sector increase - i.e. balance sheet financial institution expandfaster nominal gdp. that said, course issue “how much faster”? lessexcusable inadequate effort put place effective prudential supervision.coincidence compoundingi argued, far, none element usually put forward is,in itself, unusual, enough explain extent crisis. the fatal flaw thecombination.11 to extent, problem self-reinforcing - one weak link broke,this put pressure linkages, collapse extra burden place them.but mean inevitable problem coincide - i would simply note thataustralia mid 1980s exchange rate fall magnitude thailand’s korea’swithout major crisis, asset price bust probably order magnitude (inthe late 1980s) without degree damage. 6 feldstein horioka (1980).7 grenville (1998, p. 31).8 the bumpy international environment make capital flow volatile, help explain boththe exchange rate appreciation variation capital flows. the yen/dollar exchange ratemoved 20 per cent year begin april 1996, affect countries’ effective exchangerates, trade capital flows. low japanese interest rate initially encourage excessliquidity flow countries, reverse market begin focus possible interestrate increases.9 grenville (1997) macfarlane (1997b).10 mckinnon (1973).11 an analogy might illustrate point compound causation: car crash, toblame injuries? be speed, act recklessness intoxication, poor roadsurface, under-inflated tyre, inadequate guard-rail, poorly-designed car, inadequateseat-belts? some thing mutually compounding, others simply unable copewith abnormal strain subject. so asian “currency” crisis. thesearch single key cause - and, implication, single key solution prevent recurrence - willmiss complexity task ahead.bis review 22/1998 - 5 -that said, clear linkage fault lines, asian case,there conjuncture problems. large capital inflow led, more-or-less inevitably, toexcessive credit growth growth financial sector, possible sterilisethem fully. the large flow meant, also, easy fund available project (bothgood bad), asset price bid up. similarly, large capital flow make itdifficult raise interest rate high (they already quite high), fear induce evenmore capital inflow. high domestic interest rates, time, persuade many borrowersto take risk tap attractively low foreign currency-denominated borrowing.further, quasi-fixed exchange rate regime countries, little incentive forinstitutions borrow foreign currency hedge debt. these issue beenrecognised source vulnerability, focus growth, without enough concernabout resilience face variance growth.this failure recognise interaction element key misunderstandingas crisis broke. with hindsight, realise simply free exchangerates would cause shift fair way would create enormous problem afinancial sector weigh bad debt large foreign currency-denominated debt. thiswould, turn, fee back exchange rate. if identify crucial combination,it would large volatile foreign capital flows, plus fragile financial sectors.these two factors, combination, make economy extremely vulnerable tochanges confidence. we mind financial market constantly digestingand evaluate information produce price - exchange rate - reflect the“fundamentals”. but see, here, nebulous concept “confidence”, times,dominates fundamentals. “in matter months, asian economy go frombeing darling investment community virtual pariahs. there touch ofthe absurd unfold drama, international money manager harshly castigate verysame asian government praise month before. … but, often happen infinancial markets, euphoria turn panic without miss

(those whosay, many do, new zealand need inflow capital finance future development arein effect say new zealand must continue current account deficit.) so sense,part reason current account deficit simply reflection enthusiasm whichforeign institutions, companies, indeed individual invest new zealand inrecent years.some foreign investment form so-called direct investment,involving foreign company establish control interest new zealand operation. a youknow, large amount investment kind go back many year -

(indeed, loss magnify because, sharply increasedliabilities express local currencies, borrower rush sell assets, tend push downasset price sharply well.) these large loss turn tend reduce investor confidence,and accelerate capital outflow.by contrast, much foreign capital inflow new zealand either inthe form equity investments, currency risk bear company receive capital, orin form new zealand dollar borrowings, government banks. the quarterly disclosurestatements publish new zealand bank show little way unhedgedforeign exchange position and, although i detail information make adogmatic assertion, i would fairly confident unhedged foreign exchange liability newzealand corporates small. they operate long freely floatingexchange rate environment unaware risks, indeed still recall loss theysustained borrow low interest foreign currency 1970s 1980s newzealand dollar pegged.a third point note that, capital outflow occur, interest rate would risesharply result likely combination sharply low exchange rate andmarkedly high interest rate would quite quickly reduce current account deficit. the reservebank might well blame sharp rise interest rates, sure would allopposed increase since exchange rate fell sharply mark increase interest rateswould need keep inflation control. but also true that, unless bank move topump money economy aggressively, sharp outflow capital, whether own byforeigners own new zealanders, would necessarily result sharp increase interest rates,bis review 8/1998 -

education, medical care, retirement - would largely betaken care government. we effectively told: don’t need save and, way, ifyou do, you’re fool, government-sourced inflation steal large chunk saveanyway.i’m frankly sure culture low household-sector save changed.clearly significant section community surplus income all. to suggestthat solo parent live benefit scope increase save absurd, would bepresumptuous extreme come me. but also true many new zealander onhigher income still attitude personal finance make sense high inflation1970s early-1980s. the mind-set fool personal savings, quick theclever debt eyeballs. indeed, attitude sensible individual’spoint view, negative real interest rate rise asset prices. those attitude long makesense.part problem recent year may less-than-ideal mix monetaryconditions, interest rate low encourage save discourage borrow theexchange rate high allow export import-competing sector grow. this mix ofmonetary condition particularly unhelpful inflation pressure thedomestic part economy, especially house sector, export andimport-competing sectors. the reserve bank begin tighten monetary policy early 1994 headoff inflationary pressure project time. by end year, 90 day interestrates rise around 4.5 per cent january close 10 per cent, exchange ratehad increase 57 trade-weighted index (twi) 60. through next nine quarters, tothe end march 1997, interest rate never go much 10 per cent, exchange ratecontinued increase twi reach 69. a consequence, lend major financialinstitutions private sector continue grow rate double nominal gdpgrowth. in words, although exchange rate put great pressure expose part ofthe economy, interest rate nearly high enough restrain huge surge private sectorborrowing.but hold on, may saying. don’t high inflation-adjustedinterest rate develop world? and do, one compare interest rate inflation inthe cpi. but course u borrow buy good service cpi basket. rather,most u borrow buy assets, particularly real estate. and interest rate arecompared change index house prices, show graph 3, see ourbis review 8/1998 -

without risk inflationobjective - since inflationary pressure come sector relatively immune fromexchange rate pressure susceptible, believed, interest rate pressure. but theinternational evidence suggest sterilise intervention little last effect unless issimply precursor ease overall monetary policy.i believe introduction monetary condition index december 1996may help change mix monetary condition extent eliminate theimpression grow exchange rate target well inflation target, buteven mean certain.if central bank much improve national save performance,could government more? i already mention importance government itselfcontinuing run fiscal surpluses. there almost certainly policy would aneffect private sector save performance.bis review 8/1998 -

monetary authority,mr. david carse, bancomp ’98 conference hong kong 25/5/98.i please morning speak start conference oninternal control anti-money laundering. the advertise title speech “understanding therole need regulator authorise financial institutions”. this broad subjectand i therefore narrow focus bank supervisor’s perspective controlissues financial institutions. i sure many compliance audit professional theaudience today, i trust i hard hard job persuade good internalcontrols important, crucial success financial institutions. just consider, forexample, poor internal control bcci, daiwa bank barings.so advice i offer today help ensure institution notmeet fate? well, i share think key element afinancial institution’s control systems, highlight area institution havegone horribly wrong. i also talk one key area financial institution’s control -its control use money laundering.so let start give bank supervisor’s view internal controls. butfirst, exactly mean “internal controls”? the definition i would suggest, isborrowed basle committee bank supervision, internal control refer theongoing process board director management institution ensure theinstitution meet three key set objectives. first, operational objective - efficiency andeffectiveness institution use asset resource protect institutionfrom loss. second, information objective - reliability completeness financial andmanagement information need decision-making within institution regulatory andother external uses. third, compliance objective - compliance applicable law regulations,supervisory requirements, internal policy procedures, order protect institution’sfranchise reputation.what, then, main element sort control system need achievethese objectives? basically, five inter-related elements: management oversight thecontrol culture; risk assessment; control activities; information communication; monitoringactivities. the basle committee bank supervision recently put together setof fourteen principle regulator use evaluate institution’s internal control systems. i donot propose run one one, i would like pick one two point togive idea i, regulator, see key ideas.first, management oversight control culture, start point theboard director need understand risk run institution, set acceptable limit onthese risks, ensure senior management take step necessary identify, monitor andcontrol risks. senior management must take responsibility implement strategiesapproved board, set appropriate internal control procedures, monitor theeffectiveness procedures.this make quite clear main responsibility control rest - isfairly squarely shoulder institution’s board director seniormanagement, compliance audit departments. however, say that, everyonein institution share responsibility extent. a key task board seniormanagement establish right culture within institution, culture importanceof internal control stressed, high ethical integrity standard promoted. this culture - 2 -bis review 48/1998will determine simply top level management say do. forexample, institution’s remuneration policy reward risk-taking expense prudence?does senior management display casual attitude towards breach limits? do encourage theright attitude towards regulatory compliance? be back respect senior level theinternal audit compliance functions? the response senior level organisation tothese kind issue determine personnel low actually behave practice, includingtheir attitude control issues.moving risk assessment, important thing identify evaluate everyfactor could adversely affect achievement institution’s objectives. this mean justthe familiar risk credit risk liquidity risk, also risk operational risk, interest raterisk, market risk, country transfer risk, legal risk reputational risk. and need anongoing process, continually re-evaluating risk review control system addressthese risks.regarding control activities, point i would stress control activity need tobe integral part daily operation institution. example include: top levelreviews performance risk exposure; appropriate activity control monitor performanceand exception departmental divisional level; segregation duties; physical control onaccess assets; periodic check compliance exposure limits; system approval andauthorisations transaction certain limits; system verification reconciliation oftransaction detail activities. the objective ensure area institution arecontinually compliance establish policy procedures.on information communication, self-evident institution needscomprehensive timely financial, operational compliance data, need goodinformation systems. but information first step. equally important thesecond step, information get right people right time.finally, monitoring, cannot overstress monitor theeffectiveness institution’s internal control continual ongoing process, thatmonitoring key risk integral part daily operation institution. effectiveand independent internal audit compliance function important role play here. thisrequires function direct access senior level organisation potentialcriticisms system transaction cannot block line management concerned.these, then, i would regard key element financial institution’sinternal controls. a regard apply individual institutions, expectation abanking supervisor financial institution, regardless size, effectivesystem internal control consistent nature, complexity, risk activity andthat respond change institution’s environment conditions. i say iexpect every institution use state-of-the-art risk management control techniques. butwhat i expect every institution control system adhere basicprinciples i discussed, state-of-the-art need give thatparticular institution’s activities. i also expect system keep review thingschange.let move discus thing go wrong controlsbreak down. i go particular case studies, try instead draw together ofthe common thread recent problem bank cases. the basle committee paper i mentionedearlier suggest five common threads, i draw follow remarks. - 3 -bis review 48/1998the first, i mention already, lack adequate management oversightand accountability, failure develop strong control culture within institution. withoutexception, common feature recent problem bank case management inattention to, andlaxity in, control culture institution, insufficient guidance oversight board ofdirectors senior management, lack clear management accountability theassignment role responsibilities. these case also reflect insufficient incentive carry outstrong line supervision maintain high level control consciousness within business areas.the second thread inadequate assessment risk certain bank activities,whether balance sheet. many bank organisation suffer major lossesneglected continually ass risk new product activities, update riskassessments significant change occur environment business conditions. manyrecent case highlight fact control system function well traditional simpleproducts unable handle sophisticate complex products.the third thread absence failure key control activities, segregationof duties, approvals, verifications, reconciliations, review operate performance. lack ofsegregation duty particular play major role significant loss occurredat banks.the fourth thread inadequate communication information level ofmanagement within bank, especially upward communication problems. to effective,policies procedure need effectively communicate personnel involve activity.some loss bank occur relevant personnel aware understandthe bank’s policies. in several instances, information inappropriate activity havebeen report upward organisational level communicate board directorsor senior management problem become severe. in instances, information inmanagement report complete accurate, create favourable impression businesssituation fact problematic.the fifth final thread inadequate ineffective audit program othermonitoring activities. in many cases, audit sufficiently rigorous identify report thecontrol weakness associate problem banks. in cases, even though auditor reportedproblems, correct management.from common threads, clear why, first part myremarks today, i stress thing i - management oversight control culture, riskassessment, control activity monitoring, information communication. these theareas institution need focus avoid become “problem bank case” themselves.let move consider role bank supervisor ensure thatan institution’s internal control adequate effective. this area beengreatly increase emphasis recent years. of course supervisors, like management financialinstitutions, always concern quality control systems. however, approachhas rather piecemeal, focus certain type risk easily quantifiable,rather intangible type risk. what try nowadays move towardsa systematic identification assessment risk face bank across whole range ofits activity adequacy control risks.this “risk-based” approach intend focus attention see theinstitution’s key risk areas. of course, correct identification institution’s key risk area iscrucial this. for hong kong’s local banks, credit risk, liquidity risk perhaps - 4 -bis review 48/1998reputational risk remain high risk areas, individual institution form risk suchas interest rate risk market risk also come equation. if institution engage type ofbusiness regard high end risk scale, share margin finance orlending property development, also attract attention. other thing attractour attention include major change operate environment, include new technology; areasor activity experience rapid growth; introduction new line business, productsor activities; domestic foreign acquisitions. in case would want assure thatany necessary enhancement control environment make reduce chanceof adverse unforeseen effect institution.different risk area require different approaches, essentially approach tostart review write policy procedure set control particulararea, look control work practice. this may involve combination ofreviews documentation, discussion staff, test transactions. the end-resultwill judgement whether believe control effective need improvement. ifimprovement need discus recommendation management agree anaction plan time-scale remedial action.this may sound quite similar respect work institution’sinternal audit department external auditors. i would agree certainly commonfeatures, indeed would usually review part work work do auditdepartment identify area potential risk control problems. similarly, external auditors’observations recommendation often useful u come judgement theeffectiveness institution’s internal controls. however, supervise institution effectively asupervisor needs, opinion, mean independently verify internal control soundand substantive risk identify considered. for reason, ongoingdialogue institutions, periodic on-site examination institutions’ activities, areinvaluable.i believe oversight also beneficial practical way institutionitself. for example, may insight institution not. we may able give aninstitution feedback compare vis-à-vis peer similar area indicate respect inwhich, experience, control risk management process fall behind game.i would want overplay “management consultant” type role, i think beneficial,perhaps especially smaller, le sophisticate financial institutions. of course, presupposesthat necessary expertise offer useful advice. this constant challenge today’senvironment rapid technological change product innovation. we therefore try todevelop treasury security specialist whose task review ass moreleading-edge sophisticate area value risk treasury derivative riskmanagement.let move subject prevention money laundering. this akey concern supervisor major international financial centres, something thatshould high agenda management every financial institution.here hong kong considerable time effort put period ofyears ensure bank system follow best international practice prevention ofmoney laundering. principally, mean follow recommendation basle committeeon bank supervision financial action task force, whose guidance note theprevention money launder use develop detail guideline institutions.the basic thrust guideline provide institution place adequate andeffective policies, procedure control combat money laundering, cover essential area - 5 -bis review 48/1998such procedure account opening, customer identification record keep well propersystems report suspicious transaction train staff.please doubt seriously regard adherence guidelines.the reason simple. to paraphrase health warn packet cigarettes, “moneylaundering seriously damage health”. be associate money launder canseriously undermine confidence individual financial institution potentially financialsystem whole. we presently see demonstrate case mexican bankingsystem, embroil money-laundering scandal.so step bank supervisor take ensure institution doingeverything protect use money laundering? the first thing isto make sure guideline issue institution keep up-to-date technique patternsof money launder evolve, ensure institution revise internal guidelinesaccordingly. we recently revise guideline issue convenient booklet. i ampleased say demand high issue 5000 copy thebooklet. however, guideline need put practice. to ensure senior management arefocused need this, money-laundering control regular agenda item prudentialmeetings management. they also regular topic on-site examinations. during theseexaminations review institution’s policy procedures, look record suspicioustransactions, interview staff random check train identify suspicioustransactions follow appropriate procedure account open customeridentification. we may also commission external auditors’ report think necessary.so institution hong kong rate combat money laundering? perhapsthe best indicator vigilance money launder number report suspicioustransactions make joint financial intelligence unit (jfiu). these number suggest thatinstitutions certainly improving, number reports, number institutionsmaking reports, increase time. the number report make jfiu rise fromonly 264 1992 4210 1997. our on-site examination also suggest level ofawareness, train staff, improving. so, overall, institution well. however,there always room improvement, i would urge responsibility area torelax guard.this bring conclude remarks. i start today talk theimportant element control system, bank supervisor ass effectiveness ofinstitutions’ controls. i discuss common thread recent “problem bank” cases, andthe control issue highlighted. finally, i stress importance control area moneylaundering prevention. while i hope interest you, least give slightlydifferent perspective familiar issues, i think i end say i certainly lay noclaim answers. please sit back expect bank supervisor issueguidelines tell exactly need do. while i hope advice may help, theresponsibility ensure institution right control right culture yours.so i hope conference provide useful, practical idea improve yourinstitutions’

association 27/5/98.thank invitation attend meet talk economic policy andinflation. today i shall begin brief review historical background fight againstinflation swedish economy. it worth recall eight year pass since itwas decide sweden combat inflation would top priority. this policy pursuedconsistently ever since. after couple initial year troublesome many ways, resultshave encourage swedish stabilisation policy look good even european comparison.this follow discussion three policy fields—fiscal policy, labour market wageformation—that closely link monetary policy, well remark competitiveconditions sweden’s economy. successful result policy field enlarge room manoeuvrein monetary policy. in conclusion i shall consider topical monetary policy issues, include ourcurrent appraisal inflation monetary policy’s construction.1. the fight inflation resultshigh inflation characterise sweden’s economy number year 1970s and1980s, period clearly illustrate inflation economy’s negative consequences. repeat attemptswere make rectify economic imbalance mean devaluation fiscal stimulus butdevelopment remain unstable. the problem inflation accentuate financialmarkets deregulated. price wage rise steeply sweden catch wage-price spirals.the occurrence price bubble make investment decision hazardous lead weakproductivity. a high level inflation become permanent

officially first time budget statement january 1991. combatinginflation give pride place economic policy agenda. the final policy objective thesame perception condition need attain changed.this realignment stabilisation policy occurred, however, time earlierpolicy’s negative consequence begin leave mark. due high level cost inmanufacturing, example, economic growth sweden weak. in addition, rise real interest ratecoincided period tax reform make saver investor sensitive interest rates.all mark downward effect domestic demand.the drop output—almost 6 per cent course three years—meant turn thatgovernment finance worsen dramatically. from surplus 4.2 per cent gdp 1990, budgetbalance swing deficit 12.3 per cent 1993. in period, moreover, register unemploymentshot 1.7 8.2 per cent.in way, economic crisis early 1990s say generate bypolitical decisions. the combination stabilisation policy realignment structural reformsdid play part course crisis. but also underscore measure werebroadly essential. the problem much measure implement aninflationary bubble already develop fact policy realign earlier.in recent years, economic development sweden favourable. growth hasbeen strong high phase late 1980s prove possible combine good growthwith low inflation. a couple year realignment economic policy, inflation fall - 2 -bis review 47/1998sharply around 3 per cent. moreover, reduction current inflation accompany adownward revision inflation expectations. today, neither households, firm financial marketagents perceive serious threat inflation come five years.government finance also improve markedly since effect acute crisis inthe early 1990s overcome. after rapid budget consolidation, surplus 1.6 per cent forecast for1998. government debt reduce since 1995. still, restoration confidence take longtime. there strong persistent doubt determination ability thegovernment riksdag (sweden’s parliament) carry propose measures.finally worth note step reorient economic policy stability weretaken consensus considerably broad sometimes suggest politicaldebate. a good foundation year ahead laid, although high unemployment still aserious problem sweden’s economy. the positive picture underpin institutional reform tothe budget process status riksbank.2. three field importance monetary policynow i like turn issue policy field major practicalimportance monetary policy. they are: fiscal policy, labour market, wage formation andcompetitive condition swedish economy. it generally case price stability issupported policy fields, great contribution monetary policy make othereconomic policy goals.good fiscal foundation store lean year advisablefiscal policy relevant monetary policy number ways. fiscal decision affectthe room manoeuvre monetary policy via direct impact demand—and hence oninflation—but also influence economic policy’s credibility. a fiscal policy perceivedas untenable long run raise doubt overall policy commitment lowinflation stability. to add fiscal policy’s influence macro economy. the waysin tax levy public revenue spend influence behaviour household firms,which may thereby—generally long run—alter economy’s inflation propensity. today,however, i shall develop aspect.in first respect—fiscal policy’s impact economic activity—the picture clear-cut:in recent year fiscal stance tight. of course, contribute low rate ofinflation sense assist monetary policy. with current fiscal proposal yearsahead, however, stance tight before. but extent growth householdincome still restrain overall change taxation public spending.as regard credibility, mark improvement. last year governmentlaid long-term objective government finance go average thecorresponding commitment europe. over business cycle budget balance average asurplus 2 per cent gdp. the riksdag approve objective.the riksbank find objective reasonable. a budget surplus business cyclecan contribute speedy reduction government debt, currently high. this creategreater freedom action future economic policy, particularly important sweden’spublic finance doubt still relatively sensitive cyclical economic situation. but future hasfurther challenge store fiscal policy. an age population imply new grow requirements,for example. another matter may alter condition fiscal policy increase mobility taxbases, respect may make difficult maintain present level taxation.better wage settlement next round? - 3 -bis review 47/1998as thing stand, fiscal policy continue provide good room manoeuvre inmonetary policy come years. so contribution labour market wageformation?of aggregate value-added swedish economy, wage make almost 70 percent. wage trend therefore crucial path inflation. for many years, wage rise swedenhas rate country europe. but know, instead givingswedish employee good real wage, outcome reverse. in 1990s rate wageincreases sweden curb negotiate increase 1995 round theeuropean average.as i mention earlier, economic policy sweden focus low inflationsince 1991. a consistent implementation policy, inflation target, clarify rule thegame wage formation. high wage increase liable boost inflation, necessitate higherinterest rates.the inflationary consequence wage increase modify productivitygrowth good, case recent years. but least part productivity growth isachieved expense jobs; one aspect process whereby high labour cost generatestronger rationalisation maybe also increase capital input. in way, too, becausethe high interest rate directly affect demand employment, rapid wage rise liable endangerjobs.against background, outcome late wage negotiation good inearlier years. agreement next three year conclude level around 3 per cent year.it say take wage drift account probably entirely case. insteadone doubt count wage drift average around 1 per cent. the average annual wage outcomein period 1998–2000 would 3.5 4 per cent. this still represent downward shiftin rate wage increases, turn assist riksbank’s task ensure low inflation. all elseequal, allow somewhat low level interest rate somewhat strong growthof demand.speaking you, seem natural take two aspect issue:- the outcome 1998 wage round appear sufficiently low make amajor contribution employment sweden. but wage level still rise faster, anything, thanthe european average. this may prove manageable regard inflation sweden’s competitiveposition, thank good productivity growth, entail employment?- neither easy feel really confident next wage round. what reallyresponsible good outcome year compare 1995? the great credibility inflationtarget cite one explanation whole story? and not, otherarguments occasion still hold good two three year time? these importantquestions need analyse answered, first place party labour market.better competition price formation doa third issue, presumably practical consequence monetary policy andthe fight inflation recent years, although seldom discuss contexts, thecompetitive situation swedish economy.in work riksbank monitor price swedish economy, could failto notice positive change competitive condition price recent years, well somemore negative pattern seem persisting. - 4 -bis review 47/1998let take positive aspect first. one favourable price trend importedgoods recent years. this particularly notable much period exchange rate hasbeen comparatively weak, push import price up. a favourable price trend alsobeen observe food products, example; seem consequence, least part, ofsweden’s membership european union. today, moreover, many indication thecombination european monetary union increase it-based trade, instance, makecompetition even stronger.there general difference development administer price marketprices good services. the administer price rise faster. this may result ofincreased fee set public sector recent years, connection structural move awayfrom tax finance fill exist “holes” public finances. then classic explanationthat easy raise productivity growth part service sector. this doubtapplies particular number service mainly provide public auspices, asmedical care care aged.i raise question competitive condition price formation today mainly soas help initiate debate matters. for monetary policy self-evidently case thatincreased competition, keep cost price down, lead good inflation prospects. this inturn improve condition monetary policy.in recent year indication tendency direction, sweden aswell globally. at time, difficult tell much reduction inflation beattributed specifically change competition price formation. neither clear longsuch process continue whether potential exist keep price seriesof years. these matter intend return.3. some monetary policy issuessweden good experience, i demonstrate earlier, effort establishcredibility mean direct inflation target. inflation currently low level expect toremain low come years. the condition continue monetary policy’s focus stabilityare improve far-reaching delegation monetary policy involve theriksbank’s enhance status turn year. against background, i like commenton monetary policy’s topical issues.the exchange ratethe part play krona’s exchange rate matter debate surface fromtime time. a recent instance is, example, run european monetary union attentionthis draw sweden’s commitment member european union. some observer believe thatthe riksbank may (unacknowledged) exchange rate target. that misconception. theriksbank target krona’s exchange rate.in flexible exchange rate regime price stability target, exchange rate isadmittedly major factor, one many factor impinge inflation. a permanentappreciation depreciation krona affect inflationary pressure via import prices, example. agiven exchange rate trend may well support monetary policy’s drive price stability; notthe case, however, riksbank intervene adjust repo rate.at time, exchange rate price asset current throughout theeconomy; value krona highly important many economic decisions, least exportcompanies. this make stable exchange rate fundamentally desirable. it easy economicagents make decisions. all else equal, lead high growth. - 5 -bis review 47/1998to basic endeavour keep price krona stable add oureuropean undertakings. a member european union commit treat exchangerate policy matter common interest. opinion union presumably differ time timeabout practical application commitment basic requirement policy focusesconsistently stability.the riksdag leave door open sweden’s participation monetary union alate date state connection move relevant join european exchangerate mechanism (erm). in perspective, too, advantage krona le stable.monetary policy euro area primary objective price stability. wedo yet know european central bank (ecb) formulate target unlikely todiffer norm apply germany since mid 1980s. this mean inflation toexceed medium-term level 2 per cent. in practice, therefore, difference policy fieldbetween ecb sweden probably great real consequence theexchange rate.with policy focus price stability sweden monetary union, thereshould good possibility stable exchange rate krona euro. this supportedby path krona relative german mark recent years. a measured, example, thelong-term interest rate differential germany, confidence swedish economic policy highsince 1996. in period two occasion krona fluctuate 2per cent german

upper limit exceeded.that case. a couple year short period base argumentsthat deviation target rate sign policy symmetric. monetary policywork involve lot uncertainty, doubt inevitable interest rate set thebasis forecast extend several year future. at present, moreover, assessment areparticularly difficult soon changeover low-inflation regime, may involvein form alter behaviour household firms. another complication recent years,inflation throughout world low expected.another aspect issue riksbank’s choice target variable. everyconceivable indicator inflation shortcoming weigh theadvantages choose monetary policy’s target variable. the consumer price index (cpi) theadvantages well-known establish among economic agent people general ameasure inflation. it also cover large proportion household consumption. these centralarguments cpi choose target variable begin 1993.a disadvantage cpi, however, combine information inflation’sunderlying trend transitory price movements. in period inflation target inforce, transitory factor mark effect cpi number occasions. example suchfactors tax change (most recently increase subsequent cut property tobacco taxes)and fluctuation interest rate (which affect cpi form house mortgage expenditure).during 1996 1997 particular cpi relatively markedly target ratebut even tolerance interval. this face riksbank educational problems.transitory effect inflation ought secondary consideration monetary policyand absorb inside tolerance interval 1–3 per cent. that one interval’s functions. and - 6 -bis review 47/1998provided question temporary price movement around stable rate inflation, noreason counter movement repo rate adjustments. on contrary, might adestabilising effect real economy. instead, monetary policy’s central concern direction ofinflation’s long-term trend. it trend affect directly total demand henceby monetary policy.against background, riksbank contact cpi enquiry, set thegovernment, obtain assistance specify indicator underlie inflation likely bewidely accept publish regularly statistic sweden. in future, indicatormight able direct function monetary policy, either replace cpi targetvariable serve operational target aid continuous work construct policy. theriksbank also ask statistic sweden publish, time being, one indicator ofunderlying inflation together cpi. perhaps i emphasise way initiativesalter monetary policy’s fundamental commitment price stability.the current situation monetary policythe question transitory effect lead current monetary policy. transitoryeffects play major part cpi’s present development. a result tax changes, lowerinterest rate low oil price, since december riksbank revise 1998 cpiprediction downwards 1.2 percentage points. in 1999, too, transitory effect mean cpiinflation low envisage earlier.thus far, however, alter picture inflation need sizeableconsequences monetary policy. it late influence year’s path inflation thanmarginally. moreover, transitory effect entail risk high inflation, anything, during1999; tax cut low interest rate leave household money spend appliesto cheap oil.but underlie inflation also show sign weak expect even thougheconomic activity seem relatively strong line path count sometime, increase drive domestic demand support strong activity europe.the good picture price come variety factors. the rate wage increase islikely somewhat advantageous count earlier, even though consistentlybeen cautiously optimistic respect. of great importance productivity, good growth inrecent year help brighten prospects. somewhat low import price together slightlystronger exchange rate also contribute.work next inflation report near completion. there several indicationsthat two year horizon relevant monetary policy, cpi inflation may somewhat belowour target. the picture underlie inflation much same. neither positive inflationprospects modify various risk lie ahead. in perspective extend middle 2000the element uncertainty obviously high; anything, however, main risk seem thatinternational activity marginally weak inflation accordingly somewhat lower.this pleasant situation in. the swedish economy appear grow arate reasonable broadly expected. at time, inflation low expected. theprospect riksbank face last autumn, inflation two year hence half percentage pointabove target, long seem probable.for monetary policy, outlook accordingly changed. the present inflationprospects clearly imply need raise interest rate disappear now. a strictinterpretation riksbank’s rule monetary policy focus primarily second thecoming two year could even indicate downward adjustment instrumental rate. what - 7 -bis review 47/1998riksbank reason consider whether minor downward interest rate adjustment would leadto good condition stable economic development future.4. conclusionstabilisation policy sweden realign early 1990s focus lowinflation. the background countries’ experience 1970s 1980s.repeated attempt stimulate demand, view boost employment, accept associatedincrease inflation fail produce intend results. on contrary, economic activity hadbecome unstable growth long term had, anything, weakened.in recent year result policy realignment good many respects.economic growth sweden high latter part 1980s provedpossible combine low inflation. government finance also undergo rapidimprovement. moreover, revise rule fiscal monetary policy provide betterconditions future stability. this mean good foundation also establish futureeconomic development.the 1998 round settlement agreement represent step right direction thesense that, compare previous round, agree rate wage increase come year lookslike easy combine low inflation. unfortunately, however, still reason someconcern future. do wage settlement create really good condition increasedemployment foundation lay responsible wage settlement nextnegotiating round two three year time?some positive thing swedish economy also happen recent year asregards competitive condition price formation. with ongoing process internationalisation,european monetary union advance it field, likely intensification ofcompetition downward pressure prices, benefit swedish consumers. but cause toconsider whether done, would also assist monetary policy.finally i consider aspect monetary policy current situation respect.in past six month inflation prospect improved. like many central bank central europe, theriksbank accordingly move situation point likelihood relatively quicksuccession continue interest rate increase one need high interest rate nearfuture seem disappeared.with bright inflation prospect strict interpretation riksbank’s rule formonetary policy decisions, today may even grind consider minor downward repo rateadjustment. what

cross-border good financial flows. and capital market areglobalised, different approach monetary policy may contribute volatility. such volatilitymay strong impact financial real investment.but, third problem area: policy integration two-edgedsword. it may make market efficient. but also contribute curb policycompetition. that may involve risks: excessive tendency towards centralisation may arise -

weaknesses, inparticular, may become achilles heel: domestic financial sector unable handlelarge capital flow sufficiently sound manner, overly rigid exchange rate peg toone currencies.exchange rate peg case length time producepositive effects. an overly rigid exchange rate peg, however, problematicconsequences: it may jeopardise competitiveness economy, especially exports. itmay fetter domestic interest rate policy. it thereby make difficult fight inflation inperiods heavy capital inflows. and may tempt resident borrow foreign currency atrelatively favourable nominal interest rates. these consequence may make country vulnerable,as see already mexican case 1994-5. - 5 -bis review 45/1998in addition, risk factor inherent market. the internationalfinancial market mostly tendency towards

recipient country bail private investors. loss cause bymisjudgements enforce adjustment event wrong behaviour much integralpart function market profit opportunities. and crisis invariably lead

weakness orprevent arise first place. this includes: careful overly rigidexchange rate pegs, strengthen domestic supervision financial system, all,strengthening domestic competitive structure good market financial sector.vcynics might say europe make spar use advice: “becareful exchange rate pegs”. after all, eleven european country actually roadtowards monetary union. and hitherto also largely link mutual exchange rates,though always without problem past.monetary union fact represent maximum policy integration themonetary field. monetary policy merely coordinated, unified. and forgood, practice step cannot reversed.there course also options. with european monetarysystem, europe’s approach long time exchange rate arrangement withfixed adjustable parities; time considerable difficulties, theend system prove largely successful. that go particular also period - 6 -bis review 45/1998widening fluctuation margins. nevertheless, approach fall short full monetaryintegration strategy single currency.at time, country propose another, le ambitious solution thanfull monetary union; i refer adoption parallel currency, use acommon currency. that would probably trigger currency competition. depend itsdesign, solution could, however, also adversely affect scope monetary actionof central bank exist hard currency country thus jeopardise theiranti-inflation policy. a parallel currency would presumably get stuck. it might perhaps havebeen able crowd weak currencies, whether also currency d-mark’s standingwould least doubtful. this true, rate, specific form monetary policyactivities discuss time.be may, maastricht treaty far-reaching solution wasadopted. a large majority eu opt merely common currency. it also want asingle currency. there sound economic reason favour single currency; incidentally,also sound political reasons, least, thorough-going political integration beingsought.above all, single currency make possible fully exploit economicbenefits integration. competition give maximum encouragement single marketby complete transparency prices. factor allocation long impair domesticexchange rate uncertainty. exchange-rate-related information transaction cost beminimised single currency. the euro financial market optimum depth andbreadth.but apply economic integration general also apply monetaryintegration particular: these benefit come automatically withoutcorresponding challenges.how monetary union secure benefits? what risk looming?monetary union face three major challenges: firstly, aforementionedbenefits good financial market materialise euro remain lastinglystable. only euro lead full price transparency, reduce cost become anattractive investment currency. secondly, monetary union must trigger exacerbateeconomic tensions. broadly speaking, essential requirement must meet is: one size fitsall. and, thirdly, monetary union must give rise political tension participatingstates.these challenge arise backdrop specific condition presentedby monetary union. the euro legal tender area consist largely sovereignnational state whose policy - monetary policy - largely remain theirresponsibility. that may lead dilemma requirement supranational currency,and political pattern europe, continue determine national statesand policies.the euro need high degree flexibility economy participatingcountries. but european economic structural policy ordain suchnecessary flexibility above. and even responsibility european level - 7 -bis review 45/1998doing so, possibility could rule that, ultimately, result would rigidity,rather flexibility. at time, regional revenue equalisation scheme,comparable system operate national state. a social transfer union cannot andmust make lack flexibility competitiveness, upshot would probablybe le flexibility, possibly also political disagreement.at time, however, euro need discipline part national fiscalpolicy, least far fiscal deficit concerned. otherwise risk conflicts,because large debt country attract save euro area whole, andcontribute high interest rate everyone. fiscal policy, however, largely remain anational responsibility. that important growth stability pact shouldprove effective future.how euro function background? the “classical” answer thewerner group early seventy (of i member time) was: europe must setup political union parallel monetary union. thus, supranational political structure weresupposed ensure europe meet requirement supranational currency.maastricht adopt different approach. it leave rift supranationalmoney national policy structures. to extent, sometimes dub “a constructwith limp”. if, however, supranational political authority meet requirement ofa supranational currency, participate country must initiative, oftheir accord interest.the maastricht treaty therefore also set important rule fiscal discipline ofmember countries. and compliance rule likewise jointly monitored. however,what ultimately crucial function stability pact will, all, thecountries’ ability willingness abide rule sustain basis.a monetary union, maastricht treaty, therefore need large measure ofcommon “stability culture” participate countries. and another point: euro canfunction depoliticised currency specific form. the ultimate monetary target,i.e. monetary stability, must subordinate discretionary basis goals. andmonetary policy must conduct politically independent central bank.that may consider quarter overly german postulate. but inmy view imply requirement lastingly stable currency, also bythe logic monetary union comprise several countries. for one country subordinate itsown currency political objective stability, may unpleasant consequencesfor countries, give globalise financial markets. but still, one could live that. if,however, eleven country try subordinate common currency respective primarypolitical objectives, thing really get pretty chaotic union.that way, euro would gain confidence neither citizen thefinancial markets. the upshot would, rather, likely permanent political conflict.the euro must come influence domestic interest individual countries.monetary policy must gear situation euro area whole, take responsibilityfor maintain stability common currency. some incident brussels thefirst weekend may may context timely warning, lesson learnedby all. - 8 -bis review

bank supervisory responsibilities? and, i hesitate even ask, whythere separate federal state supervisor thrift institution credit unions? just incase even question confuse you, let step back outline structure banksupervisory system unite states.if want open bank unite states, must get permission - is,a charter - government agency. there two way this: state government charter“state banks,” federal

long-standingdesire many american decentralize bank system. an important theme americanpolitical philosophy distrust concentration power, especially concentration offinancial power. thus, start

interaction development inboth financial real economy expand cross-border asset holdings, trading, andcredit flows. in response, financial intermediaries, include bank security firms, haveincreased cross-border operations. once again, critical result rapid evolution hasbeen substantial increase competition home abroad. today, example, almost40 percent u.s. domestic commercial industrial bank loan market account byforeign-owned banks.the final significant trend i highlight on-going consolidation theu.s. bank industry. i think fair say american bank system currentlyin midst significant consolidation history. a i mention earlier, lasttwo decade nearly traditional barrier geographic expansion u.s. bank havecrumbled. while state take lead eliminate barrier begin late1970s, final step take federal government passage riegle-neal act in1994. under act, virtually full interstate branch bank become possible june 1997.a fact perhaps give feel profound change occur thestructure u.s. bank

part, part, tothe large number bank failure late 1980s early 1990s. a important factorwas merger among healthy banks. since early 1980s, unusual see 400 ormore merger among healthy bank year.while merger occurred, continue occur, among bank sizes, iwould emphasize three aspect current bank merger movement. first high incidenceof “mega mergers,” merger among large bank organizations. several merger thelast year either large time, among large bank merger u.s.history. example include combine chase manhattan chemical bank, well fargoand first interstate, nationsbank barnett, and, recently, first union corestates. - 6 -bis review 34/1998˝second, despite merger activity, large number medium small bank remain inthe unite states. moreover, measure performance small bank thana match large

overall number bank organization fallensince 1980, mean new, de novo, entry occurred. from 1980 through1997 3,600 new bank form unite states. my bottom line? theu.s. bank structure highly dynamic, adjust variety forces, defy easygeneralizations.the current wave bank merger lead substantial increase bankconcentration national level. for example, percentage bank asset control bythe top 10 bank organization rise 22 percent 1980 34 percent 1997. thepercentage hold top 25 increase 33 53 percent.are increase national concentration public policy concern? in myview, answer question “no,” least time, virtually evidencewe strongly suggest competition problem almost always arise bank locallevel. that is, extent bank able exert market power, exercise powertends occur retail market relatively narrow geographic scope, fairlywell-defined set customers, usually household small businesses.however, special influence local market competition may develop bankconsolidation interstate branch continue, result large bank compete witheach increase number local markets. such widespread competitive contact maycause firm temper competitive behavior individual market recognition thepotential response rival common market recognition theirwidespread mutual interests.so, happen bank concentration local market since 1980?the answer is, “not much”. for example, average three-bank deposit concentration ratio inmetropolitan statistical areas, common measure local urban markets, hover between65 68 percent 1980 1997. concentration measure rural county showsimilar results, average three-bank concentration ratio remain 89 percentthroughout period. other measure local market concentration show similar result forboth urban rural areas.the stability local market concentration face largeconsolidation bank industry remarkable. while single reason thisstability, i would point two factor particular importance. many mergers,including merger large banks, involve institution compete samelocal markets. in cases, local market concentration obviously affected. where themerging bank compete local markets, enforcement antitrust law beenan important factor limit growth local market concentration. moreover, antitrustenforcement doubt deter highly anti-competitive merger even beingproposed.why bank consolidate number expand size andgeography? again, one answer appropriate, merger somewhat unique andreflects one factor. in recent year many bank respond removal - 7 -bis review 34/1998˝of barrier interstate bank branch restrict entry divide markets. in suchcases, twin desire diversify risk geographically expand source “core” depositshave surely important motivate forces. moreover, geographic barrier constrainednatural market developments; important sense removal simply allow marketto adjust new economic equilibrium previously legally mandate equilibrium.beyond adjustments, scale economy mention frequently bankersas causal factor bank consolidation, although academic research tend find muchevidence overall economy scale banking. still, economy scale certainly exist forsome bank operations, many back office functions. in addition, line business,such security underwrite market making, require large level activity viable.increased competitive pressure cause rapid technological change result blurringof distinction bank type financial firms, low barrier entry due toderegulation, increase globalization also important factors. for example, greatercompetition force inefficient bank become efficient, accept low profits, close upshop, - order exit market cannot survive - merge another bank.other possible motif merger include simple desire achieve market power, effortsby management build empire enhance compensation. some merger probably occur asan effort prevent acquire bank acquired, or, alternatively, enhance abank’s attractiveness buyers.no matter bank merging, bottom line unite state wellon way develop truly national bank structure first time history. weare quite yet, i think take many years. what thisstructure look like? well, obviously complex question, answer whichinvolves forecast year advance. and i tell many year experience,forecasting economy even one year advance risky humble business. thus,any prognostication future bank structure take many grain ofsalt.still, economist feed try look dark glass seethe future unite state bank structure. for reason i discussed, seemsreasonable expect continue high level merger activity foreseeable future. verylarge merger uncommon. study base historical experience suggest inaround decade likely 3,000 4,000 bank organizations, fromabout 7,000 today. although top 10 bank organization almost certainlyaccount large share u.s. bank asset today, overall size

give bank strong internal incentive manage risk prudently andminimize exploitation moral hazard. put differently, need design strategy thatencourage banks, self-interest, work us, us.when design supervisory policy, always remember first line ofdefense excessive risk-taking bank market itself. market discipline be, andoften is, highly effective deter excessive risk. indeed, primary goal many bankregulatory reform implement wake bank thrift crisis 1980s early1990s either increase market discipline make supervisor behave like marketwould behave. market discipline increased, example, raise capital standard bymandating great public disclosure bank financial condition. prompt corrective actionrules require supervisor impose increasingly severe penalty bank financialcondition deteriorates, adoption risk-based deposit insurance premium example ofencouraging supervisor act like market.the reform early 1990s good start. but i believe may well bemore do. such comment may sound place today. time good, almosteveryone seem quite satisfy current deposit insurance system. but good time may beprecisely develop idea even effective system. the crucible crisis isnot always best time think reform -- witness error make pass glass-steagall act, error yet correct 65 years! indeed, part reasonthat board continue urge congress pas financial modernization legislation. so, thespirit forward looking, let attempt give flavor one idea seem worthconsidering.it may possible increase market discipline require large, internationallyactive bank issue minimum amount certain type subordinate debt public. anappealing aspect approach subordinate debt holders, long bank - 5 -bis review 55/1998“insiders,” face downside risk, thus risk preference close thefdic. subordinate debt holder would therefore expect impose market discipline thebank quite consistent bank supervisor try do, include encouragingbanks disclose information financial condition. observe risk premium onsubordinated debt could perhaps use help fdic set accurate risk-based depositinsurance premiums, debt would provide extra cushion protection taxpayers. anadditional benefit subordinate debt trade open market price movementswould provide clear signal market’s evaluation bank’s financial condition that, even ifit use help price deposit insurance, could serve early warn aid supervisors.subordinated debt not, however, without problems. for example, riskpreferences creditor align fdic bank clearlysolvent. at near insolvency, subordinate debt holder may will “bet bank” orderto increase chance suffer loss. the fact bank closure decision stillin supervisor’s hand another complicate factor. in addition, unclear deep andliquid market bank subordinate debt would be, although limit requirement thelargest bank would ease concern. for example, end last year one-half percent ofbanks le $50 million asset issue subordinate debt, 83 percent bank withtotal asset $10 billion so. however, appear much exist banksubordinated debt hold bank’s parent hold company, independent third parties. thus,the question deep liquid market might evolve remains. for reasons, anoperationally feasible program mandatory subordinate debt would require considerableamount careful thought. still, judgment think might prove worthwhile.the need for financial modernizationtechnology globalization change market world, perhapsnone affect financial markets. yet unite state much legalframework essentially change since 1930s. the resultant pressure financialinstitutions able compete thus reflect search loophole effort byregulatory authority find way within charter permit new activities. the process notonly inefficient, create new inequities, institution may produce unintended risks, andthe misallocation resources. that colleague i strong supporter h.r.10, the financial modernization act 1998, house pass last month senatebanking committee discuss next week.this bill bring financial institution 21st century framework thatminimizes risk inequities. the task set easy. each set financialinstitutions -- regulator -- special privilege advantage wish tomaintain limit restraint wish shed. balance reality result inprovisions bill one -- include -- say like completely. but thebalancing h.r. 10 is, i think, best possible; indeed, many respect balancedthat adjustment address concern one set institution would probably eliminate thesupport another set institutions. what critical, seem me, bill afine balance job, public interest, something i sorry say toofrequently lose sight of. let share specific reason i think bill thatdeserves support.first foremost bill would finally let financial institution get eachother’s businesses, thus widen scope range institution compete thepublic’s business. mind you, statement say financial supermarket and/or largeinstitutions good successful specialize and/or small institutions. but - 6 -bis review 55/1998benefit public, regulators, decide prosper competitor bend theirefforts serve consumer.that bottom line. it’s reason financial modernization.but structure bill establish consistent efficient resource allocation withminimizing risk stability economy taxpayer. let’s take close look thatstructure.the critical element h.r. 10 would permit bank conduct ownsubsidiaries (so-called operate subsidiary “op subs”) activity mayalready conduct bank financial agency activities, nature require minimalfunding create minimal risk. these limitations, seem me, crucial several reasons.banks low cost fund financial entity safety net -- namewe give collection deposit insurance, access discount window, access thepayments system. this subsidy provide government order buy systemic stability, butit cost: increase risk take banks, reduce market discipline, consequently needfor onerous bank supervision order balance resultant moral hazard. the last thing weshould want extend subsidy wide range activities, is, i believe, exactlywhat would happen bank op sub could engage wide nonbank financial activities. not onlywould increase moral hazard -- need bank-like supervision -- would alsounbalance competitive play field bank sub independent firm engage thesame business, strange result legislation whose ultimate purpose increase competitionfor financial services.the subsidy integral op sub would surely induce bank otherfinancial institution organize form would maximize use subsidy. indeed,stockholders would every reason critical management avail theopportunity raise low cost funds. the profit bank subsidiary would surely benefit bankparent since gaap accounting, economic legal reality, common sense call forconsolidation. but losses, too, would consolidate bank parent loss would falldirectly safety net, ultimately taxpayer. these safety soundness safety netrisks ultimately would bring need regulate op sub way bank regulated,creating inefficiency reduction innovation, let alone conflict functional regulators.the legislation i support would require organization conduct bankingand financial business organize hold company form bank otheractivities sub hold company. profit loss business line accrue theholding company thus directly benefit endanger bank, safety net, thetaxpayer. the safety net subsidy directly available hold company affiliate andcompetition thus balanced. moreover, traditional regulator like sec stateinsurance commissioner still regulate entity engage nonbank activity wereindependent firms. functional regulation desirable competitive equity, apolitical necessity practical reality process balance require movefinancial regulation. in principle, functional regulation could also apply op subs, thesafety net, i submit, would soon create regulatory conflict structure.importantly, bill pass house would prohibit commercial affiliation withbanks. there doubt become increasingly difficult draw bright line separatesfinancial service nonfinancial businesses; become difficult so. but, thetruth sure enough implication combine bank commerce --potential conflict interest, concentration power, safety net stability concern -- tomove forward area. better, i think, digest financial reform move area - 7 -bis

commercial enterprises. i would hope senatewould instead freeze activity place bank commerce issue addresseddirectly; fact house simply reinforce point hard reverse suchpowers gained.finally, i support h.r. 10 hold company framework would keep thefederal reserve -- central bank unite state -- umbrella supervisor. i believe thatthe feed important role play bank supervision order carry responsibilitiesfor monetary policy, economic stabilization, crisis management. i cannot grasp couldpossibly understand happen bank markets, innovation occur theirimplications, nature quality risk exposure control critical crisismanagement policy formulation without hands-on practical exposure come fromsupervision. an umbrella supervisor need complex organization order assure theentire organization policy control well manage consistent financialstability. at least large organizations, i believe supervisor federal reserveso play role central bank international crisis manager. many people aresurprised hear feed directly supervise 5 large 25 bank -- state members.our window bank umbrella supervision bank hold companies.unfortunately, understandably, view feed want new activity ina bank hold company often construe “turf” issue. i believe two separablearguments. i would prefer hold company -- reason i discuss -- even fedwere umbrella supervisor. but i also think involve bank

increase hourly compensation slow pick mostother recent expansions, although, sure, wage start accelerate past couple yearsas labor market become tight tighter.in first year expansion, subdue rate

close market scrutiny uncover draw attention deep-seated economicproblems may exist. but i would conclude become captive themarkets lose control national monetary policies, argue.first, let u clear “having control” one’s monetary policyactually means. when people talk independent autonomous monetary policy, oftentake mean ability central bank set domestic interest rate without influence - 2 -bis

abroad, link domestic foreign interest rate isinevitable. a major user foreign capital, canada long live interest rate areclosely relate unite state foreign financial markets.but even integrate financial markets, still room monetary policyindependence via exchange rate movements. thus, monetary policy autonomy require flexibleexchange rate regime. with fix exchange rate, national authority essentially adopt themonetary policy another country - country whose currency serf anchor. if interestrates go anchor-currency country, interest rate also rise sufficiently thecountry fix exchange

the mexican crisis focusedthe spotlight fiscal problem time, consequently drive risk premium interestrates sharply higher. during recent asian crisis, however, public finance bettershape, clear,

because flow often drive small difference inperceived rate return home abroad, could well discourage transaction tax.on hand, speculative flow actually “bet” sharp movement currency, haverather large

oesterreichischenationalbank topic “economic policy 2000”, vienna 7-8/5/98.introductionjust day ago, key political decision pave way emuwere take summit brussels. base upon preparatory work europeanmonetary institute, commission ecofin, council head state ofgovernment agree last weekend start stage three emu january 1, 1999, elevencountries. at time, bilateral exchange rate participate currencies, whichare form basis euro conversion rates, preannounced. the european centralbank formally inaugurate frankfurt june 30, emu commence onschedule january 1, 1999. these development provide financial market withreliable point reference contribute substantially calculable development ofexchange rate interest rate onset emu.the general public financial market convince emu willbecome reality months’ time. by comparison, people know much le theinstitutions responsible single monetary policy and, particular, therelationships among them. will still place leave within emu today’s national centralbanks? and so, task go keep monetary policy make frankfurt?these question frequently asked. and answer indeed quite complex.the basic institutional framework european system central bank define theescb/ecb statutea superficial glance escb/ecb statute let thing appear quite simple.• the establishment ecb mid-1998 coincide foundation ofthe european system central bank (escb). the escb consist theecb national central bank (ncbs) eu member states. fromjanuary 1, 1999, escb sole responsibility singlemonetary policy within euro area. in perform tasks, escb beindependent political instruction commit primaryobjective price stability.• the escb govern ecb’s decision-making bodies, lead theecb govern council, consist six member ecbexecutive board, include ecb president vice-president, well asthe governor ncbs euro area. monetary policy decision - 2 -bis review 44/1998taken centrally, simple majority ecb govern council basedon principle “one member, one vote”.• the ecb executive board conduct monetary policy accordance theguidelines decision adopt ecb govern council. in so,it issue necessary instruction national central banks.• the national central bank form integral part escb act inaccordance guideline instruction issue ecb. inconducting operation within escb’s field competence, ecb willrely national central bank whenever possible appropriate.• finally, so-called “general council” constitute thirddecision-making body. it assume responsibility coordination andexchange information euro area eu central bank whichhave yet adopt single currency, exercise influence onthe monetary policy euro area.ample room manoeuvre practical implementationthis, nutshell, escb/ecb statute. it apparently quite straightforwardstructure allow ample room manoeuvre actual practice. the european monetary institutein fact devote quite substantial part preparatory work emu concreteassignment duty establishment procedure within escb.let quote example question resolve incompliance escb statute: who within escb conduct monetary policyoperations? who intervene exchange markets? who manage foreign exchangereserves? do we, inside euro area, still need national balance-of-payments statistics? wherewill commercial bank keep central bank accounts? which body within escb areto access target cross-border payment system? who issue euro banknotes?who print them? where monetary income creation central bank moneyoriginate: ecb national central banks? and go distributedwithin escb? who prepare document meet ecb governingcouncil? will still committee expert delegate national central bank atleast help prepare decision ecb govern council? how large ecb beby comparison national central bank much staff need?each question – i pick – beendiscussed emi great length. most fully resolve – even though initialpositions sometimes diametrically opposed. in cases, transitional rule agreedfor initial phase monetary union; may adjust light ofexperience gained. legal instrument prepare wherever necessary. when ecb - 3 -bis review 44/1998established week now, one first task wind discussion andendorse preliminary work do emi.the philosophy underlie organization escbhow, light emi’s preparatory activities, task duty bedistributed within escb? what role national central bank play?the basic philosophy organize escb decision takencentrally ecb; effect, decision fundamental issue take ecb’sgoverning council. this way uniformity single monetary policycan ensure across euro area. the implementation decision - operations, whichin practice account national central bank’s work - effect national centralbanks decentralize basis, coordinate ecb executive board. like red thread, thesetwo principle – centralize decision guidelines, decentralize implementation – govern allthe escb’s operations.at point, three concept must explained. the first relate escb’stasks functions. the maastricht treaty provide clear definition area whichfrom stage three emu fall within community’s field competence. thus basictasks carry escb define implement monetary policy euroarea, conduct foreign exchange operation accordance exchange rate policy theeuro area, hold manage official foreign reserve member states, promotethe smooth operation payment systems. in area prudential supervision bank andfinancial markets, escb contribute smooth conduct policy pursue thecompetent authorities. in addition basic tasks, national central bank free toperform tasks, provide incompatible objective singlemonetary policy.the second item require explanation legal form escb. theescb legal personality own. only component – ecb nationalcentral bank – legal personality. the term escb therefore refer fact theecb national central bank integral part whole guide common setof rules, objective duty internal external relations. this underline thefederal character escb institutional role national central bank equalpartners within escb.the third concept need explain principle “subsidiarity”.under principle subsidiarity, distribution responsibility task must allowfor maximum degree freedom, time pay due regard body politic.centralized entity monopolize task perform decentralize units.the centralize entity focus function perform interest society awhole. the european union incorporate principle subsidiarity maastricht treaty: - 4 -bis review 44/1998in area fall within exclusive competence, community shall take action onlyif insofar objective propose action cannot satisfactorily achieve themember states. how principle subsidiarity apply monetary union? thetransfer monetary policy national high community level base theconviction general economic interest. only actual implementation ofmonetary policy may – shall – remain responsibility small entities, is, thenational central bank “to extent deem possible appropriate”. consequently, wespeak subsidiarity context emu, must distinguish carefully monetarypolicy decision implementation. in former case, principle subsidiarityprovides motive centralization, latter incentive decentralization.five area responsibility national central banksagainst background, five key area responsibility function beidentified national central banks. first, national central bank governor activelycontribute central decision-making process within escb. in context nationalcentral bank will, second, serve intermediary single monetary policy andnational economic policies. third, act escb’s operative entity carry outmonetary foreign exchange policy well policy relate payment system incompiling monetary balance-of-payments statistics. fourth, national central bank willcontribute ecb’s capital and, “the owners” ecb, also receive share ecbincome. fifth, national central banks, apart escb member banks, continue toexist independent institution outside escb’s scope responsibility befree perform additional function responsibility. let explore fivefunctions great detail.1. participation decision-making ecb govern councilthe first area responsibility relate ncbs’ participation decision-making processes. a already mentioned, ecb govern council consist sixmembers ecb executive board and, time being, eleven governor ncbs. atthe start, ratio member ecb executive board national central bankgovernors therefore one two. this predominance ncb governor ecbdecision-making safeguard that, base european central bank experience, requiredmeasure continuity achieve spite significant change institutional level.the ecb govern council take monetary policy decision simplemajority. each member ecb govern council one vote. this also apply ncbgovernors, regardless whether small large country. this reflect theintention treaty, accord central bank governor serve ecbgoverning council individuals, “country delegates” representative - 5 -bis review 44/1998institutions. they commit community objective task escb areexpected consider monetary policy need euro area whole. the treaty thereforeattaches particular importance independence member ecb executive boardand national central bank governors. to ensure personal independence, escbstatute define certain minimum requirements, include minimum term office andprotection early dismissal. these additional safeguard attempt exertpressure way instruction influence. the prohibition issue instruction ncbgovernors apply fact type bodies, external internal, include thedecision-making body respective national central bank. the treaty deliberately refrainsfrom provide disclosure minute ecb govern council meet votescast individual member ecb govern council order assist actingresponsibly, benefit euro area whole.the call member ecb govern council think “european” hasalso underline economic theory necessary prerequisite define best possiblemonetary policy entire euro area. let u assume, example, austria numberof small medium-sized country command majority vote ecbgoverning board together enjoy boom. let u assume germany france,which together account well half gdp euro area, pass aperiod recession. if situation central bank governor small country usedtheir majority vote raise interest rate euro area order dampen overheatedeconomies, would opt measure inconsistent monetary policy need ofthe euro area whole. this example, course, mere conjecture, case quiteunlikely develop, particularly may expect business cycle euro area countriesto continue converge past years. the example nevertheless serf toillustrate principle monetary policy decision escb must always benefitof euro area whole must cater national interests.this also show clearly important national central bank tohave macro-economic analysis available meet ecb governingcouncil. the staff ecb executive board frankfurt certainly draw full set ofdata analyses, available member govern council. ncbgovernors will, however, well advise analysis development euroarea global economy, prepare in-house staff economist statisticalexperts, possibly deal great detail issue particular interest governor’s ownperspective. the example federal reserve system unite state show thatwell-prepared information indispensable decision aid participant meet atwhich monetary policy decision taken. the sound compel thearguments central bank governor present ecb govern council, great orher chance convince members. - 6 -bis review 44/1998the experience federal reserve system also demonstrate national –regional, u – central bank find market niche research analysis. forthe oenb, example, i would see comparative advantage study transitioncountries.2. public relation agent interface single monetary policy national economicpoliciesa second important role national central bank result first one toact public relation agent interface single monetary policy one handand public economic policy-makers hand. the escb’s – indeed anycentral bank’s – successful implementation single monetary policy dependsubstantially ability communicate effectively general public economicpolicy-makers.like central bank today, escb keep citizen inform aboutits strategy motif behind action takes. this way ensure theeuropean public understand, endorse support monetary policy. for number ofreasons, national central bank central role play context. they theones best acquaint countries’ weak spot special concerns. they speak thelanguage people country represent – literally metaphorically. theyhave enjoy population’s confidence many years. they close network formaland informal communication channels. and resource require public relationswork reach general public, task may prove time-consuming make hugedemands ncb’s manpower resources. the national central bank therefore ideallyplaced conduct escb’s public relation activity participate countries. carewill taken, however, ensure decentralize public relation effort stillfollow clear common line.a second central aspect ncbs’ intermediary function role acommunication channel national economic policy-makers. it nature emu onesingle monetary exchange rate policy apply entire euro area. different nationalmonetary policy stance balance difference economic development structure nolonger possible. the balance must therefore achieve mean economic policyinstruments, i.e. national fiscal, income structural policies.these area economic policy course beyond central banks’ immediatescope competence. it is, however, part central banks’ responsibility alert economicpolicy-makers national level well public adjustment may benecessary. this way make sure euro area member state able reapfull benefit emu minimize potential disadvantages. here, centralimportance budgetary policy closely coordinate national level, government - 7 -bis review 44/1998budgets put sound foot accordance provision growth stabilitypact flexibility aim economic structures.ideally, emu incentive eu government tackle pendingeconomic reform swiftly determination. thus, emu could act catalystin european economic development. the significant reform effort undertake past monthsand year eu member state run-up emu make confident thispositive scenario attainable. in fact, extent emu already highly beneficialimpacts economic policy recent years, although even start yet. we must beaware, however, reform initiate must continue thatparticipation emu require increase readiness permanent change reform.as possible last year convince austrian population ofthe benefit euro, i trust equally possible motivate citizen europeto take structural reform accompany euro full reward bereaped. here ncbs play important role mediators, coordinator publicrelations agent issue dictate single monetary policy within entire euro area theeconomic policy member states. draw economic expertise, nationalcentral bank able provide valuable assistance economic policy-makers thenational level formulate argument reform needed. be independent institutions,however, also stand ready act voice reason alert economicpolicy-makers due time necessary.3. the national central bank operative entity escblet move third key function national central banks. thencbs operative entity escb. preparatory work emi show thatdecentralization large portion central banks’ operative activity both“possible” “appropriate”. use advance information technology, money market tenderoperations, example, conduct decentralize basis reasonable expense.at time, benefit decentralize approach quite obvious. itwill permit use ncbs’ infrastructure benefit experience conductingmonetary policy operations. watch national financial market evolve, thenational central bank accumulate wealth experience decades. at earlystage monetary union, market still differ substantially. in order guaranteenevertheless equal fair access central bank liquidity large number escb’scounterparties, national central bank assume indispensable function intermediariesbetween ecb’s monetary policy decision counterparties escb. the nationalcentral bank also best place monitor, continuous basis, rapid substantialchanges conduct market player trigger monetary union itself. this ensure thatthe escb’s monetary policy instrument retain effectiveness efficiency even - 8 -bis review 44/1998rapidly change environment.the national central bank therefore conduct open market transaction andother monetary policy operation bank accordance instruction issue theecb. upon decision ecb, intervene foreign exchange markets. they willprint issue banknotes. the commercial bank maintain minimum reserve thenational central bank reserve go instrument monetary policy – iwould indeed advocate. the national central bank supervise payment transactions, act assystem operator large-volume payments. they collect statistical data, willcontinue cooperate monetary policy-making international level, imf andthe bis.let mention two example illustrate national centralbanks’ important function operative business: first, let u consider role monetarypolicy operation within escb. a rule, decision regard instrument use toallocate withdraw liquidity initiative escb take centrally ecb.however, implementation administration - carry line ecb’sinstructions - largely responsibility national central banks. open marketoperations part remain exclusive task national central banks. theseinclude regular weekly tender operation term two weeks, regular monthly longer-termrefinancing operation term three months, structural open-market operation and,possibly, issuance central bank debt certificates. only fine-tune operations, outrighttransactions, foreign exchange swap acceptance time deposit may exceptionalcases execute directly ecb upon decision ecb’s govern council. asregards stand facilities, i.e., marginal lend facility deposit facility, bank bedealing ncbs. minimum reserve also hold exclusively nationalcentral banks.the second example relate administration foreign reserves. the ecbwill provide foreign reserve asset possible intervention exchange marketsand support confidence euro. initially, foreign reserve asset amount totalequivalent eur 50 billion (about at 700 billion). in start phase, oenb willtherefore transfer at 16 billion foreign reserve ecb. the nationalcentral bank continue manage transfer foreign reserve behalf ecb afiduciary basis, compliance ecb’s investment rules. the predominant part ofaustria’s foreign currency reserve retain invest oenb. transaction bynational central bank involve foreign currency reserve govern guideline inorder prevent possible undesirable impact monetary foreign exchange policiesof euro area. very large foreign currency reserve transaction even require approvalof ecb. - 9 -bis review 44/1998as two example clearly illustrate, operative framework escb asprepared emi heavily rely national central banks’ exist resource merelyconfers decision-making power ecb.4. holder capital ecbwhat kind role national central bank play “holders thecapital” ecb? the ecb subscribe capital eur 5 billion (aboutats 70 billion). the national central bank sole subscriber holder thecapital ecb. only ncbs participate euro area member state pay theirshare capital. the capital subscription national central bank base weightingof 50% share respective member state population community and50% share respective member state gdp community. the oenb’sshare amount 2.3% eur 115 million (approx. at 1.6 billion). base oneleven country participate monetary union start, oenb’s share thesubscribed capital 2.9%.capital subscription entitle oenb proportionate share ecb’sprofit. the key determine share capital pay also instrumental indetermining distribution monetary income earn national central bank theissuance central bank money. under escb’s statute, monetary income allparticipating national central bank pay common pool redistribute inaccordance key capital subscription. this procedure choose isimpossible predict regional distribution central bank money creation within themonetary union. incidentally, problem, entire euro area singlecurrency area identical money market rate uniformly applicable term govern theallocation central bank money. however, ensure equitable distribution income fromthe creation money within escb, profit distribution mechanism installed. atleast early phase monetary union, however, still substantial difference inthe central banks’ balance sheet owe national difference use cash, payment andsavings habits. consequently, transitional arrangement make initial periodbefore monetary income distribution mechanism introduced. once structure ofnational financial market circulation banknote coin begin converge, willbecome easy define appropriate approach gradual introduction monetaryincome distribution mechanism.5. other activity remain within ncbs’ responsibilitylet come last area central bank activities. beside functionas “integral part escb” national central bank frequently perform number ofspecific duty grow course history. such public duty - 10 -bis review 44/1998include task relate supervision bank financial markets, carry either directlyin function supervisory authority expert pool support authority chargedwith bank supervision. some central bank prepare analysis financial statement ofcompanies establish country connection use instrument monetarypolicy service business community. sometimes, central bank involve thegovernment program promotion export research. beyond that, central banksfrequently provide financial service public entities. some central bank manage account forprivate-sector customers, much like commercial banks. other central bank hold interest inproduction service industries, may commercial strategic reasons.the statute escb envisage forceful dismantle unificationof structure national central bank develop course time. they aretherefore free choose legal form organization. however, must clearlypointed national central bank perform additional task within ownresponsibility account task deem part escbactivities. furthermore, ecb govern council may decide two-thirds majority thatcertain activity fail comply contractual statutory task duty escband may decree discontinuation. previous work emi issue, particularlystudies legal convergence, indicate restriction impose activitythreatens impair single monetary policy.restructuring oenb run-up monetary union…the fundamental reorganization central bank europe associate withmonetary union also require restructure oenb, involve several levels:the first level relate transformation central bank itsown right integral part escb. the goal strategy monetary policy, itsintermediate target well monetary policy instrument must harmonize

oenb’s area operation. the oenb inessence continue activity previous area responsibility also austria’sentry stage three monetary union. in many fields, however, focus change moreor le markedly. the

people destination fast, butthe pile-up wreck lot expensive wind two lane road. if recent trendscontinue, manage next crisis call resource taxpayer unite statesand develop country likely feel comfortable turn imf otherinternational organizations, even reasonably confident borrow country willpay loan back, experience indicate will.second, far important, perception official resource countedon bail creditor (directly indirectly) arguably generate moral hazard. it could lead toexcessive risk-taking lender fund le economically defensible projects. it may alsochannel finance le stable form whose overuse make crisis likely occur. in recentepisodes, direct investor holder equity long-term debt take serious losses, butshort-term lenders, especially interbank lenders, largely protected. while country introuble understandable reason want cut short-term bank credit andfor use scarce international resource keep lifeline attached, result may toreinforce excessive dependence debt rather equity short, rather longer-termfinancing.both reason combine create urgent need serious creative think thepart international community “bail in” private sector financiers, order toreduce impact financial resource official institution like imf, world bank andthe regional development banks, reduce moral hazard lead excessive risk-taking, especiallyshort-term inter-bank borrowing, improve risk assessment.designing mechanism appropriate burden share among private sectorinvestor/creditors inherently hard run sticky fundamentaldilemmas. the basic principle borrow lend must proceed peoplewho use people’s money firm obligation pay back. hence, suspension ofpayments work-out arrangement must clearly rare exceptional, resort inextreme situations. raise fear suspension likely work-outs normal could unnecessarilyincrease cost capital, cause drastic reduction cross-border flow diminish futureincomes debtor creditor alike. yet know understand process deal withdefault can, see

markets, example brazil, affect much severelythan south africa. the question often ask south africa leave almost unimpaired theeast asian crisis? there number reason this:firstly, must remember south africa mini-crisis 1996when sudden capital outflow country force depreciation rand ofmore 20 per cent, introduction restrictive fiscal monetary policiesthat reduce growth rate total domestic

deserve theoutcome. then i ass crosscurrent shape prospect go forward thesustainability recent economic performance give perspective challenge facingmonetary policy.let emphasize view economic outlook monetarypolicy i present interpret position board ofgovernors fomc.where we be how we get therethree force drive recent economic performance. first, strongmomentum private domestic demand - sum consumption, private fix investment andresidential construction - partially offset decline net exports. the result beenconsistent above-trend growth rise resource utilization rates, particularly labormarket.second, strength aggregate demand good service beenencouraged favorable financial conditions. whereas, normally, financial condition becomeless favorable expansion ultimately constrain demand, expansion financialconditions become increasingly favorable therefore continue supportabove-trend growth. an important element favorable finance condition has, course,been soar stock market.third, coincidence favorable shock enable business produce alower cost; short run, least, restrain inflation. the result slow increasein cpi measure overall price level, even economy race ahead tohigher utilization rates. the favorable shock include decline oil prices, decline inimport price associate cumulative appreciation dollar, technological innovationsthat speed reduction computer prices, change medical care management haveheld increase benefit costs, improve crop damp food prices.the result economic performance consistently exceed expectations. i havesaid many time i dime every time i say faster-than-expected growthand lower-than-expected inflation, i would rich man today! growth 1998 nearly4%, high annual growth decade. the unemployment rate decline about¾ percentage point last year quarter-century low. and inflation decline than30-year low.there much like outcome policy support it. monetarypolicy help deliver low inflation environment strong economy

fiscal policy, government long compete - 2 -bis review 33/1998˝with private sector private saving, contribute low real interest rate high ratesof capital formation. in combination, monetary fiscal policy set stable foundationfor private sector decision making.as good policy been, clearly deserve credit theexceptional recent performance. i rule i religiously follow: if didn’t predict it, don’ttake credit it. we predict exceptional performance take morecredit deserve. still, little question policy make animportant contribution exceptional performance.the net result force economy has, view, movedbeyond point sustainable capacity. that is, output it’s long-run sustainable level.normally, would result rise inflation, favorable supply shock onlyprevented rise inflation, allow inflation decline. monetary policy hasaccommodated above-trend growth rise utilization rate precisely havebeen accompany decline inflation.contradictionsi always appreciated, private sector forecaster, that, interpretation theeconomy, always tension contradictions. this reflect reality theinterpretation data never perfectly clear, always subject uncertainty. and itis today. let highlight three uncertainties.first, question whether or, least, degree theeconomy operate beyond point sustainable capacity. the unemployment rate belowthe consensus estimate threshold consistent stable inflation, although issomewhat great normal uncertainty estimate. this threshold call nairu,the nonaccelerating inflation rate unemployment. the president’s council economicadvisers estimate threshold, example, 5.4%, congressional budget office 5.8%,and i use 5.5% best guess. there is, rate, question labor marketsbeing tight. on hand, measure resource utilization product market,notably capacity utilization rate manufacture sector, suggest excess demand.there is, fact, unusual discrepancy unemployment capacity utilizationrates, compare previous expansions; is, capacity utilization rate low wouldhave expected, base past experience, prevail unemployment rate. thisundoubtedly account perception limit price leverage contribute therestrained inflation, despite low unemployment rate. nevertheless, tight labormarkets expect put upward pressure wage change hence inflation, thespecial force restrain inflation dissipate reverse.second, question ass degree restraint orstimulus associate current monetary policy. although nominal federal fund rate hasremained nearly constant, decline inflation raise real federal fund rate. manyhave observe rise real federal fund rate level well historical averageand conclude monetary policy currently restrictive. the implication monetarypolicy already well position slow expansion.on hand, many measure financial condition appear beindicating, contrary, financial condition favorable, highly supportive ofcontained momentum aggregate demand perhaps become even so. this - 3 -bis review 33/1998˝interpretation appear confirm continue strength aggregate demand generaland interest-sensitive sector particular. real long-term interest rates, base surveymeasures inflation, stable declining, equity price soaring, creditavailability ample, underwrite standard may ease some, loanpricing aggressive, spread safe risky asset narrowed, moneysupply grow rapidly. i conclude that, notwithstanding recent rise real federalfunds rate, neither financial condition general monetary policy particular currentlyrestraining aggregate demand.third, significant rebound productivity growth 1996 and1997, compare previous two years. that clear data. the question thedata immediately reveal whether rebound normal cyclical rebound mark asignificant increase trend productivity growth. my view continue theincrease predominantly cyclical rebound. this lead next topic.storiesin last outlook talk i develop two “stories” provide alternativeexplanations recent exceptional economic performance. each story carry animplication sustainability recent performance challenge monetary policy.i call one story “temporary bliss.” this story emphasize role good fortune inthe current exceptional performance highlight potential may able tomaintain recent rate growth current high labor utilization rate much longerwithout ultimately suffer increase inflation. the key story series offavorable supply shock have, judgment, masked, time, normal consequencesof tight labor market permit economy operate beyond point long-runsustainable capacity without usual inflationary consequences. the challenge facingmonetary policy, interpretation, facilitate transition sustainable statebefore favorable supply shock dissipate reverse.the second story i call “permanent bliss.” this story emphasize possibility thatstructural change permanently alter economy capable deliver termsof average growth unemployment rate consistent stable inflation. in thisinterpretation, monetary policy must careful interfere economy takingadvantage improve potential.the truth, i note previously, likely combination two stories.i keep separate highlight difference policy implication temporarysupply shock permanent structural change. i say previously i low myestimate nairu, example, 6% 5 1/2%, response read evidenceof last several years. i also raise estimate trend productivity -- 1.1%, theaverage rate 20 year prior current expansion 1.3% 1.4%.a tenth increase trend productivity growth reflect technical revisionsto cpi low chain measure gdp deflator tenth. this anincrease trend productivity expansion, relative previous expansions, rather anupward revision productivity growth entire postwar period, mirror image adecline upward bias measure inflation. it noted, nevertheless, thetechnical revision

productivity, improvement generallyassociated capital deepening, increase amount equipment worker itsdisposal, result strength investment expansion. a such, improvementin productivity growth may transitory, part one-time increase level ofproductivity associate transition high capital-to-labor ratio. nevertheless, even acouple tenth improvement productivity growth, sustain period, would givean important boost high live standard time.but upward adjustment estimate productivity trend play anegligible role explain manage exceptional economic performanceover last couple years. it go right direction, simply small carrymuch burden. the major player view, addition decline nairu, thecoincidence favorable supply shocks. the relative weight important becausethey affect challenge monetary

continue time. try morethreatens give back reduction inflation move u.s. positionvery close federal reserve’s objective price stability.the bottom line essential growth slow near 4% 1997 toand perhaps trend allow economy move toward sustainablestate.prospectsthere two set crosscurrent likely shape outlook immediatelyahead. first, tug war continue exceptional momentum privatedomestic demand external drag asian crisis. the latter shock also reinforcesthe restraint project cumulative appreciation dollar predatedthe asian crisis. the result almost certainly slow expansion, relative to1997. still, sharper-than-expected decline oil prices, decline long-term bond yieldsand rise equity price recent month provide offset externaldrag come asia appreciation dollar. the question muchof slow results, whether slowdown take growth trend, leaf growthstill trend. there still considerable uncertainty crosscurrent willbalance out.second, tug war tight labor market set forcesthat restrain inflation. the

76/1998mr. ferguson discus state u economy: near-term challengesand long-term change remark mr. roger w. ferguson, jr., member board ofgovernors u federal reserve system, federal reserve bank kansa city on17/9/98.it pleasure today discus state economy, leastbecause -- despite turbulence late financial market -- still good news toreport. we eighth year economic expansion. production, employment, andincomes rise briskly, unemployment rate decline low levelsince 1970. and time, inflation remain remarkably subdued.but prudent central banker cannot afford focus exclusively goodperformance past. he must constantly look well future. in spirit, today i shallnot discus current economic situation, i shall also comment several area ibelieve deserve particular attention period ahead. some area involve potentialrisks fine economic performance, involve potentially important structuralchanges economy.before i begin, let remind view personal notnecessarily reflect view member federal open market committee theboard governors.recent economic performanceas know, unite state experience period exceptionallystrong economic growth. real gdp rise nearly 4 percent 1996 last year, thefastest rate increase, two year row, fifteen years. and activity maintain rapid paceof expansion first half year well, although growth apparently step downsome spring. this recent performance especially impressive occur theface substantial reduction export demand associate crisis asia.this powerful economic growth benefit american business throughsoaring profits. it also benefit government -- federal, state, local -- taxrevenues come early expectations. and benefit american workers,through high income low unemployment rate almost anyone predicted. our tightlabor market tremendous dividend give job experience people whootherwise would margin economy -- experience serve peoplewell many year come. tight labor market welcome, even central bankers, wherethey sustain without produce cost price pressure undermine prosperity.the drive force behind sustain growth domestic demand, asreflected enormous increase consumption investment spending. consumptionspending fuel rapid growth employment incomes. with 6 millionpeople add payroll past two years, compensation gain well excess ofinflation, consumer mean boost spend appreciably. and thandoubling value stock market since late 1994 -- small fraction hasbeen reverse recent weeks, i might add -- make people comfortable spendingout current income -- probably accumulate assets, too. it surprise thatsurveys measure consumer confidence record historic highs, personal - 2 -bis review 76/1998saving rate decline considerably. the factors, along low mortgage rate insome time, power home sale record levels.favorable financial conditions, along exceptionally large price decline forcomputer equipment, make relatively cheap firm invest new plant andequipment. and sale solid uptrend, produce remarkable boom capitalspending. business fix investment nearly 10 percent last year, rise still fasterpace first half year. even strikingly, investment average 10 percentannual growth past five years, make rapid sustain expansion ofinvestment thirty years. a i shall discus shortly, investment may provide reason forsome optimistic productivity growth period ahead. but, without doubt, hasplayed important role help boost aggregate demand recent quarters.one important question look forward whether recent rapid growth indemand sustained. i forecaster, important know consensusamong forecaster been, expect growth slow recent pace.one reason forecaster expect growth slow production inventory beenrising extremely rapid pace unlikely maintained. and indeed, inventoryinvestment drop good bite second quarter, contribute importantly thatquarter’s modest gdp growth. still, analyst believe rate stockbuilding --at least outside motor vehicle sector -- probably remain unsustainable expectedto slow further.a second reason forecaster expect slowdown impetus toconsumer spend annual gain 25 30 percent share value seem unlikely besustained. this may seem obvious last month’s drop stock prices, look back toearlier year even optimistic forecaster expect stock market increaseswell short rate see 1996 1997. the impetus spend modestincreases household wealth would considerably small generate last year’soutstanding run-up share prices. and course, last month’s decline may provide furtherreason expect consumption growth slow.international risksa third important reason forecaster expect slow growth ahead thecontinuing trouble overseas. the problem face asian trade partners, include thepersistent weakness japanese economy, accompany strength dollar,already lead sharp reduction demand exports. indeed, first half ofthis year, quantity export decline two quarter row first time since themid-1980s, shipment korea japan sharply. decline export machinery,industrial supplies, agricultural equipment especially noteworthy. when include theeffect rise import well, net export subtract 2 percentage point gdpgrowth period, trade deficit good service widen about$175 billion annual rate second quarter.i emphasize effect economy asian crisishave adverse. low price year energy internationally trade commodities,including many agricultural commodity soybean wheat, benefit much ofour nation -- although certainly oil industry farmers. those low price reflect, inpart, decline demand asia. to put another way, nation export oil - 3 -bis review 76/1998other commodity bear brunt sag asian economies. furthermore,the favorable financial condition country may aid “flight safety” thathelped hold long-term interest rate stimulate interest-sensitive sector likehousing. thus, seemingly fortuitous time extremely robust domestic demand hasoffset reduction export demand entirely coincidental.as financial crisis, extremely difficult predict future willbring trouble asian countries. i remain guardedly optimistic condition begin tostabilize come months, export demand start firm least little nextyear. but mean certainty.one particular risk problem thus far severe asiamay become severe region world. we already see russia, andfinancial difficulty country distinct south africa brazil emphasize theworries uncertainty score. for variety reasons, could more“contagion” countries. first, investors’ appetite international risk go downfollowing asian crises. this lead trouble country run current accountdeficits dependent foreign capital. while russia’s problem homegrown, example, cautious investor probably contribute precipitate country’scrisis. indeed, last month become apparent even u financial market notimmune perception risk increased. second, emerging-market country withfixed exchange rate respond market pressure relax exchange-rate arrangements,those remain country attempt peg exchange rate may come increasingspeculative pressures. third, country close economic tie hardest-hit asiannations certainly feel repercussion reduction demand exports, agreater economic slowdown asia could trigger financial problem countries, too. andfinally, i note earlier, country heavy exporter oil primary commoditieshave hard-hit low prices.in short, international problem asia elsewhere prove moreprofound sustain many, included, guess hop would thecase. obviously, effect drag ongoing economic expansion area thatdeserves close scrutiny month ahead.inflation developmentsbut i noted, flip side reduce export demand strong dollar thatthe international situation help hold inflation home. this help explainthe remarkable fact strong economic growth low unemployment rate havecoincided exceptionally favorable news inflation front. i cannot overemphasize theimportance story: rise inflation sow seed almost every cyclical downturn ofthe last half century.the consumer price index increase le 2 percent past year. the lasttime consumer inflation low 1986 when, present instance, consumersbenefited decline price energy products. but even exclude volatile food andenergy item focus so-called “core” cpi, inflation run much 2percent, low rate three decades. and broad measure prices, gdpprice index, increase one percent past year, hold rapid decline theprices business pay computer communication equipment. - 4 -bis review 76/1998this inflation performance good analyst expected. butwe exaggerate extent surprise. true, economist believe thecurrent unemployment rate 4½ percent level consistent stable inflation, andindeed may already exert upward pressure labor costs. but almost sensibleeconomists long realize unemployment influence inflation. a ihave emphasized, strong dollar lead fall price imports, low oil priceshave lead low price gasoline energy products. low oil price also helpedhold price petroleum-derived product like fertilizer plastics, havereduced price pressure generally reduce firms’ utility transportation costs.furthermore, structural change health care system reduce growth firms’health care costs. these factor contribute benign inflation performance. we willneed vigilant because, factor work benefit low inflationrecently, may turn around exert upward pressure inflation future.changes labor marketone complexity inflation outlook involve change appear beoccurring labor market practices. the extraordinary rise labor demand theaccompanying tight labor market lead labor shortage part country.shortages report variety jobs, supply computer professionalsespecially tight.to extent, firm respond labor shortage raisingwages. and indeed, compensation increase grow size past two threeyears. but firm also respond tight labor market way simply grantinglarger base wage increases. firm make increase use various form targetedpay, hire retention bonuses, way attract retain certain key employeeswithout grant general wage increase. these target bonus seem prevalent forinformation process workers, i sense reasonably widespread beyond areaas well. and bonus often quite sizable. it uncommon hear hire bonusesof five ten percent base salary, higher.firms change compensation practice ways, too. businessesincreasingly rely le base wage salary increases, substitute form ofvariable pay tie directly performance, annual bonus profit share plans,or even stock option extend well beyond senior management.these change labor market practice implication function theeconomy interest and, potentially, quite important. for one thing, many targetedbonuses may adequately capture aggregate wage statistics, bonus arebecoming prevalent, labor cost may rise somewhat fast publish datawould indicate. second, practice may lead change cyclicality firms’compensation costs. on one hand, firm able use target bonus certainworkers place generalize wage increases, could hold compensation cost tightlabor markets, thereby make cost le cyclical. on hand, increase use ofvariable pay tend make compensation cyclical otherwise would been.under profit share system, example, firm make large compensation payment theiremployees time good business slack. - 5 -bis review 76/1998if latter effect dominate, compensation become morecyclical, would raise interest question change might affect firms’ pricingbehavior. to extent, course, firm probably smooth cyclical up downsin cost make price decision case. but smooth probably notperfect, increase fix pay probably would exert upward pressure prices.increased use profit-sharing bonuses, however, would presumably lead firm boost theiremployees’ compensation precisely afford so. and, conversely, whenprofits squeezed, result decline bonus payment would help ease firm’scost pressures. thus, may reason believe increase variable compensationpayments might lead price pressure would increase fix compensationpayments. in words, increase cyclicality compensation gain might imply anychange cyclicality price increases.finally, spread variable pay could lead change employment patterns.pay variable tie profitability. a profitability declines, willcompensation, possible employment may drop much would world inwhich compensation le closely tie profits. in event, fascinate watchthese labor market development unfold, try sort implication themacroeconomy.of course, company move toward variable compensation scheme toalter macro-dynamics economy. firm move variable compensation schemesbecause hope

way product make business conducted. it ishard know successful effort ultimately prove be. many business people areconvinced variable compensation plan pay term high productivity. manyothers le confident, say hope change boost productivity, itis hard pinpoint source productivity improvements.this discussion point one final aspect economic outlook deservesmention, namely, productivity growth. in long run, nothing important economicwelfare productivity growth, determine pace increase livingstandards. and recent productivity data impressive: output per hour work rose1¾ percent 1997 advance 2 percent year before. the big question iswhether rapid productivity growth temporary permanent -- is, whetherproductivity merely display normal short-run response step-up growth ofactivity, whether fast pace sustain time even output growthmoderates.the correct answer, course, don’t know yet. i cite fewreasons cautiously optimistic productivity may favorable uptrendthan 1980s. one reason change incentive within firm owe variablepay i discussed, least firm strongly believe aid productivityperformance. a second reason optimism investment boom i discuss earlier.economic history teach u fairly convincingly growth amount capital per workeris important determinant gain output per worker. - 6 -bis review 76/1998furthermore, analyst argue computerization economyis begin bear fruit, may expect impressive productivity advance aspeople learn use new technology effectively. the economist paul david note tookseveral decade follow initial development electric motor company toreorganize production technique use new invention efficiently. by analogy, david’sargument hint large benefit computerization may yet come.this analogy intriguing, counterargument certainly make well.one reason take electric power long yield benefit take many year newtechnology gain widespread use, part huge expenditure require toreconfigure manufacture plant use electric power. by contrast, transition olderoffice equipment mainframe computers, desktop machines, often entail muchsmaller adjustment cost comparatively rapid. furthermore, easy forgetthat, computer account large share investment, account small shareof overall capital stock, part reflect rapid rate depreciation. thus, unlesscomputers earn considerably high return investment firm might make, thesmall share impose limit contribution computer could make overallproductivity growth.so, hopeful recent productivity increase may represent afaster long-term trend, count chicken soon. but certainly addproductivity list item i follow closely period ahead.conclusionwith strong output growth, low unemployment, low inflation, rapidproductivity growth, certainly good time central banker. but doesnot mean interest times, glance financial page drive home.although economy basically strong, also face near-term longer-termchallenges, i hope i give sense issue mind itry gauge nation’s economic performance period ahead. bi

2 -bis review 66/19982. recent yearsthe swedish economy, know, go profound crisis early1990s. this occasion discuss cause crisis depth. it suffice note thatthe origin lay structural weakness sweden’s economy. but crisis also withshortcomings stabilisation policy late 1980s early 1990s.since production stop fall growth restart course 1993, economicdevelopments sweden exceed expectation several respects. the average annual growth rateof 2.5 per cent high average boom period 1980s.in way, perhaps hardly surprising. the weak exchange rate give export strongimpetus plenty unutilised capacity. but i think many people expect suchhigh growth could combine low inflation. in year sweden reject policy fromthe decade high inflation reinstate time-honoured tradition annual price increase around2 per cent. inflation also low international comparison. judge expectation ofeconomic agents, low-inflation regime established.the composition growth also favourable. after decade growth wasgenerated high degree rise consumption—with accumulation external debt—it healthysign expansion associate strong export demand industrial investment. one result ofthis, large current-account surplus since 1994, make possible repay external debt.a dramatic turnaround also achieve government finances. massive budgetdeficits succeed surplus. this trend primarily consequence economicrecovery, decline activity main cause early fiscal collapse. but without theextensive measure budget consolidation, neither economic upturn improvement ingovernment finance would feasible.tax increase spend cut scale experience recent yearsobviously leave mark. household income sharply restricted, particularly 1995–96. sohave public activities.in one respect, moreover, outlook still troublesome, namely regardsemployment. despite economic recovery, rapid expansion employment prove difficult toachieve. it worth noting, however, number private sector jobs, service particular, hasin fact rise continuously since 1995. but make sufficiently contraction ofemployment 1990s in, example, public sector construction.after review development recent years, i shall discus riksbank’sappraisal come twenty-four months, period need

trend recent years, high growth low inflation, would continue yearsahead.the economic upswing assume continue forecast period, annualgrowth rate around 2.5 per cent year 3 per cent next two years. the forecast involve anincreasing contribution rise domestic demand, accompany successive fall-off exportgrowth. private consumption expect pick up, partly view rise household income. - 3 -bis review

although capacity utilisation high certain sectors, theriksbank envisage economy whole would capacity surplus.external inflationary pressure expect low view subdue internationalinflation, low raw material price somewhat strong exchange rate.expectations future inflation among households, financial agent manufacturingindicated belief future inflation would low. thus, confidence economic

traditional indicator credibility, computedfrom price trend financial markets, convey picture. both long bond differential withgermany expect future short interest rate point persistently strong confidence thelow-inflation policy. - 5 -bis review 66/1998in context i like briefly rehearse role exchange rate monetarypolicy. the riksbank target exchange rate; monetary policy focus instead target forinflation. the exchange rate see one number indicators—albeit one mostimportant—that use predict inflationary pressure swedish economy. if krona weaken orstrengthens permanently, this—all else equal—will affect inflation.the difficulty accordingly lie assess permanence exchange rate movementsand incorporate assessment overall picture inflation. the economic fundamental favouran appreciation

contributedto overheating.following deregulation domestic financial market, crisis sweden wasalso precede rapid expansion credit; course five years, private borrow grewfrom 85 135 % gdp. the credit

economic upswing, many misdirect overly optimisticinvestments various industrial projects. - 2 -bis review 65/1998in aspect i find similarity sweden late 1980s asiancountries 1990s. a feature common sweden korea was, moreover, thedomestic financial market liberalise long external capital outflows. this mean thatoverheating domestic economy could adequately balance capital outflow forinvestment abroad.but also differences. other factor contribute sweden’s acutecrisis relatively deep international downturn high interest rate part worldin wake german reunion. on top this, fiscal position vulnerable, enter the1990s public debt-to-gdp ratio around 40 per cent. sweden’s external borrow ratio wasalso high - 30 per cent gdp. besides reflect public budget deficit, withan extremely low private save ratio. in year ratio actually negative. theseweaknesses make sweden highly vulnerable shift confidence economy.the financial sectorthere also underlie weakness financial systems. let turn tothese.the financial system adapt change shelter environment toa deregulate much competitive situation. in early environment, bank littleincentive develop sophisticate credit culture, involve

(although also structural weakness financialsector). the solution also primarily macroeconomic kind. once krona peg beenabandoned, demand get stimulus. the task confront policy maker restore credibilityof economic policy. this require case, give weak fiscal position, strong fiscalmeasures (some 8 per cent gdp 1994-98). but also call consistent monetary policy.however, important underline present context, financial problem notbeen manage properly, could easily drag macro economy. for example, bytaking prompt action seem largely avoid “credit crunch”, possibility thatworried people lot time. credit volume obviously fell, could explain thereduction demand.briefly, important component solution financial sector follows:1. the government, late confirm parliament, issue unlimited guarantee state thatno depositor counterparties swedish credit institution would suffer losses.this fundamental measure order restore confidence swedish bank bothfrom domestic foreign depositor counterparties. the result showedthemselves rather quickly, e.g., form renew interbank credit line foreignbanks. also swedish public remain calm run banks.however, government (parliament) guarantee measure must also madeknown interest parties.2. the mandate implement support policy give new agency, bank supportauthority, arm’s length political sphere accountable thegovernment. to avoid conflict interest, find appropriate supportauthority either ministry finance, central bank financial supervisoryauthority. -

6 -bis review 65/1998first, i think important, i say before, recognise importance ofmacroeconomic developments. once fix exchange rate abandoned, sweden’seconomy experience export-driven upturn. but take long time confidence theswedish economy general return - least another two years. it noteworthy sodespite fact recovery growth start summer 1993. the explanation liesprimarily fiscal situation, financial sector relate problem make asubstantial contribution - enlarge budget deficit perhaps much 6% gdp time.on top this, krona depress long time repayment foreign loans.the financial problem major impact economic development from1993 onwards. once important decision concern financial sector taken, wasnot long financial aspect crisis disappear headlines. and bankswere already recover late 1993 - year peak crisis. this wasobviously great achievement may worth briefly state importantlessons that, opinion, draw episode financial crisis management:1. confidence need restore rapidly. this achieve sweden far financialsector concerned. if confidence return fairly soon, real effect economy neednot large. but if, hand, lack domestic and/or external confidence wereto persist, could act drag economic development long period. it also myexperience country long period lack confidence, themore drastic measure need restore credibility. among things,restoring confidence involve transparent problem measuresfor deal them. it also mean measure implement state theresponsible authorities, without deviation time application. just suspicionthat specific industry interest group may receive unjustifiably favourabletreatment would quickly erode confidence.2. transparency important. a severe crisis wipe confidence - rightly so. we realise thatit sweden regain it. to so, card table. the extent ofthe loss magnitude bad loan reveal entirety andvaluation prudent. if hide loss initially overly optimistic valuations,you risk apply international investment community taxpayer foradditional support. this, view, might jeopardise confidence legitimacy. it alsonecessary highly transparent fair “rules game” government support tothe financial sector, least avoid political bickering. the responsibility transparencyfalls primarily two parties: authority banks. the authority must betransparent broad framework solution crisis bank must betransparent loss deficiencies, financial position need externalsupport.3. someone must take losses. it important realise crisis occurred, thelosses cannot hide must deal one way another. in respectswedish institution work well. party politics clearly separate businessrealities. and politician good job, realise bygone bygones, set afair framework sort crisis out. from political perspective important thebanks’ owner rescued. people large take substantial cut livingstandards -

emphasize thepriority need attach update refine capital standards. third, i willdiscuss importance financial modernization legislation.before tackle policy questions, let begin review howbanks regulated.why do we regulate banks?why supervise regulate banks? the reason straightforward.initially, bank dominant financial institutions, major purpose reduce“systemic risk” impact economy bank failure. then safety net - 2 -bis review 76/1998created reduce systemic risk, resultant moral hazard create even important reasonto supervise regulate banks.historically, objective protect

indeed, stability electronic, large dollar payment system, movestrillions dollar day bank play pivotal role, critical limit systemicrisk. other potential pressure points, bank play key role, include liquidity ofsecurities, financial derivatives, interbank fund markets.our success virtually eliminate risk bank run unite stateshas lead second major reason supervise regulate banks. deposit insurance, thediscount window, federal reserve payment system guarantee -- thing haveeliminated bank run -- create call “safety net” banks. the existence safetynet give government direct stake keep bank risk control, privateinsurance company stake control risk policyholders. because depositinsurance part safety net never fully accurately priced, necessaryfor u monitor sometimes act control bank risk order protect potential callon taxpayer funds. an equally important, unintended, consequence safety net itcreates economist term “moral hazard” incentive bank take excessive risks.that is, safety net create incentive bank take large risk otherwise, thesafety net, potentially taxpayers, may absorb loss gamble fails. suchincentives especially strong bank near failure since, point, bank stockholdershave virtually nothing lose.how do we regulate banks?bank regulation supervision think portfolio regulatoryrules supervisory practice collectively aim monitor protect safety andsoundness bank system, control systemic risk, offset moral hazard incentives,and limit potential call taxpayer. this portfolio includes, particular order, (1) theset rule practice relate federal safety net itself; (2) requirement fordisclosure incentive promote market discipline bank organizations; (3) therules govern capital bank organization must hold; (4) limitation onactivities bank organization may

framework diversify financial serviceorganizations would emerge legislation. - 3 -bis review 76/1998market discipline: the role subordinate debtto significant extent, market discipline regulatory standard substitutes.the effective former, le reliance make latter. because theregulatory approach involve significant cost private public sectors, increasedreliance market reduce cost achieve give degree safety soundness inthe bank system thereby increase efficiency overall regulatory framework.but significant trade-off worry about. a great reliance marketmay also increase systemic risk. for example, eliminate deposit insurance would certainlyincrease incentive depositor monitor risk profile banks. the price suchincreased market discipline, however, would, view, unacceptably high -- significantlyincreased risk bank run hence systemic risk. the key therefore find opportunity toincrease market discipline way result acceptable trade-off respect systemicrisk thereby achieve optimal balance market discipline regulatory standards.market discipline involve information incentives. market need access toinformation judge risk profile bank organizations. but, make market disciplinework, also incentive bank respond change judgment themarket.it may possible increase market discipline require large, internationallyactive bank issue minimum amount certain type subordinate

fdic set accurate risk-based depositinsurance premiums, debt would provide extra cushion protection taxpayers.an additional benefit subordinate debt trade open market pricemovements would provide clear signal market’s evaluation bank’s financialcondition that, even use help price deposit insurance, could serve earlywarning aid supervisors.such approach would likely limit large bank least tworeasons. first, increase size bank organization financial innovation atthe large sophisticate bank challenge effectiveness currentregulatory supervisory framework. it may therefore appropriate, even essential, todifferentiate regulatory standard supervisory practice large, sophisticated, andinternationally active bank -- predominant source systemic risk -- applyto small medium-sized banks. second, unclear deep liquid market inbank subordinate debt would access small medium size bank would tothis market. today, almost small banks, example, issue subordinate debt, amajority large bank

feasible program mandatory subordinate debt would require considerableamount careful thought. still, judgment think might prove worthwhile. - 4 -bis review 76/1998reform basle accord: update

exchange rate regime. change feature amount tofixing underlie “engineering” monetary system.• second, change guide economic principle determine whethermonetary policy right course.• third, change

noone could confident tighten could achieve reliability.the first deficiency system rely heavily direct control banks,including interest rate ceiling impose banks’ deposit lend rates. this mean that,even monetary policy successful limit expansion bank deposit lending(and mean clear would be), tighten condition would extend tothe non-bank financial intermediaries. it group - merchant banks,

financial sector. interest rate ceiling deposit remove indecember 1980 small business loan april 1985. with removal ceiling 2 grenville (1991).3 this may seem obvious now, first response problem. the first response set intrain process whereby interest rate ceiling would extend cover non-bank financial institutions.an act parliament pass - financial corporation act 1974 - this, part 4 actwas

toensure budget deficit finance entirely borrow public. any shortfallin borrow public automatically meet government borrow thereserve bank, method finance colloquially know “printing money” or“monetising deficit”. in order stop unintentional monetary injection system,the government need move exist system, set interest rate ongovernment bond issue amount bond market want buy (the “tapsystem”), new system sell amount need finance deficit whateverinterest rate market demand (the “tender system”). this move occur 1979 fortreasury note 1982 government bonds.4finally, fixed, quasi-fixed occasionally change exchange rate regime thataustralia use post-war period introduce another element unintended monetaryinjections withdrawal system. under systems, reserve bank clearthe

benefit world capital flowslet start benefit world capital flows. much standardneoclassical economics, bear repeat trouble times. countries’ save andinvestment propensity differ markedly around world. if economy close capitalflows, domestic interest rate would equilibrate save investment country. theseinterest rate would vary widely, mean capital would different marginal value ineach

without world capital flows, general level ofdevelopment world would far less.problems - 2 -bis review 71/1998if that’s story, what’s problem? why world capital market seem becausing anguish, country country? why country turn away open capitalmarkets? it turn fine print go neoclassical model, theworld economy trouble fine print. here ways.• exchange rate volatility. country trade different currencies, exchangerates necessary make conversions. but addition devicesfor convert currencies, exchange rate play another important role theworld economy - also represent mechanism bring country

general, often far le costly way makeinternational adjustments. the next time hear someone complain aboutexchange rate changes, ask else mind restoreinternational equilibrium.while exchange rate change potentially stabilize effect, canalso destabilizing. when exchange rate allow fluctuate, setin currency market accord demand supply forward-lookingtraders, volatile, often overshoot long-term

unilateral default loan payment currency obligations.defaults would appear benefit debtors, long run debtor willhave trouble get new credit. or contagion effects. even one borrower isperfectly sound, borrower like go under, lender reluctant tolend similarly classify borrowers. discussion international capital flowsabound incentive effects.• transparency. a last issue involve transparency. for international capitalmarket work well, lender must know risk rewards. they must knowthe aggregate debt country, exchange rate risk taking, theon off-balance sheet liability relevant banks. when havea good picture risks, get serious trouble.while world financial crisis hit uneven force various countries, andwhile local situation differed, interaction four element almost alwaysbeen critical. sometimes big change exchange rate precipitate crisis, sometimes big changesin asset value put bank trouble, sometimes moral hazard issue generate unsound loans, andalmost everywhere lack transparency. once crisis get going, unilateral default andcontagion effect spread countries. the result broadscale financial collapse, whichthen feed real sector cause bankruptcies, credit restraints, recessions. these realincome loss turn magnify financial problems.solutionsare solution mess? many call end open capitalmarkets, benefit worth costs. others call distortionary taxes, toprotect country much openness. should go part way back closedeconomies?i remain optimist i think not. there may occasional instance somerestrictions necessary control extreme capital flow justify economic fundamentals.moreover, world capital system clearly need repair. but i hope repair getback world save whatever country go country need most, canpay saver. and world international capital flow important vehiclefor world economic development. let discus remedy help process.• financial institutions. two type correction necessary. a first istantamount preventive medicine - do institution

institution must close themanagement replace shareholder suffer losses. third, healthyinstitutions must recapitalized, preferably new equity sale capitalmarkets. the sooner step taken, better. the long nottaken, long trouble bank continue incur losses, engage riskypractices, threaten safe institutions, generate contagion effects, notperforming banks’ all-important maturity transformation function. indeed,here way foreign capital flow part solution problem,because new foreign-owned bank perform maturity transformationfunction invite participate credit-starved economies.• maturity transformation. while financial institution perform maturitytransformation, reason unduly burden system. country haveoften get trouble do much maturitytransformation - is, borrow abroad short maturity financelong-term investment. step could take limit borrowing, eithernationally bank supervision. some economist use idea topropose tax short-term borrowing, though tax rate necessary thejob could high might effective use orthodox principlesof bank supervision.• transparency. a set corrective mechanism involve greatertransparency. it must clear lender borrower alike risk theyare taking. this require good report financial institutions, alsorequires good aggregate statistic uncommitted foreign reserve balancesof individual countries. transparency alone cannot job good bankregulation, hard imagine

bothpositive harmful ways. those see potential harm argue trans-national bank stimulatecapital flight, particularly develop markets, stressful time may source capitaloutflows currency crises. second, analyst argue foreign bank may lack commitmentto host country flee, withdraw credit, face problem local market orin home market. a third concern participation foreign bank may associatedwith broad

foreign banksmay directly bring new good basic bank skills, sophisticate management techniques,and product good suit manage spread risk. through benefit competition,these commentator argue, local bank

foreign bank compete gainmarket share demonstrate comparatively sound financial condition. finally, theproponents view argue participation cross-border bank may stimulate improvementsin supervisory

broad-based lesson asian crisis teach us. one ofthe important contribute factor current financial crisis many emerge asiannations weakness bank systems, well weakness bank supervision withinthose countries. it seem clear that, asian banks, well government supervisors,violated fundamental principle bank bank supervision. banks’ managershad develop adequate process underwrite loan monitor continuedperformance, establish sufficient timely reserve buff expect loan losses. some ofthese problem stem lend direct governments, lead expectation thegovernment would support loans, needed. but, primary cause credit problemsstemmed banks’ failure deploy effective tool credit risk analysis.the absence credit risk analysis lead financial structure inherentlyfragile. bank supervisor country prove ill-equipped compensate fragility.poor allocation credit undermine prospect sustain economic growth. some borrowerscould service loans. a domestic banks’ loan portfolio deteriorate theirfinancial condition eroded, creditors, domestic foreign, look critically, andbegan withdraw funding. in short, deteriorate condition borrower hurt bankingsystem, increase economic harm rest countries’ economies.two feature countries’ financial system compound theproblems cause poor lend practice inadequate supervision. first, standard thetransparency disclosure private financial information extremely lax. it difficult forcreditors, foreign domestic, distinguish good risk bad, cause grantand, later, withdraw credit borrower within country without full knowledge ofborrowers’ creditworthiness. this latter reaction exacerbate crisis business andcitizens countries. second, creditor bank doubt rely extent publicsafety net back claims. this true small depositors, also

functioning.that begin improve prevention. above all, require transparency andinformation financial market form expectation rationally morerealistically imf ass need action quickly. specifically, thismeans publish data (especially maturity structure denomination external debt),publishing timely data short interval (if possible, monthly instead twice-yearly) usingmore sources, data borrower

broad sense, great prevention also include technical support. for example, theinternational community provide support, especially field bank supervision,where number emerge economy evidently still weaknesses. the bi recently set upthe institute financial stability order train expert staff, committee g-10 centralbank governors, mostly meet basle, intensify cooperation therepresentatives emerge economies.in addition, imf take account recent experience specific conditionsof country make policy recommendations. for example, level development thedomestic financial sector need take account assess right route liberalisationof capital transactions. and recommend exchange rate peg, country’s ability cope withsuch regime need consider carefully.finally, one aspect prevention surely imf, wherever economicpolicy weakness apparent, exert great pressure necessary government concernedbefore crisis break out, even extent do publicly sensitivequestion.for main contribution towards effective crisis prevention must made, course, bythe country concern themselves. that apply emerge economy country transition, tothe poor develop country and, least, industrial nation well. - 5 -bis review

restore crisis countries’access private capital.therefore imf contribute towards bring creditor debtor togetherround table early stage towards work market-based solutions. i fully agree whatmr. michel

heterogeneous, may difficult bring interestedparties together around one table. on hand, non-banks involve heavily, dangersof spread financial crisis sense systemic risk also tend smaller.the imf also minimise provision financial assistance least becausethese public resource distributing. it therefore bear absolutelynecessary portion finance package. it define maturity interest rate resourceswhich provide give debtor incentive repay soon possible. finally, course,the imf must make help subject certain requirements, must define conditionality. thatis part imf’s mandate also interest world

economic policy price stability. thenotion trade-off exist inflation unemployment live sweden longerthan countries. it take rather long time drawback level inflation thatwas relatively high, industrialise country, widely recognised.at time, sweden long tradition field central banking. theriksbank, found 1668, world’s oldest, still-functioning central bank. this give usthree hundred thirty year experience. it sweden, too, first banknotes—ineurope least—were introduce seventeenth century. a monetary policy focus pricestability, one theme forthcoming discussions, always animportant item central bank policy agenda. a well-known swedish economist, knutwiksell, clear exponent idea late nineteenth century. a happens, headdressed audience subject stockholm hundred year ago almost day,namely 14 april 1898. in one book wrote:“if price rise, rate interest raised; price fall, rate ofinterest lowered; rate interest henceforth maintain new leveluntil movement price call change one direction other.”just three decade address stockholm, sweden leave thegold standard september 1931. the objective monetary policy declare use“every available mean maintain swedish krona’s domestic purchase power”. in way - 2 -bis review 58/1998the riksbank first central bank declare openly monetary policy norm pricestabilisation.notwithstanding long tradition, inflation’s rise trend post-warera, swedish economic policy’s reorientation toward price stability begin late1980s early 1990s. that decade realignment initiate othercountries. by then, sweden experience twenty year inflation average 8 per cent ayear. that long inflationary period since early nineteenth century. in contrast, inthe one hundred forty year 1830 1970, inflation sweden average annualrate 2 per cent. so one say present decade re-establishing ourroots.sweden’s policy realignment early 1990s was, however, painful thananyone could foreseen. one conceivable explanation that, wait long thanother countries, road back price stability difficult us. there also anumber exceptional event along way. what perhaps bad bank crisis thecentury erupt wake 1980s’ bubble economy. exchange rate turmoil that,during dramatic days, instrumental rate hike 500 per cent. in early 1990sthe budget deficit grow large industrialise world. there many similarities,as well differences, financial crisis sweden mexico andsoutheast asia.in recent year situation sweden become stable and, aresolute economic policy, development take positive turn. the bank crisis beenresolved, economy expansionary phase inflation expectation low. step bystep, credibility new regime established. experience country clearlyshows consolidation changeover low-inflation regime take many years.inflation target’s historical root advantagesthe idea focus monetary policy price stability go back, i mentionedearlier, least wiksell’s argument century ago. it seem wiksell’s emphasis ondeflation important avoid inflation much acceptance thispolicy today.in sweden many countries, old idea, 1950s 1960s, atrade-off exist inflation unemployment result increasingly high level oftrend inflation. when drawback active economic policy type become apparent,people general representative also fear extreme - monetary policy thatconsistently aim keep inflation low possible. some countries, sweden isone, basically averse deflation. so regime whereby monetary policy systematic,long-term commitment keep inflation predetermine level 2 per cent, neither morenor less, represent many people perceive balance approach avoid deflation aswell inflation. this make easy establish legitimacy regime publicmind.some relevant issue practitionerlet turn matter practitioner find important whichwill also touch upon come two days. - 3 -bis review 58/1998one issue concern indicator inflation appropriate use anexplicit target. the practical consideration respect complex currently beingdebated sweden. the consumer price index advantage familiar widepublic. besides measure trend inflation, however, also give information pricefluctuations stem transitory supply-side shocks, example change indirect taxesand interest costs. with cpi target variable, central bank encounter problem inthe public discussion shock various kind liable result temporary deviationsfrom target. if indicator underlie inflation target instead, however, likelyto relatively unfamiliar people general. neither entirely clear optimalindicator underlie inflation constructed.whichever alternative one chooses, essential opinion centralbank prepare contribute open discussion possible, ambition ofachieving maintain price stability lose sight public’s ability hold thecentral bank responsible conduct monetary policy weakened.another issue choice target horizon monetary policy. thisrelates trade-off output volatility inflation volatility. a stand sentenceis correct difficult understand.a short horizon inflation targeting, say keep inflation target levelfrom quarter quarter, yield stable inflation rate. in order maintain target,however, central bank must make drastic adjustment instrumental rate causesa high degree variability real economic activity. a long target horizon may well implygreater variability inflation rate would allow gradual interest rate adjustmentsand small real economic fluctuations. in approach normal target horizon set atbetween one two years.a third issue degree transparency. it widely agree transparency isnot merely compatible inflation target regime actually essential regime tofunction properly. for one thing, central bank must accountable conduct ofmonetary policy. this question monetary policy’s basic legitimacy, important notleast central bank operate independently. for another, actual implementation ofmonetary policy need predictable possible.would maximum transparency preferable? be really point aline draw would reasonable try identify certain minimum level oftransparency? should minute monetary policy meet vote published?would even right allow central bank’s monetary policy meet show ontelevision?for part, seem reasonable publish relatively detail minute ofmonetary policy

- 4 -bis review 58/1998monetary policy asset pricesfinally word matter directly agenda ourdiscussions. i refer monetary policy respond asset prices. the reason forbringing today threefold. first, matter widely discuss today manyinternational forum well many central banks. second, practitioner i would like toencourage lead international expert present today study year tocome order develop knowledge area. it could topic futureconference. my third reason personal. before i come sverige riksbank i statesecretary ministry finance involve management sweden’s financialcrises. the obvious question happen prevent everhappening again.i already touch question monetary policy’s target variable, which,as know, complicate matter. an additional dimension whether asset pricesmore formally include target variable monetary policy?the question monetary policy asset price mean new. at thebeginning century economist like irving fisher already emphasise importanceof follow consumer price also asset prices. some decade later, tradition fromfisher take alchian & klein become well-known paper 1973. cpican see measure “current service flow prices”. asset price turn measure “futureservice flow prices”. a weight index consist cpi well asset price could serve aninter-temporal indicator live costs. the underlie idea index couldcontribute monetary policy aim price stability. the author argue centralbank concentrate solely development consumer prices, monetary policy may eithertoo contractive expansionary, reason consumer price usually react moreslowly asset price contractive expansionary impulse monetary policy. there isthen risk monetary policy destabilise tendency.alchian & klein found, however, construction index ratherdifficult practice; underscore importance monetary policy’s take thedevelopment asset price account. recently, charles goodhart draw attention isnow twenty-five year old paper alchian & klein; he, too, see difficulty involve aweighted index consumer asset prices. the conclusion probably asset price shouldnot formally include target variable monetary policy.asset price are, however, take account regime explicitly targetsinflation term consumer price index variant this. this occur via householdwealth effect corporate capital costs, influence total demand, alter output gap andthereby modify inflation prospects. if asset price rise strongly that, via increase demand,inflation tend rise target rate, central bank normally respond bytightening monetary stance. conversely, monetary stance ease asset price fallso much inflation liable target. thus far analysis fairlystraightforward. even asset price feature explicitly target variable, betaken account monetary policy model target consumer price index.sweden combination high inflation rise asset price 1980s. itmight argue policy fail concentrate price stability term consumer - 5 -bis review 58/1998price index. it note fix exchange rate regime time, theoverheating economy primarily matter fiscal policy. price bubble develop inasset markets, follow late price fall share real estate, example. this turn ledto severe bank crisis. but swedish bank crisis explain simply term aninsufficient focus price stability?the example japan 1980s suggest consumer price stability may notbe sufficient condition preclude bubble asset price financial instability. withtrend inflation average two per cent year, situation japan 1980s close towhat commonly mean price stability. yet japanese economy still move towardsa period grave financial instability.thus, question practitioner consider deal situationwhere asset price effect take account reference consumer price inflation butwhere may still risk asset price bubble may lead financial instability, adestabilisation real economy severe downward effect consumer price inflationlater on.one could argue effect large rise asset price aggregate demandmay small effect large fall fall increase general uncertainty andleads cautious spend behaviour. if collapse bubble asset price muchstronger effect precede boom, may optimal increase interest rate raise theprobability burst bubble even though policy action may temporarily lead lowerconsumer price inflation short term otherwise would desired. the reasonfor conclusion burst bubble sooner rather late reduce probabilityof still large bubble late even great downward effect consumer price inflation.hasn’t experience teach u grow risk instability may indicate bya steep increase asset price time credit supply expand anunsustainable rate time? if situation happen coincide low prospect forconsumer price inflation, might grind central bank depart itsinflation target time order curb increase asset prices?that special circumstance might prompt temporary departure centralbank’s inflation target novel suggestion. it discussed, example, thecontext natural disasters, large supply shock on. and full-blown bank crisisif serious economic disaster?at time, curb rapidly rise asset price price good andservices still show little sign turn upwards exactly easy task central bank.one difficulty lie justify general public. another whether assetprice bubble actually developing; central bank really good information themarket participants? a third problem interest rate hike might exacerbate subsequentcourse event asset price corrected. fourthly, central bank’s ambition steerasset price directly could perhaps pave way much large bubble future. in otherwords, safeguard financial bubble absence subsequent economicconsequences lead moral-hazard type phenomenon among market participants?circumstances must evidently special warrant central bank action tocounter asset price bubble concurrent upward pressure consumer price inflation. - 6 -bis review 58/1998it also reasonable central bank present clear case course action anddoes special situation arises.the riksbank start biannual series report financial system’sstability. the idea draw lesson recent experience bank crisis aposition - need arise distant future - discus policy measure mightbe call event risk financial instability. this could also do inflationreports.the situation today sweden different 1980s. asset price havebeen rise steeply since 1994 indebtedness turn upward quite recently. thissuggests risk bank sector experience significant problem event ofa fall asset price

fund experience draw on.this even i intend take challenge monetary policy inflation targetregime, bear mind particular position sweden. how active independentcentral bank stabilise economic

conclusion, i think i would make remark “new economy”.stable condition rather stabilisation policystable condition form le variability real economy mean enhance welfare societyas whole.one essential question whether, general terms, short-term stabilisation policy pursuedin attempt bring high real growth long term. it worth emphasise thatmonetary fiscal policy differ promptly react change economic circumstances.in principle, riksbank adjust instrumental rate time whatever stimulate orcurtail demand. at time, however, impact measure expect peak onlyafter 1 2 years. this mean monetary policy

monetary policy fiscal policy work together away moderate major variation employment growth, i.e. reduce cyclicalfluctuations around potential growth.since may difficult achieve practice, one question arise optimal modeof interaction fiscal policy monetary policy within framework inflation targetregime.what happen inflation target economy fiscal policy completely disregard state theeconomy?what happens, e.g. economy boom fiscal policy conduct along excessivelyexpansive lines? in absence credible nominal anchor economy, e.g. form aninflation target, demand increase further. this turn lead

productive capacity economy short-term stimulationpolicies.what happen scenario central bank inflation target? when inflationary pressure inthe economy increases, central bank tighten monetary policy prevent inflationtarget exceeded.such course event would result unfavourable policy mix. the stimulation provide byfiscal policy would counteract monetary policy, would mean even positiveshort-term effect stimulation would decrease even become negative. moreover, thestimulation provide fiscal policy powerful, could lead expectation increasedrisk inflation target cannot upheld, would lead rise inflation expectationsand high risk premium swedish interest-bearing papers. household company may feelgrowing uncertainty development public revenue expenditure, theformulation monetary policy. this costly economy lead failure carry outinvestments unnecessarily cautious decision allocation resources. to sum up,then, become costly pursue excessively expansive fiscal policy monetary policy isguided explicit inflation target.a good policy mix make good conditionsa good policy mix arise orientation fiscal policy make high inflation riskpremiums. it avoid orientation fiscal policy appear sustainable long run.the surplus-target public finance good example this.one mean confidence felt general public economic policy monitoredconsists inflation expectations, diverge substantially riksbank’s inflationtarget. when expectation inflation diverge target long term - whether upwards ordownwards - imply monetary policy adjust steer expectation backtowards target.in connection important observe central bank whose inflation target command highcredibility often scope act one little credibility. assume, example,that economy credibility inflation target high experience positive disturbanceto business cycle, lead high demand. since inflation risk premium low, employeeswill need demand extra high nominal wage insure unexpectedly highinflation. this anticipate central bank tighten monetary policy. thisin turn mean le stringent measure probably require would need acentral bank yet establish credibility. 3bis review 132/1999turning specifically situation sweden, say macroeconomic conditionstoday favourable: inflation low, budget deficit transform surplus theprospects growth good. however, economic policy continuous learn process thesuccesses recent year take evidence structural problem beensolved. on labour market, example, structural rigidity remain; also, tax-pressure stillhigh, inevitably distort incentive work save. a far monetary policy concerned,the credibility inflation target regime yet hardly test period economicupturn.what mean much often monetary policy react change theeconomic outlook? this, course, question executive board riksbank addresseson ongoing basis, communicate view inflation reports, minute meet andspeeches. in general terms, say need action base outlook fordomestic demand, stringency fiscal policy international

subject much discussion medium inacademic circles: existence “new economy”. when people talk this, eye turnedprimarily towards american economy. the concept seem capable cover manyphenomena. in context i define “new economy” increase potential growth theeconomy.in last years, growth american economy surpass forecasts. not hasthe rate growth high historic term present upswing - around 3.5% per year onaverage since end 1991 - besides stable unusually long lasting. at sametime, unemployment fall near 4%; level low witness since 1960s.however, distinction previous booms, increase rate inflation theunderlying rate inflation halve since 1991, 4% 2%. publicfinances improve considerably, deficit 5% gnp 1991 expect surplus ofaround 1% year.looking productivity per hour work american business, perhaps best measure ofhow good country’s growth potential long term, rise sharply, 2.5% onaverage since 1997; figure compare average growth productivity around1.5% period 1974-96. a substantial part improve productivity labour beexplained high investment - so-called “capital deepening” - least computer equipment.in spite fact unemployment continue fall throughout period, growth ofproductivity impressively high. this remarkable consider fact new jobshave principally create service sector, productivity generally increase lesserrate manufacturing.three principal group reason positive trend america distinguished.one important reason behind upswing appear good economic policies. since beginningof 1990s, fiscal policy direct towards achieve balance budget, year sonow budget balanced. in order achieve this, tax raised, expenditure bi review 132/19994diminished budgetary procedure make stringent. monetary policy directedtowards keep inflation low stable succeed ward destabilisinginflationary deflationary pressure early stage. the policy mix monetary fiscal policytherefore appear favourable.a number structural factor seem important. deregulation many sector andincreased globalisation intensify already tough competition increase pressure thepartners labour market, lead great flexibility labour market enhance labourmobility. the increase effective use new technology (it) raise productivity, theuse jit (just-in-time inventory management) mean match supply anddemand economy improved. the increase openness economy result fromamong thing nafta gatt agreements, mean foreign trade function asa “shock absorber” fluctuation domestic demand.finally, fortunate circumstance seem play part. with end cold war thebeginning 1990s, resource free up, principally military sector, could putto productive use private sector. further, mexican crisis asian crisis havebeen shock check certain tendency towards overheat thus also inflation, yetwithout lead economy recession. during crises, “flight quality” appear ledto fall long interest rates, benefit stock exchange price strengthen dollar.foreign investor will finance deficit america’s current account, atpresent come 4% gnp.to sum up, seem likely certain rise growth potential take place usa duringthe 1990s inflationary tendency declined. just much nevertheless remain openquestion. the oecd, example, raise estimate potential growth rate 3%.however, past three year growth amount 4% average, mean thatthe oecd regard factor discuss temporary nature expect growth toslacken factor die away.in course powerful upturn american economy, significant imbalance builtup time. among things, deficit current account never great itis now, recently consumption increase rapidly household incomes, whichmeans save ratio record low. sooner late imbalance need becorrected. however, discussion might come lie beyond bind iintended talk evening.are trace “new economy” sweden?–since sweden switch fix

financial reform indiahave proceed four major directions.first, set policy condition right remove operational constraint financialsystem. what reform process try achieve low share pre-emptedresources

allow great role interest rate theeconomy, dependence instrument monetary policy would need come infuture.the second directional change area create competitive environmentin financial sector reform measure relaxation entry exit norms,reduction public ownership bank industry let bank access capital marketin order meet fund requirements. the objective bring best result termsof price quality bank service period time.the third important direction reform strengthen market institution andallowing great freedom financial intermediaries. these reform take form ofgradual liberalisation interest rates, development money, capital debt market andgiving operational flexibility bank management asset liability subject, ofcourse, prudential guidelines. in simple terms, change imply great degree ofexposure individual financial institution domestic international economicenvironment.in connection, distinction need make two type market developments,which implication financial system. one

exposure beunhealthy lead irreparable shocks. although impact cycle bankingsystem quite limited, international experience suggest that, unless prudential measure inplace, bank potentially vulnerable asset price pressure generate systemicrisks financial system.the fourth important element reform concern “safety” aspect financial system.this core challenge face financial system present. when reform

net profit schedule commercial bank apercentage total asset turn around negative figure –1.0% anaverage 1992–93 1993–94 positive 0.5% 1994–95 1997–98. in thecase public sector banks, business per

netnon-performing asset bank system percentage advance decline 16% and8.2%, respectively, march 1998. in term percentage total assets, gross net non-performing asset decline 7.0% 3.3%, respectively, march 1998.i think present statistic unfavourable bank system whole. a thesecond report narasimham committee observed, “this improvement arrest thedeterioration parameter mark function system

public sector bank net non-performing asset range 10 20% net advances. the narasimham committee hasunderlined need reduce average level net npa bank 3% 2002 tozero bank international presence. i think important requirement ourbanking system crucial maintain viability system future. a two-prongedstrategy identify committee viz., reduce backlog npa improve themanagement efficiency strict enforcement

the world change dramatically since statement wasissued. we have, however, make adjustment stance monetary policy, follow thedecember board meeting. this result continual process evaluate incominginformation, assessment outlook year ahead, various risk attachedto forecasts. our judgement that, even though data come weresuggesting growth run ahead early expectations, likelihood growthwould decline 1999. at time, likelihood overshoot inflation target wasjudged declined. hence, view small ease policy prudent measure.the good economic outcome past year will, i suspect, recur feature ourdiscussion today. it might helpful, therefore, i start review forecast i presentedseven month ago make observation recent development compare withthem.what i say last time could summarise as:• gdp would grow 3 per cent 1998;• unemployment rate would remain relatively stable;• pass trough inflation would rise gradually, reach 2 per centby end year; and• current account deficit would average 5½ per cent gdp 1998.i also say i think combination event would reasonably good result foraustralia view difficult external situation facing, particularly among asianexport markets. in event, external situation get better, australia’seconomic performance exceed expectations, and, best knowledge, theexpectations virtually forecasters.it look though gdp growth 1998 4 per cent, rather 3 percent seem likely may. a good deal additional growth attributable strongeroutcomes expect june september quarters. the remainder result ofupward revision early data across recent quarters. consistent strongerthan expect growth, rate unemployment continue edge down, rather stayingflat. over past three month average 7.9 per cent, compare 8.1 per cent thefirst quarter 1998 8.7 per cent first quarter 1997. - 2 -bis review 107/1998on inflation, seem clear trough passed, best guess rise cpiover four quarter december 1998 is, round figures, still 2 per cent. but alsotrue say inflation show sign increase much historical relationshipsmight lead u expect, give fall exchange rate. on current account deficit, itnow look though average around 5 per cent gdp 1998 rather 5½ percent expect last hearing.i would summarise situation one forecast error within normalranges occur forecast type. the thing take comfort from, however,is no-one accuse u pollyannas case outcome slightlybetter forecast. growth stronger, widen current account deficitsmaller and, margin, rise inflation slightly small expected.i propose make general comment expect future event tounfold. over course year asian crisis commenced, 1996/97, theeconomy grow 4½ per cent. in first year affect asian crisis - 1997/98 - grow by4¼ per cent. despite start 1998/99 similar pace, accept beable continue rate. growth 1998/99 likely somewhere between2½ 3 per cent. implicit come quarterly growth rate noticeablylower one experience past year.some slow seem inevitable, give weak outlook world economy. since welast meet may, forecaster revise expectations. the imf, take oneexample, revise forecast world growth 1998 3 per cent 2 per cent,and 1999 3¾ per cent 2½ per cent. if estimate reasonable guide, theexternal environment remain difficult income external source constrained. ofcourse, domestic demand been, remains, much strong external demand, soaustralia’s expenditure run ahead national income past year. but gap cannotbe expect continue grow pace indefinitely, domestic demand andgdp growth must expect come come quarters. with slow growth theoffing, expect unemployment rate flatten out. of course, say last time;now suggest occur slightly low rate unemployment formerlyexpected.we expect four-quarters-ended increase cpi 2½ per cent end thefinancial year - is, short term, expect inflation performance consistent withour target. of course, forecast inflation beyond period good itsassumption future path exchange rate.given current tendency towards low commodity prices, assume furtherwidening current account deficit 5½ per cent gdp 1998/99. with annualfigure size, would surprise see quarter two run 6 percent gdp. i make comment march year, may previoushearing. i expect would come pas now, not. it would surpriseme, however, happen time next year.this set outcomes, something like it, would represent good performance economyin eighth year expansion face difficult, disastrous, external environment. iexpect would well receive domestic international investment community,though one never take granted. and, course, assumption makingabout world economy turn optimistic, bet would off.i come second part testimony, i attempt answer question whywe do good country asia pacific rim. in so, i - 3 -bis review 107/1998conscious story yet over, really interim report. i think number offactors involve i list particular order. a go them, itwill become apparent intertwined.first, i think asian crisis hit time australian economy good shape, partlyfor cyclical reasons. by mid-1997, economy grow strongly inflation lowerthan target. have receive contractionary impulse asian crisis, may havebeen face need tighten policy potential overheating. no-one ever know,but possibility. i conscious attribute performance past 18 month toour good start point rather superficial explain start point wasso good. but i come back later.second, i think benefit flexibility exporters, switch fromthe contract asian market expand north american european ones, anumber market usually think important us. the nature ourexports - much commodity - helped, effort marketingcompanies authority ignored. even so, prove possible preventexports falling, year september quarter fell 2 per cent volume.third, australia benefit greatly improve perception soundness itseconomic policies. the fact budget move back surplus - inthe mature phase economic expansion - important. so nearly decade lowinflation. also important occasion recognition australia score well onsuch factor regulation banks, financial institution stock exchanges, thatits underlie body commercial law account practice close world bestpractice.not international capital market take good view australia, also seemto confidence ourselves. business consumer confidence initially fell theasian event unfolded, fall excessively - part fell wellabove average average. in past three months, tend rise moderatelyagain figure economy confirm perform good mostexpected.the fourth explanation growth hold catch-all one - economy seem tobe flexible adaptable before. the clear evidence productivity -whether labour productivity total factor productivity - increase fast 1990s inearlier decades. for example, total factor productivity increase average annual rate of1.7 per cent expansion 1990s, compare 0.7 per cent 1980s 1.2per cent 1970s. to me, suggest painful adjustment make overthe past decade pay off. by this, i mean change make increasecompetition previously shelter industries. this, course, include great exportorientation, also great competition utility transport, reduce cost toother industries. it also include downsize public sector, releasedresources. finally, labour relation practice wage set machinery degreeof flexibility surprise sceptics.i come fifth factor, commentator view important - namely, thefact response contractionary external shock, australian dollar allow floatdown. this way textbook say situation handled, sharp contrastto severe domestic squeeze result case country fix quasi-fixedexchange rates. - 4 -bis review 107/1998the domestic economy benefit low exchange rate exporters’ incomeshave hold incentive export maintain (while time assist thoseindustries compete imports). the domestic economy also benefit becausewe put interest rate order maintain external parity (as fixedexchange rate) prop float rate threaten fall far would hadundesirable inflationary consequences. raise interest rate response externalcontractionary shock something normally would want do, although extremecircumstances may become necessary.i hear people say good thing that, unlike countries, relaxedin face fall exchange rate. i assure never relaxed. havingfollowed australian dollar virtually daily basis 15 years, i know nevertake granted. while float rate best system had, like asset pricesfreely determine unconstrained market australian dollar prone bout instabilityor overshooting. on three occasion - january, june august - downward overshootingthreatened respond foreign exchange intervention. on occasion, stability wasre-established and, unlike experience mid-1980s, raise interest rates. butthis mean option table. it was, financial market know this;as result, 90-day rate well cash rate june august. fortunately, thingsturned well, option used.thus, exchange rate centre stage. the general direction movement performinga useful function, yet short-term dynamic often threaten go toofar. it delicate balance act, one favourable outcome. over past twoyears, economy able grow 4 per cent per annum without significantupward pressure inflation (which average 1.6 per cent period). this isbetter almost anyone expected.another way approach question ask reserve bank able toaccept continuation high growth depreciate exchange rate without tightenmonetary policy (in fact, able ease slightly begin month). the answeris combination date seriously threaten inflation target. why turnedout way?the answer, i think, begin receive big dividend low inflationprovides.the economy gradually adjust nearly decade low inflation and, although theadjustment still complete, benefit become apparent. inflationary expectation aremuch low stable; wage contract often two three year duration; loans,including house mortgages, often interest rate fix long periods; businessesknow long automatically pas cost increase secure knowledgethat get lose among multitude price increases. this new le volatileenvironment allow float exchange rate job stabilise domestic economyin face external shock. it reduce tendency expansionary effectsof fall exchange rate dissipate form rise inflation. it also go withoutsaying low inflation environment make task monetary management lot easier.i think take satisfaction event turn past two years,but become complacent. this particular episode, start regional asiancrisis, far over. we think see end hasalready run

whatmistakes avoid future.so, 1997–98 financial turmoil widespread long-lasting? the way isee it, two main reasons. first, benefit hindsight, clear manyincautious international portfolio investment make wake growingglobalization capital markets. second, take japan much long expect dealwith serious economic financial problems, problem long predate asian crisis. – 2 –bis review 104/1998let explain i think factor impact time around.first, matter incautious international investment practice – problem here?with open financial market decline interest rate industrialcountries, grow number investor attract high return abroad. “abroad” oftenmeant so-called emerge market countries, particularly asia. with rapid ratesof economic growth year year, country seem great investment potential.but foreign investments, especially emerge markets, far complex domesticones. and assess investment tricky. for one thing, investor dealingwith company operate far away, different economic political environment. foranother, financial regulatory supervisory practice country le well-developed transparent. in addition, investor may felt rather well “protected” risks– couple reasons. first, past assistance package international monetary fund(imf) international agency may lead believe internationalcommunity would always come rescue bad come worst. second, many investmentadvisers evidently terribly fuss exchange rate risk asiancurrencies fix u.s. dollar. it easy forget fix exchangerate guarantee currency decline value – fact iswhat many currency done.in end, huge amount place emerge market 1990s

foreign banks, u.s. dollars, relatively low rates, andlending long term, domestic currency, high rate – often domestic real estatedevelopers.when peg exchange rate system asia break pressure, fixedat

positive factor picture look ahead. let elaborate,starting global environment. perhaps reassure element economicexpansion main industrialize countries, except japan, still well sustained. rememberthat country account half world output. the u.s. economy, particular,remains strong, grow much fast anticipate third quarter. so even slows, thateconomy – canada’s main export market – still operate relatively high levels. themajor european economies, group, also expand moderately. and number ofindustrial countries, include unite states, unite kingdom, many country incontinental europe, low

tostimulate economy grind cautious optimism. if implement sensible,systematic fashion, world economic outlook brighten considerably.another factor add pessimism early autumn concern a“credit crunch” unite state could spread elsewhere, include canada.however, recent interest rate reduction u.s. federal reserve eliminate theworst scenario envisage time. some rise interest rate “less-than-prime”debt, occur autumn concern global market risk andliquidity, reversed. and availability credit slowly improving.this say completely trouble yet; long considerableuncertainty there. but, reason i discussed, i certainly believe thescenarios worldwide recession deflation likely look ahead.as canada, true hit hard 15% decline commodityprices past year. it also true low prices, together slow worldeconomy, affect export industry – fact audience probably know toowell. it also evident nervousness volatility financial market make somecanadian consumer business le confident,

and successful, provide canadian great predictability,fewer cyclical fluctuations, sustain low interest rates. i believe monetary policy thatseeks provide kind environment conducive productivity

committee. the employment policy institute play important role inbringing together undertake research labour market involve policydecisions. in particular, employment audit provide valuable commentary currentdevelopments.the labour market unlike market. indeed, many people language ofeconomists – equilibrium unemployment, market-clearing wage – seem incompatible thehuman dimension unemployment deprivation. be 16 million unemployed people inthe european union merely equilibrium, one hand, statistic, other? but formost people labour market market – good worse, sickness health– sell time skill market price. that price determines, large part, theiropportunities economic welfare. wage rate much great significance influencingthe distribution real income price almost anything else. a result, labourmarket cannot divorce broad social political considerations.if terminology language sometimes insensitive, economist offer byway idea unemployment? the prize important idea insensitiveterminology surely go milton friedman concept natural rate unemployment.i shall discus shortly significance idea monetary policy. but elegantadvocacy similar position necessary delve back history.this month see 75th anniversary publication milton friedman describe asjohn maynard keynes’ best book: a tract monetary reform. it undoubtedly one themost persuasive polemic ever write subject monetary policy. to coincide withpublication december 1923, keynes give lecture national liberal club hetalked “the triple evil modern society”. from note use lecture – printedin collect write – see keynes regard evil as, first, “vastenrichment individual proportion service rendered”; second, the“disappointment expectation difficulty lay plan ahead”; and, third,“unemployment”. fat cats, short-termism jobless society: keynes ahead time.all these, keynes argued, “mainly due instability standard value”. over past20 years, britain face three problems. the income distribution widen

wrote, “i write toyou familiar fashion old kings’ scholars, though sameelection.” so far, good. regrettably, however, deputy governor’s comment onthe book appear grateful keynes write style educatedman could read pleasure, book print particularly attractive style.this deputy governor learn great deal keynes’ book. i refer almost everylecture i give. in lecture i shall discus three aspect significance labour marketfor monetary policy. the first concern link unemployment inflation inthe transmission mechanism monetary policy.the second issue monetary policy committee us available empiricalinformation uk labour market decide interest rates. how unemploymentfigures earn data enter mpc’s decisions?the third issue way unemployment enter objective monetary policy. withan explicit inflation target, true mpc neither care unemployment take itinto consideration set interest rates?the labour market monetary transmission mechanismthe theory unemployment spawn concepts, – without doubt – acronyms,than almost field economics (apart, perhaps, measure price inflation). ishall return language unemployment later. but i want first discus two conceptswhich heart discussion monetary policy labour market. they thenatural rate unemployment rate unemployment consistent stable inflation,usually know nairu.the concept natural rate unemployment introduce milton friedman edmundphelps 30 year ago level unemployment – friedman famously describe –would “ground walrasian system general equilibrium equations” reflect thestructural characteristic labour product markets. friedman first recognisethat natural rate unemployment neither constant time immune policyinfluences.the natural rate hypothesis imply vertical long-run phillips curve. in words, themonetary authority attempt “peg” level unemployment natural rate, thenthis time would cause inflation rate rise indefinitely. the work friedman phelpssoon prove highly relevant. the futility use monetary policy choose differentcombinations unemployment inflation become apparent 1970s. monetaryshocks – early 1980s 1990s – cause unemployment deviate itsnatural rate, period. a inflation expectation catch consequence ofthe monetary shock, unemployment return natural rate. – 3 –bis review 103/1998but response unemployment inflation expectation monetary shock far fromimmediate. indeed, friedman speculate full adjustment unexpected change ininflation might take “a couple decades”. such long lag dynamic labourmarket mean unlikely simple relationship deviation ofunemployment natural rate change inflation rate. chart 1 show didindeed take almost 20 year bring inflation inflation expectation (implied financialmarket return index conventional gilts) double-digit level currenttarget 22%, accompany large rise subsequent fall unemployment.the idea nairu think conceptual response inertia system whichmeans response economy shock protracted. in 1975 franco modiglianiand lucas papademos introduce concept non-inflation rate unemployment – theniru – define “a rate that, long unemployment it, inflation beexpected decline”. note pass appropriate terminology would non-increasing inflation rate unemployment (niiru). modigliani papademos recognise thatthe niru would affect macroeconomic shocks. they argue evidence tosuggest “over last two decade niru [in us] hold favourabletrend term trade private nonfarm sector one hand importedgoods farm product other. a termination reversal trend would tend raisethe niru, least temporarily.”it ironic two prominent economist country synonymous art andbeauty – italy greece – (one future nobel prize winner future central bankgovernor) give birth unattractive acronym spawn many evenmore unappealing cousins. the first, feted, offspring – nairu – introduce byjames tobin five year later. niru, niiru, nairu – tongue twister financial timeschristmas quiz, measure inflationary trigger point? take choice. for sake ofsimplicity i shall adopt conventional term, nairu, represent entire family.so relationship natural rate unemployment nairu? thenatural rate unemployment nairu quite different concepts. the former describesa real equilibrium determine structural characteristic labour product markets– grind friedman’s walrasian general equilibrium system (modified, necessary,by non-walrasian feature labour market imperfect competition, search behaviourand efficiency wages). it exist independently inflation rate. in contrast, latter, wellas affect structural characteristics, also affect gradual adjustment ofthe economy past economic shock determine path inflation. because definedas unemployment rate immediate pressure change inflationrate, reduce form – structural – variable.this difference reflect method use generate empirical estimate twoconcepts. the natural rate unemployment estimate reference structuralmodel labour market explicit microeconomic underpinnings beused identify characteristic determine natural rate. empirical estimate naturalrate would typically relate inflation long run effect shocksaverage out. in contrast, nairu estimate use system time-series equation relatinginflation past present economic shocks. the sole criterion judge success ofestimates nairu short-term correlation inflation. indeed, nairu asdefined – recent work estrella mishkin (1998) – level unemploymentsuch difference current rate unemployment necessary todescribe short-run inflationary pressure. – 4 –bis review 103/1998although nairu tend towards natural rate unemployment long run, isno reason expect close relationship two measure short run.the natural rate likely move relatively slowly time response change itsstructural determinants. in contrast, nairu vary change natural rateand response macroeconomic shocks. so argue estimate nairu aretoo time-varying plausible are, i think, danger miss point.the nairu use ex-post device describe level unemployment whichinflation start (or would started) increase. but usefulness estimate anex-ante predictor future inflationary pressure depend critically upon economicenvironment. in particular, estimate nairu good predictor future inflation,the natural rate would need relatively stable, magnitude likely shock would needto small. this perhaps go way explain estimate nairu recentpast appear contain ex-ante information future inflation u theyhave europe.more fundamentally, distinction natural rate nairu illustrate thedifficulty use concept month-to-month implementation monetary policy.the natural rate, although clearly relevant dynamic inflation, sufficient explainchanges inflation rate. the nairu, define measure relate short-runinflationary pressures, require knowledge reduce form transmission mechanismand history shock economy. but knowledge require also forecast forinflation, nairu provide additional information contain theforecast. indeed, estimate nairu could describe by-product process offorecasting inflation.as example, consider impact appreciation sterling mid-1996 late 1997.retail price inflation think weight average domestic import inflation.the substantial real appreciation sterling since mid-1996 reduce importedcomponent uk inflation so, turn, retail price inflation, level wouldotherwise reached. in essence nairu fell relative natural rate. that restrainingeffect inflation gradually wear begin reverse sterling continue fall.the issue whether domestic inflation component would fall level consistent theinflation target time temporarily depress effect wear central themonetary policy debate summer.the example sterling’s appreciation show macroeconomic shock, entirely independentof labour market, affect relationship rate unemployment rateof inflation. the rise sterling likely reduce nairu via two separate channels.first, short run, relationship domestically generate inflation – wageinflation substantial element – retail price inflation shift low importedinflation. second, temporary improvement term trade follow rise insterling 1996 reduce wedge real consumption wage – relevanceto employee reflect mix domestic import inflation component –and real product wage – relevance employer reflect price onlyof domestically produce goods. that reduction wedge likely reduce thepressure nominal wage growth give level unemployment.so quite possible believe nairu fall even natural rate not. butthis likely temporary. a impact sterling’s appreciation wage price wearsoff, nairu will, thing equal, rise towards natural rate. but – 5 –bis review 103/1998lasting change may reduce natural rate (and hence nairu). for example, range ofgovernment policies, include change jobseekers allowance, new deal newworking family tax credit, increase incentive work. the national minimum wageworks opposite direction. assess impact structural factor naturalrate easy calculate effect macroeconomic shock nairu. but isuseful distinguish two concepts, least move quite differently theshort run.enough theory, may appear largely semantic. none is, course,either new original. but understand language unemployment matters. richardrogerson, journal economic perspective last year, pose question: “have thelanguage concept develop economist study unemployment serve roleof foster clear communication find allow issue sharply defined?”professor rogerson’s conclusion, perhaps surprise hear, resound no.neither natural rate nairu term well choose win friend influencepeople. after all, nothing natural natural rate.whatever call them, crucial recognise considerable uncertainty thelocation natural rate unemployment nairu. even unite states,where appear obvious trend natural rate, estimate 95% confidenceinterval nairu typically 5% 7.5%. in uk structural reformsand macroeconomic shock large impact us, range uncertainty iseven greater. perhaps honest answer question natural rate thatgiven milton friedman wall street journal january 1995: “i don’t know thenatural rate is, neither you, neither anyone else.”the labour market monetary policy practice?how concept affect monetary policy practice? and role analysis thelabour market play monetary policy committee’s decision interest rates?using language unemployment develop earlier, mpc ass whether thecurrent level unemployment differ significantly nairu and, importantly,whether likely remain future. it may explicitly take view thelevel nairu, may implicitly produce forecast inflation. in practice,we focus directly inflation forecast.but need policymakers focus level unemployment level outputeach time ass stance monetary policy unavoidable. alan greenspan it.mpc member it. know growth rate gdp (or likely be) orbelow trend rate increase little value unless one also know level outputis relative potential. this basic, fundamental, point. if, whatever reason, levelof unemployment natural rate, rise unemployment unavoidable. that may beundesirable. but attempt avoid simply result longer, pronounced,correction future

community. it standard practice literature monetary policy assumethat authority seek minimise social loss function, define term deviation ofthe level output unemployment equilibrium values, term deviation – 6 –bis review 103/1998of inflation desire value. but obvious, why, discussion economicconjuncture economic policy, much attention place growth rate rather onlevels? why commentator pundit concern whether economic growth goingto trend rate, even whether likely zero? that isnot matter economic policy nor, importantly, social welfare.an excessive focus growth rate output employment, rather levels, mayreflect rather natural, dangerous, optimism degree spare capacity theeconomy. after all, belief could always achieve low unemployment withoutan increase inflation mark kinder, gentler, altogether civilise approach toeconomic policy? or simply wishful thinking? a greg mankiw put it:“wishful think one reason monetary policy historically excessivelyinflationary… to mind, wishful think worrisome problem monetary policy astime inconsistency.”genuine concern unemployed mean recognition sustainable reduction inunemployment require combination monetary stability demand

– – react toshocks order minimise undesirable volatility output employment. to end, thepursuit explicit symmetric inflation target relevant objective monetary policy.with inflation target and,

complement independence escb, credibilityof single monetary policy rests. moreover, monetary policy strategy must clear andtransparent confusion ambiguity objective monetary policy andhow objective

issue high level unemployment. in so, shall make thebest possible use knowledge expert throughout escb ensure expertise isavailable wide public policy-making community.in context, let emphasise govern council ecb concern theunacceptably high rate unemployment euro area. however, inflationary monetary policywould solve europe’s serious unemployment problem. on contrary, inflationary policywould unacceptably flout maastricht treaty; treaty, let remind you, beenratified member state european union endorse public referendum inseveral countries, include ireland. an inflationary monetary policy would almost certainly lead tohigher unemployment medium run, long-term interest rate would rise benefit ofprice stability would lost. such policy would therefore entirely counterproductive. let bevery clear: interest european citizens, govern council determine protectprice stability. the escb’s independence mean facilitate achievement goal. onlyby preserve price stability thereby create stable environment require continuedhigher employment growth, european system central bank (escb) serve publicand address public’s understandable concerns.in describe escb’s stability-oriented

second, ishall outline prominent role play money overall strategy. third, i shall describe theanalysis wide range financial economic indicator enter policydiscussion. finally, i shall conclude argue stability-oriented strategy adopt - 3 -bis review 97/1998escb is, present circumstances, clear transparent thealternatives. in consequence, i confident future success.2. the quantitative definition price stabilitythe maastricht treaty assign escb primary objective maintain price stability. in theinterest accountability, govern council ecb decide publish quantitativedefinition price stability, success fulfil treaty’s mandate besensibly judge public.in context, october meet govern council ecb agree “price stabilityshall define year-on-year increase harmonise index consumer price (hicp) forthe euro area 2%”.in way, govern council clearly unambiguously define objective. if whenwe meet objective, oblige explain case goingto it. let emphasise over-riding priority attach objective. this priority isnot consequence legal obligation treaty. it also root belief –supported decade experience substantial body theoretical empiricalresearch – maintain price stability euro area pre-requisite sustainable andlasting improvement standard live europe’s citizen lay foundation forimproving growth employment prospect future.the definition publish clear. in particular, specific price index identify withwhich ass maintenance price stability. the hicp euro area choose itis sufficiently harmonise across different country euro area start stagethree consistent public’s usual focus consumer prices.using index “for euro area” highlight euro area-wide developments, instead specificnational regional factors, determinant decision regard single monetarypolicy.as i emphasise past, definition signal aversion govern council toboth inflation deflation. the phrase “below 2%” clearly delineate rate inflation thehicp deem consistent price stability. the word “year-on-year increases” imply thatdecreases hicp - say deflation measure price index - would consideredconsistent price stability.the govern council also announce “price stability maintain mediumterm”. in so, realistically acknowledge disturbance price level occur theshort run - example, cause change indirect tax commodity price - cannotbe control monetary policy escb. such factor may lead occasional fall thehicp, occasional increase 2%. these quite normal consistent meaningfuldefinition price stability. by focus medium term, escb’s monetary policy willensure transitory deviation definition become sustain mediumterm.by maintain price stability medium term, appropriate forward-looking medium-term orientation impart monetary policy. this ensure policy reaction threat toprice stability measure deliberate. such action introduce unnecessary instability oruncertainty economy, nevertheless ensure price stability - attendantbenefits - maintained. - 4 -bis review 97/1998the prominent role money escb’s

monetary policy help stabilise thepublic’s medium-term inflation expectations, enhance credibility effectiveness monetarypolicy.to signal prominent role attach money, govern council ecb announce aquantitative reference value monetary growth. in regard, commentator assumedthat escb adopt conventional monetary target, simply call different name.however, announce formal intermediate monetary

essence transparency. - 5 -bis review 97/1998a number issue remain finalise regard quantitative reference value formonetary growth. first, broad monetary aggregate reference value beannounced defined. second, reference value monetary growth 1999 tobe derive published. progress two important issue well way i anticipate afinal announcement govern council december.1. a broadly-based assessment outlook price development euro areaalthough monetary data contain information vital monetary policy-making, monetarydevelopments alone not, course, constitute complete summary economicinformation necessary enable appropriate policy decision taken. in escb’s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, money accord prominent - exclusive - role.there clear need govern council look wide range economic andfinancial indicators. consequently, parallel analysis monetary growth relation thereference value, broadly-based assessment outlook price development risk toprice stability euro area also undertaken. this assessment systematically analyseall information economic financial situation, ensure governingcouncil well-informed possible make monetary policy decisions.outside escb, commentator label broadly-based assessment “inflationforecast”. failure publish “the” inflation forecast see contrary principle oftransparency. i afraid view flawed. allow explain why.while true accurate forecast contribute success appropriately forward-looking monetary policy, escb judge on, hold accountable for, accuracy ofits internal forecasts. rather, performance maintain price stability medium termshould use public judge success escb’s policies. consequently, thepublication forecast important far help achieve price stability throughincreasing clarity transparency policy-making process. in regard,

chargesi aware commentator question aim make system reflect risk amore differentiate way. one argument make capital charge procyclical, thateconomic downturn external shock amplify regulatory demand high capital.there concern consequence could particularly severe case lend toemerging markets, rat change sometimes lag onset crises.this certainly risk, one take seriously. clearly could

decisions. in fact, part underlie problem ofprocyclicality risk recognise early enough, time allow lender exert moregradual beneficial discipline borrowers. the capital framework - and, equally important, bankprovisioning policy - need therefore forward look dynamic possible. since ratings- whether external internal - influential provision future influential incapital, turn forward looking. this sovereign context placeparticular emphasis importance country adhere international transparency standards.no rat reliable without adequate information economic financial situation thecountry. the

residual risk underlie various type credit risk mitigation technique - collateral, guarantees,netting, credit derivative - hop uniform consistent treatment appliedto instrument place various, somewhat ad hoc, treatment grow date.there perhaps one caveat attach aim introduce great risk sensitivity.this often entail much great reliance judgement competence supervisors.this see evolution basel accord encompass banks’ internal market riskmodels, approve supervisors, new proposal allow banks’ internal rat tobe use credit risk capital. it also evident emphasis individual supervisory judgement

even amongst g10, somesupervisors (such us) actively contemplate draw two tier distinction thecapital rule apply banks, depend level complexity organisation. i entirelyagree howard davy essential basel framework, remain globalstandard, continue encompass menu option accommodate different needs.i also wish gloss fact knotty area proposal haveto tackle basel committee deliver objective great risk sensitivity andcomprehensiveness. the fsa today go tackle four difficult, namely credit riskmitigation, operational risk, internal ratings, interest rate risk bank book. i would like totake opportunity make observation area particular interest us.use internal credit ratingsthe bank has, may know, devote considerable think development theinternal rat base approach set capital credit risk. this part beenable utilise expertise build course work credit risk modelling, onwhich bank fsa hold joint conference last year. but importantly, also becausewe consider part basel proposal utmost importance achieve balancedand stable framework. in particular, availability approach important safety valvefor market pressure distortion could otherwise arise use external ratings. imean disrespect exist well-known rat agency - indeed quite contrary - i saythat last thing regulator would want see mushroom untried rat agency allclamouring “recognition” supervisors. we wish see supervisory net extended, bi review 132/19994by way quasi-regulation, rat agencies; wish substitute regulatory judgement forthe satisfactory investor discipline currently operate rat arena.i note eu commission’s consultative paper reform eu framework go thanthe basel committee’s talk design internal rat base approach could potentiallybe use banks, large sophisticate ones. this make sound sense, since, mymind, bank seriously question value-added bring credit intermediationprocess reasonably systematic mechanism assess price borrowerrisk. there indeed various way internal rat base approach could designed, withvarying degree sophistication depend instance number “buckets” used,whether maturity incorporate additional dimension, whether bank’s internalestimates loss-given-default recognised, well simple

evolutionary framework whereby system could develop insophistication time. in principle, would certainly like see system reasonably largenumber bank could sensibly aspire to. there two caveat i would make. first, ofcourse, implication supervisory resource large population bank tohave internal rat system approved. and secondly, even simple framework observecertain minimum requirements. this mean ability relate internal rat quantifiableconcept, loss-given-default default probability; ability demonstrate thisrelationship historically valid, - likely absence long run data - least plausible; andthird, i say before, forward-looking dimension rating. whilst bank england doingits best - i hope success - help economy avoid boom bust previousdecades, bank likely remain cyclical industry, mind would simply imprudentto base rat capital borrower’s position top economic cycle.operational riskuse internal rat course raise many sort difficulty test validationthat identify credit risk modelling. however, least talk reasonablywell-defined type risk one quantifiable statistical terms. we much moredifficult territory come operational risk. the term operational risk cover wide range oftypes source risk, banks’ data base loss generally patchy. there numerousquestions appropriate design charge, also appropriate level. it isclear type operational risk, fraud, result huge spike loss, saw inthe case bar morgan grenfell. even though concern protect system, ifeel would inappropriate expect bank hold additional cushion capital coverthese sort rare events: would either grossly excessive

credit market risk. but practice, clear evidence credit ormarket loss put pressure firm, push manager fraud result inoperationally-risky cost cutting. there certainly occasion operational loss haveonly reveal market downturn similar event. a i hear graphically expressedthe day: “it tide go discover wear bathingcostume”!i optimistic that, time, operational risk become measurable that, casefor market risk models, consensus method quantify emerge. the basel committee’sframework certainly flexible face evolution. however, also notlose sight fact committee’s announce aim coverage

would that, even advanceson measure operational credit risk, bank want carry chunk fairly undefinedcapital cover rainy day events.future challengesfinally, i close, i would also like stress many

korean economy surface wake thefinancial crisis. the topic speech select mind.the role central bank restructure processrather explain great detail korea’s restructure measure outcomes, i wouldlike focus central bank contribute process monetary policy.the restructure process require micro administrative approach since aim reformindividual company financial institutions. therefore government ministry position draftand revise legislation, government agency oversee monitor detailedmanagement financial institutions, charge process. the central bank, theother hand, face natural limit extent share actively restructure process.it conduct monetary policy base efficient work market rather onadministrative device legislation. moreover, monetary policy influence economic entity awhole rather act individual institution businesses. bi review 120/19992despite limitations, central bank contribute restructure process within themonetary policy framework. there four way may so.1.create macroeconomic environment conducive restructure processfirst, central bank create economic environment help successful implementation ofrestructuring measures.the economy need degree dynamism restructure measure implementedsmoothly.looking back, restructure carry real economy contract due theripple effect crisis. korea country experience negative growth crisis.several country suffer crisis 1990s include three scandinavian countries, mexico,thailand malaysia go period negative growth last one two years.however, deep economic downturn likely act obstacle successful restructuring. if acompany financial institution improve financial structure, pay back debt byrealizing profit increase capital public offering. during recession, attemptsdo yield desire outcomes. moreover, since job mobility decrease significantly recession,bold management rationalization inevitably entail large-scale job shedding, difficult carryout.another reason certain degree economic vitality necessary successful reschedule isrelated problem “black sheep” economy. when specific sector clearly needsemergency surgery, fear would heavy toll term unemployment andfinancial market disturbance, government tempt put operation, especiallywhen economy depressed. this sector remain “black sheep” economy longas economy pull recession, gradually turn time-bomb theeconomy whole. for example, korean economy recover year, therestructuring daewoo group (a large chaebol whose interlink company beenplaced workout program) problem involve investment trust company - two majorissues come fore since july - might remain surface thepotential cause even great trouble future.this lead conclusion economic recovery vital smooth implementation ofrestructuring measures. have say this, must bear mind economy recover tooquickly exuberantly, cause overheating, economic unit may feel need restructurethemselves.too low interest rate choke companies’ incentive reduce debt. with improve cashflow, company lure expand business. also, financial institution become lessinterested clear bad debt book since opportunity cost hold decrease withlower interest rates.another problem spring choice monetary policy stance inflationary pressuresbegin rise due over-accommodating policy. in cases, period restructuringcorresponds deflationary phase central bank ease monetary policy withoutworrying inflation. however, inflation raise head restructure proceededvery far, central bank may position choose price stabilization andmaintaining environment favorable restructure process. this dilemma centralbank either choice negative effects. if central bank, example, adopt amonetary-tightening stance fight inflation, short-term profitability company andfinancial institution deteriorate, may blunt momentum restructuring. on otherhand, relax monetary policy stance maintain keep restructure road, price riseand company may turn debt-dependent, expansionary management style, whichran riot past. a result, people come lose faith restructure itself. 3bis review 120/1999for successful restructuring, therefore, economy must allow overheat therecovery le adequate. achieve well-balanced, unbiased economic environment forsustainable growth create best condition reform measures. in words, central bank hasto conduct monetary policy supportive economic recovery, subject constraint thatadequate discipline exercise economic entity incentive forchange. such policy, nature, attract spotlights, quite important itmay affect final outcome restructure measures.in regard, bank korea steadily low interest rate since second quarter of1998. a result, korean economy show clear sign recovery basis thesetrends, restructure process well way. however, may 1999, bank decide afurther low overnight call rate, policy rate, take view economicrecovery proceed fast pace expected, asset price rise sharply within ashort period.recently, even though economic recovery gain great momentum, bank koreahas maintain call rate unchanged, imply take neutral position. the reason behindthis decision sign imminent inflation visible, financial market havebeen unsettle restructure daewoo group.2.supply liquidity ensure financial market stabilitysecond, central bank supply liquidity flexibly response financial market turmoilwhich may arise course restructuring.it quite common financial market become destabilize process structuraladjustment due high credit risk reduce trust among market participants. a result, creditcrunch may occur, bring prolong economic recession financial institutionsand corporation may able raise sufficient money normal operation. in addition,market participant favor short-term end market. the consequent large pool short-termfunds make movement interest rate stock price extremely volatile, financialinstitutions may become illiquid short-term nature liability long-termnature assets.admittedly, financial market unrest unavoidable process restructuring. however, thedegree unrest become acute insupportable, may threaten cut short reform itself.therefore, central bank, suppose responsible stabilize financial markets, cantake active role provide liquidity open market operations.at outset crisis, bank korea provide fund stabilize financial market inresponse market turbulence, induce bank expand lend small mediumenterprises order ease credit crunch whose effect concentrate them.a central bank play role lender last resort order maintain financial market stability.however, role lender last resort must carry follow strict rules, since centralbank’s right issue paper money easily abuse invite moral hazard part financialinstitutions. first, central bank must maintain “constructive ambiguity” prevent individualfinancial institution become dependent it. this phrase mean although centralbank able intervene market insure financial stability, must give assurance abailout individual financial institutions, whether covertly overtly. second, even support isgiven individual financial institutions, punitive rate least market interest rate must appliedin order avoid exploitation interest rate differential. lastly, element conditionalityincluding resolute self-rescue plan must clearly impose performance closely monitoredby central bank. bi review 120/199943.mediate structural adjustmentthird, central bank may play role mediator process restructuring.there example central bank mediate debt reschedule negotiation amonginterested parties. the bank england, instance, actively involve corporate sectorrestructuring 1970s quite recently upon voluntary request creditor banks. thefederal reserve system unite state also serve mediator cash-strappedfinancial institution brink failure.there many reason bank england federal reserve system able tomediate restructure process. one them, i believe, time undertake theresponsibilities financial supervision. if central bank supervise banks, accurately analyzetheir current business condition status. moreover, also get easy access information onindividual company borrow money them. the central bank, therefore, effectivemediator. in addition, strong credibility arise carefully cultivate reputation forneutrality fairness, may well help reconcile conflict interest groupsinvolved.in case korea, relationship financial institution enterprises, thosebetween individual enterprise closely intertwined. therefore, structural reform korea cannot berestricted one specific sectors: rather, broadly based. this imply thatin korea, perhaps country, accurate analysis financial institution andenterprises badly need successful restructuring. however, since revision relatedlegislation april last year, bank korea long supervise bank directly. consequently,it easy monitor scrutinize business condition individual bank andenterprises, make hard bank serve mediator.4.foster international cooperation improve overseas confidencelastly, central bank contribute brighten country’s external credibility closelycooperating international financial circles.restructuring entail extensive friction conflict domestic front. so process toproceed smoothly, imperative avoid extra turbulence stem international investorswho large claim korea. this require international confidence country bemaintained exist level or, possible, improved. to sure, international credit rat willbe upgrade substantial progress reform drive, also important reassureforeign investor keep well post domestic economic situation. towards thisend, international cooperation necessary, central bank, i believe, well suit job,in particular, financial matters.a number cooperative group link central bank like bi (bank internationalsettlements), emeap (executives’ meet east asia pacific central banks) seacen(south east asian central banks) already set up. they allow governor work levelofficials central bank ample opportunity discus current issue build upmutually-cooperative relationships. in emergency, central bank governor thus able tackleissues promptly thank close contact cooperation. by influence hold overtheir domestic financial institutions, central bank well-placed persuade prolong thematurities overseas credit provide fresh loan request fellow central bank, topromote good understand economic situation debtor countries.closing remarksthe bank korea support smooth implementation structural reform openmarket operation financial market stabilization policy. in future, bank intend conducta balance monetary policy ensure success restructure support economic 5bis review 120/1999recovery. it also support structural adjustment indirectly strengthen cooperativelinks among central bank worldwide.i fully aware critic overseas rate korea’s structural reform far fromsatisfactory. however, experience country attests, difficult achieve satisfactoryoutcomes short time restructure definition entail conflict pain. consideringthese points, i venture ask continue

andthe way business transact markets. these change are, course, root theremarkable technological advance witnessing. today, technology forprocessing information make information widely available fundamentally alteredthe way world channel save investment. no long global economy relyprimarily loan commercial bank meet finance investment needs. rather,more ever before, global economy today look

markets.the flow funds, turn, increasingly rely price signal generate trade activitythat take place daily markets. the reliance secondary market trade pricediscovery constitute fundamental difference fund security market andloans banks.let bite specific. in security markets, investment decision drive pricesthat arise trade process reconcile differential information diverse group ofinvestors. in bank loans, investment decision base bank’s private information aboutspecific borrowers. while bank make investment decisions, security market rely onthe consensus multitude investors.when security market work well, provide efficient way aggregate information andallocating risk among wide range investors. in order function well, however, thesemarkets require trade infrastructure. this infrastructure may consist exchange, anetwork broke dealers, clear system. these market also rely cadre ofrelatively well-informed investors, confidently judge asset price take position – 2 –bis review 108/1998strength judgments. if trade infrastructure fail investor lose confidence, tradingwill grind halt.the global fixed-income market unlike equity markets. in equity markets, everyone knowssomething trade infrastructure, centralize exchanges. thus, noquestion focal point trade information. but importance fixed-incomemarkets, multiple-dealer, over-the-counter markets, sometimes hard appreciatebecause decentralized.in unite states, bond market company raise fundsin recent years. during last ten years, example, u.s. nonfinancial corporation borrow anet amount $785 billion form

continuous process offinancial innovation. this innovation serve unbundle different kind risk and, thereby,to enlarge menu risk investor may choose bear. for example, interest-rate swaps,futures

political involvement tend take short time horizon consideration.the consequence long term decision support sustainable gain inemployment income, lead high inflation. this view confirm host ofeconomic research.independence, however, require clear mandate. the escb mandate. it primaryobjective maintain price stability. without prejudice objective price stability theescb support general economic

society – 2 –bis review 100/1998the central bank account policies. finally, transparency towards outside worldcan also structure discipline internal debate inside central bank.let turn way mean achieve transparency. a first element escbhas define quantitative objective price stability. it read follows: price stability year-on-year increase harmonise index consumer price (hicp) euro area

term”. the escb cannot hold accountable short-run deviation pricestability, example due shock import price specific fiscal measures. a monetarypolicy reaction short-run fluctuation price level would provide wrong signal themarket cause unnecessary interest rate volatility. in summary, escb react anappropriate, measure and, necessary, gradualist manner economic disturbance thatthreaten price

andexplained public. the select stability-oriented strategy promote much continuity aspossible exist strategy national central bank eu. at time, itsdesign adapt unique situation introduce single currency eleven countries,which may certain extent change economic behaviour. therefore much continuity aspossible much change require thrust strategy.our strategy consist two pillars. the first important role money second abroad-based assessment outlook price development euro area. the main reasonfor assign prominent role money empirically well-founded view inflation, atleast long run, monetary phenomenon. this simple obvious observation lead thegoverning council announce quantitative reference value growth broad measureof money. this choice create “nominal anchor” monetary policy therefore helpstabilise private inflation expectation long horizons. the reference value derive ina manner clearly consistent – serf achievement – price stability. it willbe construct that, absence

labour cost industrial producer prices.concerning recent price developments, hicp inflation euro area fell 1.0% inseptember, due strong impact food prices, i would want read much intothis late decline price component relatively volatile short periods. moresignificantly, preliminary data suggest various broad monetary aggregate euro areaare increase 3 5%, thus appear signal strong incipientinflationary deflationary pressures. we line consensus view inflation theeuro area rise moderately 1999, remain 2%. i consider deflation aserious risk price stability present.so far, despite worsen global environment, euro area-wide activity continue toexpand fairly stable rate. at around 3%, annual real gdp growth broadly unchanged inthe first half 1998 solid growth see second half 1997. industrial productiongrowth slow somewhat since spring. more recent evidence, particularly thearea-wide survey data, may also suggest moderation pace growth furtherdevelopments indicator continue

moreover, low short-term interest rate euro area currently stand at3.3%, several country cut interest rate towards level recently part theprocess towards interest rate convergence. the process

think issue theinternational role euro monetary policy strategy european system centralbanks (escb). in order remain within tight time frame leave room discussion, ishall try concise possible, i shall therefore focus three question addressedto directly.1. be significant international role euro desirable goal?some observer assert one main motif behind economic monetaryunion europe creation major international role euro, foster sucha role would important objective european central bank (ecb). both assertion areincorrect. the purpose introduction euro promote economic integration andeconomic welfare member states, objective escb – ecb partof system – maintain price stability within euro area. the escb take neutralstance towards international role euro. it neither hind deliberately encouragethe development role, rather leave market forces.the escb will, however, contribute indirectly international recognition euro byachieving objective maintain price stability within euro area. a successful monetarypolicy necessary condition, prerequisite international recognition anduse currency. the reason latter complex phenomenon. while singleinternational role currency, many us currency

complicate conduct monetary policy. in escb’s monetarypolicy strategy, development monetary aggregate play prominent role, thesedevelopments analyse carefully. if significant part money stock tocirculate outside euro area development deviate circulate insidethe euro area, could source instability money demand.but one challenge escb face analyse developmentsin monetary aggregates. other challenge relate change money demand result ofthe introduction euro itself. together, change represent structural break, isobviously difficult predict demand money evolve around break.the escb take difficulty account monetary policy strategy that, firstly,it announce reference value monetary aggregate, target value. thismeans that, although monetary development use main indicator potentialinflationary disinflationary pressures, escb react almost mechanical way tocorrect deviation reference value short term. secondly, escb focussolely analysis monetary aggregates, complement analysis broadlybased assessment outlook future price developments.on one hand, choose strategy will, view, ensure great degree continuity aspossible relation exist strategy national central bank euro

international policy co-ordination central banks? be target zonesfor key currency conceivable, even desirable?the ecb, act behalf escb, already begin play major role internationalfora, bank

price stability euro area prime objective. at time,the ecb seek make best contribution stable international developments. inparticular, introduction euro reduce number major currency bloc theglobal

similarlyvulnerable possible consequence instability. they may thus great incentive takeon share responsibility help maintain stable global environment.on question exchange rate target zones, i would like state clearly that, itsmonetary strategy, escb exchange rate target. nor unite state andjapan. an exchange rate target area large relatively close euro areacould easily conflict maintenance price

ciocca, deputy director general bank italy, conferenceon “la concentrazione nell’industria dei servizi finanziari:aspetti teorici ed esperienzeinternazionali” hold università cattolica del sacro cuore

appear see large scale operation offer prospect ofcoping repercussion better.in italy’s case, however, key additional factor increase competition. the italianbanking system enter eighty low level competition inherit thepast. the subsequent change radical consequent narrow margin stimulatedrestructuring consolidation. from eighty onwards, dictum comparative statics“more concentration, le

remain objective pursued, eventhough necessary, sufficient, condition increase thecompetitiveness italian bank system, still burden high operatingcosts.mergers protection competition - 2 -bis review

power. the law recognizesthe threat concentration pose competition. nonetheless, traditional attitude towardsmergers attenuated, view positive effect capable producing.in italy, article 6 law 287/1990 define scope antitrust action. the ban mergersapplies would create strengthen dominant position detrimental tocompetition.antitrust law, turn, supplement monitor merger range alternativeinstruments. control firm’s behaviour may prevent exploit position todiscriminate competitors. control agreement compete firm mayprevent understand distort play competition.in addition, action — derive directly antitrust law strictsense term often fall within scope several institutions’ authority —aimed ensure contestability markets, make possible firm enter themarket erode dominant firm’s profits. freedom enter market must couple withfreedom leave market keep sink cost withdrawing, allow inefficientfirms go wall, make effectively possible entrepreneur sell part oftheir businesses.the provision concern abuse dominant position agreement detrimental tocompetition, together control effective freedom enter leave market, make itpossible take fairly relax view merger acquisitions, bear mind inparticularly serious case operation hind competition may prohibit law. it shouldalso note respect party require dispose asset adopt othermeasures like ensure sufficiently competitive conditions. this practice widely follow inthe bank sector: unite state recent mega-mergers wave throughsubject mandatory disposal asset equivalent 5 13 per cent thedeposits acquired.the bank industry still several distinctive features, especially regard take ofdeposits grant loans. one important sink cost relate information contentof customer relationship lend decision based, asset easilymarketable. credit relationship

peculiarity likely act exit barrier, thereby reduce incentiveto enter market potential competition. sometimes authority themselvesencourage merger order remove inefficient bank market without tobe put

instability, even though oligopoly allow profitable. a powerfulstimulus achieve profitability hence congruous capital base efficiency couldclearly detect increase competition domestic bank financial markets.increased competition therefore become key intermediate objective, fulcrum bankof italy’s monetary, exchange rate supervisory policies. without competition, long runthere cannot efficiency; without efficiency, long run cannot stability thebanking financial industry. a consideration, root economic theory uponwhich antitrust legislation based, laisser faire competition samething, former

financial service sector remarksby mr. roger w. ferguson, jr., member board governor u federal reservesystem, college management university massachusetts boston,massachusetts 27/10/98.some observation future financial service sector relatedpublic policy issueslet first thank invitation speak today topicalconference. the future financial service sector hold great interest industryparticipants well bank regulators, give remarkable change affect industry.developments sector affect us.we acutely aware trend toward blur line haveseparated various part financial sector, particularly commercial banking, investmentbanking, insurance. most recently, face prospect formation hugefinancial conglomerates, compose amalgam firm previously operate withinthe roughly define boundary respective industries. in addition, witness asubstantial degree consolidation merger commercial bank otherindustries.i begin remark today discuss historical experience withconglomeration us, underlie condition necessary conglomeration asuccessful business strategy. i offer think regard financial servicessector may look like future. finally, i address issue federalreserve supervisor regulator need consider.there several conclusion i would like highlight. the first themovement financial conglomerate may prove transitory. second, basic financial riskmanagement skill likely remain important determinant company’s viabilityand success. third, even world financial conglomerate room smaller,and nimble, participants. finally, supervisory regulatory structure need toevolve meet new challenges, regulatory authority remain vigilant carryout duties, particularly enforce antitrust laws.ii. will financial service conglomerate successful?the historical context conglomerationthe concept financial conglomerate receive great deal attention atthis time diminish distinction across financial industries. however, thesuccess conglomerate certainly guaranteed, base historical experience. for anillustration, one need look back conglomerate merger movement industrialsector 1960s. large conglomerate firm ltv, gulf western, textron, andlitton industry become conglomerate numerous mergers, herald great fanfarefrom business press. by 1970s, proclamation sound hollow, manyconglomerate firms’ equity pummel corporate structure prove unsuccessful.this period follow decade spin-off conglomerate seek streamlinetheir operation return original area expertise - reversal strategy wasgreeted considerable enthusiasm business press. - 2 -bis review 90/1998much close home, also recall retail financial sector wentthrough phase conglomeration 15 year ago, movement toward “financialsupermarket”. the acquisition coldwell banker dean witter sears, shearson byamerican express, schwab bank america, bache prudential come mind. despitethe enthusiasm financial supermarket early 1980s, end decade theconcept stagnated, press instead report benefit specialization theprovision niche services.i believe past experience business conglomerate u shouldtemper view inevitability today’s financial conglomerates. there clearlychallenges manage much larger, diversify firms, well benefits. this businessstrategy surely financial service firms.business condition necessary financial conglomerate succeedthe difficulty associate operate financial conglomerate suggestedby business condition necessary conglomerate succeed. we heard,of course, potential economy scale scope manage information may allowlarge firm reduce unit cost business. we also aware potential crossmarketing, economy scope supply side allow firm sell multiple product totheir customers, demand side allow consumer conveniently purchase bundle ofservices. since number conglomerate past unable improve uponseparate delivery service - include financial service - unclear whether technological orother change alter nature financial product managerial capability sufficientlyto result significantly improve exploitation scope economies.the potential benefit reduce risk sectoral geographicdiversification another motivation conglomeration. i little doubt many casesthe potential diversification gain exists. however, hear little theexpertise need merge risk management practice previously separate financial firms.while merge risk management practice may straightforward firm consolidate withinan industry, readjustment likely far complex firm originate differentindustries.furthermore, challenge manage merger diverse firm theoperation result conglomerate substantial. the operation financialconglomerate require ability integrate financial activities, research developmentinvestments, price decisions, compensation practices, cost containment activities, culturesof extremely large diverse organization. before step toward conglomeration aretaken, potential participant merger must judge whether extraordinary set ofskills find managerial team.however, raise cautionary flag prospect financialconglomerates, i add various consideration suggest financial conglomerateformat future may successful least firms. from managementperspective, technological development help provide detail information formonitoring various activity firm allow application sophisticate riskmanagement models. past experience conglomeration may also provide new insight formanaging product integration effectively. on demand side, retail customer may bi review 90/1998become receptive one-stop shop range service increase newopportunities access service become available.iii. how might financial service sector evolve?the extraordinary change occur financial sector make projectionsabout sector evolve quite speculative. nevertheless, useful consider thefuture might look industry participant regulator plan meet future. i wouldlike offer prognostication base systematic projection use historicalexperience analogy informal observation current trends.systematic projection consolidationthe commercial bank industry, large single component thefinancial sector, experience massive consolidation since 1980. for example, number ofbanking organization u fell around 12,300 1980 7,200 endof 1997. not surprisingly, percentage bank asset hold top 10 bankingorganizations rise 20 percent 1980 nearly 35 percent 1997, shareheld top 25 increase 33 53 percent. despite large amount ofconsolidation increase bank concentration national level, bank concentrationwithin local market area (msas non-msa counties) has, average, hardly change overthe past decade. for example, average herfindahl-hirschman index (hhi) msasdecreased 1990 1949 1985 1997, non-msa county decreasedfrom 4357 4114 (thrifts excluded). the stability average local market concentration isnoteworthy research suggest competition retail customer take placesubstantially local market level, concentration determinant competition.based trend fact tremendous new opportunity bankmergers create removal restriction interstate bank riegle-neal interstate bank branch efficiency act 1994, i would expect moreconsolidation occur banking. base historical experience, feed economist haveprojected decade 3,000-to-4,000 bank organization remain.importantly, firm would small organizations.in addition commercial banking, financial service sector alsoexperienced movement toward consolidation. insurance company security firm allexperienced merger wave recent years, though extent commercial banking. thismore moderate pace consolidation nonbank financial industry likely due absenceof preexist restriction geographic expansion. like banking, insurance underwrite ischaracterized broad size distribution firms, several large national insurer muchsmaller local technically specialize firms. investment bank heavily concentrated,due great geographic expanse market services, due theconsiderable benefit portfolio diversification. extend current pattern future, wecan expect continuation trend towards consolidation. - 4 -bis review 90/1998informal projection conglomerationas i note earlier, addition continue consolidation bank andelsewhere financial sector, also tendency toward increase conglomeration.given prospect legislation expand product line available banks, i would besurprised wave cross-industry merger within financial sector, particularly among thelargest firms, result formation financial conglomerates.in order consider form financial sector future, i believe isvery important distinguish retail financial service (i.e., household andsmall businesses) wholesale large-scale corporate financial services. the customer basesof two sector differ dramatically, many product used.despite differences, retail wholesale sector move toexpand product offerings. in retail financial services, desire bank expand theirproduct offer response new product develop industry (for example,the emergence annuity insurance industry), well response customers’substitution product (such mutual funds) traditional bank product (such astraditional save accounts).at wholesale firms, witness push security underwrite andthe establishment office throughout world effort respond financial need oflarge corporate customers. because large scale require serve wholesale marketconsisting relatively small number sizable customers, relatively large firm willlikely remain active wholesale portion financial sector. of course, largewholesale institution may operate retail portion well, although latter activity doesnot necessitate extraordinary size firms. in addition, clearly boutique firmsthat achieve enviable result serve one need, say m&a advice, large businesses.the existence retail wholesale institution direct bearingon future financial services. in contrast wholesale institutions, retail financialinstitutions able operate profitably small scale. give continue strong preferenceof many retail customer deal local offices, especially many service depositoryinstitutions, small retail financial institution likely able serve need individualsand small business local markets.such niche player would play important role retail financial sectorcomposed perhaps several thousand relatively small retail financial institutions, muchsmaller number large financial firm offer wholesale products, wholesale andretail products. the large firm offer retail service would likely operate office throughoutthe country. this scenario would unlike observe quite frequently thenonfinancial retail sector. restaurants, department stores, convenience store supermarketsare example locally base market strong presence large national regional firmsoperating alongside large number small local sellers.iv. what do conglomeration consolidation mean federal reserve?now i would like consider issue raise evolution ofthe financial service sector federal reserve. clearly federal reserve must adaptalong industry supervise regulates. bi review 90/1998reducing moral hazard increase market disciplinea key concern, challenge internationally well domesticsupervision, well-known “moral-hazard” problem. moral hazard occur firm takeson great risk prudent, bear full cost adopt riskposition. instead, cost risk bear financial safety net, usbanking system consist access federal deposit insurance, fed’s discount window, andfederal reserve payment system guarantees. while safety net judgment surelyremain firmly place, incentive-compatible policy develop apply shiftmore cost risk-bearing onto firm themselves. such policy would seek increaseand improve role “market discipline” constrain bank risk taking.one widely discuss idea increase market discipline require bank toissue minimum amount subordinate debt non-related parties. the basic idea create aset uninsured bank liability holder risk preference similar banksupervisors, would thus discipline bank risk take similar degree. in addition,changes price bank’s subordinate debt might prove useful signal themarket’s evaluation bank’s financial condition. such signal could perhaps use bysupervisors aid identify problem banks. while policy “mandatory subordinateddebt” without problem implementation difficulties, certainly worthy seriousdiscussion.a second way market discipline could encourage financialreporting transparency guidelines, provide market information necessaryto make inform transactions. this improve information essential market discipline tofunction. great transparency alleviate moral hazard problem inherent toinsured deposits, since fully inform investor may will make deposit bank withan overly risky portfolio, long deposit insured. however, transparency reducethe need type direct regulation uninsured financial activities. if hold offinancial institution apparent market, institution adjust risk positionsoptimally maintain ability attract capital. improve disclosure domestic well asinternational institution would increase information allow investor ass riskthey bear.communicating other regulatorsif financial service sector move direction conglomeration,the federal reserve experience ever great need communication regulator ofdifferent financial industries. regulator bank industry need coordinate withagencies govern security insurance industries. communication insuranceregulators present particular challenge, since u insurance regulate exclusivelyat state level. furthermore, international communication among central bank otherfinancial regulator already essential. this need become great market manyfinancial service continue extend across national borders. indeed, need crisisintervention could reduce preventive measure include ongoing communicationand coordinate improvement supervisory methods.ensuring competition - 6 -bis review 90/1998also important role encourage competition implementation ofthe federal reserve’s bank merger policy. this role particularly important time whenbanking financial sector general experience unprecedented merger movementthat radically restructure industries. before discuss new analysis might becalled upon perform, let emphasize i think must continue extremelyvigilant protect local market competition. applicant remember measureimpacts local market structure consider hhi concentration ratios. transactionssatisfying one measure may satisfy measure. small increase marketshare measure hhi may mask high market share dominant competitor. in thosecases, i would expect mitigate factors, even small increase market share, must beextremely strong gain approval.the task enforce bank merger policy become potentially morechallenging financial conglomeration occurs, since analysis competition rely thecorrect definition relevant geographic product markets. thus, increase number offinancial conglomerate sell traditional retail bank service along insurance andsecurities make analysis competitive effect merger difficult. in addition, itwill remain important distinguish market large-scale wholesale product andmarkets household- small-business-oriented retail bank products. we also need toconsider effect networks, atm point-of-sale networks, form ofelectronic bank competition financial services. finally, financial relationshipsbecome increasingly complex, must work reduce market inertia could lessencompetition restrict customers’ ability choose freely among provider financialservices. domestic competition particularly important increase welfareof fellow citizens, also reforms, base market discipline,probably work best competitive market. also, domestic competition one mostpowerful force give rise international competitiveness.reducing systemic risk improve supervisionfinally, federal reserve must continually improve bank supervisoryprocess order help manage risk could introduce financial system thechanges occur financial sector. the effect consolidation conglomeration onsystemic risk cannot ignored. if risk manage properly within consolidate firm, therepercussions could extend beyond single institution well financial sector. even ifthe moral hazard problem could largely solved, financial firm bear individualcosts risk adopt, firm may fail internalize cost bear entirefinancial system portfolio decision result bad financial outcomes. the risk suchdamage hold check sound supervisory practices.i time quickly mention important effortsthat federal reserve pursue order improve bank supervision. much effort,along bank supervisors, focus improve ability monitor andsupervise risk management practice bank bank organizations. closely relatedwork aim devise capital standard accurately reflect reality today’sbanking world. through all, i would emphasize old-fashioned supervision, core ofwhich on-site examination, remain central supervisory strategy. improve marketdiscipline, increase communication supervisors, enhance stability throughgreater diversification necessary. but improve supervision also critical, sometimesthere simply substitute well-trained highly motivate examiner “on ground.” bi review 90/1998v. conclusionin closing, i would like reemphasize importance basic skill thatremain centrally important financial service sector. regardless extent thenature conglomeration, technological development, new financial instruments, goodfundamental business practice remain essential: credit underwrite risk managementskills, cost control, appropriate price practices. while technological improvement anaid nearly areas, sound management practice allow industry participant totake advantage advance technology. at time, fundamental principle ofsupervision regulation must applied, include sound credit standard on-siteexaminations, ensure safety soundness financial sector. finally, regulatorsshould implement antitrust policy manner ensure competitive price service asthe financial sector evolve consolidates. despite importance vigorous supervision andregulation, i colleague board quite sensitive fact roleto judge wisdom management decision business strategy beyond ensure thatpublic policy standard regard supervision regulation met. i look forward observingand participate sector’s evolution next century. i thank theopportunity discus issue today.
