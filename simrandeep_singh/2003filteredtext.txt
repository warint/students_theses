 bi review 16/2003 1 otmar issing: monetary financial stability - trade-off? speech professor otmar issing, member executive board european central bank, conference “monetary stability, financial stability business cycle”, bank international settlements, basel, 28-29 march 2003. the reference speech find european central bank’s website. * * * the question whether trade-off monetary financial stability one interest area research central bank since many years. researcher bi regular valuable contributor discussion. thus i particularly please opportunity convey idea subject bi basle. problem definition let start define i mean monetary financial stability. monetary stability synonym price stability. price stability refer stable price level low level inflation stable individual prices. there doubt change relative price play crucial beneficial part economic adjustment decision make individual actor company households. part cost inflation relate fact relative price signal blur high rate inflation.1 although issue concern relevant composition measurement price index optimal horizon define price stability, general concept widely accept relatively straightforward handle, conceptually central bank practice. an example explicit definition price stability one choose ecb, refer year-on-year increase harmonise index consumer price euro area 2 percent, maintain medium term.2 the degree clarity cannot claim regard financial stability. a generally accept definition knowledge yet provided. besides fact author find convenient define financial instability instead positive counterpart, clear distinction exist definitions, base system approach those, relate volatility directly observable financial variables. an example former would definition broadly follow mishkin (1991), adapt define financial stability prevalence financial system, able ensure last way, without major disruptions, efficient allocation save investment opportunities.3 how close economy break point, exceed would impair efficient allocation savings, could label degree financial fragility. this definition broad - opinion - intellectually convincing. due focus resilience financial system would classify individual bank failure large swing asset price proof financial instability. to contrary, large swing asset price possibly lead failure monetary financial institution aftermath large real financial shock could even sign stability self-purifying power system,4 long efficient financial intermediation finance process maintained. however, definition contain little practical guidance institution try maintain contribute goal financial stability. other, le conceptually convincing, directly observable definition (and therefore frequently use theoretical work) equate financial stability situation without bank crisis asset price stability, include interest rate smoothness, 1 see gaspar smets (2002) issing (2000). 2 see ecb (1999). 3 a similar definition stress shock resilience payment process dimension financial stability find padoa-schioppa (2002, p. 21). 4 in context one could think schumpeter’s creative destruction reduction moral hazard risks. 2 bi review 16/2003 relative benchmark.5 but definition apparently tangible, suitable benchmark would still found. the difficulty relate definition financial stability reveal problem semantics. the central bank’s role contribute financial stability stake. the definition degree predetermine role subscribe monetary policy contribute goal financial stability anticipate answer trade-off question. for example system-based definition financial stability intuitively reasonably suggest prudential supervision play first violin pursuit financial stability objectives. the reason compare toolbox regulator monetary policy authority (in narrow sense), clear former absolute advantage care system wide stability financial institutions, able define, monitor enforce rule game. the central bank’s tool primarily influence money supply, make price stability natural objective. furthermore, definition illustrate central bank would attempt target asset price such, would monitor obviously regard direct inflationary consequence also view possible systemic effects. focus impact asset price instability rather asset price reduce, although abolish, moral hazard problems. if financial stability instead define as, example, interest rate smoothness, trade-off price stability immediately follow poole’s result face aggregate demand shocks. the central bank would choose degree prefer stabilise one hand interest rate hand output inflation. so question define financial stability non-negligible consequence regard trade-off monetary financial stability. price stability financial stability - conventional view have briefly touch substantive issue definitions, let turn straight away conventional central banker’s view concern trade-off monetary financial stability. the conventional wisdom rather sceptical concern existence trade-off. the reason inflation regard one major factor create financial instability first place. this line view inflation increase likelihood misperceptions future return possibilities. inflation worsen asymmetric information problem lender borrowers. high inflation always relate high inflation volatility, add problem predict real returns. a business cycle boom accompany high inflation traditionally consider typical environment real over-investment asset price bubble blossom. excess liquidity provide central bank one main factor responsible development inappropriately lax lend standards. credit growth, excessive view realistic return expectations, often foundation financial instability. in words, stable price monetary policy focus objective play important role stable financial markets. strong protagonist view even claim price stability almost sufficient condition financial stability.6 others careful simply state price stability tend promote financial stability.7 i think difficult argue basic notion latter. price stability financial stability tend mutually reinforce long run. this widespread view support empirical evidence many financial crisis cause major shift price level.8 moreover, historically bank crisis occur recessions9 often follow period high inflation. this comfort central banker sense likely policy stance maintain price stability also appropriate state financial system. accord conventional view general trade-off monetary financial stability. on hand also know world always straightforward might wish were. we know financial imbalance build even environment stable price - think 5 see e.g. goodfriend (1987) cukierman (1990). 6 schwartz (1995). 7 bordo wheelock (1998). 8 bordo, dueker wheelock (2000). 9 gorton (1988), calomiris gorton (1991). bi review 16/2003 3 example u 1920s 1990s japan late 1980s. thus must aware price stability sufficient condition financial stability. however, concrete definition financial stability important precise link financial stability monetary policy, choice monetary policy strategy implication financial stability. if central bank primary objective maintain price stability medium term, simply pursue inflation target strategy accord inflation forecast one two year horizon might always optimal policy strategy. the overall cost (in term standard central bank loss function mainly future deflation follow financial crisis) might receive appropriate weight limit horizon inflation forecast. truly optimal monetary policy cannot avoid that, times, strain financial system might deviation desire inflation rate short period time accepted, order preserve price stability medium long run.10 the argument implies, course, monetary policy decision actually bear state financial system could margin even decisive prevent crisis allow system recover. a second argument lead conclusion stem risk asymmetries. give fact consequence systemic financial crisis quite substantial, optimal monetary policy might time choose err side caution, order reduce probability crisis small likelihood11. due asymmetry (very low probability large loss) involved, actual inflation likely exceed expect inflation - optimally - quite time. the argumentation use illustrate ecb always stress stability-oriented monetary policy strategy simple inflation forecast targeting, also robust. the reason explicitly focus monetary credit development order form judgement consumer price inflation medium long run, force ecb take sufficiently forward look perspective. for example, borio, english filardo (2003, p. 43) explicitly recognise pre-emptive role first pillar ecb monetary policy strategy. this long perspective highlight risk price stability stem financial imbalances. a important side effect, optimal price stability-oriented policy reaction base monetary credit development likely diminish financial imbalances. the latter claim rest observation positive correlation credit growth bubble developments. policy would tighten time rise loosen time unwind financial imbalances.12 at point worth stress accord previous argument consider financial imbalance - time time - may lead different monetary policy stance fixed-horizon inflation targeting, despite fact objective central bank price stability (defined appropriate medium term horizon). the “new environment” hypothesis interestingly recently suggest conventional wisdom price stability good financial stability reversed. this - least central banker generation - provocative view, present several recent bi research work papers13 also spread academic world.14 very first sign discussion along line find fomc minute november 13, 1996 meeting, week chairman greenspan make famous “irrational exuberance” speech. during fomc meet governor lindsay mention preoccupy think central bank’s success keep inflation control could trigger optimistic outlook future course economic development. peoples’ false sense security could lead asset valuations, could pose problem future. since additional argument forward explain low stable inflation make financial system vulnerable - compliance language use bi research paper i label 10 see kent lowe (1997), brousseau detken (2001). 11 bordo jeanne (2002) argue one think aspect term insurance. 12 see issing (2002). 13 see borio lowe (2002) borio, english filardo (2003). 14 see blind (1999). 4 bi review 16/2003 “new environment” hypothesis following.15 the reason suggest quite time inflationary pressure might show inflation itself, due a) low price power firms, b) positive supply side development c) well anchor low inflation expectations. it argue central banks’ focus (consumer) price stability insufficient financial imbalance would address directly. this direct response could consist two parts. it would first involve try avoid (or least subdue) build process financial imbalance second - former unsuccessful (or insufficient) - smooth adverse consequence imbalance unwound. policy implication i previous occasion already state doubt price stability add list cause trigger financial instability.16 i deny fact financial fragility significant time low inflation. but latter statement low inflation sufficient condition financial stability former low inflation cause financial instability, world apart. here i would like focus two particular aspects, trade-off question respect “new environment” hypothesis relate relevance problem associate identify asset price bubbles.17 in spirit tinbergen central bank one policy instrument, i.e. monetary policy, achieve one independent goal, price stability. an intuitive division labour assign objective financial stability financial regulatory authority, set prudential supervisory framework. this regulatory authority must central bank. in scenario two authority follow one objective each, none authority would subject policy trade-off, number instrument match number objectives. nevertheless reason cannot use exclude conflict situations. in practice central banks’ responsibility concern financial stability vary lot. for example, general financial stability objective derive treaty statute ecb. nevertheless ecb task contribute policy pursue competent authority relate stability financial system [art. 105(5) treaty, art. 3.3 25.1 statute]. in addition promote smooth function payment system [art. 105(2) fourth indent treaty, art. 3.1 22 statute]. give fact long run financial stability support sustainable price stability, difficult deny central bank’s legitimate interest financial stability. thus despite trade-off possible financial stability primary objective central bank, separate allocation objective institution cannot exclude situation short-term conflict, along line describe previous paragraphs. how trade-off discussion relate “new environment” hypothesis? would exist trade-off monetary financial stability? let u assume moment true low stable rate inflation foster asset price bubble reason give above, e.g. due excessively optimistic expectations. if take extreme position, existence trade-off imply achieve le price stability would generate financial stability. due lack evidence inflation general beneficial effect financial stability quite evidence contrary, i regard existence exploitable trade-off highly implausible. and fair, proponent ‘new environment” view far suggest central bank purposely increase inflation inflation volatility. the situation i envisage low inflation could actually conducive financial instability period significant unprecedented disinflation, typically time convergence state high state low inflation. very often simultaneous financial deregulation add new risk well opportunity investment decisions. although high level debt sustainable low interest rates, unusually (and perhaps temporarily) low nominal interest rate might give rise finance risky projects, due inexperience lender borrower low-interest-low-inflation rate environment due fact liquidity constraint automatically eased. but fragility period disinflation transitory adjustment problem would vanish soon economy get accustom new stable environment. 15 see borio, english filardo (2003). 16 issing (2002). 17 see also greenspan (2002). bi review 16/2003 5 furthermore, broader, long term perspective high inflation cause problem. without precede period high inflation, economy would go potentially vulnerable period disinflation adaptation regime low inflation first place. in general, though, “new environment” economy would rather another example short-term conflict near term price stability financial stability - rather exploitable trade-off - could arise. the reason increase interest rate require dampen asset price inflation, prevent over-investment thus reduce risk serious financial crisis, could come along low desire near term inflation. again, short-term conflict would occur financial stability independent general objective central bank, time horizon, primary objective price stability pursue include future - possibly post-crisis - periods. the “new environment” short-term conflict thus one financial imbalance consider important enough possibly constitute long run threat price stability. to mind imply ultimate objective monetary policy price stability. with regard asset price central bank intervention would imply central bank ability detect bubble real time. i often make argument central bank comparative advantage market participant dare judgement.18 it follow react perceive financial imbalance could easily misleading. it remain true one hardly humble enough judge one’s ability estimate equilibrium asset price general. but light recent boom bust phase equity markets, i would tend slightly le pessimistic possibility identify extreme bubble real time. there ample evidence stock market development late 90 large part unrelated fundamentals. of course, information available central bank alone. but due uncertainty relate time bubble burst, often reward market participant follow trend bet it. this view consistent recent literature market efficiency, find return degree predictable, horizon, would exploitable, long sustainable individual market participants. thus central bank might role play provide noisy unbiased opinion equilibrium price public. recently argument forward uncertainty relate identification asset price bubble fundamentally different uncertainty surround variables, central bank base policy decisions. in particular, estimate output gap rely large degree much information need identify stock market bubble, underlie productivity growth equilibrium risk premium.19 more provokingly cechetti et al (2003, p. 440) recently claim “if cannot estimate asset price misalignments, cannot forecast inflation either.” i consider latter view purposely exaggerate dramatic effect. but still probably truth commonly accept central bank circles. i would therefore completely disregard possibility situation financial instability approximately identify relevant time horizon information find way policy decisions.20 there still remain issue level strongly central bank react perceive misalignment asset prices. the strong form target asset price level, consider line fundamentals. this idea reject - correctly -many time before.21 here, i mention moral hazard problem possible indeterminacy inflation policy would foster. a second le interventionist strategy would central bank lean wind asset price changes. here i must say i share concern monetary policy reaction necessary prick bubble midst euphoric bull market, could create immense risk real economy, particular interest sensitive sectors. this even truer, central bank suddenly shift gears, accommodate financial market development extend period time. a third option would central bank avoid accommodate asset price movements, deem move away equilibrium. a 18 see issing (2002) garber (2000). 19 see cechetti, genberg wadhwani (2003). 20 some first step direction provide borio lowe (2002). 21 see e.g. issing (2002). 6 bi review 16/2003 explain above, ecb two pillar strategy would send “warning signal” case forecast consumer price development benign monetary credit aggregate rise strongly. in consider monetary policy action result analysis would least ask cautious approach. finally, fourth option, central bank could choose react mainly mean communication. communicate view asset price consider bind fundamental could lead market participant increase doubt sustainability price developments. an example latter strategy observe period undervaluation euro early millennium.22 ecb representative issue statement euro would potential appreciate. the editorial monthly bulletin march 2000 october 2000 show increase concern divergence fundamental external value euro.23 although estimation equilibrium exchange rate difficult business model parameter uncertainty huge,24 evident time statement correct. again also case guess time trend reversal exact equilibrium level could made. while exchange rate asset price misalignment raise issues, also noteworthy differences. in plausible scenarios, likely impact exchange rate misalignment economic development euro area important asset price misalignments. our knowledge concern impact exchange rate change generally good found understand impact asset price changes. on hand, extreme scenario impact major asset price adjustment could potentially harmful euro area (even large) exchange rate changes. thus analyse likelihood impact asset price “tail events” remain major challenge central bank research. conclusion let conclude. i start discuss define financial stability difficult important. namely, pre-empt answer trade-off question. a system definition financial stability practically exclude trade-off monetary financial stability. it partly promote clear assignment objective authority accord comparative advantage major instrument toolboxes. furthermore, central bank employ medium term horizon definition price stability imply strategy encompass stability-oriented, forward-looking approach, financial imbalance implicitly obtain attention deserve.25 this true even financial stability consider general objective central bank monetary policy aim maintain objective price stability. this rule existence short-term conflict. in case price stability would foster financial stability. in rare circumstance though, short-term conflict possible. with short–term conflict i refer situation optimal deviate desire rate inflation short-run order best maintain price stability medium run. therefore, context appropriate definition price stability financial stability particular appropriate concept horizon policy objective apply, conflict disappears. the “new environment” view central banking, accord low inflation detrimental financial stability, opinion, overturn conventional wisdom general price stability foster financial stability. ironically, could exist trade-off accept time shorter-term deviation desire rate inflation optimal act accordingly one side overall credibility central bank side. if previously describe optimal policy would lead prolong period deviation declare inflation objective, long-term loss inflation fight reputation could outweigh gains. furthermore, systematic central bank response financial instability, expect financial market participants, likely trigger high 22 see gaspar issing (2002) concern role exchange rate monetary policy 23 see ecb monthly bulletin march, april, may, september october 2000. 24 see detken et al. (2002), maeso-fernandez et al. (2002), ecb (2002). 25 see also “the economist, january 18th, 2003, economics focus: still bubbling, p. 66 bi review 16/2003 7 risk taking. a consequence financial system might become safe place, result would high average inflation. accept possibility short-term conflict monetary financial stability must mean moral hazard problem deny forgotten. and finally, last reason caution temporarily deviate declare price stability objective financial stability reason might difficult explain public. in deal latter trade-off, central banker risk-averse regard primary objective, loss inflation fight credibility may weigh heavily. but reputation also stake, central bank perceive underestimate even neglect issue financial instability. thus final conclusion easy choice, surprise result complex world. bi review 16/2003 1 yves mersch: the reform govern council ecb panel statement mr yves mersch, president central bank luxembourg member govern council ecb, central bankers' panel, european bank & financial forum prague, 25 march 2003. * * * lady gentlemen, it pleasure participate european bank financial forum back prague order speak distinguish audience. my brief presentation perhaps directly cover topic "when europe become global superpower" nevertheless closely relate europe power. it deal power, specifically vote power ecb's govern council, reallocate order cope ongoing expansion eu. it also excellent example eu works: decision take vigorous democratic debate, consensus seek whereby interest involve take account. my presentation structure follows: 1. i start briefly describe govern council how, result enlargement, consider necessary reform vote procedure. 2. subsequently, i analyse discussion govern council lead approval dynamic rotation model utilisation composite indicator, make economic financial variable. i also go detail formal ecb recommendation, notably term group composition vote frequency. 3. before concluding, i look reaction institution involve enable clause procedure: council, commission european parliament (ep). 1. the need reform 1.1. the govern council the govern council supreme decision-making power ecb. it comprise member executive board ecb governor national central bank ncbs. the executive board 6 members: president, vice president 4 members. they nominate european procedure, contrary ncb governor appoint national level. the treaty statute assign govern council power take important strategically significant decision eurosystem. it define implement monetary policy euro area. in particular take monetary policy decisions, govern council normally act simple majority vote cast member present person. each member one vote. the principle 'one member, one vote' reflect status member govern council, include governor ncbs eurosystem, appoint personal capacity representative member states. for decision financial matter relate status ncb shareholder capital ecb, vote govern council weight accord ncbs' share subscribe capital ecb. on occasion vote member executive board zero-weighted. at time maastricht treaty, eu count 12 member state arrival 3 new member widely expected.consequently treaty envisage govern council eventually comprise 21 members: 6 executive board member 15 ncb governors. 2 bi review 16/2003 1.2. enlargement 1.2.1. the enable clause treaty nice in order cope eu's current enlargement, treaty nice, become effective february 1 year, call revision decision-making procedure for, composition of, several european institution commission, council, european parliament ecb. indeed, many fear govern council's capacity efficient timely decision-making would hamper membership expand 33 members, namely 6 executive board member and, eventually, 27 ncb governors. a solution therefore imply overall number govern council member vote right would small overall number govern council members. to end, treaty nice contain so-called enable clause which, essence, enable council amend article 10.2 ecb statute recommendation either ecb commission. in case ecb recommendation, procedure also involve consult commission european parliament. it emphasise reform govern council way compare reform institution council. it also remarkable treaty nice include possibility ecb come recommendation reform. it also underline enable clause limit scope. it concern vote right govern council not, example, allow modify composition govern council executive board. similarly, allow restrict membership govern council; form monetary policy committee board. moreover, procedure complex. the ecb recommendation take unanimity, approve unanimously council, meet composition head state government, ratification member state accord respective constitutional requirements. within constraint 3 february 2003, two day nice treaty take effect, ecb adopt unanimously recommendation, i explain discus detail. however, prior so, i would like turn moment expansion eurosystem, order clearly distinguish eu enlargement. 1.2.2. the expansion eurosystem the eurosystem consist ecb ncbs country adopt euro. the time expansion current 12 eventual "steady state" 27 member is, however, highly uncertain. currently three eu country outside euro area. the unite kingdom denmark exemption, sweden statute country derogation. all new member will, upon join eu, automatically statute country derogation, say clear commitment join euro area late stage. accord position publish ecb, adoption euro consider result complex convergence process, rather mere exchange rate measure. hence unilateral euroisation consider unacceptable. the accession country respect converge criterion set maastricht treaty term inflation, public finance interest rates, expect achieve high level real nominal convergence, mean economic structure inflation level converge eu levels. in addition, participate least two year erm ii. 2. the ecb recommendation 2.1. initial discussion initially multitude possible solution analysed. relatively soon, constituency model, capital key inspire vote system double majority system, name principal proposals, abandoned. bi review 16/2003 3 • a constituency model, base regional group like imf world bank, reject felt would violate principle total independence individual ncb governor representative constituency would probably feel oblige defend interest / constituency govern council. this contrary current system, whereby ncb governor vote interest entire euro area heart, rather basis national interests. • a system weight vote which, way, also use bretton wood institutions, contrary "one member, one vote" principle eu treaty. a see earlier, statute escb foresee scenario vote relate shareholdership, i.e. national central banks, issues. in circumstance executive board has, accordingly, zero-weight. • a double majority system, inspire revision vote council decide nice treaty, also rejected. first, council relevant example ecb former intergovernmental body latter supranational institution. second, many member felt would result directoire, dominate large countries. under one version model, proposal first require approval majority govern council, include least 3 6 executive board members. moreover, govern council member would right request verification pre-set gdp level represented. in case representativeness level set example 62%, germany france jointly could block decision. interestingly, shall see later, european parliament, german rapporteur, also make proposal double majority, consist of, first, population second, total size economy financial sector. • the creation monetary board, consist theexecutive board additional members, sometimes suggest press academia, reject incompatible model structure govern council. it violate principle decentralisation, eurosystem based. when large area policy make still national eu, case excessive concentration decision make seem touch political reality. a eu single nation, structure ecb different fed's structure. • an election system could appear appropriate entail many practical difficulty body like govern council. an unrestricted election might fulfil representativeness criterion might lead "market" vote le cooperative atmosphere govern council. impose certain condition safeguard clause concern representativeness, maximum minimum participation though simple theory may well, practice, present many drawbacks. 2.2. dynamic rotation model representativeness in order allay fear decision govern council might take majority necessarily representative euro area's economy, discussion turn system dynamic rotation models, whereby governor allocate different group vary vote right basis define economic criterion. such system would maintain principle equal treatment ncb governor ensure sufficient level representativeness. 2.2.1. fundamental principle a dynamic rotation system consider equitable, efficient acceptable way assign vote right among governors, particularly design rotation system guide handful guide principles: • 'one member, one vote' 'ad personam participation': all member govern council continue attend meet personal independent capacity, "one member, one vote" principle, oppose weight voting, continue apply ncb governor exercise vote right. • representativeness: at moment, ncb governor right vote must, whole, representative euro area. 4 bi review 16/2003 • transparency: the language revise article 10.2 statute reasonably accessible meet requirement primary community law. • consistency. during transition phase, great care take order avoid governor certain ncbs move randomly certain groups. 2.2.2. number composition groups, vote rights, composite indicator representativeness • two-group versus three-group models. a long debate go concern number group composition. three-group model steady state favour outset, although two-group model, consist 15 12 country also considered. in final event, preference give three-group model, allows, roughly speaking, rank country accord whether large, medium small. however, intermediary phase two-group model used. • vote rights. at one stage discuss limit number vote current 18. a consensus eventually reach set number vote 21, (6 executive board 15 ncb governors). it also decide grant 6 executive board permanent vote rights, appoint special european procedure. • representativeness indicator. a ecb economic political body, use population criterion appear inappropriate, even use capital key together gdp, initially use exclusively gdp favoured. however, increasingly find contribution financial sector, ecb steer liquidity interest rates, also take consideration. moreover, financial criterion, contrast gdp population, purely national, reflect effective contribution various central bank eurosystem. it also line experience american federal reserve system reference make relative weight various u states. instead, accord section 2 federal reserve act, criterion base convenience "customary course business". reflect importance financial centres, president new york chicago federal reserve bank enjoy respectively permanent vote right 50% vote right federal open market committee (fomc), 33% vote right virtually feed presidents. several financial indicator monetary aggregate m3, capital credit institutions, bank deposit / loan total aggregate balance sheet monetary financial institution analysed. preference give tabs-mfi conceptual, legal statistical considerations. from conceptual point view, tabs-mfi broad measure size financial sector. a legal definition exist community law statistical framework well establish consistent. • concern relative weight composite indicator, ecb propose official recommendation give gdp weight 5/6 th, relative weight 1/6 th tabs-mfi 2.3. technical element ecb recommendation in recommendation, ecb propose dynamic rotation model which, steady state, 21 vote rights. the executive board 6 permanent vote right 27 governors, allocate three group basis composite gdp-tabs indicator, 15 vote rights. in initial phase, model consist 2 groups. the detail implementation provisions, include possible decision postpone start rotation system avoid situation governor within vote group vote frequency 100%, adopt govern council, act two-thirds majority members, without vote right. the ecb recommend introduce two-group rotation system number euro area member state range 16 21 member states. once number euro area member state exceed 21, rotation system base three group start operating. bi review 16/2003 5 group composition steady state in euro area 27 member states, basis available figure gdp tabs-mfi, first group would consist 5 governor germany, unite kingdom, france, italy spain. ncb governor group would vote frequency 80%. the second group would consist 14 members, namely ncb governor netherlands, belgium, sweden, austria, denmark, poland, finland, greece, portugal, ireland, luxembourg, czech republic, hungary romania. these governor would vote 8 time 14, equivalent vote frequency 57%. the third group would consist remain 8 ncb governor vote frequency 3/8 37,5%. this compare cumulative share composite gdp-tabs indicator le 1 %. in steady state, 3 group ncb governor thus make respectively 5, 14 8 members. this result pragmatic empirical approach, attempted, extent possible, clear separation different groups. thus, first member second group, netherlands, composite indicator 41% inferior indicator last country first group, spain. the correspond figure separation last country second group -romania- first country third group -the slovak republic- even strike 80%. 3. follow ecb recommendation the council unanimously accept ecb's recommendation 21 march, positive opinion european commission non-binding rejection european parliament. the council also confirm model vote modality govern council ecb see precedent eu-institutions. it member state ratify therecommendation accord constitutional procedure. let add that, treaty nice already ratified, seem need national referenda, something facilitate gratification process. it noteworthy, however, commission ep favour comprehensive revision function govern council framework upcoming intergovernmental conference. i analyse position two institution detail. 3.1. the commission's opinion on 19 february, roughly two week ecb make recommendation, commission issue press release indicate that, i quote, "…the propose model constitute step towards secure continue efficiency decision-making within ecb perspective enlargement." the commission also emphasise that, i quote, "…the severe limitation enable clause art.10.6. ecb statutes…more fundamental comprehensive reform ecb's governance structure could envisage basis, achieve wide framework convention upcoming igc." on occasion, commission reiterate also importance attache "population" criterion, matter i deal above. 3.2. the european parliament's opinion the ep reject 11 march ecb's recommendation, notably grind "that widely criticise excessively complex". in short term ep "…reaffirms exist rule whereby central bank governor member state eurozone full unrestricted vote rights, whereby govern council ecb take decision simple majority." in long term, however, ep "…calls adoption solution next intergovernmental conference, consult ep, would distinguish operational decisions, take enlarge executive board nine members, adequately represent 6 bi review 16/2003 euro area economy, strategic general monetary policy decisions, take govern council act double majority, base population member states, total size economy relative size within financial service sector;" the essential point ep consist therefore of: • maintain statu quo short term, mean ncb governor vote; • request intergovernmental conference create enlarge executive board nine members. such enlarge board may well turn similar monetary board academic journalist mind; • most interestingly, ep accept use composite indicator, base partly financial criterion. 4. conclusion please let finish presentation conclude remarks. one fellow countrymen, member european parliament, state recent debate institution, le 2 week ago, debate enable clause seem result fact large country suffer gulliver syndrome: fear bind tie lilliputian outnumber and, definition, act irresponsible manner. interestingly, mep remind parliament blockage european integration originate large, rather small nations. similarly, small nation one abide punctiliously growth stability pact. nevertheless, fear seem exist among large member state small one might impose lax monetary policy, even though generally accept ncb governor vote govern council ad personam basis interest entire euro area. to mep, whole debate enable clause seem therefore somewhat artificial take unnecessary time pressure. all two week ago meantime council approve enable clause. particularly important heartening, eyes, fact handful guide principle ecb consider particular relevance respect 'one member, one vote', ad personam participation, representativeness transparency. moreover, ecb recommendation manage avoid several perilous pitfalls: • a i mentioned, 'one member, one vote' principle maintained, even though governor vote time. however, whenever entitle vote, vote governor carry weight important element fairness large small countries. • there re-nationalisation monetary policy, would case govern council move system imf-style regional constituencies. • similarly, fact governor member govern council permanent vote right, subject rotation scheme, another important element fairness large small countries. • finally, steady state, 4 new member country expect become member second group many remain country gradually move third second group real convergence, "catching up" plain english, progresses. in respect, ecb proposal also strike fair balance current new members, important point i wish emphasise prague. bi review 16/2003 1 the rt hon sir edward george: a brief review economic financial development uk speech the rt hon sir edward george, governor bank england, finance lease association annual dinner, london, 24 march 2003. * * * mr chairman, lords, lady gentlemen, i must confess i surprise i discover seven year since i last speak finance lease association annual dinner. i'm delight evening. on early occasion - 1996 - i emphasise corrosive debilitate effect high variable inflation experience country much previous 50 years. i stress damage do economy - pervasive uncertainty unpredictability, short-termism induced, personal business well financial behaviour, incentive borrow spend rather save invest, mask real price signal guide efficient resource allocation, masking, too, productive inefficiency easily cover generally rise price earnings. but i suggest tide already finally begin turn. i draw attention grow constituency support stability country - necessary condition sustainable growth - particularly bitter experience boom bust late 1980's early 1990's. i able point precede four year - inflation average 3¼%, compare almost 10% previous 20 years. i able, too, point sixteen consecutive quarter positive economic growth. and i able point continuing, relatively steady fall unemployment peak - term claimant count measure - almost 10% 1993. then i hold prospect continue stability - low inflation sustain economic growth - far ahead i could see. you believe word it! you listen - courteously, i would expect member professional association - listen good deal scepticism, which, i confess, i could perfectly well understand. a i leave evening, one member say "i hope right, eddie, we've hear before. we'll believe see it!" i suspect speak rest you. well, tonight i tell inflation - government's target measure - average 2.5% past 10 years. we 42 consecutive quarter positive economic growth - much long period continuous growth since quarterly data become available 1955. and unemployment continue decline fairly steadily 3% - low rate quarter century. now get wrong. i'm moment suggest finally reach promise land. i'm well aware many people country - doubt include many tonight - economic life still pretty tough. my post bag never let's forget that! for time since i last speak particular confront difficult international economic financial environment. this begin asia crisis. but follow couple year late sharp economic slowdown, mild recession, major industrial countries. and accompany sustain fall global equity market "irrationally exuberant" peak - aggravate protract threat terrorism follow 9/11 corporate governance account failure unite states. most recently, course, uncertainty surround possibility war iraq weigh heavily sentiment. all this, together persistent weakness - relatively recently - euro exchange rate, make condition intensely difficult internationally-exposed business uk, include much manufacture sector; that, turn, reflect weak net external demand also decline business investment country elsewhere industrial world. 2 bi review 16/2003 it's make life pretty difficult, too, i say u involve macro-economic management! macro-economic policy - that's say monetary policy overall fiscal policy take together - operates, directly, demand side economy, aim essentially keep aggregate - external domestic - demand grow broadly line underlie supply-side capacity economy meet demand. stable, low, inflation fact essentially measure far successful that. there little, quite frankly, either bank, monetary policy, chancellor could influence international environment. the problem originate abroad could avoid effects. what could - try - seek offset effects, compensate external weakness, stimulate domestic demand uk. give weak business confidence, mean essentially, case monetary policy, encourage growth consumer demand - cut interest rate low level 40 years. in event manage - - avoid recession winter 2001/2002 cost grow imbalance within economy domestic external demand one hand and, domestically, consumption investment other. essentially take view unbalance growth good growth - option had. this "two speed" economy has, i know, reflect pattern activity fla members, consumer finance volume grow strongly recent year business volume relatively flat. in past year alone new business write consumer nearly three time write business customers. now clearly imbalance can't go increasingly indefinitely. the build-up household debt relate strong rise house price saw last year particular must begin moderate point. so much recent debate whether eventual adjustment occur gradually, within context continue overall expansion, abruptly case overall expansion could prove difficult sustain. on macro-economic data seem clear global economy fact bottom around year ago, since see begin recovery, notably us, much rest world currently depends. and also clear monetary policy generally - country also fiscal policy - remain supportive. on view, give recent moderate decline sterling's effective exchange rate, reasonable look forward gradual improvement - i emphasise gradual improvement - external environment would clearly helpful uk perspective. i deny downside risk scenario. the eurozone example recently put back project expansion late year. and financial markets, business consumer sentiment, recently severely affect uncertainty iraq - though financial markets, certainly, war started, factor rapid conclusion. i hope prove right - purely economic reasons. notwithstanding risks, i still think likely outcome see gradual pick-up pace global recovery next year two - view share monetary policy committee february inflation report economic commentators. on basis would also expect see gradual recovery domestic business investment go year next. and, fiscal prudence clearly important stability efficiency economy medium term, chancellor's project increase public spend view positively welcome immediate situation confront us. take together, development accommodate moderation rate growth consumer spending, anticipate may begin see. in meantime see rise rate inflation - 3% target measure - drive notably last year's sharp rise house price rise oil price run invasion iraq. and may well rise somewhat further, example, result prospective rise council tax somewhat weak exchange rate. but influence stage seem likely largely one-off effect level retail prices, rather persistent influence rate inflation. there significant evidence point continuing, second-round, effects, bi review 16/2003 3 example labour market, inflation seem likely fall back 2½% target rate course next year. on basis - although mpc course monitor inflation prospect carefully - conclude recent meet policy remain hold. mr chairman, see i mean i say early yet reach promise land! we fact go difficult patch, remain heavily dependent upon development abroad beyond control. certainly face risk uncertainty short term. but important exaggerate risk allow cloud judgement. the likely outcome view - look ahead next couple year - reflect inflation report - inflation close target growth close trend - imbalance within economy begin adjust. in event i totally confident mervyn king, successor july, deputies, andrew large rachel lomax, mpc, ready adjust policy either direction prospect changes, totally commit i maintain stability hit government's inflation target, necessary condition sustainable growth. that provide best possible context continue development business, important contribution make economy. i, myself, course, look new lease life retirement! i'm aware lease product actually provide. give age population perhaps develop one - though good careful market it! in event i wish well. bi review 15/2003 1 william l rutledge: implement new basel accord speech mr william l rutledge, executive vice president federal reserve bank new york, the british banker’s association basel 2 / cad 3 half day conference, london, uk, 13 march 2003. * * * introduction thank good morning. it great pleasure today offer think basel implementation issue - think reflect partly role head bank supervision federal reserve bank new york, partly role member basel committee. in latter capacity, i’d like begin offer thank extremely helpful constructive comment bba provide throughout basel consultative process. in experience, candid dialogue industry supervisory community best way develop well inform regulatory policy. give desire basel ii consistent best exist emerge risk measurement management practices, get specific feedback industry particularly critical. it also critical understand calibration issue set appropriate numerical standards; connection, i’d like offer thank bank represent participate late quantitative impact survey. i know gather necessary data provide prescribe format daunt task. just know task - analyze result exercise data nearly 50 country 250 institution - quite challenge well. i expect patricia jackson bank england, lead effort, comment qi result late today. in remarks, sir andrew share observation objective new basel accord. my focus expect achieve goals, address various challenge lie ahead implement new accord. first, i offer broad observation implementation issues, include think challenge apply across jurisdictions. then, i get specific detail preparation bank supervisor make implement new framework. i draw unite states’ experience highlight kind preparation need generally. implementation new accord overview a know, basel committee quite close finalize new capital framework number year work. issuance next consultative paper tremendously important step get new approach place. but step taken, critical action must occur - particular rulemaking processes, preparation supervisor industry new accord. with respect former, country set countries, process establish specific rule must occur ensure local issue address appropriate manner. in unite states, eu, process formal one. while national rulemaking go on, bank supervisor around world also need think practical implication surround implementation. to sure, implementation new accord require substantial resource commitment part bank supervisors. however, i think important emphasize effort bank need undertake comply basel ii build, significant extent, good work many large well-managed bank already train improve risk management measurement approaches. for example, many bank time devote increase attention track loan performance, sophisticate assessment loan quality. further, bank analyze managerial process - make sure right system check balances, appropriate use independent expert would gain overly favorable assessments. time effort also invest develop rich meaningful data past, likely future, credit performance - data need fuel management information 2 bi review 15/2003 control system senior management use. i expect much cost bank adopt advance approach basel ii come push ahead precisely type initiatives. this minimize cost involve come full basel compliance, rather emphasize extent bank risk management supervisory capital requirement share common objective pursuit benefit sir andrew described. those benefit - individual bank financial service sector generally - real valuable. we know well cost society bank weakness failures. a large bank continue grow, prosper pursue new opportunities, must simultaneously make investment require understand manage exist risk fully, address new risk appropriately. likewise, new framework provide supervisor opportunity incentive enhance ability identify respond risk bank supervise. i discus challenge individual supervisor moment, let offer think challenge supervisor collaborate effectively one another. more effective collaboration course key reason establishment basel committee. the committee provide excellent forum open constructive dialogue among bank supervisors. this spirit communication crucial ever new framework adopt across national jurisdictions. it clearly important new accord implement consistent manner across various jurisdictions. market competition drive bank’s strengths, rather difference country’s rules. accordingly, basel committee establish accord implementation group. a know, group responsible promote consistency quality implementation new accord facilitate exchange information among national supervisor bank supervisory practices. through implementation group senior line supervisor begin share among practical insight ass internal risk management processes. we think detail share information among people front line supervision go long way ensure assessment do consistent fashion across jurisdictions. we appreciate strong endorsement bba liba offer welcome formation accord implementation group. indeed, know association keenly interest group may well help ensure single bank organization active many jurisdiction face divergent set expectation different bank supervisor new accord. i please note accord implementation group take concern among first topic discussion. an important goal coordination information share help ensure national supervisors, assess eligibility internationally active bank’s internal rat system, arrive different conclusions. prepare new accord let get detail bank supervisor need prepare accord, describe unite states. i sure experience parallel uk elsewhere. challenge bank to begin with, look get arm around major firm actually stand prepare basel ii, pinpoint major challenge lie ahead look towards implement advance approach credit operational risk. importantly, dialogue bank focus stand meet minimum standard entry to, on-going use of, irb approach. our strong sense bank desire commitment continue develop internal rat system manner consistent requirement irb framework. the discussion industry have, however, highlight various area bank may need expand effort prepare implementation. i offer comment four area work needed: a. design structure rat systems; b. necessary control ensure rat accurate date; bi review 15/2003 3 c. availability quality credit data; and, finally d. overall corporate governance approach a. rat system design the first area concern design risk rat system, is, course, central ensure effectiveness irb approach. the basel committee belief banks’ internal rat system accurately consistently differentiate degree risk. the minimum irb standard area build strong risk management practice observe industry. to illustrate point, many organization either already have, process develop rat system capture risk borrower default, well transaction-specific factor shed light amount loss would arise default occurs. in words, banks’ system orient capture several essential component estimate credit risk irb approach. credit risk rat system clearly improve various dimensions, include finely seek distinguish differ degree borrower risk. to so, bank typically look expand number rat category slot exposures. however, establish rat category enough. the challenge bank define clearly objectively criterion rat category order provide meaningful assessment individual credit exposure and, ultimately, overall risk profile. the clarity transparency rat criterion critical ensure rat assign discipline reliable manner. b. control rat system of course, rat system useless without necessary system check balances, control structure, second area i discus need banks’ attention. bank must proper control place ensure rat system perform intended, rat accurate - is, "5" rat really "5" "7" really "7." there least three major structural element necessary good rat system control structure: • the first independence process assign ratings; people assign rat (and even approve loans) independent market department revenue producers. • a second check subsequent review rat independent review group. this group charge review rat fact - is, origination - accuracy, timeliness consistency. moreover, rat system individual rat subject review internal audit department. • a third final critical element transparency rat process. here, would expect rat criterion objective, bank place policy procedure clearly document rationale rat category. the transparent process is, easy third party audit rat form replication analysis. these three element - independence rat process, internal review ratings, transparency - contribute toward strong control rat process. such control risk rat process must complement collection good data base ratings, third area focus banks. c. data requirement validation clearly, system good input go it. accordingly, bank use irb approach need able measure key statistical driver credit risk. i would emphasize basel committee clearly recognize one way accomplish purpose. the minimum basel standard provide bank flexibility rely data derive experience, external sources, long bank demonstrate relevance external data exposures. regardless source, high quality data critical formulate meaningful internal risk assessments. from broad risk management perspective, access 4 bi review 15/2003 data enable bank evaluate performance internal rat risk estimation system consistent meaningful manner. the basel standard outline data history bank need order use irb approach. the committee recognize bank may currently require information hand. for reason continue engage market participant dialogue issue. a implementation new accord approaches, encourage bank consider data need seriously comprehend fully technique need use derive appropriate estimate loss base data. in practical terms, bank expect place - actively develop - data "warehouse". by data warehouse, i mean process enable bank collect, store, draw upon loss statistic efficient manner time. d. corporate governance the design, controls, data figure risk rat system must develop within framework good overall corporate governance, fourth area focus bank i’ll mention today. the involvement senior management director critical successful implementation new accord. this particularly true bank seek adopt advance approach calculate regulatory capital. a bank’s capital requirement draw increasingly firm-specific performance systems, need board director senior management gain deep understand conceptual underpinnings, even operational mechanics, bank’s internal rat system measure risk derive them. senior management, and, significant extent, board directors, good understand various key element organization’s rat process - design rat system, method assign review ratings, process develop use necessary data, approach develop reliable quantitative estimates, ultimately consistency system basel standards. understand various element important assess appropriateness reliability measure credit risk develop - measure turn need senior management board make inform strategic decisions. operational risk another area basel committee develop new regulatory capital approach. in area, credit risk, committee attempt build banks’ rapidly develop internal assessment techniques, seek provide incentive bank improve techniques, broadly, management risk, time. this particularly true advance measurement approach operational risk, ama. under ama, bank would able use internal methodology ass exposure operational risk - subject series qualitative quantitative supervisory parameter intend ensure approach use comprehensive implement integrity. moreover, ama intend sufficiently flexible accommodate rapid evolution operational risk management practice expect see come years. the primary criterion ama could summarize fall three broad areas: first, development strong corporate operational risk governance management structure - structure include business line integration firm-wide process; second, incorporation qualitative factor control self-assessments overall capital measurement process; finally, loss data quantification, include scenario analysis. our review major u.s. bank intend adopt ama indicate clearly various stage preparation. however, institution already place, well along towards establishing, corporate level operational risk management function, firm-wide policy manage assess risk. moreover, many firm already place good, improving, firm-wide control self-assessment methodologies. finally, increase number bank turn attention collect internal loss data consistent manner across firm. some already collect data year two particularly effective mine exist historical loss experience certain risk types. a lead institution make real progress pull together - pilot operational risk quantification methodology combine quantitative qualitative element ama overall economic capital assessment operational risk. bi review 15/2003 5 while much work still do many institutions, bank obtain senior management buy-in embark approach able move ahead fairly rapidly. in addition, institution find significant value process roll framework. the benefit include great risk transparency within firm, great cost efficiency, ultimately, le exposure large losses, term dollar additional reputational knock-on effects. challenge supervisor i've focus challenge bank confront implement new accord. let spend moment discuss supervisory approach also likely evolve time. naturally, allow bank rely internal model determine capital requirement led, continue lead, change supervisory process. fortunately, experience draw. in 1996, "market risk amendment" original basel accord, qualify bank large market risk position first permit incorporate internal estimate associate risk regulatory capital requirements. when determine whether bank may rely market risk model capital purposes, examiner evaluate technical underpinnings model, well risk management control process surround implementation use. they review issue whether model base reasonable assumptions, whether firm make appropriate use backtesting, model perform normal stress market conditions. in addition, spend significant time key control relate overall use models, include model validation process new product approval process. likewise, bank rely increasingly assessment credit operational risk determine capital needs, examiner become well-versed change technical aspect models. some conventional, static metric use - example, credit risk side, judge asset quality ass adequacy credit loss reserve - likely supplant sophisticate quantitative measures. a case credit risk, process develop integrate framework assess adequacy banks’ operational risk management measurement approaches. we focus heavily bank manage operational risk corporate-wide perspective. we begin develop feel "tone top" - is, board directors’ senior management’s commitment effectively manage operational risk. then ass whether commitment translate effective operational risk management control structure - include quality management reporting, degree integration operational risk bank’s overall risk management approach. our analysis include banks’ assessment economic capital requirement operational risk, capital allocate business line reinforce effort improve internal controls. with respect specific business lines, increasingly look drill test key controls. the aim ensure internal process place fact work effective mitigate relevant risks. without question, important devote necessary supervisory resource - term skilled personnel, technical training, target strategy - new supervisory efforts. in regard, basel committee anticipate provide much assistance, formally informally, supervisory agency around world prepare add responsibility assume new accord come force. moreover, i please note financial stability institute (or fsi) continue collaboration basel committee, especially assist supervisor globally understand implement aspect revise accord. the fsi anticipate half 50 seminar program year concentrate component basel ii. in fact, shortly release final consultative package late spring, fsi intend offer three special seminar around world introduce supervisor important feature new framework. 6 bi review 15/2003 next step finalize new accord most remark today center implementation new framework. i’d like conclude spend moment discuss process finalize new accord. a i mentioned, committee finish gather data industry third impact study. the aim study collect analyze information bank worldwide regard capital impact new proposal exist portfolios. the result review help u determine whether adjustment need prior release final consultative package. that final consultative paper issue early may. our goal continue final accord agree fourth quarter year. in closing, i want emphasize effective supervision modern bank organization necessarily entail close cooperative partnership industry participant official supervisors. the industry’s participation formulation risk-sensitive capital adequacy framework good example kind constructive interaction. indeed, three pillar propose framework reflect understand regulatory requirement alone long sufficient address grow complexity banks’ activity associate risks. consistent notion need effective corporate governance, play increasingly important role rapidly evolve bank environment. it clear industry supervisor work together - meet responsibility reinforce - able successfully manage supervise modern financial system. while perspective may differ time time, objective - maintain strong vibrant financial system long term. thank much. bi review 15/2003 1 ben s bernanke: a perspective inflation target speech mr ben s bernanke, member board governor u federal reserve system, annual washington policy conference national association business economists, washington, dc, 25 march 2003.the reference speech find website board governor u federal reserve system. * * * one interest development central bank past dozen year increasingly widespread adoption monetary policy framework know inflation targeting. the approach evolve gradually early monetary policy strategy follow demise bretton wood fixed-exchange-rate system--most directly, i believe, practice germany's bundesbank swiss national bank latter part 1970s 1980s. for example, bundesbank, though conduct short-term policy reference target money supply growth, derive target year calculate rate money growth estimate consistent bank's long-run desire rate inflation, normally 2 percent per year. hence, bundesbank indirectly target inflation, use money growth quantitative indicator aid calibration policy. notably, evidence suggest that, conflict arise money growth target inflation targets, bundesbank generally choose give great weight inflation target (bernanke mihov, 1997).1 the inflation-targeting approach become explicit strategy adopt early 1990s number pioneer central banks, among reserve bank new zealand, bank canada, bank england, sweden's riksbank, reserve bank australia. over past decade, variant inflation target proliferated, newly industrialize emerging-market economy (brazil, chile, israel, korea, mexico, south africa, philippines, thailand, among others) among enthusiastic initiates. most recently, policy framework also adopt several transition economies, notably czech republic, hungary, poland.2 central bank switch inflation target generally please result obtained. the strong evidence score that, thus far least, none several dozen adopter inflation target abandon approach.3 a academic interest monetary policy, several year ago i become intrigue inflation target go co-author book several piece approach.4 a i continue follow development area, i must say, however, discussion inflation target american medium remind way american deal metric system--they really know is, think foreign, impenetrable, possibly slightly subversive. so, hope cut fog, today i offer own, perhaps somewhat idiosyncratic, view inflation target potential benefits, least i consider best-practice form.5 i also try dispel i feel misconception inflation target gain currency. finally, i end words, one modest suggestion, implication experience inflation target practice monetary policymaking federal reserve.6 my main objective today, however, clarify, 1 the interpretation bundesbank proto-inflation targeter universally accepted. certainly, bundesbank put emphasis communication transparency modern inflation-targeting central bank do. 2 mishkin jonas (forthcoming) describe experience three transition economy inflation targets. 3 a country use inflation target transition european monetary union partial exception. the european central bank inflation objective (a ceiling 2 percent) refer inflation-targeting central bank, largely grind (officially, least) also put weight money growth policy decisions. a newly create central bank preside monetary union, ecb unique fundamental way well; hence, lesson ecb experience federal reserve establish central bank may somewhat limited. 4 see particular bernanke mishkin (1997) bernanke, laubach, mishkin, posen (1999). 5 by focus i call “best practice” inflation targeting, i must necessarily somewhat subjective; goal today largely normative, descriptive. 6 for detail exposition case inflation target unite states, see goodfriend (forthcoming). 2 bi review 15/2003 advocate. of course, comment today reflect view necessarily reflect colleague federal reserve board federal open market committee. best-practice inflation targeting: one view although inflation target number distinguish features--the announcement quantitative target inflation obvious--capturing essence approach entirely straightforward. the central bank call inflation targeters, well economy represent, diverse group indeed, (not surprisingly) institutional operational feature differ. moreover, many central bank formally adopt framework inflation target clearly influence approach (or, prefer, idea trend influence inflation-targeters non-inflation-targeters). for example, past twenty years, federal reserve, though reject inflation-targeting label, greatly increase credibility maintain low stable inflation, become proactive head inflationary pressures, work hard improve transparency policymaking process--all hallmark inflation-targeting approach. in short, draw bright line central bank practice full-fledged inflation target firmly outside inflation-targeting camp difficult one might first guess--a fact, way, substantially complicate economists' attempt ass empirically effect approach. nevertheless, expository purposes, i find useful break inflation target approach two components: (1) particular framework make policy choices, (2) strategy communicate context rationale policy choice broad public. let's call two component inflation target policy framework communication strategy, short. the policy framework inflation target by policy framework i mean principle policy committee decide set policy instrument, typically short-term interest rate. in early speech, i refer policy framework describe i consider best-practice inflation target constrain discretion.7 constrain discretion attempt strike balance inflexibility strict policy rule potential lack discipline structure inherent unfettered policymaker discretion. under constrain discretion, central bank free best stabilize output employment face short-run disturbances, appropriate caution bear imperfect knowledge economy effect policy (this "discretion" part constrain discretion). however, crucial proviso that, conduct stabilization policy, central bank must also maintain strong commitment keep inflation--and, hence, public expectation inflation--firmly control (the "constrained" part constrain discretion). because monetary policy influence inflation lag, keep inflation control may require central bank anticipate future movement inflation move preemptively. hence constrain discretion inherently forward-looking policy approach. although constrain discretion acknowledge crucial role monetary policy play stabilize real economy, policy framework place heavy weight proposition maintenance low stable inflation key element--perhaps i say key element--of successful monetary policy. the rationale emphasis go well beyond direct benefit price stability economic efficiency growth, important are. the maintenance price stability--and equally important, development central bank strong reputation commitment it--also serf anchor private sector's expectation future inflation. well-anchored inflation expectation (by i mean public continue expect low stable inflation even actual inflation temporarily deviate expect level) make price stability much easy achieve long term also increase central bank's ability stabilize output employment short run. short-run stabilization output employment effective inflation expectation well anchor central bank need worry that, example, policy ease lead counterproductively rise inflation inflation expectation rather strong real activity. 7 bernanke (2003). bi review 15/2003 3 in early speech, i give great inflation 1970s unite state example happen inflation expectation well anchored. contrary belief long-run tradeoff inflation unemployment hold many economist 1960s, unemployment inflation 1970s high unstable. even today conventional wisdom ascribe unexpected outcome oil price shock 1970s. though increase oil price certainly adverse factors, poor monetary policy second half 1960s 1970s facilitate rise oil price substantially exacerbate effect economy. monetary policy contribute oil price increase first place create inflationary environment excess nominal demand exist wide range good services. for example, important paper, barsky kilian (2001) note price many industrial commodity raw material rise 1970s time oil prices, reflect broad-based inflationary pressures. without general inflationary pressures, unlikely oil producer would able make large increase oil price "stick" length time. besides help make oil price increase possible, legacy poor monetary policy also exacerbate effect oil price increase output employment. when oil price shock hit, begin 1973, inflation expectation already become unstable, several year increase inflationary pressure fail program price control president nixon. because inflation expectation long anchored, widely publicize oil price increase rapidly transmit expectation high general inflation and, hence, high wage demand cost pressures. face unprecedented inflationary surge, feed force tighten policy. a turn out, fed's tighten enough contain inflationary surge sufficient generate severe recession. the upshot deep 1973-75 recession cause part increase oil price per se. an equally important source recession several year overexpansionary monetary policy squander fed's credibility regard inflation, ultimate result economic impact oil producers' action significantly large be. instability price real economy continue rest decade, feed chairman paul volcker re-established fed's credibility painful disinflationary episode 1980-82. this latter episode enormous cost also chalk failure keep inflation inflation expectation low stable. in contrast 1970s, fluctuation oil price far small effect inflation output unite state industrialize country since early 1980s. in part moderate effect reflect increase energy efficiency structural changes, i believe dominant reason use constrain discretion make monetary policy lead good anchor inflation expectation great majority industrial countries. because inflation expectation firmly tie down, surge decline energy price significantly affect core inflation thus force policy response inflation extent three decade ago. indeed, rather lead tighten monetary policy, increase oil price today likely promote consideration increase policy ease--a direct important benefit improve control inflation. the communication strategy inflation target the second major element best-practice inflation target (in view) communication strategy, central bank's regular procedure communicate political authorities, financial markets, general public. in general, central bank's communication strategy, closely link idea transparency, many aspect many motivations.8 aspect communication particularly emphasize inflation-targeting central bank public announcement policy objective (notably, objective inflation), open discussion bank's policy framework (including cases, all, timeframe achieve inflation 8 in countries, improve transparency accompany great central bank independence, argument independent central bank must also provide enhance accountability. 4 bi review 15/2003 objective), public release central bank's forecast evaluation economy (as reported, example, inflation report issue number inflation-targeting central banks).9 why inflation-targeting central bank emphasize communication, particularly communication policy objectives, policy framework, economic forecasts? in 1960s, many economist greatly interest adapt sophisticate mathematical technique develop engineer control missile rocket problem control economy. at time, adaptation so-called stochastic optimal control method economic policymaking seem natural; like ballistic missile, economy may view complicate dynamic system must keep course, despite continuous buffet unpredictable forces. unfortunately, macroeconomic policy turn rocket science! the problem lay crucial difference missile economy--which that, unlike people make economy, component missile try understand anticipate force apply them. hence, although give propulsive force always same, predictable effect ballistic missile, give policy action--say, 25-basis-point cut federal fund rate--can different effect economy, depend (for example) private sector infer action likely future policy actions, information may induce policymaker act, policymaker's objective take action, on. thus, take "right" policy action--in case, change federal fund rate right amount right time--is necessary sufficient condition get desire economic response. most inflation-targeting central bank find effective communication policy useful way, effect, make private sector partner policymaking process. to extent explain general approach, clarify plan objectives, provide assessment likely evolution economy, central bank able reduce uncertainty, focus stabilize private-sector expectations, and--with intelligence, luck, persistence--develop public support approach policymaking. of course, often point out, action speak loud words; declaration central bank modest diminish value clear, coherent, and--most important--credible, sense consistently back action. but agree word must consistently back action say word value. in extreme, i suppose central bank could run "marcel marceau" monetary policy, allow action convey intend meaning. but common sense suggest best option combine action words--to take clear, purposeful, appropriately time policy action support coherent explanation helpful guidance future. one objection raise public announcement policy objectives, economic forecasts, (implicit explicit) policy plan central bank even relatively modest commitment along line may limit flexibility choose best policy future. isn't always good rather le flexible? shouldn't consider judgment experience policymakers always trump rules, even relatively flexible ones, set policy? i agree human judgment always ultimate source policy decision central bank should--or even able to--commit irrevocably advance action may turn highly undesirable. however, intuition flexibility always good le flexibility quite fallacious, point understand long ago homer, tell ulysses tie mast fall victim song sirens. more recently, notion flexibility always preferable pretty well gutted modern game theory (not mention modern monetary economics), show many context ability commit advance often yield good outcomes. for illustration potential benefit policymakers even modest self-imposed restriction flexibility, consider fiscal policy, share monetary policy issue arise group shift membership make series policy decision short-run long-run implications. in short run, fiscal policymakers may important legitimate reason 9 i refer feature communication rather rule simply make public element policy framework, is, constrain discretion. even inflation target set outside central bank outside agency cooperation central bank, part inflation-targeting central bank rather outsider (such legislature) principal enforcer target procedures. “self-enforced” inflation target case i consider here. bi review 15/2003 5 depart budget balance, sometimes even substantially--for example, appropriate fund deal national emergency provide stimulus package assist economic recovery. in long run, however, maintain public confidence require fiscal policy conduct way ratio national debt gdp remain stable moderate level. arguably, public confidence, hence ability policymakers use fiscal instrument aggressively address short-term concerns, enhance whatever legislative rules, guidelines, procedure exist that--however gently firmly--tend compel policymakers bring budget back toward balance, debt-gdp ratio back toward stability, crisis passed. true, spend caps, comprehensive budget resolutions, mandatory long-term deficit projections, similar provisions, extent effective, may reduce least bite flexibility fiscal policymakers. but intentionally yield bite flexibility increase public confidence long-run sustainability government's spend tax plans, fiscal policymakers may find adopt rule actually enhance ability act effectively short run. a fiscal policy, public belief monetary policy perform long run affect effectiveness monetary policy short run. suppose, example, central bank want stimulate weak economy cut policy interest rate. the effect real activity strong public confident central bank's unshakable commitment price stability, confidence moderate tendency wages, prices, long-term interest rate rise today anticipation possible future inflationary pressure generate current ease policy. now central bank's reputation credibility may entirely sufficient additional framework guideline needed. certainly, general, great inherit credibility central bank, le restrictive need guidelines, targets, like form central bank's communication strategy. but credibility permanent characteristic central bank; must continuously earned. moreover, explicit policy framework broad advantages, include among others increase buy-in politician public, increase accountability, reduce uncertainty, great intellectual clarity. hence, though central bank strong credibility may wish adopt relatively loose indicative set guideline communication public, even bank may benefit increase communication public add bite structure approach make policy. from public's perspective, central bank's commitment policy framework, include long-run inflation target, impose kind discipline accountability central bank long-term commitment fiscal stability place fiscal authorities. misconception inflation target i would like turn now, briefly, comment key misconception inflation target gain currency public debate. misconception #1: inflation target involve mechanical, rule-like policymaking. a rick mishkin i emphasize early expository article (bernanke mishkin, 1997), inflation target policy framework, rule. if coherent purposeful, policy make within sort conceptual framework; question degree framework explicit. inflation target provide one particular coherent framework think monetary policy choice which, importantly, let public conversation. if framework succeed goal anchor inflation expectations, may also make policymaker's ultimate task easier. but make monetary policy inflation target require much insight judgment policy framework; indeed, inflation target particularly demand require policymakers give careful, fact-based, analytical explanation action public. misconception #2: inflation target focus exclusively control inflation ignore output employment objectives. several author make distinction so-called "strict" inflation targeting, objective central bank price stability, "flexible" inflation targeting, allow attention output employment well. in early day inflation targeting, distinction may useful one, number inflation-targeting central bank talk language strict inflation target one two come close actually practice it. for quite year now, however, strict inflation target without significant practical relevance. in particular, i aware real-world central bank (the language mandate notwithstanding) treat stabilization employment output important policy 6 bi review 15/2003 objective. to use wonderful phrase coin mervyn king, governor-designate inflation-targeting bank england, "inflation nutters" head major central banks.10 moreover, virtually (i tempt say "all") recent research inflation target take grant stabilization output employment important policy objective central bank. in short, theory practice, today inflation target flexible variety.11 a second, serious, issue relative weight, ranking, inflation unemployment (or, precisely, output gap) among central bank's objectives. country differ regard, formal mandate actual practice.12 a extensive academic literature shows, however, general approach inflation target fully consistent set relative social weight inflation unemployment; approach apply equally well "inflation hawks," "growth hawks," anyone between. what i find particularly appeal constrain discretion, heart inflation-targeting approach, possibility use get good result term inflation employment. personally, i subscribe unreservedly humphrey-hawkins dual mandate, i would interest inflation-targeting approach i think best available technology achieve set policy objectives.13 misconception #3: inflation target inconsistent central bank's obligation maintain financial stability. let address point context unite states. the important single reason found federal reserve desire congress increase stability american financial markets, feed continue regard ensure financial stability critical responsibility. (by way, reason nervous recent trend separate central bank financial supervision; i hope sense here.) i always take bedrock principle stability function financial market threatened, october 1987 stock market crash september 11 terrorist attacks, federal reserve would take leadership role protect integrity system. i see conflict role inflation target (indeed, inflation target seem require preservation financial stability part preserve macroeconomic stability), i never hear proponent inflation target argue otherwise.14 inflation target federal reserve a i note earlier, federal reserve, though reject explicit affiliation inflation targeting, influence many idea influence self-described inflation targeters. increasingly great transparency forward-looking, proactive policy two example convergence practice feed inflation-targeting central banks, i think would agree development positive lead good outcomes. most important, however, i discuss early speech, chairman volcker chairman greenspan, feed move gradually toward policy framework constrain discretion.15 in 10 king (1997) appear source phrase. 11 svensson (1999), i believe coin phrase “strict inflation targeting”, call point “uncontroversial.” svensson’s paper relate work also show detail consistency inflation target dual mandate. 12 a number inflation-targeting central bank refer inflation stabilization central bank’s “primary long-run objective.” at one level, statement much content inflation variable central bank control long run. it real import say central bank responsible long-run price stability, statement unobjectionable framework. 13 meyer (2001) draw distinction hierarchical mandate, subordinate objective price stability objective, dual mandate, place price stability employment objective equal footing. like meyer, i prefer dual mandate formulation find fully consistent inflation targeting. formally, dual mandate represent central bank loss function include inflation unemployment (or output gap) symmetrically. 14 here part verbal reply i make commenter paper inflation target asset price mark gertler i present fed’s jackson hole conference august 1999, publish conference volume: “i want correct impression . . . mark i somehow lender-of-last-resort activities, absolutely wrong. i study depression quite bite career, i think two distinguish mistake federal reserve made. the first allow serious deflation, inflation target regime would permitted. and second allow financial system collapse, i absolutely agree with, example, happen october 1987 intervention . . . one advantage inflation target approach opposed, example, currency board, [that] give considerably scope lender-of-last-resort activities.” (federal reserve bank kansa city, 1999, p. 145) 15 bernanke (2003). gramlich (2000) make similar observation cite empirical evidence. bi review 15/2003 7 particular, two decade effort feed restore credibility maintain low stable inflation, which--as theory suggests--has important benefit increase institution's ability respond shock real economy. the acid test occur 2001, fomc cut interest rate nearly 500 basis point without apparent adverse effect inflation expectations. give fed's strong performance recent years, would gain move road toward inflation targeting? the heat debate say occur question inherently impossible prove either way, i afraid question give rise one debates, involve counterfactual futures. personally, though, i believe u.s. monetary policy would good long run feed choose make policy framework somewhat explicit. first, feed currently good historically rare situation, build consensus inside outside feed good policies. we would smart try lock consensus bite make current procedure explicit le mysterious public. second, make fed's inflation goal medium-term projection economy explicit would reduce uncertainty assist plan financial market economy generally. finally, additional anchor inflation expectation achieve helpful future. to move substantially direction inflation targeting, choose so, feed would take two principal steps: first, quantify (numerically, term specific price index) federal open market committee mean "price stability", second, publish regular medium-term projection forecast economic outlook, analogous inflation report publish inflation-targeting central banks. particularly general range price stability, i believe quantify fomc mean price stability would provide useful information public lend additional clarity policymaking process. let add caveat however. despite potential long-run benefit change, fomc member may concern juncture congress public would misperceive quantification price stability elevation fed's price stability objective employment objective violation dual mandate, even way intention. although personally i doubt quantification price stability objective fully consistent current dual mandate, i also appreciate delicate issue communication raise change. realistically, step unlikely occur without good bite public discussion. i hope talk today contribute discussion.16 the publication medium-term forecast raise nearly difficult political communication issue quantification price stability may, view, i propose feasible short-term step. the fomc already release (and release since 1979) range "central tendency" projection nominal gdp growth, real gdp growth, pce inflation, civilian unemployment rate twice year, publish part semiannual monetary policy report congress.17 these projection actually quite interesting, represent view feed policymakers future evolution economy, conditional policymaker view best path future policy. two drawback projection stand (1) sometimes release number week (the time fomc meet assemble chairman's testimony congress), (2) january projection cover remainder current year (the july projection cover remainder current year subsequent year). i think would useful detach projection monetary policy report instead release shortly meet (in january july) compiled. i would also suggest add second year forecast january projection, make parallel july projection well forecast staff-prepared greenbook. by release projection timely manner, add year january projection, fomc could provide quite 16 in principle, federal reserve could also publish estimate long-run growth potential u.s. economy, symmetry estimate price stability. unfortunately, potential output growth tend variable difficult measure precision. a deep asymmetry arise fact that, unlike long-run rate inflation, federal reserve cannot control, thus cannot hold responsible for, long-run economic growth rate. 17 the monetary policy report require congress section 2b federal reserve act. the report require contain “a discussion conduct monetary policy economic development prospect future . . .” the projection may interpret satisfy part requirement provide federal reserve’s view prospect future. 8 bi review 15/2003 useful information public. in particular, fomc projection would convey policymakers' sense medium-term evolution economy, provide insight fed's diagnosis economic condition policy objectives.18 ideally, release projection also would provide occasion governor regional bank presidents, draw expertise respective staffs, convey individual view prospect economy objective monetary policy. conclusion inflation targeting, least best-practice form, consist two parts: policy framework constrain discretion communication strategy attempt focus expectation explain policy framework public. together, two element promote price stability well-anchored inflation expectations; latter turn facilitate effective stabilization output employment. thus, well-conceived well-executed strategy inflation target deliver good result respect output employment well inflation. although communication play several important role inflation targeting, perhaps important focus anchor expectations. clearly limit talk achieve; ultimately, talk must back action, form successful policies. likewise, successful credible central bank like federal reserve, immediate benefit adopt explicit communication strategy may modest. nevertheless, make investment great transparency central bank's objectives, plans, assessment economy could pay increase dividend future. 18 an alternative, suggest blind et al. (2001), release summary staff-prepared forecast (the “greenbook” forecasts). i think option worth consider prefer focus fomc projection now. the projection fomc member draw heavily expertise board staff, well staff regional banks, also reflect policymakers’ personal views, i think important. report policymakers’ projection rather staff projection keep practice central banks. bi review 15/2003 1 lars heikensten: introduction monetary policy speech mr lars heikensten, governor sverige riksbank, riksdag committee finance, stockholm, 18 march 2003. * * * let begin thank opportunity come committee finance discus monetary policy. this first time i come governor riksbank. i look forward today's meet you, owners, i shall i provide information need. these open hear begin originally initiative riksbank. they expression endeavour bring open discussion monetary policy society, endeavour since take many aspects, lengthy inflation reports, clear rule-of-thumb evaluated, publish minute monetary policy discussions, on. now meet part legislation. the fact committee closely follow activity become even important since riksbank give independent status. these meet illustrate link u democratically-elected body sweden. they make clear work sort democratic vacuum, sometimes claim debate. the situation global economy swedish economy currently mark insecurity cause iraq issue. what central bank world situation continue pursue policy consistently avoid contribute great uncertainty increase pessimism. if participant financial market year ago could say show strong willingness take risk perhaps sometimes exaggerate optimism, today tendency opposite direction, particularly one look headline medium listen market participants. the central bank balance maintain credibility price stability safeguard function payment system. the riksbank strive conduct clear, credible monetary policy generally accept swedish people participant financial markets. we therefore specify explicit target annual inflation rate explain normally try keep simple rule-of-thumb; forecast inflation one two year ahead exceed inflation target raise interest rate vice versa forecast show inflation target level. this clear intellectual framework make easy influence expectation society monetary policy evaluate policy afterwards. both external analyst take stand whether policy appear sensible, whether forecast make reasonable, whether follow principle declare follow. today i intend begin describe current monetary policy situation look back development recent years. the latter discussion shows, surprisingly, always easy practice determine appropriate monetary policy, despite clear target apparently simple principle behind it. current monetary policy high energy price behind rise inflation inflation present target level. over past twelve month und1x inflation rise 3.3 per cent. doe mean monetary policy expansionary, interest rate raise now? no, not. at least believe so. the fact inflation rise recently due large price rise component und1x, primarily electricity oil. exclude energy prices, und1x inflation rise 1.9 per cent past year, i.e. close inflation target. it well know accept monetary policy great immediate effect inflation, one reason interest rate set relation change forecast inflation rate rather actual rate. attempt constantly keep inflation close target level could 2 bi review 15/2003 lead large fluctuation interest rates, negative consequence economy whole. this apply particular economy suffer supply shocks, time lead high price low production. increase electricity oil price example type supply shock. it therefore important separate effect energy price rise effect drive force behind inflation. this also completely line clarification inflation target publish riksbank 1999. the riksbank's assessment energy price one two year ahead fall back roughly level forecast increases. however, forecast include slight trend increase electricity prices. uncertainty connection iraq conflict assess exactly much temporary rise inflation much depend last tendency delicate task. the assessment economic activity, sweden abroad, play important role here. the uncertainty currently prevail global economy make difficult usual interpret various economic indicator predict future developments. when weak figure receive various sources, difficult know whether result slowdown economic recovery due fundamental reasons, household want increase save compensate large stock market falls, whether result inability act wait solution iraq crisis. the assessment economic situation even oil price largely due assumption make regard development geopolitical situation. let emphasise, i go this, actually obvious; war entail much economic consequence type riksbank reason observe inflation report - first foremost considerable human suffering. let also say field - i.e. geopolitics - course amateurs, although try use international contact put together forecast. the riksbank's main scenario assume solution reach iraq conflict give reason significantly reconsider picture gradual recovery economic activity. the survey make indicate macroeconomic consequence brief war different le dramatic development. in sense one say main scenario consistent peaceful solution brief war. the inflation report describe great detail ass effect bad development, is, course, possibility. a weak recovery an increase number indicator past month give impression international economic recovery protract anticipated. the main difference assessment make december report, deterioration prospect euro area. all all, assessment international growth slightly low year believe make forecast december. the fact revise international growth forecast also mean expect slightly le strain resource utilisation global economy. the slightly slow recovery global economy also repercussion development sweden. growth year expect low last year almost one half percentage point low reason assume december - 1.7 per cent instead 2.1 per cent. consequently, also anticipate slightly unutilised resource swedish economy come year previously assumed. our forecast resource utilisation sweden also affect revision statistic sweden recently make national accounts. these indicate productivity growth economy high estimate great part 1990s. this turn indicate economy's long-term potential growth rate may slightly higher. to summarise, i conclude picture economic activity sweden rest world similar extent appear unutilised resource growth exceed long-term potential come years. development currently restrain unease iraq. there also still great uncertainty regard size adaptation remain early rise share price asset prices. some figure indicate adjustment made, picture unambiguous. nevertheless, recovery way, must regard many areas, particularly sweden, fairly mild bi review 15/2003 3 slowdown. our forecast indicate average gdp growth come year line economy's long-term sustainable rate resource utilisation expect remain largely unchanged period. this mean economic activity labour market expect put great pressure price wage present come years. there is, course, risk development follow completely different path anticipate main scenario. this could turn entail upside downside risk inflation. the downside risk concern u connect international developments. there problem euro area particular could lead weak development. the upside risk mainly link domestic price-setting wage formation. the rise energy price push cost part economy spread. it could also affect expectation wage demands. we face collective wage bargain round autumn, play decisive role future economy. all all, come assessment risk spectrum neutral; see equally large risk low inflation path main scenario high path. repo rate low 0.25 percentage point the riksbank's total assessment inflation measure rate guide policy recent times, und1x, slightly low target level one two year ahead. however, picture complicate this. despite fact indicate repo rate lowered, decision simple one. this one important reason inflation low target level one two year ahead electricity oil price expect fall back current high level certain fall price affect policy. when adjust energy prices, inflation expect line target two year ahead. the forecast inflation present inflation report provide scope low repo rate 0.25 percentage points. this also decision take executive board riksbank yesterday. an important circumstance affect decision unease uncertainty global economy risk lead short term much bad development economic activity describe main scenario. it difficult present determine future direction monetary policy, depend partly development iraq crisis effect possible outcome inflation prospects. before i go discus history, let emphasise one thing. the repo rate decision consider appropriate depend overall direction expect economic policy. recently, claim appropriate time counteract weaken economy expansionary fiscal policy. some debater even claim would desirable present situation give principle guide budgetary policy recent years, expenditure ceiling surplus target. i agree all. if short-term room manoeuvre possible obtain high growth employment without threaten inflation target, safeguard low repo rate. to relinquish fiscal policy regulation may really put test would send negative signal analyse swedish economy. this could turn risk directly counter-productive effect interest rate thereby economic developments. monetary policy 2000-2002 let return retrospective look development inflation rate monetary policy conducted. the riksbank publish appendix inflation report intend facilitate evaluation monetary policy period 2000-2002. the focus discussion latter part period. this development 2000-2001 illustrate clearly last year's assessment. price rise monetary policy 2001 the fact inflation target level second half 2001 first half 2002 largely due supply shock similar experience now. food price rise considerably result mad cow disease, foot-and-mouth disease high price fruit vegetable result poor harvests. there also rise electricity prices. the riksbank's 4 bi review 15/2003 assessment then, now, price rise essentially temporary inflation would soon fall again. this prove case sense upturn inflation 2001 comprise serious monetary policy problem. however, inflation rate rise even adjustment make food energy prices; appear rise trend various measure underlie inflation early 1999 early 2002. it since show riksbank forecaster overestimate gdp growth underestimate inflation make forecast 2002 2000 2001. perhaps little optimistic regard economy's capacity grow without inflation accelerating. however, see light early forecast wrong direction; swedish international economy grow rapid rate, inflation low. the surprise upturn price 2001 come affect policy. although riksbank make assessment - early may 2001 - upturn essentially temporary, remain concern might great degree anticipate reflect high level resource utilisation. when sign inflation expectation rise 2001, time krona weakened, make assessment necessary intervene raise repo rate quarter percentage point. this take place early july 2001. a couple month later, terrorist attack usa 11 september, riksbank choose low steer interest rate 0.5 percentage point light poor economic prospects. however, reduction made. the reason tentative upturn economic activity expect future resource utilisation assess relatively high, despite slowdown. compare countries, fiscal policy tangibly expansionary, weak exchange rate give impetus swedish economy. development 2002 during spring 2002 repo rate raise 0.25 percentage point two occasions. the background resource utilisation still assess relatively high economic activity expect strengthen significantly light policy pursued, ensue high inflation. in addition, inflation still high uncertainty this, partly connect resource utilisation. however, recovery begin slow down, partly wake continue stock market falls. at time, early assessment upturn inflation 2001 temporary confirmed, inflation line target again, reduce uncertainty possible contagion effects. give development, repo rate low twice autumn, 0.25 percentage points. there important similarity important difference situation then. inflation rise sharply now, then, result easily discernible supply shocks, probably fairly transitory effects. the geopolitical unrest negative effect global economy, ever since 11 september 2001. however, also important differences. the krona weaken begin 2001, together tendency towards high inflation expectation bring interest rate hike. over past year krona remain relatively stable euro strengthen dollar. expectation economic activity also different 2001. that year, early autumn, aim relatively high growth rise resource utilisation, although growth expectation slightly low year earlier. today, expectation largely unchanged level resource utilisation. thus, price pressure high, either, long secondary effect arise energy price rises. forecast guide policy let conclude underline two important aspect assess monetary policy. firstly, riksbank, like many country inflation targeting, choose look ahead make monetary policy decisions. this clearly see actual policy compare evaluation appendix simple, rule-based decision basis observe gdp growth actual inflation. the import is, course, forecast inflation gdp growth become decisive monetary policy actually observe growth rate price level gdp. a disadvantage policy forecast mistake effect policy. but one advantage, consider bi review 15/2003 5 outweigh this, monetary policy become le disjointed, predictable whole stabilise economic developments. of course, riksbank could raise rate inflation rise high food energy price 2001. but would rapidly subdue inflation lead beneficial development economy? i think so. secondly, difficult make ass forecasts, picture history current situation constantly change result revision statistics. the late revision entail upward adjustment gdp productivity sweden year 1993-2002. in 2000 2001 riksbank make assessment unutilised resource economy inflationary pressure thus modest. when actual inflation rate rose, felt oblige review picture, adjustment probably justified. however, recent figure nevertheless indicate original assessment largely correct. it important get carry away recent statistic rapidly draw new trend follow. future assessment riksbank let finish emphasise something i accentuate beginning. we aim provide committee finance best possible information assessment discussions. if wish view regard material information receive today could developed, would course happy hear them. we shall satisfy wishes. thank you. bi review 14/2003 1 andrew large: basel ii systemic stability speech sir andrew large, deputy governor bank

three pillar achieve it. have work side argument, i aware anxiety - indeed disagreement - arise long debate get u are. but direction seem clear even though storm cloud may appear time time. but i would like today look beyond today's situation little, share reflection basel process itself, and, look forward, relate issues. importance three pillar new accord firstly couple observation accord itself. one remind accord three pillar - one. pillar one attention hitherto. the challenge produce great risk sensitivity considerable. technical expert area business, model builders, others, involved. this generate tendency seek great great granularity resulted, perhaps inevitably, considerable complexity. strike balance risk sensitivity detail easy. but face detail pillar one, challenge go forward lose sight two pillars, role play mitigate complexity. pillar two pillar two, remembered, design alleviate need excessive detail. supervisory oversight felt good way address many complexity detail rules. some private sector complain might lack regulatory level play field. but experience lead believe supervisor aware this. so i would encourage private sector work supervisor different country ensure delivery fair supervision across frontiers. if achieve confidence that, intention pillar two act mitigant great prescription i believe realise practice. that said, i recognise jurisdiction think behind pillar two represent new departure philosophy, perhaps legal basis, behind bank supervision. and way represent considerable challenge. 2 bi review 14/2003 maintain link market practice basel ii long process. but end itself. indeed would never achieve it. the markets, risk give rise to, static. it instructive, instance, reflect much risk management theory practice advance five year since negotiation accord began. i long felt need mechanism ensure prudential standard remain appropriate state art move on. that mean standard state continuous flux. there good case stability initial period accord adopted. and review mechanism must take careful account implementation cost incur bank rule change. but costly, too, persist regulatory standard clearly line market practice. real effort make tie accord best market practice thus change bank need introduce anyway. go forward, guide principle, difficult i know achieve practice, keep minimum difference expenditure bank would incur event require regulators. part trick ensure sufficient continuity core aspect standards, change basic it system etc minimise rate take place time. time is, all, major help respect. implement system change part software obsolescence cycle may involve modest marginal cost. more immediate discrete change always go costly. these issue clearly need discussion. in eu context, however, particularly important arrangement revise directive reflect, letter, least spirit lamfalussy. it would wholly inappropriate try hard code detail pillar one rule eu directive, necessarily stand long period time. i say cost implement basel ii fall bank alone - challenges. in jurisdictions, regulator face challenge need incur cost expand staff numbers, train implement systems. this important handle new approach. after all, call significantly great level expertise part line supervisor exist basel accord. and whilst uk, jurisdictions, expertise, need remember look global market place. and global level i detect deficit expertise require remedied. pillar three disclosure i would also like say word pillar three. pillar three can, seem me, play two roles. first, course, play role within basel ii context itself, mitigate need complexity pillar one. disclosure way organisation actually manage risk indeed help good understand risk profile, compare study complex number own. for example, understand firm conduct stress testing, valuation might sensitive different assumptions, could real value. but, second, disclosure could value general account context itself. this get complexity versus disclosure debate search good way forward arena; improve ability account reflect change underlie business. all really say pillar three need see broad context. in today's 'derivatised' world, utilisation derivative complex form contract, often model valuation bases, omnipresent. this value judgment - fact. i think accept set accounts, however draw up, likely considerably deficient, take numbers, term outline economic reality risk within balance sheet. and disclosure arguably inadequate present relation off- well on-balance sheet activity. however much may matter regret, despite best intentions, transparency today's account become le opacity great case former days, thereby give le complete reliable view overall risks. this question spvs; balance sheet; even whether historic fair value account technique used. the fact account standard setter well aware this, grapple considerable issue involved, much applauded. for fundamentally difficult area. bi review 14/2003 3 i particularly welcome effort sir david tweedie colleague iasb address openly hugely difficult task get right balance right principle place. many u see i think financial instrument standard ia 32 39 provoke significant strong views. wisdom, foresight certain forbearance need achieve good solution. so welcome present initiative iasb hold series roundtable respondent exposure draft revision ia 32

account standards, wrong hands, engender moral hazard search way round investment banker lawyer may well expect find. a similar logic apply prolong debate historic mark-to-market account principles. once again, whichever approach used, neither tell whole story term underlie economic reality bank's risk return, risk managed. but form disclosure may help. look ahead: long term financial stability policy agenda perhaps i turn observation long term. these go beyond basel ii architect mind it. but nonetheless require u think term combination evolve best practice within financial service industry one hand public policy need other. i the challenge increasingly integrate financial sector firstly, new accord mainly design credit risk hence essentially banks. yet become clear process intermediation risk change mightily. the silo securities, lending, insurance, long silos. instead see increase development single financial network embrace areas, also many organisation fall outside today's definition bank, security house, insurance company. this process gather pace recent years, accelerate since basel ii process began. a couple example illustrate i mean. first growth credit risk transfer market. alan greenspan recently note may benign effects, recently argue that: 'if risk properly dispersed, shock overall economic system good absorb le likely create cascade failure could threaten financial stability'. but new form contract tend bring uncertainty. the recent litigation new york involve claim surety bond perhaps much report incident sort. and uncertainty world dependent expeditious performance contract real issue financial stability terms. second, see emergence large multifunctional financial groups. so observation whatever think might go basel ii accord banks, would wise focus further, way capital adequacy prudential supervisory technique fit together, different part financial world, include insurance. the wisdom early day systemic risk, financial stability sense, largely confine banks. not more. it recognise time security arena process securitisation change that. and recently, grow interlinkages insurance sector give rise need rethink. ii look beyond capital adequacy: importance liquidity secondly rather different angle. view point view financial stability, capital adequacy clearly vital valuable policy tool. that basel ii important. but systemic crisis always emanate capital inadequacy. the first indication trouble ahead may well come completely different area. what i talk question liquidity. and observation would advise give think underlie issues, risks, mitigants could ingredient liquidity problems. what drivers? what may cause liquidity withdrawn? to extent could uncertainties, refer moment ago, impact liquidity 4 bi review 14/2003

settlement), change practice perception affect driver liquidity? this is, i feel, area standard principle could develop engender best practice understand private participant one hand, interface public

financial sector luxembourg - recent development financial stability introductory speech mr yves mersch, governor central bank luxembourg, alfi 2003 spring conference, luxembourg, 11 march 2003. * * * chairman, lady gentlemen, it honor pleasure invite join 2003 spring conference luxembourg investment fund association hold introductory speech. my presentation comprise two main sections. the first section devote recent development financial sector, specific focus luxembourg. the second section relate financial stability issues. 1. recent development financial sector the year 2002 been, know, difficult year financial industry whole. weak economic financial market condition translate deterioration profitability european banks. this deterioration appear consequence combination two major adverse development operate environment. - first, deterioration economic cycle borrowers’ credit quality, result increase loan loss provisions. - second, plunge global particular european stock markets, couple increase risk aversion uncertainty financial markets, entail reduce commission trade income capital-market relate businesses. the luxembourg financial sector, characterize high degree openness, escape impact depress general environment. in year 2002, luxembourg bank sector see net result deteriorate aggregate basis 6%, although evolution unequally spread among individual financial institutions. while interest margin commissions, key source profitability, decline total 7% 6% respectively, compensation negative trend partly achieve level certain individual institution increase one-off exceptional revenue and/or release previously create general provisions. the one-off exceptional revenue increase total 525 million euros, 132%, relate major part capital gain income sell-off

results, likely increase short term volatility bank results; future introduction new capital adequacy rule risk negative pro-cyclical impact loan-loss provision financial sector. the concept dynamic provision could step right direction context. 2 bi review 14/2003 if disregard banks’ account result miscellaneous income, include capital gains, picture bank sector appear even alarming. banks’ income provision tax would show decrease 7% 2002 instead increase 6%; net result would almost 30% low year before, instead modest decline 6%. amid adverse developments, bank succeed contain costs. administrative cost reduce 6% year review, staff cost slightly increase 3%. possible cost reduction year 2003 however unlimited. the cost/income ratio luxembourg bank stand 40% end 2002, 41% 2001, already efficient european banks. it compare indeed average ratio 66% eu-wide 2001. an important part potential cost cut european level probably already incorporate luxembourg results. other gauge bank activity encourage either. a look banks’ aggregate balance sheet show decrease 58,4 billion euros, decrease 8% compare 2001 contrast continuous growth past twenty years. even employment, typically lag indicator, decrease close 600 unit 2002, 2% relative terms, total number employee stand 23 300 end december 2002. this reduction however attenuate increase 200 staff member within ”other professional financial sector”, whose employment come close 20% employment bank sector. staff redundancy via social plan however far exception. a concern number banks, 178 end january 2003, witness reduction nine unit compare end 2001 notable decrease compare peak 223 bank june 1996. this movement mainly result merger result restructure within bank groups, cross-border well cross sectoral, international level. the tendency abate now, likely revive economy recovers. this restructure process lead among others concentration specific activity within bank group one single handle unit. it-infrastructure, back-office, trade account prime examples. while acknowledge possible economic benefit concentration, care take outsource create gaps, neither risk management supervision. from macro-prudential perspective, bank able, partly due however aforementioned factor profit loss accounts, cope harsh external environment. on aggregate basis, global net constitution value adjustments, relate funds, increase 1.9% 2001 5.1% 2002. their return assets, term net result 0.4% end 2002, fall back level 1999. their global aggregate capital ratio improve stance 14% end 2001, 16% end 2002, comfortably prudential 8% threshold. the investment fund business equally spar unfavorable external environment. the ucis, number 1 941 end 2002, albeit show modest increase 33 unit past year, see grow trend reverse october 2002 december 2002 19 units. the value asset management, close 845 billion euro end 2002, diminish 9% compare 2001. this decline seem however mainly result reduce market value assets. positively, net accumulation 57 billion euro new capital invest 2002 take place. lady gentlemen, although current picture look favorable, sector remain resilient. ultimately, sector’s outlook hinge development economic financial market environment. we face quite unusual synchronize slowdown world’s three major economies, europe, unite state japan. today, word appropriately characterize future outlook uncertainty, fragility volatility relation time pace economic recovery overshadow geopolitical tensions. we remain vigilant. 2. issue financial stability the combination central banks’ role issue money participation commercial bank money creation process result involvement central bank financial stability. commercial banks’ money represent large share total money stock, value bi review 14/2003 3 dependent creditworthiness commercial banks. the concern central bank orderly function stability bank system arise hence need maintain public good stable mean payment. bank plague inherent instability. the bank sector function closely inter-linked system, prone contagion risk payment system interbank markets. central banks, issuer money, need, like sound manage financial institution, monitor quality counterparts. this addition role ultimate provider safe settlement medium liquidity ensure orderly function financial system. price stability support sound investment sustainable growth, turn conducive financial stability. since fragility bank counterpart tend frequent price unstable, pursuit price stability see crucial contribution financial stability. day-to-day monetary policy tool significant extend associate financial stability considerations. lending- deposit facility central bank fine tune money market operation primarily aim provide sufficient liquidity money market facilitate orderly liquidity management individual banks. a specific question relate relationship asset prices, financial stability monetary policy. how central bank position regard price change assets? asset price target beyond pursuit price stability could set conflict signals. one could certainly question central banks’ superior ability asset price targeting; different asset class could require conflict action. base indicator maintain price stability medium term, present ecb strategy take note movement exchange rates, stock price property prices. the mission attribute escb field financial stability threefold: first, task contribute policy carry competent authority field prudential supervision credit institution stability financial sector; second, entrust advisory role rule-making process; third, obligation promote smooth operation payment systems. the bcl put place system macro-prudential indicators, allow regular monitor luxembourg financial sector. the international monetary fund context recent article iv consultation financial sector assessment program (fsap) welcome establishment bcl aforementioned indicators; serve among others basis imf assessment soundness financial sector, systemic importance highlight respective reports. during six months, june december 1998, bcl endow mission supervise financial institution micro-prudential level. this mission however subsequently remove delegate commission de surveillance du secteur financier, create begin 1999. the legislator probably aware fact decision would lead exceptional situation within monetary union, entail total absence formal bilateral co-operation micro-prudential macro-prudential supervision financial sector. central bank eurosystem assume today either direct responsibility micro-prudential supervision, closely involve mission, formal co-operation arrangement place. the role central banks, embed appropriate overall supervisory regime due involvement financial stability, base mission payment systems; obligation communicate comment field financial stability maintain communication network central banks; need disseminate information markets; possible need liquidity injection emergency situation crisis management. therefore, role central bank act global co-ordinator crisis situation directly derive fact central bank special expertise, information tool necessary perform co-ordination liquidity support functions. the smooth function payment system instrumental efficient allocation financial resource economy. through payment systems, bank interconnect channel liquidity financial sector rest economy, thus contribute smooth economic development financial stability. the participant system link network provide channel contagion risk. the failure counterpart trigger systemic problems. the true security settlement systems. 4 bi review 14/2003 with transposition settlement finality directive luxembourg law january 2001, legislator endow bank supervisory authority surveillance systems, exceptional basis bcl, condition bcl participant systems. for time being, bcl charge oversight lips-gross, luxembourg component target, lips-net, local retail payment system, include technical agent cetrel security settlement system operate clearstream, include technical agent clearstream services. the bcl notify system european commission. it monitor observance system requirement lay oversight policy procedures. those base international standard recommendations. they comprise among others, issue relate corporate governance corporate structure, latter aim avoid emergence oversight gap loophole level system operator. the bcl participate discussion escb issue regard oversight payment security settlement systems. at escb level, memorandum understand conclude 2001 overseer payment system supervisory authorities. this non-legally bind document relate co-operation exchange prudential information may impact financial stability aspect call co-operation esbc bank supervisor cross-border level. even though synergy price stability financial stability prevail long run, successful monetary policy always sufficient prevent financial instability. in rare circumstances, need provide liquidity individual illiquid institution cannot excluded. a form involvement central bank carry few moral hazard implication provision liquidity consist central bank act co-ordinator facilitate private sector solutions. in case, central bank act “honest broker”. due unique position financial system, independence political considerations, possession special expertise, information tools, appear best place assume role overall co-ordinator. 3. conclusion potential future risk vulnerability financial sector continue source european global macro-economic environment. further need additional risk provision continue low income trade activity retail bank general could impair banks’ profits. the financial result first quarter 2003 give u first indication respect. the bank sector resilient far i believe, without complacent, sector potential withstand possible shocks. enhance risk management, increase reserve buff continue strategy aim increase profitability certainly step right direction. lady gentlemen, since creation euro area financial system, financial stability concern develop euro area wide issue. the unique challenge eurosystem face lie threefold separation regulatory body, european union, single currency area country specific supervisory jurisdictions. this separation require special form co-operation public bodies. a liquidity contagion risk increase importance, one expect role central bank financial stability increase. care take relation risk arise non-banking financial sector activity financial market price developments. despite improvement risk management technique procedures, prudential supervision oversight payment security settlement systems, occurrence future financial crisis excluded. central banks’ role global co-ordinator situation crucial importance. to repeat summarize: central bank involve financial stability: bank business operations, necessary central bank control soundness counterparts; addition central bank entrust exclusive task provide ultimate liquidity. they play important role crisis management maintain financial stability, regardless institutional structure supervision adopt respective jurisdiction. however, close formal co-operation information share arrangements, central bank supervisory authorities, work theory also practice, pre-condition address issue financial stability adequate way. bi review 14/2003 5 thank kind attention. bi review 14/2003 1 david dodge: central bank website year remark david dodge, governor bank canada, website award event, central bank publication lombard street research, london, england, 12 march 2003. * * * it gratify tonight accept, behalf bank canada, award "central bank website year." it become almost cliché point "internet time move fast normal time." but i'm remind observation i accept award - award achievement medium barely exist ten year ago. for matter, eight year ago - 1995 - banco de méxico, bank canada, central bank launch first web sites. back then, would hard imagine quickly web would evolve hugely influential medium today. it would also hard imagine back far central bank would move towards great openness transparency day-to-day operations. so seem significant two trend - push towards open, transparent communications, unexpectedly rapid ascendance web - coincided. at bank canada, web site integral part communication strategy past eight years. the web offer u cost-effective global distribution channel vast amount data, analysis, commentary pertain main function - is, conduct monetary policy, promotion financial stability, supply bank notes, provision central bank service federal government. our site also offer grow amount purely instructive material. through use glossaries, "backgrounders", information, make concert effort ensure every document publish provide enough context help non-specialists read understand it. this small challenge, give admittedly dry complex nature much material central bank deal with. we also develop "inflation investment calculators" message benefit low inflation clear public. and use graphic presentation explain transmission monetary policy. a well, currently develop web-based simulation game, design explain intricacy monetary policy high school undergraduate students. base effort date, host even decide bank canada's web site best among two dozen central bank site short-listed award. so question may ask is, "how exactly it? and set bank canada's web site apart banks?" first, ourselves. we throw lot money outside consultants. from early days, fortunate enough small group key people - editors, writers, programmer - excite new technology, will dedicate time build improve site. i'd like take moment mention couple key people name - although, always, many others whose effort contribute importantly success site. some may already know senior web consultant, brent eades, web-related article central bank publications, presentation various central bank web conferences. since 1998, brent principal responsibility develop expand site, obviously please effort receive strong endorsement tonight. i would also like note considerable contribution ken kingsbury, senior programmer staff, responsible perfect many sophisticate data search tool site. second, beginning, attitude one encouragement, rather direction. we content trust plan management site staff expertise job right. indeed, i think fact trust specialist various department decide best present particular information lot success web site. 2 bi review 14/2003 a look future site, plan continue trust necessary talent. staff already plan variety improvement site next year - graphic redesign works, well simulation game i mention moment ago. we also plan fine-tune reorganize site's content make even accessible now. so heads-up fellow central banker intend relinquish award readily! *********************** once again, i want express sincere thank central bank publication lombard street research honour prestigious award. this proud moment member staff put endless hour develop prize-winning site. bi review 13/2003 1 tt mboweni: inflation, growth employment opportunity lecture mr tt mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, department economics, university stellenbosch, stellenbosch, 6 march 2003. * * * 1. introduction member portfolio select committee finance, deputy vice-chancellor, professors, staff, students, lady gentleman it pleasant side beautiful hex river mountain speak number issue right core central banking. the accusation often hear central banker narrow world inflation, open mind matters. not true! the way matter come together - principle behind interaction - central talk today. 2. the magnitude challenge face economy start longer-term picture inflation, well-known fact double-digit inflation reign 1974 1992 leave considerable scar economy. it redistributive impact nasty, buy power vulnerable group society, poor elderly, particular undermined. the plight pensioner retire twenty year ago use interest fix deposit provide illustrate cost basket consumer item cost r100 early 1983. the cost basket shoot r380 early 1993, currently amount r815. although inflation recede single-digit level average around 7,8 per cent per annum last ten years, still enough significantly erode live standard vulnerable group society time. some distortion therefore remain, lead friction misallocation resources. high unemployment continue characterise south african labour market. base response representative sample 30 000 household sample february 2002 labour force survey, statistic south africa put official unemployment rate 29,4 per cent. the absolute number unemployed amount 4,7 million people. and people look job - cover give up. the opportunity cost economy huge: even would produce good service amount r650 per month (the equivalent minimum wage lowest-paying areas), combine output would amount almost r40 billion per annum - almost much value actually add entire agriculture, forestry fish sector. disillusionment desperation often accompany unemployment. unemployment insurance - soon expand sector - help relieve symptoms, course need creation sufficient number sustainable job opportunity absorb unemployed. to end, economist agree sustain real gdp growth around 5 6 per cent per annum needed. whereas south africa barely manage record average growth rate 1,5 per cent per annum 1980s, indeed accelerate around 3 per cent per annum since 1994. nevertheless, significant sustain improvement needed. the question how? and way could monetary policy contribute towards strong growth? 3. inflation growth: trade-off? can growth (and side coin, le unemployment) buy allow inflation? this question interest economist lot since 1958 a w phillips r g lipsey publish analysis relation unemployment rate change money wage unite kingdom 1861 1957. empirical evidence indicate existence 2 bi review 13/2003 inverse relationship wage inflation unemployment. this imply inflation-accommodating monetary fiscal policy stance - easy-money policy - could use reduce unemployment. however, relationship turn fragile least quite false worst. firstly, empirical evidence accumulate numerous country increasingly undermine phillips curve theory inflation accelerate hoped-for reduction unemployment either fail materialise last long. secondly, economic theory develop explicitly incorporate learn behaviour. assume adaptive expectation could show "the" phillips curve (with unemployment rate horizontal axis inflation vertical) would shift upward time. the true picture would consist short-term phillips curve trade-off hold while, long-term phillips curve vertical. some rational expectation model go further, imply stimulatory monetary fiscal policy would fully expect reflect price without quantity effects. this would mean would short-term phillips curves, long-term vertical relationship. look south african empirical information regard, unfortunately severe data problems. the data register unemployment (people register unemployed order receive unemployment insurance payouts) patchy available, consistent time. a far labour force survey concerned, start 2000 six-monthly frequency. but assume growth real gdp mirror image unemployment, adequate data high quality available investigate proxy relationship - inflation real gdp growth. this relationship turn loose. on occasion sign expect short-term relationship, high growth accompany high inflation, time seem persist. over long term, trade-off seem hold. in fact, noteworthy 1982 1992 average inflation amount 14,6 per cent average real gdp growth 0,7 per cent, 1992 2002 inflation average 7,6 per cent per annum real growth 2,7 per cent. the low inflation, good economic growth. this run logic phillips curve, make perfect sense central banker tend stress deadweight loss flow high inflation. an uncertain environment high inflation certainly conducive true read price signal relative scarcities, brisk fix capital formation sound resource allocation general. (some observer would course argue low growth high inflation 1970s 1980s cause outside factor various supply side shocks. correlation prove causality. and debate continue…) pursue line reason further, number study cover large number country done, inter alia imf officials, estimate rate inflation distortion introduce inflation really start drag real growth rate economy down. not surprisingly, study come different answers. growth-destroying inflation start low single digits, high single digit (at most) slightly ten per cent mark, depend methodology used. a little inflation may good, example make easy low real price wage industry experience competition without low nominal price wages. however, must point low inflation solely pursue conducive sustainable economic growth. it also pursue equity, fairness development broad sense would sacrifice inflation leave spiral upward. 4. what currently happen inflation, growth employment? it well-known south african government set target 3 6 per cent cpix inflation. in 2002, actual outcome 10 per cent. while disappointing, outcome unexpected light 34 per cent depreciation nominal effective exchange rate rand 2001. it feed high rand price import product inflation spiral. in order brake inflationary forces, reserve bank therefore raise repurchase rate 4 occasion january september 2002, occasion 100 basis points. the 2001 depreciation rand fairly soon reflect production prices. twelve-month production price inflation accelerate low point 7,8 per cent september 2001 double-digit rate 11,5 per cent january 2002 eventually reach maximum 15,4 per cent august september 2002. consumer price tend lag bite behind production prices, bi review 13/2003 3 indeed happen again: twelve-month cpix inflation accelerate low point 5,8 per cent september 2001 double-digit rate august 2002 record recent high level 12,7 per cent november 2002. food price play important role process. at production price level twelve-month food price inflation peak around 30 per cent, consumer level peak around 20 per cent. for key food item like maize, southern african production fell demand, drive price towards import parity - mean high level rand term past 18 months, give happen exchange rate. but year-on-year inflation rate deceptive, make worthwhile also analyse shorter-term price movements. one way calculate percentage change quarter quarter relevant price index, annualise it. calculate way, production price inflation shoot 25,8 per cent first quarter 2002, recede course year 5,0 per cent fourth quarter. consumer price much sticky; annualised cpix inflation balance accelerate 11,5 per cent first quarter 2002 14,5 per cent final quarter. by january 2003, however, month-to-month rate cpix inflation reflect moderation flow slowdown production prices; recede annualised rate 6,0 per cent. at time recent appreciation rand swing month-to-month rate production price inflation around annualised rate decline 6,4 per cent. it japan price decline! but i hasten add comparison japan's long-term price deflation south africa's short-term decline production price closely relate exchange rate movements. how inflation prospect look go forward? to extent already deal reserve bank's monetary policy review october 2002. it project cpix inflation would peak towards end 2002 (which did), would decline fairly dramatically course 2003 (which also seem progress). the discipline monetary policy stance continue sound control government finance already set reign inflation spiral, receive additional help relatively strong exchange rate - strong incorporate central scenario october 2002 projections. new projection course table forthcoming monetary policy committee meeting, hold 19 20 march. some downward rigidity inflation always expect various ratchet effects, sticky nontradeables' price like, resolve mpc steer inflation difficult terrain within 6 3 per cent target range underestimated. do right thing thing right far macroeconomic policy concerned, enhance stability, clear medium-term policy frameworks, adequate transparency accountability, confidence grow fix investment expenditure rising. furthermore, rise investment expenditure spread many industries. this bode well future growth. the transition volatile real gdp growth quite match population growth 1980s consistent growth around 3 per cent per annum recent year significant. a consistent track record grows, athlete likely graduate stage 3 per cent much pedestrian. decline employment number since 1989 record core formal sector south african economy. these number comprehensive; inter alia include government, manufacture mining, instance include industry computer programming. but broad enough make worthwhile note core formal sector employment turn around second quarter last year, grow annualised rate 1,8 per cent, follow 2,4 per cent third quarter. while two swallow make summer, nevertheless represent good news. 5. a note lag monetary policy in monetary policy formulation acutely aware long variable lag inherent monetary policy. we ass current economic situation economic problem hand comprehensively quickly possible. and cannot simply look window like rain forecaster get initial feel situation. a huge amount statistical work, include large-scale survey economic agent various sectors, do get fact table. then decide policy instrument use extent. utilise input economic researchers, monetary policy committee deliberate issue thorough debate take decision. next implement instrument changes. with operational 4 bi review 13/2003 department well-geared, element monetary policy usually quick clean. but then, course, economy respond new instrument settings. many thing speed certain point. even utmost dedication effort, comprehensive picture economic situation table two month end quarter concerned, although many individual bite information available analyse early on. the mpc process fairly quick, take two days. monetary policy change generally implement almost immediately. the really frustrate part "outside lag". this generally hold 18 24 months. when mpc sens imminent acceleration inflation raise interest rate counter it, private sector bank usually raise interest rate within days. however, many transaction already irrevocably pipeline many economic agent sensitive interest rates, credit extension expenditure slow react. eventually do, course. it usually time, expenditure slow significantly, price wage setter start discover real resistance increases. it could easily 18 month long policy interest rate raise fully work moderate inflation rate. in world long lags, credible inflation target seem useful mechanism shorten outside lag perhaps moderate magnitude interest rate change require achieve particular outcome. if doubt authority commit inflation target end prevail, economic agent likely set price wage level readily reconcilable inflation target, likely view deviation target temporary. le interest rate medicine likely require forward-looking expectation formation process. le sacrifice would therefore require get inflation target range remain there. but could work central bank fully commit inflation target, independent will use policy instrument full extent needed, economic agent know this. in cricket, one-day game rise popularity tempo life accelerated. most people simply five day watch traditional kind match. so thing speed up; without it, cricket world cup tournament would take age complete. it seem preferable also speed tempo inflation unwind return 6 3 per cent target range, work along line forward-looking expectation process describe previously. while i doubt regard reserve bank's independence commitment achieve inflation target, lag structure economic agents' response interesting. may one-day match rather marathon! 6. conclusion low inflation financial stability support sustainable economic growth, development, equity employment creation. they opposition it. while short-term trade-off cannot denied, allow inflation take root dire long-term consequences. cpix inflation already deceleration mode, reserve bank vigorously ensure end 6 3 per cent target range. thank you. bi review 13/2003 1 david dodge: meet global challenge - importance sound economic policy remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, canada-uk chamber commerce, london, uk, 12 march 2003. * * * i delight london speak today. we face time great economic political uncertainty. while economic activity close potential canada, country face weak demand lacklustre economic prospects. and, course, override prospect war iraq. voltaire say "doubt pleasant condition, certainty absurd one." we policy-makers rarely burden certainty best times, definitely days! in environment unsettle one, easy become preoccupy now. but, times, even important remain focus medium-term goal macroeconomic policy. and that's we're try canada. many colleague international meet year comment canada's economic strength. it true we've good luck. but canada's strong performance past two three difficult year world economy primarily reflect extraordinary effort make 1990s get macroeconomic framework - is, monetary fiscal policy - right. canada, course, alone make efforts. during 1980s, consensus develop among oecd nation combination policy likely deliver sound economic performance. the consensus grow unhappy experience early policy experiments. and build around four key principles: trade liberalization, structural reform, fiscal prudence, low stable inflation. these four principle work like four leg chair. the chair steady four leg equally sturdy. similarly, economy stable progress make four policy fronts. and one leg start weaken, best way restore stability build leg back up, cut three. canadian spend great deal effort past decade put four element policy framework place. it involve considerable short-term economic pain. but phrase "short-term pain long-term gain" cliché. canada receive economic payoff effort. since 1997, economy consistently exceed average growth rate world's industrialize countries. and expect year. the first principle: trade liberalization let briefly review four principle progress canada make each. i'll start principle trade liberalization. we know free international trade help country fully exploit gain come increase specialization great productivity competitiveness. canada's economy make difficult adjustment free trade late 1980s early 1990s. first, sign canada-us free trade agreement, come effect 1989. then, 1994, mexico join group north american free trade agreement. both agreement spark great deal political controversy. and many canadian company understandably anxious avoid increase competition. a well, free trade agreement come effect time monetary policy tight, fight high inflation rate day. despite initial misgivings, canadian company rise challenge increase competition. some sector use protect - furniture, clothing, wine - since establish strong presence international markets. overall, canadian export flourish agreements. 2 bi review 13/2003 and strengthen resolve see free trade extend beyond regional trade blocs. canada hop see meaningful progress world trade organization's doha round multilateral talks. clearly, agriculture go major hurdle. the develop countries, include u g-7, considerable way go term liberalize agricultural trade. and sector major effort required. this effort must make global economy benefit. it easy but, long run, worth it. the second principle: structural reform complement trade liberalization second principle, focus need improve structure national economies. the goal twofold: first, increase flexibility economy adjust change world economic conditions; second, ensure longer-run viability social - income - security arrangements. structural adjustment always difficult reform affect various group differ often painful ways. further, economic benefit increase flexibility may take fairly long time emerge. but difficulty sway u task reduce rigidity increase efficiency. canada make progress number fronts. for example, government take step reduce distortion personal income tax system, implement good service tax replace outdated tax manufacturers. unemployment insurance benefit also reduce restructure strengthen incentive work. another important structural reform public pension system. in 1996, canadian federal provincial government agree change would put canada quebec pension plan sustainable footing. this mean restructure benefit sharp increase contribution - move unpopular necessary. the surplus canada quebec pension plan represent almost 1 per cent gdp. furthermore, surplus set aside special fund cannot touch government general use. the asset public plan manage canada pension plan investment board, body entirely independent government. it sole mandate invest contribution markets, order generate best possible returns, consistent prudence, long term. the third principle: fiscal prudence this lead next principle, relate fiscal policy need discipline approach manage public purse. fiscal policy must guide principle put ratio public debt gdp sustainable, downward track. in canada's experience, difficult hurdle overcome. to sure, fiscal consolidation 1990s painful. i federal deputy minister finance time, i tell many difficult unpopular decision taken. equally important, province make tough choice reduce public spend restore fiscal health. but difficult year were, wait would make matter worse. well, here's good news: vicious circle rise deficit debt become virtuous circle balance budget fall debt. reduce deficit 1990s help canada's international credibility. this lead reduction risk premium demand international investors. the fiscal improvement mean bank canada able low interest rate easily economic circumstance warranted. not low interest rate reduce debt-servicing costs, also stimulate economic growth, bring revenue government. the extra revenue low debt-servicing costs, turn, lead even good fiscal position. at end 2002, canada's total government surplus represent 1 per cent gdp - include surplus pension plans. last month, finance minister john manley announce fifth consecutive surplus federal budget project budget continue balance position good next three years. the budget maintain fiscal plan framework previous years. that framework include $3 billion contingency reserve, use reduce debt needed. it also bi review 13/2003 3 include $1 billion upcoming budget year additional economic prudence, $2 billion follow year, assurance canada fall back deficit. canada expect one low debt burden g-7 year. not reduce debt-to-gdp ratio, pay almost $50 billion federal debt. this lead restoration canada's triple-a credit rat free $3 billion resource every year federal government. the main point initial work fiscal consolidation certainly difficult, necessary order enjoy dividend late on. the fourth principle: low stable inflation the fourth principle relate monetary policy - responsibility bank canada. this principle recognize that, medium term, monetary policy work keep inflation low, stable, predictable. let explain this. since 1991, follow joint agreement federal government, bank canada operate system inflation-control targets. i plan spend lot time explain system audience, unite kingdom adopt system similar couple year did. we aim keep consumer price inflation 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent range. if trend inflation move away target either direction, bank take action inflation return target within 18 24 months. canada's inflation-targeting framework work symmetrical way, minimize chance sustain upward drift inflation threat deflation. indeed, past decade, manage keep inflation around 2 per cent target midpoint. and so, canadians' expectation inflation become firmly anchor around 2 per cent. this climate low, stable, predictable inflation help smooth up down economy create best possible environment longer-term economic growth canada. inflation economic outlook let give bank canada's view state canadian economy outlook. first, bite history. follow 11 september 2001 terrorist attack unite states, bank canada, like major central banks, move quickly aggressively cut policy interest rate shore confidence. that dramatic monetary policy action help great deal. by spring 2002, become evident economy knock track event 11 september. indeed, evidence start build economy grow fast production potential, take remain small amount economic slack. so, raise key policy rate three time april july, total three-quarters percentage point. but late last summer, see effect financial headwinds, geopolitical uncertainties, continue weakness global economy. these factor remain play autumn. a result, refrain raise interest rates, even though inflation accelerating. our initial analysis increase inflation would temporary. however, core total cpi inflation remain well target. this reflect impact higher-than-expected price crude oil natural gas, continue increase auto insurance premiums, price pressure certain sectors, housing, food, services. the high inflation also suggest underlie firmness price-setting environment. in words, relative price increase push trend inflation sufficient demand. indeed, final domestic demand - especially household spend - remain robust. however, economic growth canada moderate final three month 2002, largely weak export - notably, decline automotive shipment unite states. even slow growth fourth quarter, upward revision previous quarter leave level economic activity slightly high monitoring. in fact, canada's economy remain near full capacity. let list indicator support view: high industrial capacity utilization; near record-high labour force participation rates; record-high employment-to-population ratio; corporate 4 bi review 13/2003 profit high level since early 2001; and, i say moment ago, above-target trend inflation. while continue foresee growth somewhat potential first half year, expect increase demand second half 2003 2004, global uncertainty diminish. but appropriate reduction amount monetary stimulus, see level output remain close capacity year 2004. so, make interest rate decision 4 march, weigh follow considerations: domestic inflation pressures, expectation canadian economic activity remain near potential 2003 despite geopolitical uncertainties, stimulative stance monetary policy, improve condition capital markets. take factor account, bank raise key policy rate one-quarter percentage point 3 per cent. even increase, stance monetary policy remain stimulative. thus, time, reduction monetary stimulus require return inflation target medium term. but, said, time pace increase policy interest rate continue depend number considerations. these include strength demand pressures; evolution inflation expectations; impact confidence geopolitical global economic uncertainties; way development middle east affect demand inflation, globally canada. the bank continue closely monitor factors. *********************** let conclude. at begin talk today, i note that, decade now, canada follow policy base four key principles: trade liberalization, structural reform, fiscal prudence, inflation control. it's never easy follow principles, but, medium term, lead good economic performance. canada's recent economic record evidence that. we maintain enviable growth performance difficult period world economy. we remain optimistic - others - continue so. both oecd imf predict canada's economy outperform g-7 country year. but difficult times. significant geopolitical global economic uncertainty continue overhang economic outlook countries. it time like policy-makers may tempt put four principle aside focus instead short-term economic problems. in canada, learn stick principle create economic structure withstand turmoil. the four policy principle prove effective tool meet challenge uncertain world. bi review 12/2003 1 bank japan’s march report recent economic financial developments1 bank japan, 6 march 2003. * * * the bank’s view2 economic activity remain flat amid substantial uncertainty outlook economy. with regard final demand, business fix investment virtually level, private consumption continue weak. moreover, house investment remain sluggish public investment declining. while domestic demand yet show sign recovery, export import increase modest pace net export remain virtually level. industrial production continue basically level response development final demand. a employment situation, new job offer gradual rise trend. in addition, number employees, cover various type employee include non-regular employee temporary workers, appear decline slow pace. however, firm still maintain stance reduce personnel expenses, household income continue decrease significantly due mainly ongoing decline wages. thus, employment income situation household overall remain severe. turn economic outlook, widely share view prospect overseas economy 2003 that, partly due continue firmness asian economies, follow gradual

strengthen program swiss agency development cooperation, islamabad, 26 february 2003. * * * i would like commend swiss government swiss agency development cooperation (sdc) launch financial sector strengthen program (fssp). i believe lack adequate human institutional capacity, shortage local expertise weak coordination among various stakeholder indeed factor inhibit growth microfinance sector pakistan. the initiative take sdc overcome constraint therefore timely appropriate. but i expect fssp successfully demonstrate business model capacity build adapt internalize network without recourse external donors. the transfer technology adaptation circumstance effective way utilize external resources. at outset let place microfinance overall context effort state bank make expand outreach financial service help goal poverty alleviation country. the sbp is, addition microfinance, encourage provision credit small medium entrepreneur newly set sme bank, small farmer newly restructure zarai taraqqati bank ltd cooperative banks, woman entrepreneurs, individual small firm first women’s bank. these institution work protype develop methodology expertise area protype replicate mainstream financial institution country. this durable basis poor benefit financial sector country. pakistan adopt sectoral approach microfinance pakistan assimilate learn experience develop country active area decades. microfinance still infancy long way go. some momentum build last three year bulk disbursement take place since june, 1999. although big spurt three year number beneficiary volume credit disburse still quite low relation need demand intend target group. we therefore decide adopt holistic, “let thousand flower bloom”, inclusive strategy promotion spread microfinance pakistan. this strategy consist follow six elements. first, strong political commitment towards support microfinance integral tool poverty alleviation program. president pakistan take keen personal interest nurture growth sector direct ministry finance monitor track microfinance sector regular basis. the government invite world bank, adb bilateral donor actively assist u sector. consequently enable environment development growth mf highly conducive. the constraints, snag problem face implementation program remove consultation full involvement stakeholders. second, program involve multiple actor institution - community organizations, ngos, public sector, private sector, rural support program - delivery microfinance. the extent poverty prevail pakistan require ‘all hand - deck’ approach rather exclusive monopoly government public sector case past. khushali bank own several lead financial institution - private, public foreign - rather government pakistan. this allow function professional manner. third, complementarity microfinance element poverty alleviation investment, infrastructure, social service capacity build clearly recognize build program. income generation poor cannot take place availability credit infrastructure, market sell produce. similarly without build knowledge base enlarge capacity poor won’t scope sustainable microfinance. fourth, government experiment variety institutional model delivery mechanism outreach poor. for example, wholesale organization ppaf successfully disburse $ 100 million line credit provide world bank. we khushali bank retail bank already reach 100,000 customer target 700,000 2007. then first mcirofinance bank establish private sector expand branch network throughout country. we integrate program vehicle nrsp, prsp etc. combine

26 february 2003. * * * the framework monetary policy iceland alter decisively march 2001. the government central bank issue joint declaration adopt inflation target mainstay monetary policy abandon fix exchange rate policy follow decade. to begin with, relatively narrow target band set previous regime reference exchange rate 2¼% either direction around central value króna. this widen two stages, end 9% deviation either direction early 2000. during period, price stability principal objective monetary policy stable exchange rate intermediate target. since adoption inflation targeting, central bank’s inflation forecast could say actually serve intermediate target monetary policy, ultimate objective price stability. inflation target establish many country recent year form backbone monetary policy, instance, uk, sweden, norway new zealand, good result case. in may 2001 icelandic parliament althingi unanimously adopt new central bank act, entail extensive change previous legislation. take consideration innovation central bank legislation countries, act consolidate new inflation target policy. the significant change early legislation set single, principal objective central bank, i.e. promote price stability. the bank also grant independence apply instrument order achieve objective. furthermore, assign task maintain iceland’s foreign exchange reserve foster efficient reliable financial system, i.e. financial stability. the act also stipulate treasury may borrow central bank. specific requirement set concern transparency accountability towards government public. for example, bank oblige publicly account monetary policy monetary exchange rate development action area least quarterly. the principal objective current central bank monetary policy, state joint declaration issue bank government march 2001, keep inflation close possible 2½%. should inflation deviate target 1½ percentage point either direction, bank provide government write public account explain cause deviation, bank intend respond long expect take inflation return within target inflation limits. the central bank one instrument disposal achieve objective: interest rates. the significant interest rate use bank’s repurchase transaction credit institutions, sometimes refer central bank’s policy interest rate. such transaction fact represent bank’s liquidity facility institutions. the commercial save bank subsequently set rate interest, regard central bank’s policy rate, short-term market interest rate generally change phase central bank rate. if factor remain constant, change central bank interest rate also affect long-term interest rates, aspect also enter picture. the response rate change central bank rate therefore always predictable tend occur certain time lag. inflation forecast play crucial role central bank policy. it produce four forecast annually, publish quarterly monetary bulletin. the inflation forecast extend two year future, quarter-by-quarter basis. a countries, interest rate change central bank take quite time impact throughout economy. this make necessary forward-looking policy, inflation forecast base state-of-the-art methodologies. in addition inflation forecast, central bank publish quarterly assessment economic monetary situation prospects, include national economic forecast, probable impact price level developments. if inflation look likely exceed bank’s target limit long-term perspective, bank raise policy interest rate, cut rate inflation head target limit. in prepare inflation forecast regular assessment economic situation outlook, central bank examine wide variety indicators. these include statistical data information obtain interview representative industry, special interest groups, credit institution others. much statistical data available bank’s website. decision central bank’s board governor make follow in-depth examination indicators, base bank’s evaluation situation prospects, premise behind inflation forecast inflation forecast itself. in accordance provision act enter force spring 2001, board adopt internal rule preparation of, argument presentation monetary policy decisions. the rule formally approve begin 2002 publish quarterly monetary bulletin. the inflation target adopt march 2001 remove early fluctuation band set isk exchange rate exchange rate floated. the new monetary policy framework introduce rather difficult conditions, slide exchange rate mount inflation. it fair say tight monetary stance main reason inflation recede sharply 2002. experience show monetary policy pass demand trial fly colour one long doubt value icelandic economy. it work iceland everywhere else. the central bank respond imminent inflationary pressure raise interest rate 1998 still 1999 2000. the interest rate increase serve reduce excess demand economy isk exchange rate rose, thus slow increase consumer price index (cpi) overheat economy. early 2000 fluctuation band króna widened, part previous limit felt restrain rise exchange rate, regard necessary counter inflationary pressure. the exchange rate peak spring 2000, 12% high present. market expectation change spring 2000, exchange rate begin downward trend. there doubt various explanation occur probably major factor concern sizeable current account deficit result enormous need foreign financing, together icelandic investment foreign security year, least pension funds. the downward exchange rate slide last late november 2001. several time period mid-2000 well 2001, central bank intervene currency market attempt prevent decrease exchange rate. the bank intervene particular downward spiral seem forming, bank felt intervention could positive effect change market expectations. this base part bank’s conclusion exchange rate already drop reconcilable long-term equilibrium economy. the central bank expend substantial sum intervene foreign exchange market, isk 40 billion total, without suffice halt slide króna. at best, may slow depreciation economy cool somewhat, also contribute make inflationary impact exchange rate drop le would otherwise been. an article gerður ísberg þórarinn g. pétursson february’s issue central bank’s monetary bulletin describe bank’s action foreign exchange market 2000 2001 ass impact. the article conclude definitively best intervention short-term effect case market soon return previous situation. in words, conclusion intervention foreign exchange market strong prevail current precious little effect unless accompany correspond change domestic interest rates. this full accord experience countries. in recent public discussion claim often make exchange rate króna far high central bank need take step bring again. the fact matter bank’s mean control exchange rate overestimate power market underestimate claim make central bank can, actions, direct króna specific level. the proposal made, instance, central bank cut interest rate substantially aim low exchange rate. in context point bank cut policy rate substantially, 10.4% year ago (11.4% two year ago) 5.3% present. the bank’s nominal policy rate low since 1994 real policy rate low since 1996. the domestic foreign interest rate differential narrow significantly. in addition, central bank’s interest rate estimate equilibrium interest rate thus stimulate effect economy. the impact interest rate change generally visible certain time lag, prompt one conclude effect major decrease interest rate past year yet fully felt. a well known, exchange rate króna plummet 2000 2001, quite time substantially level reconcilable long-term equilibrium. this occur time price key export high, make year 2000 2001 especially favourable export sector fact also import compete sectors. enterprise sector understandably feel effect rise exchange rate. it expected, however, condition arise sector prevailed, example, 2001 early part 2002. in connection could mention that, base prediction performance make financial enterprises, contribution margin fishery company fairly good year, although good 2001 2002, quite exceptional. in february issue monetary bulletin, central bank publish analysis propose major construction project east iceland1 possible response economic management. the article conclude unless economic counter-measures taken, project create overheat economy, inflation instability. although scope considerable, project large economic stability cannot preserve inflation contain mean appropriate response economic management. mitigate measure would effective involve monetary fiscal restraint, well internal adjustment national economy, include rise exchange rate. the restraint show fiscal side, le need raise interest rates. a high króna exchange rate also mean le cause raise interest rates. the exchange rate fairly stable spring 2002 early winter. it begin rise continue steadily early february year. the central bank state view exchange rate rise recent month primarily due effect propose major construction project east iceland. the operation aluminium smelter likely cause equilibrium exchange rate króna high otherwise. furthermore, appear evident influx foreign currency connection project considerable, high domestic interest rate otherwise. all affect market expectation make króna exchange rate high would absence plan major development east iceland. the economy could thus say already begin adaptation come projects, i.e. exchange rate adjustment begin even well way. in view already said, clear industry business iceland prepare high exchange rate would case without major development. it naturally demand careful management cost-cutting operation required. a mention previously, central bank iceland practice inflation target intend keep inflation close possible 2½% per year. the bank’s late forecast predict inflation slightly mark next two years, 2%. follow forecast, bank cut policy rate 0.5 percentage points.. all thing equal, mean inflation slightly high assume forecast. be interest rate low significantly current level, would likely set new wave inflation instability, would advantage neither wage earner industry. a mentioned, seem overestimation possibility central bank control market rate exchange. but, also point out, bank’s intervention foreign exchange market, expend large sum 2000 2001, short-lived effect. in connection, also note since last autumn central bank regularly purchase foreign currency domestic interbank market. when decision announced, state bank intend purchase equivalent isk 20 billion currency end 2003. to start bank purchase usd 1.5 million monday wednesday week. this january bank also begin purchase amount friday well, february purchase add tuesday thursdays. currently bank thus purchase usd 7.5 million week, equivalent usd 390 million yearly basis. even though impact purchase exchange rate likely slight long term, generally case intervention foreign exchange market, króna rate somewhat low would otherwise case. 1 aluminium smelter relate power plants. a previously point out, central bank spend equivalent isk 40 billion try shore fall króna year 2000 2001. a result, bank’s net external position worsen significantly since time currency reserve considerable extent maintain foreign short-term loans. the bank’s plan purchase equivalent isk 20 billion foreign currency, announce last autumn, involve pay least major portion short-term debt. this also primary purpose purchases. the decision foreign currency purchase take completely different condition exist late winter major development project east iceland change plan reality. the central bank’s foreign currency reserve currently isk 36 billion (usd 460 million) could argue need considerably greater. consider new circumstance alter outlook due expect major development result influx foreign currency, bar unexpected change central bank likely continue regular purchase foreign currency domestic interbank market even reach isk 20 billion point. by bank would avail opportunity boost foreign currency reserve beyond would otherwise practical. public discussion recent week characterise considerable criticism central bank monetary policy. from bank’s point view, debate seem bite peculiar respects, least view typically attribute basis writings, speech statement issue bank executives. a point out, people also seem overrate ability central bank direct market developments, well expect strive achieve sort objective practically possibility accomplishing, fact part role, ensure certain exchange rate, full employment, etc. after introduction inflation target 2001, central bank specific objective far exchange rate concerned. this accordance policy target inflation float exchange rate. this interpret mean bank completely disinterested development exchange rate. this true. the exchange rate króna important, event past year two sufficient indication that. a bank previously point out, real exchange rate present far average past 20 years, much average past 10 years. the nominal exchange rate since begin year fact slightly low month two year ago. the exchange rate króna determine situation strength national economy, external equilibrium market expectations. the present exchange rate thus reflect considerable extent factor central bank little influence. the large exchange rate fluctuation 2000 2002 attribute specific circumstances, exchange rate unlikely fluctuate substantially immediate future period. it bear mind, however, nature icelandic economy small size mean currency fluctuation rule great currency large economies. in connection, however, also point euro lose one-quarter value u dollar begin 1999 bottom out, since time rise one-fifth. the central bank unconcerned exchange rate, limit mean influence development, explained. there much bank restrain currency fluctuations. a substantial low interest rate could possibly force exchange rate somewhat, would mean sacrifice important objective precious little gain. the joint declaration issue government central bank march 2001 state bank intervene development foreign exchange market buy sell foreign currency deem necessary order achieve inflation target, concern exchange rate fluctuation could threaten financial stability. there cause present. a i mentioned, primary objective central bank’s monetary policy foster price stability. price stability recognise prerequisite long-term economic growth thus improve welfare. the central bank lighten monetary restraint substantially recent months. in course ten months, policy rate cut significantly, result real policy rate low since 1996, i mentioned. at time, bank also give notice relaxation envisage form low require reserve central bank. the impact recent interest rate cut yet fully reflect economy. although claim frequently advance real exchange rate króna currently high, central bank cannot influence real exchange rate except limit time. too much relaxation monetary policy present would prepare grind next period over-expansion inflation, accordant instability. a mentioned, central bank announce interest rate cut 0.5 percentage point early month plan relax reserve requirements. the announcement bank’s decision also point oppose argument whether extent relaxation monetary restraint would implemented. follow announcement interest rate cut, government announce plan allocate fund various construction project support employment, several local authority follow suit. furthermore, appear likely work get underway year enlargement norðurál aluminium smelter power development link it. these factor naturally take consideration decision monetary policy week month come. a i mention beginning, framework monetary policy change 2001 introduction inflation targeting. this line international development recent years, result central bank entrust single main objective, i.e. promote price stability. price stability set primary objective monetary policy inflation monetary phenomenon. there little point set objective monetary policy cannot achieve. apply monetary policy achieve price stability also contribute economic stability. this, turn, prerequisite future growth economy make efficient use scarce resources. other public authorities, industry interest group also need adapt decision accord inflation targeting. bi review 12/2003 1 alan greenspan: global finance - slowing? remark mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, bank france international symposium monetary policy, economic cycle, financial dynamics, paris, france, (via satellite), 7 march 2003. * * * for least past twenty years, process financial globalization rapidly advancing. the development new financial products, notably wide variety over-the-counter (otc) derivatives, removal many barrier international capital mobility tighten linkage among global financial markets. a result, capital flow freely across national border search high risk-adjusted rate return. at point, globalization undoubtedly reach maturity. financial innovation slow approach world financial market complete sense financial risk efficiently transfer will bear them. equivalently, institutional legal impediment cross-border flow eliminated, bias allocation save toward local investment reduce minimum, opportunity arbitrage across national market disappear. in lecture today, i consider whether sign globalization near maturity. in particular, pace financial innovation begin slow? do pattern capital flow suggest global financial market approach full integration? and, important, answer question imply regard potential future contribution globalization economic growth financial stability? ha pace financial innovation begin slow? although pace innovation cannot measure precision, important new instrument continue emerge. credit derivative arise early mid-1990s. still recent marriage derivative securitization technique form synthetic collateralize debt obligation (cdos). these instrument broaden range investor will provide credit protection pool unbundling credit risk creation security best fit preference risk return. the combination derivative securitization technique apply grow range underlie assets. additionally, way otc derivative trade settle clearly could significantly improved. despite, perhaps of, rapid pace product development, derivative industry still execute trade predominantly telephone confirm fax. system electronic execution confirmation trade require degree standardization large measure cooperation require develop new instruments. still, derivative industry long history cooperate standardize documentation, disappoint little progress make adopt efficient reliable mean execute confirm trades. we must also consider broadly recent innovation adopted. of course, growth otc derivative past twenty year spectacular show obvious sign abating. the late estimate bank international settlement worldwide notional amount otc derivative outstanding reach $128 trillion june 2002, figure 25 percent large record year earlier. such derivative become indispensable risk-management tool many large corporations. yet recent study draw u.s. security exchange commission file indicate that, year-end 1997, little half 1,000 large u.s. non-financial corporation use otc exchange-traded derivatives.1 more detailed, comprehensive timely data available american bank organizations. those data show although fifty large u.s. bank organization use derivative september 1 see w. guay s.p. kothari, “how much do firm hedge derivatives?” journal financial economics, forthcoming. 2002, 5 percent u.s. bank firm use type derivative. in case otc credit derivatives, prove particularly effective risk management, mere 0.2 percent u.s. bank organization begin use tools. even among fifty largest, le half use instruments. thus, judge data use derivatives, potential financial innovation broad impact thereby continue contribute globalization appear considerable. evidence financial globalization capital flow implicit criterion complete globalization opportunity cross-border arbitrage disappear global save flow irrespective location investment project high risk-adjusted rate return.2 a half-century ago, harry markowitz show mathematically investor reduce variance, hence riskiness, portfolio give expect return diversify asset imperfectly correlate returns.3 subsequent research show foreign asset excellent candidate diversification.4 direct barrier capital flows, restriction foreign purchase domestic asset limitation ability domestic resident invest abroad, promote home bias, although, i discus shortly, many direct obstacle recent decade mitigated. indirect barriers, high cost foreign transactions, inadequate information foreign investment cultural linguistic difference foreign domestic investors, also see sustain home bias. and finally, exchange rate country risks. wild swing exchange rate entirely erase earn foreign assets, even asset yield healthy return local currencies. concern bear exchange-rate risk or, alternatively, bear cost hedge risk additional factor retard international investment. along foreign exchange risk, political risk help drive wedge foreign domestic perception expect risk-adjusted return asset. the consequence dual expectation low market clear price asset low level foreign investment would exist absence distortions. aside direct indirect barriers, people seem prefer invest familiar local business even though currency country risk exist. the unite state barrier interstate investment, state share common currency, culture, language, legal system, yet study show individual investor even professional money manager slight preference investment community states. trust, crucial aspect investing, likely foster familiarity local communities. researcher consistently find that, general, investor direct much save domestically. owe risk aversion, tend, detriment, over-discount foreign returns. such suboptimal allocation capital low live standard everywhere. in seminal paper twenty year ago, feldstein horioka point that, net, nations’ save generally invest domestically.5 their research imply global save inefficiently distribute investment, mean saver bear much risk return achieve country high-potential investment project get le finance 2 risk-neutral investors, exist, price asset solely basis expect return. but best, human risk neutral. in general, investor require asset’s price discount risk-neutral price compensation bear risk. the amount compensation require vary actual riskiness, variance, asset’s return investor’s degree risk aversion. if familiarity reduce investor’s uncertainty expect return asset, one would expect investor would discount unfamiliar asset heavily familiar assets. in case, difference foreign domestic investors’ familiarity investment would lead under-investment foreigner relative domestic investors, leave irreducible minimum bias toward invest locally. it thus total risk, neutral risk, arbitraged. 3 h. markowitz,”portfolio selection,” journal finance, vol. 7, no. 1 (1952), pp. 77-91. 4

financial globalization that, extent reduce home bias, save good direct promise investment world, increase global economic growth prosperity. however, long risk aversion exist trust enhance local familiarity, cannot expect home bias fully dissipate. nevertheless, globalization least reduce home bias toward minimum level? survey data collect unite state suggest large swing toward foreign investment. u.s. resident begin increase share foreign asset portfolio le 9 percent late 1970s 15 percent mid-1990s. since then, trend level off. the increase allocation foreign asset broad based, encompass portfolio flow debt equity security well foreign direct investment. a substantial part swing hold foreign asset u.s. resident coincide significant liberalization capital account develop emerging-market economies. in western europe, good market become increasingly integrated, capital account follow suit. start 1980s, control foreign exchange inbound outbound capital flow relaxed. in japan, most-restrictive capital control relax early 1980s, major liberalization come mid-1990s “big bang” financial reform measures. similarly, many emerging-market economy remove weaken currency capital account control 1990s. one cross-country study find that, 1983 1998, capital account openness improve markedly.6 with increase experience, u.s. investor doubtless improve familiarity foreign investment opportunities, home bias, accordingly, declined. data financial flow unite state indicate foreign purchase u.s. security foreign direct investment unite state begin pick early 1990s, surge past four years. a similar pattern apparent accumulate foreign hold security issue u.s. residents. a late 1998, foreign resident own 6 percent u.s. equities, 2001 figure rise almost 15 percent. reliable data capital flow security hold outside unite state scarce, data muster tell similar story. although international diversification appear increase past two decades, remain puzzle that, i mention previously, share foreign asset u.s. residents’ portfolio begin plateau mid-1990s level still well full diversification. this outcome might indicate either substantial indirect barrier capital flow still exist irreducible home bias among u.s. investor inhibit geographic diversification. formidable indirect institutional barrier low home bias beyond i allude early obviously remain. legal restriction foreign ownership domestic asset limit flow domestic fund abroad significant. informal disclosure practice favor local investor may lead information asymmetry - is, advantage domestic resident acquire information prospective investment - discourage foreign investment country. these asymmetry may exacerbate difference corporate governance local norm fairness diverge foreign standards, undercut trust. this unfamiliarity foster risk aversion elevate home bias. recent study suggest differ disclosure corporate governance standard preserve home bias. researcher show that, countries, hold control interest firm yield significant benefit accrue minority shareholders, substantial portion home bias country attribute local hold closely hold firms.7 additionally, staff federal reserve board international monetary fund show that, firm emerging-market economy meet u.s. standard disclosure protection minority shareholder rights, u.s. resident hold theoretically predict proportion company share portfolios.8 thus, appear improvement global report corporate governance standard could significantly reduce global home bias. 6 j. miniane, “a new set measure capital account

denominate foreign currency transfer risk agent either great appetite risk long investment horizon smooth losses. even imposition capital controls, foreign exchange restrictions, devaluation fix currency least partially hedge nondeliverable forward contract settle dollar change value underlie currency pre-determined period. credit default swap allow agent hedge exchange even sovereign risk. argentina’s recent default provide powerful test new derivative prove worth, perhaps even help limit contagion. the development derivative markets, particularly small economy idiosyncratic risk may difficult hedge, likely facilitate great cross-border flow productive distribution global savings. the coincident development local derivative market may facilitate development local currency bond market small emerging-market economy give foreign domestic investor tool hedge exposure country risk. what be real economic implication financial globalization? it apparent process financial globalization come long way yet incomplete. further development lead enrichment growth develop economy global save efficiently direct capital accumulation country marginal product capital highest. another possible result process financial globalization increasingly large international payment imbalance country export capital run current account surplus receive capital run current account deficits. however, development necessarily take sign systemic problem. they can, fact, sign global economy become efficient direct capital asset high risk-adjusted rate return. along way, economy liberalize first great extent, credibly commit respect property right foreigners, may receive great portion free-flowing capital thus potentially great net inflow large current account deficits. this process may contribute recent expansion u.s. current account deficit. that expansion coincide steady appreciation u.s. dollar late 1990s, suggest net demand u.s. asset important factor drive significant widen u.s. current account deficit. a note earlier, u.s. savers’ appetite increase share portfolio devote foreign asset begin wane, roughly time capital account liberalization country free large pool save invest internationally. these newly free save flow disproportionately unite states, consequence one must assume risk-adjusted return perceive highest. apparently, rapid u.s. productivity gain see elsewhere raise expectation return capital u.s. assets. moreover, asian crisis 1997 combine russian default year late reverse global investors’ enthusiasm investment develop economies. the crisis remind foreign investor indirect barrier continue exist, especially develop world: lack adequate corporate disclosure governance; underdeveloped, often capricious, legal structure contract dissolution bankruptcy; ex post government intervention favor domestic resident foreign investors. capital flow emerging-market economies, record level throughout early 1990s, dry result. in contrast, deep broad financial market unite state well-developed legal system long history respect private property draw record financial flow unite states. the lesson draw, however, continue financial globalization draw ever great amount capital unite state even industrial world generally. there limit accumulation net claim economy persistent current account deficit imply. the cost service claim add current account deficit and, certain circumstances, destabilizing. the gross size global quarterly annual surplus match deficit rise indirect barrier cross-border investment eliminate home bias reduced. however, portfolio adjustment presumably continuously ameliorate imbalances. a international account report standard become better, information asymmetry currently exist foreign domestic investor diminish. adequate disclosure will, one hopes, accompany development institution reduce corruption, improve corporate governance, respect private property right minority shareholders. together growth deep broad market derivatives, development low risk cross-border investment, make wide array world’s asset attractive international investors. despite much progress, process global financial integration far complete. though direct barrier international capital flow eliminated, numerous indirect barrier remain place. while dazzle array financial innovation sprout recent decades, inability market participant hedge, trade, share certain risks, especially relate cross-border investment, imply financial market still need innovation deepening. such barrier capital flow preserve home bias impede efficient distribution global save productive investments. we must remember financial globalization mature consequence economy cannot ignore. global capital flow increase size switch direction easily. a result, temporary imbalance naturally occur time time. to counter these, need consider various multilateral policy initiatives, international account standard international capital requirement banks, “new financial architecture” crisis prevention resolution mechanisms. also, market participant need enhance ability manage vast quantity collateral integral globalize modern finance. our goal include global financial stability, also promotion free flow capital direct productive us throughout world. that goal bring great financial stability prosperous

examine intersection finance macroeconomics theoretical longer-run empirical perspective. i think might interest after-dinner entertainment bring topic - current economic monetary policy situation. in particular, number commentator raise specter imbalance create market consumer durable good house - unsustainably high price activity - produce macroeconomic strain when, inevitably, correct. these concern obviously echo express observer monetary policy allow run-up equity price capital spend 1990s ultimately prove destabilizing. in context, i think might useful consider choice information available central bank relate question - real time - without aid 20-20 hindsight. i want emphasize follow focus question imbalance house durables intend comprehensive discussion outlook u.s. economy, depend wide array influence i addressing. i note view question necessarily represent colleague federal open market committee.1 monetary policy backdrop the basic story straightforward: in response series development curtail aggregate demand unite states, federal reserve ease policy aggressively, cut federal fund rate 5-1/4 percentage point two years, bring real federal fund rate zero. the important contributor economic weakness sharp contraction investment spend equity price business investor re-evaluated profitability capital spend productive capacity build late 1990s. the low interest rate boost investment house consumer durables, help offset drag decline business investment damp effect drop household wealth consumer spending. these policy action keep economy soften even inflation drop already low levels. to considerable extent, monetary policy ease work differently today past: it stimulate interest-sensitive spending. but many force work cycle require interest rate work effect household spend shoulder unusually heavy burden support growth. unlike cycle recent u.s. economic experience, weakness initiate cutback investment spending. this contrast illustrate chart1 show spend relative gdp number component investment. while business fix investment, show upper panel, typically drop gdp economy weakens, recent episode remarkable couple ways. first, drop high-tech share, red line, unprecedented. second, drop share non-high-tech equipment, black line, unusually steep, exceed 1979-82 episode, contraction output far deeper. another unusual aspect current cycle equity price wealth continue move low long interest rate start fall keep decline well economy seem bottom out. this pattern appear occur re-evaluation corporate profitability persist time; last summer's revelation corporate misdeeds; recent increase perception geopolitical risk. these concern continue raise risk spread credit markets, damp passthrough low policy interest 1 john robert board's staff contribute preparation remarks. 2 bi review 11/2003 rate cost business credit. with uncertainty high financial market skittish, firm remain hesitant commit cash investment slow turn around. in addition, economic weakness sharp decline equity price widespread globally, and, recently, development help keep dollar strong despite reduction interest rates. sluggish growth economy trade partner relatively high dollar hold net exports, blunt another potential channel monetary policy ease bolster spending. in late 1990s, rise dollar reflect global perception expand investment opportunity unite state result current account deficit provide safety valve strong domestic demand meet part high foreign production. but even though need safety valve anymore, current account deficit continue increase late, require easy monetary policy keep domestic demand elevate relative domestic income. in low panel, chart 1 also give sense extent household investment carry economy. economic contraction frequently lead weakness household sector, often respond high interest rate federal reserve act reverse inflation pressures. this pattern see chart, spend share house consumer durables typically drop sharply recessions. in episode, however, share continue move slightly higher, despite pronounce drop wealth weak economy. thus, household investment stay unusually strong throughout recession early recovery, buoyed, doubt, low interest rates. go forward: the benign scenario a consequence, expect stock interest-sensitive investment good - present circumstances, especially car house - great would otherwise be. and demand house strong, perhaps surprise house price probably high otherwise would be. but judge steep upward slope yield curve, see interest rate hold current level indefinitely. when, point, interest rate rise typical levels, desire stock good likely would fall, hold factor equal, restrain interest-sensitive spending. but important remember increase interest rate would occur vacuum; would occur economy look grow vigorously. most economist expect pronounce step-up pace activity bring recovery business investment current subdue levels. in case, need high level spend house reduced. and high interest rate instrumental bring adjustment house expenditure require keep economic activity overshoot potential. in principle, house durables boom induce monetary policy need entail bust would painful economy. of course, likely occur smoothly that. among things, market could get wrong - example, could anticipate great strength underlie demand actually occurring. then, high interest rate would tend damp spend unduly. but “automatic stabilizer” aspect interaction financial market economy. a investor realize error, rate would fall back. and market would likely get nudge federal reserve: we would set rate low market build in, various statement would attempt make clear assessment economic prospects. interest rate could stay low extend period, desire stock house would remain elevated, house investment would remain high well. but would required. alternatively, business investment could snap back fast expected. in case, interest rate would rise rapidly extent strength demand become clear - with, undoubtedly, help federal reserve - weaken household investment sharply would required. with production currently well potential inflation inflation expectation low, doubtful temporary misalignment rate would result development perceptible inflation pressure federal reserve would time take countervail steps. cost risk benign scenario so far i paint rather sanguine picture longer-term consequence monetary-policy-induced boom household investment. while story virtue plausibility bi review 11/2003 3 internal consistency, involve feature bear thought. first, benign scenario rely transfer productive resource across sector - particular, involve primarily inflow resource residential construction sector. presumably, transfer resource entail cost - retrain perhaps relocation workers, different mix capital, forth. if residential construction eventually shrink interest rate rose, cost would incur resource shift yet different uses. another possibility reality house consumer durables boom may work neatly benign scenario would suggest. indeed, draw comparison high-tech investment boom peak 2000. a event unfolded, appear firm conclude investment undertake year justified; subsequent drop investment suggest that, hindsight, firm conclude “overinvested” high-tech equipment; sharp cutback investment create recession. be possible, commentator asked, current boom house durables leave u similar regret years? furthermore, price house rise fast inflation recent years, reminiscent surge equity price 2000. some analyst argue loose monetary policy feed bubble house price eventually burst.2 in short, question whether stimulus household investment, cushion economic cycle near-term, set stage great instability long run. take concern turn: reallocation costs. there little doubt costly build commercial enterprise. worker must hired, office space rented, equipment purchased, management expertise redirected. all action entail costs. at time, i already noted, yield curve indication, interest rate one day go back up, give rise possibility current expansion construction firm eventually need unwound. so rely house sector offset weakness elsewhere economy clearly entail costs. but cost need put cost underutilized resources. facilitate increase residential construction put resource use would otherwise lie idle. implicit conventional story assumption cost unemployment significantly great cost shift resource across sectors; so, presence adjustment cost seriously impede desire offset weakness spend elsewhere great spend household investment. alternatively, judgment adjustment cost large, shock demand temporary, might argue direction measure policy response. while hard know sure important adjustment cost may be, worth note that, historically, considerable variation employment production residential construction sector. seasonal fluctuation residential construction quite large, business cycle early 1970s early 1990s, uncommon house start drop half. so appear sector economy evolve way expand contract rapidly. moreover, current episode, falloff commercial construction free many resource readily put work build house now, shift back business spend pick up. similarly, even strong sale light motor vehicle consumer durables last year, capacity utilization industry part remain moderate levels, suggest additional production induce monetary stimulus occur without important costly new investment production capacity.3 2 another possibility buildup debt associate strength household investment feedback adversely financial conditions, especially boom unwinds. such consequence could occur even absence “bubble” house price household overextend lender take adequate precaution even measure drop collateral values. however, link debt burden consumer spend tenuous best, measure consistent basis, burden look especially large. moreover, loan-to-value ratio mortgage flat, leave ample cushion moderate house price declines, occur. these observation suggest widespread credit difficulty important macroeconomic effect unlikely interest rate rise. for reason, keep subject manageable, i deal debt associate acquire house durables. 3 the exception light trucks, capacity utilization reach 97 percent third quarter 2002. 4 bi review 11/2003 in sum, seem cost shift resource across sector concern now. this especially true consider resource would quite possibly otherwise idle. that say cost might loom large circumstance - say resource temporarily shift tradeable good nontradeable service sector - though policymakers critic would still also need mindful cost keep people unemployed. excesses. perhaps challenge question whether excess imbalance build could create economic instability future unwound. it hard see issue arises. chart 2 show real house price rise rapidly last years. on constant quality basis, new house price still breach peak late 1970s, price exist home sky-rocketed. moreover, see chart 3, stock consumer durables rise elevate rate last years; stock house grow moderately, pace maintain years. the difficulty real-time identification imbalance hard overstate. one never sure well event whether price quantity indeed deviate sustainable levels, sustainable level never observable must estimated, estimate quite sensitive assumption made. this point especially true asset prices: for example, literature equity price exchange rate indicate hard beat random walk. a similar point make investment capital stock - include stock house durables. a recent experience business capital graphically illustrates, excess clearly evident fact - size over-investment may disputable even then. all said, identify number factor affect i call “sustainable” stock house consumer durable good - level would desire time particular level interest rate key determinant demand. among determinant wealth, permanent income, user cost own good - effect “price.” that price, turn, depend importantly rate interest. the demand house asset may also reflect specific institutional changes. in particular, recent decades, rise home equity line credit low cost mortgage refinance mean house wealth become increasingly “liquid,” consequence, may become attractive. chart 4 compare actual level stock house consumer durables desire level derive board staff's “frb/us” model u.s. economy, use current interest rate historical averages. somewhat surprisingly, estimate conventional approach suggest that, current interest rates, exist stock house consumer durables appreciably sustainable levels. in model, low interest rate powerful effect desire stock house durables. even estimate sustainable level base historical average interest rates, conclude method current house durables stock line long-run demand.4 we need keep mind rough estimate unobservable variables. but are, suggest interest rate rise find leave vast oversupply house durables. what house prices? unfortunately, i already noted, asset price even hard model investment. just equity price think present discount value future benefit equity ownership - principle, dividend share repurchase - house price think present discount value future benefit home-ownership, which, theory, potential market value rent house. and, rate return equity fall along interest rates, rental rate return houses. with rent change slowly time, ought expect that, thing equal, low interest rate would raise house prices. in addition, household may weigh house alternative investment bonds. in regard, collapse expectation gain hold equity undoubtedly make real estate relatively attractive, contribute price increase high activity. on supply side market, scarcity desirable land relative population growth naturally put upward pressure prices. in addition, productivity construction lag gain 4 this conclusion prove relative robust alternative model use vary definition permanent income wealth. in models, elasticity demand house relative user cost 0.5 consumer durables 0.9. bi review 11/2003 5 overall productivity nonfarm businesses. consequently, surprise see price house rise relative price good services. the combination demand supply factor cause house price gain outstrip per caput income gain recent years. the top chart 5 show ratio house price per caput disposable income increase substantially since 1998. but owe decline mortgage rates, make house le affordable. the bottom chart 5 show index house “affordability,” compare mortgage payment typical home median household income; high level index mean great affordability. although house price outpace income much late 1990s, house remain quite affordable historical standards. it appear rise price mean market support increasingly narrow base, give increase income decline interest rates. if interest rate rise real mortgage rate equal long-term average, affordability index would drop back, level would still leave house affordable second half 1980s. conclusion: implication policy choice in sum, rise house price increase household investment house consumer durables appear line might expect current environment low interest rate continue growth real disposable incomes. judge analysis, bear mind inherently tentative - speculative - character, seem likely economy strengthen interest rate rise response, household investment price likely soften relative recent trends, break precipitously. house car would provide impetus economic activity often past recoveries, appear set replicate experience fiber-optic cable. we make inference inexact proxy desire stock sustainable prices. no one could definitively rule possibility home construction price could drop sharply. undoubtedly occur local markets, could become widespread. but odds would seem favor measure response inevitable tighten policy recovery business investment pick steam, consistent keep economy sustainable growth track rather become another source macroeconomic instability. and weigh odds policy about: make choice real time, use incomplete knowledge future asset market behavior, weigh potential cost benefit economic performance time alternative policy strategies. by low interest rate aggressively, federal reserve undoubtedly shift form economic activity future present. in effect, try cushion effect decision private sector postpone business capital spend now. adjustment cost aside, appear minor, clear would want bring construction spend future, likely part economy would weak. it make sense build house car now, cost relatively low, rather waiting. and build keep people employ reduce risk deflation. all all, perspective, knowledge analysis available me, policy choice make seem consistent foster legislate goal maximum employment, stable prices, moderate long-run interest rates, near term, likely long run well. 6 bi review 11/2003 bi review 11/2003 7 8 bi review 11/2003 bi review 11/2003 9 10 bi review 11/2003 bi review 11/2003 1 alan greenspan: home mortgage market remark mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, annual convention independent community banker america, orlando, florida, (via satellite), 4 march 2003. * * * last year surely one memorable year ever experience home mortgage market. owe largely low mortgage interest rate three decade rise home prices, close 10 million regular home mortgage refinanced. i use term regular mortgage exclude home equity construction loans. the outsized dollar volume refinance - estimates, $1-3/4 trillion net cash-outs - all-time record represent almost one-third value regular home mortgage outstanding begin last year. total regular mortgage originations, $2-1/2 trillion, also proceed record pace. a part 2002's process refinancing, household “cashed out” almost $200 billion accumulate home equity, net fees, taxes, points, commissions. that represent almost 3 percent estimate total home equity begin year, slightly 2001 share. in year prior 2001, best judge, cash-outs exceed 1-3/4 percent total home equity. of last year's cash-outs, approximately $70 billion apparently apply repayment home-equity loans, significant part employ reduce higher-cost credit card debt, judge slow pace growth installment debt outstanding. previous federal reserve survey disposition cash-outs indicate substantial amount - perhaps half - use finance home modernization personal consumption expenditures, outlay directly affect gdp jobs, likely case last year. low mortgage rate doubtless motivate much spending, ready availability home equity extraction appear also play substantial independent role prompt additional household expenditures. even recently late 1980s, family want use house wealth finance consumption would face expensive time-consuming process. although substantial home equity wealth exist many years, last decade secure borrow home equity become cost-effective source credit wide variety circumstances. an even great support economy cash-outs last year extraction home equity associate record 6.4 million exist home sales, include condos, record prices. this pace ownership turnover exist house stock also reflect near-record-low mortgage rates. we estimate mortgage origination exist home purchase last year top $600 billion. subtract home sellers' repayment remain debt outstanding mortgages, infer net increase approximately $350 billion debt home turn last year. that debt increase exactly match extraction previously built-up equity home plus fee tax fold loans. not surprisingly, change mortgage debt highly correlate realize capital gain turnover homes. we direct measure equity extract last year's home turnover expended. it likely, however, home sellers, set aside payment family's next home, expend considerable part home equity extraction good services. in addition extraction equity finance regular mortgage last year, approximately $130 billion draw net increase home equity loans, also record, also presume consequence low mortgage rate well accelerate appreciation homes. federal reserve study disposition home equity loan suggest slightly high rate repayment credit card consumer nonmortgage debt cash-out disposition survey concluded. all all, amount previously built-up equity extract owner-occupied home last year, net fee taxes, total $700 billion calculations, 10 percent estimate equity begin year. home equity extraction economy whole is, necessity, finance debt. in fact, $700 billion equity extraction similar increase mortgage debt last year. 2 bi review 11/2003 despite exceptionally large extraction equity, total remain equity end 2002 high dollar term begin year, owe 7 percent increase exist home price four quarter last year $300 billion new home construction, net mortgage extension homes. mortgage debt percent market value home accordingly rise somewhat 1 percentage point year. mortgage debt service cost percent disposable income homeowner last year little change 2001. the estimate 10 percent homeowners' disposable income allocate mortgage debt service third quarter last year well high 1991, though ratio homeowners' mortgage debt disposable income rise record high. refinance home purchase originations, seasonally adjusted, peak fourth quarter last year. it difficult imagine pace maintain current quarter. seasonally adjust application refinancings, report mortgage banker association, peak still impressively high. so home purchase mortgage applications. this suggest somewhat le robust market mortgage origination quarter. with home price increase subsiding, mortgage interest rate long decline last year's impressive pace, slowdown rate mortgage debt expansion expected. that likely case equity extraction home turnover well. a i note earlier, extraction appear parallel realize capital gain home sales, mainly reflect number exist home sales. home price change, course, also factor, average change length occupancy - nearly ten year typical homeowner - matters, recent price trends. similarly, refinance cash-outs associate accelerate last year decline mortgage interest rate new loan far exceed modest decline average rate outstanding regular home mortgages. this wide spread current mortgage rate rate outstanding loans, know, markedly increase incentive refinance. so stabilize rate new mortgage would narrow spread portfolio rate continue decline consequence continue refinance interest rate still portfolio average. a narrow spread would likely reduce cash-outs, lessen level equity extraction source. we estimate total home equity loan beyond end last year, line credit commercial bank - approximately fourth total home equity loan - rise first 7 week 2003, considerably typical seasonal change. in summary, frenetic pace home equity extraction last year likely appreciably simmer 2003, possibly notably lessen support household purchase good services. * * * the large flow mortgage fund past two year describe analyst possibly symptomatic emerge house bubble, unlike stock market bubble whose burst wreak considerable distress recent years. exist home price (as measure repeat-sales index) rise 7 percent 2002, third past four years. such pace cannot reasonably expect maintained. and recently, price increase clearly slowed. it is, course, possible home price fall couple quarter 1990. but analogy stock market price behavior bubble rather large stretch. first, sell home, one almost invariably must move process confront substantial transaction cost form brokerage fee taxes. these transaction cost greatly discourage type buy sell frenzy often characterize bubble financial markets. second, national house market unite states. local condition dominate, even though mortgage interest rate similar throughout country. home price portland, maine, arbitrage portland, oregon. thus, bubble might emerge would tend local, national, scope. third, little indication supply overhang newly construct homes. the level overall new home construction, include manufacture homes, appear well support steady household formation dependent high variable replacement need second-home demand. census bureau data suggest one-third one-half new household formation recent year result directly immigration. in evaluate possible prevalence house price bubbles, important keep mind home price tend consistently rise relative general price level country. in fact, bi review 11/2003 3 past half century, annual pace home price increase approximately 1 percentage point fast average rise gdp deflator. this high home-price inflation rate result persistently slow productivity growth new home construction economy overall. this lag productivity growth drive new home price relative general price level and, arbitrage, drive price exist home well. in addition, local build land use restriction continue constrain supply buildable land many areas, whose price increase also tend outstrip rate inflation. clearly, substantial run-up recent years, home price could recede. a sharp decline, consequence burst bubble, however, seem unlikely. nonetheless, even modestly decline home price would reduce level unrealized capital gain presumably dampen pace home equity extraction. home mortgage cash-outs home equity loan expansion would likely decline face decline home prices. however, five-year old home build mortgage finance boom le likely defuse decline home price rise mortgage interest rates. should rate rise, entirely possible new exist home sale would decline, lead low level realize capital gain homes, narrow refinance spread and, consequence, le overall home equity extraction. it worth bear mind, however, sustain increase rate presumably would occur context vigorous upturn pace business activity, suggest net effect house activity might relatively limited. * * * most aforementioned data new derive much broad home mortgage data system early stage

susan s bies: retirement savings, equity ownership, challenge investor speech m susan s bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, joint presentation national economics club committee status woman economics profession american economic association, washington, d.c., 27 february 2003. * * * good afternoon. i delight speak new challenge opportunity american family face change retirement save equity ownership unite states. i know many member economist work policy advisory role government. a economist enjoy get back ph.d. roots, i want also address traditional economic theory consumer behavior corporate governance are, times, apparent conflict practice observe. this turn raise issue appropriate economic policy framework decisionmaking. there dramatic shift employer-sponsored retirement plan past two decade - shift plan pension manager control investment retiree receive preset benefit plan worker directly control investment portfolio keep investment returns. many american family respond purchase corporate equity - frequently investment mutual fund institutional accounts. with increase control pensions, broad participation equity markets, american far option financial plan twenty year ago. but new opportunity come risk responsibilities. household control resource retirement great need employ sound financial planning. moreover, though many might unaware it, stock-owning household share responsibility oversight governance corporation own. the headline past couple year highlight importance risk responsibilities. we witness precipitous fall stock price spectacular corporate failure read account retirement save accrue long career lose matter weeks. some corporate meltdown accompany revelation shoddy audit practice stock analysis taint conflict interest. and ensure sound corporate governance often unwilling unable protect interest shareholders. recent development suggest household may, come years, take even responsibility retirement save assume additional responsibility corporate governance. the president's recently release budget 2004 would considerably expand tax-preferred save account american families. and newly adopt security exchange commission rule give investor unprecedented access proxy-voting record mutual fund enable encourage investor take active role corporate governance. with backdrop, i would like start discuss challenge confront families, employers, policymakers worker assume great control retirement planning. later, i turn issue relate individual investors' role corporate governance. retirement save the american pension landscape change dramatically past twenty years. mostly go day company address workers' retirement need solely pay fix pension retirement death. today's worker much likely manage retirement resource participate employee-directed save accounts. this trend greatly expand workers' responsibility retirement planning. but also raise significant new question effectively employee handle new freedom responsibilities, appropriate role employer help worker plan retirement. what lie behind two-decade trend toward worker-directed save accounts? company like relieve firm burden manage pension fund finance promise benefits. one need scan recent headline remind difficulty underfunded pension plan impose corporate balance sheets. with savings-account plan, contrast, company need set account let employee manage investments. and worker also like save account plans, provide choice portable - is, travel employee job job. a particularly popular type save plan 401(k), let worker make pre-tax contribution retirement account payroll deduction. twenty-five year ago 401(k) plan exist. today cover 40 million workers, take $150 billion annual contributions, hold asset worth $2 trillion. this significant development, along great flexibility 401(k) plan come great responsibility part individual direct retirement saving. worker must decide whether participate plan, much contribute every pay period, invest contributions, rebalance asset mix, balance change jobs. economic theory provide basis make type choices, problem complex average employee may develop skill formally evaluate alternatives. and, fact, recent research find trouble patterns: many worker participate employers' retirement plans, contribute small proportion wages, make questionable investment distribution choices. let take minute cite tell fact 401(k) plans. despite tax advantage 401(k) contributions, one-quarter worker eligible 401(k) plan participate all, even employer would match portion contributions.1 these worker effectively turn pay raise leave compensation table. and many participate save little. in survey last year, one-quarter firm report rank-and-file 401(k) participant save average le 4 percent pay.2 how plan affect retirement security long run? several study suggest many worker save adequately retirement.3 in 2001, among household retirement account approach retirement age, one-half balance le $55,000, one-quarter balance le $13,000.4 clearly balance size adequate finance many economic emergency barely supplement social security two three decade often follow retirement. there concern way employee manage 401(k) plans. some seem give little attention way contribution invested. for example, participant divide asset equally across available investment options, simply invest contribution accord plan defaults.5 and, make painfully clear last year, many 401(k) participant seem invest heavily employer stock.6 overall, one-quarter aggregate 401(k) balance company stock, many employee share far higher. why worker invest much company stock? the question particularly press workers' financial outcome already heavily dependent fortune employer. moreover, employer often require match contribution make behalf employee invest company stock. thus, employee invest contribution company stock, ratchet already-risky position. elementary finance theory suggest it. 1 deloitte touche, 2002 401(k) annual benchmarking survey. 2 deloitte touche, 2002 401(k) annual benchmarking survey. 3 for review, see olivia mitchell, brett hammond, anna

also shlomo benartzi, "excessive extrapolation allocation 401(k) account company stock," journal finance, vol. 56 (2001), pp. 1747-64. yet many worker believe employer's stock le risky broad market averages.7 what explain apparent disconnect? a someone hold large fraction 401(k) plan company's stock many years, perhaps i help answer question. there difference risk uncertainty. employee may feel le uncertain prospect company work relative company know little. this may make comfortable hold company's stock - even cost poorly diversify highly volatile portfolio. to summarize, experience show 401(k) plan offer worker unprecedented flexibility manage pensions, worker seem use effectively - contribute little, make questionable investment choices, fail participate all. in response, employer express increase interest employer-provided financial education. but employers' attention plan design turn important. contrary prediction traditional finance theory, way retirement-plan option frame worker affect choice make. this new discipline behavioral finance begin offer significant contributions. some innovative apparently effective idea retirement-plan design owe insight behavioral finance. a compel evidence frame matters, researcher find so-called "opt-out" plans, plan automatically enroll workers, significantly high participation rate plan require worker sign up.8 not surprisingly, employer respond make automatic enrollment prevalent: a recent survey find nearly quarter large plan either adopt automatic enrollment consider adopt it.9 but automatic enrollment may enough, since automatically enrol employee often give little attention default option plan. one study find half automatic enrollee move default even three year enrollment.10 this could problem default contribution rates, typically 3 percent pay, often low allow worker take full advantage employer matches, let alone build sufficient asset retirement. in fact, evidence low default rate reduce contribution among worker would likely save absence default. finally, default investment choice automatic enrollment plan typically least risky, money market stable value fund. while investment especially safe, expect return may low achieve long-term retirement security. subsequent research highlight employer might improve automatic enrollment plans. for example, might set high default contribution rate great default exposure diversify set higher-yielding assets. another possibility bring new employee board low contribution rate - often do currently - nudge contribution rate worker receive pay raises. some study show worker will pre-commit plan, eventually result significantly high rate savings.11 but along new opportunity employer come difficult new questions. how high employees' save rate go? in ideal world, employee would make well-informed save decision need encouragement employers. but, reality, plan's design affect financial well-being participants. and though default save rate 3 percent pay might seem low, employer necessarily good position know appropriate save rate be. a high default rate may inappropriate, particularly employee respond dissaving outside retirement plan. 7 vanguard center retirement research. vanguard participant monitor: expect low market return near term, december 2001. 8 brigitte madrian dennis shea, "the power suggestion: inertia

manuscript, 2001. many employer recoil make choices, want become paternalistic. but significant inescapable implication line recent research employer cannot avoid responsibility area, "neutral" plan design - whatever design choose affect retirement security employees. to summarize, past two decade bring remarkable expansion financial option available ordinary workers, include significant new tool retirement planning. but experience also reveal important lesson workers, companies, policymakers. while many - perhaps - worker effectively use new tool prepare retirement, not. moreover, participants' choice often affect presentation options. thus, company offer retirement save account 401(k) plan face delicate balance act. while desire shift maximum degree decisionmaking workers, must acknowledge basic plan-design choice affect long-term retirement security employees. company find right combination financial education plan design best position help employee prepare adequately retirement. equity ownership a american step use employee-directed save account past couple decades, many also purchase first share corporate equity - often within 401(k) plans. more half u.s. household either stock stock mutual funds.12 moreover, equity ownership reach young generation middle class 1980s. from 1989 2001, fraction american young 35 own stock doubled, stock ownership among family below-median income.13 this strike increase equity ownership is, part, outgrowth move toward worker-directed save plans, i've already discussed. more two-thirds u.s. stockholder hold stock employer-sponsored retirement plan.14 in addition, heighten popularity own stock probably reflect broaden understand potential benefit equity investment perhaps increase tolerance financial risk. also important, especially investor relatively modest means, mutual fund particular substantially reduce cost purchase diversify portfolio. despite ease corporate equity trade directly nowadays - on-line brokerage accounts, example - recent survey find two-thirds stockholder first buy equity share mutual funds.15 besides financial risk potential rewards, stock ownership impart important corporate governance responsibilities. in fact, economic theory firm behavior often stress compete interest management ownership. with ownership share business, every stock investor role provide oversight company run. the egregious corporate scandal headline last year highlight need responsible oversight corporate board shareholder alike check behavior management. so, look solution corporate governance problems, forget every individual own stock role - perhaps small one, important one. yet growth households' equity ownership come ironic twist: while household share corporations, many new stockholder unable play role corporate governance. why? because american largely purchase share pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, financial institutions. these financial intermediaries, act agent household investors, generally make much, any, effort make governance policy transparent responsive preference investors. 12 aizcorbe, ana, arthur kennickell, kevin moore, "recent change u.s. family

management governance mechanism shift institutions. there's good news, bad news, promise news report trend. the good news may reason expect institutional shareholder would especially active work good corporate governance. an institutional investor hold large block stock naturally reap reward good corporate governance individual hold small number shares, big institutional investor undoubtedly leverage management. in addition, individual buy stock institutions, task form shareholder coalition effect good governance ought become much easier. the bad news that, notable exceptions, institutional investor historically appear fairly passive shareholder tend shy away challenge management directly initiate reform-oriented proxy proposals. also institutional investor may face conflict interest provide active governance also compete sell financial service - like pension-plan administration - firm whose share hold. to sure, evidence institutional shareholder activism conflict interest limited, institutional investor provide information vote share portfolios. so, individual investor interest corporate governance unlikely able ascertain anything institutional investor vote share behalf. although institutional investor may active behind-the-scenes attempt promote good management decisions, detail effort make available public, ultimately bear risk stock ownership. and promise news? just last month, sec approve new rule require investment adviser mutual fund disclose proxy vote policy specific proxy votes. for investor mutual funds, new rule provide unprecedented information vote cast behalf. in fact, criticize new disclosure rule impose great burden mutual fund provide much information useful investors. but criticism miss point. disclosure proxy

age global population testimony mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, special committee aging, u.s. senate, washington, d.c., 27 february 2003. * * * mr. chairman member committee, i please today discus economic effect age global population. in doing, i would like emphasize view i express necessarily represent federal reserve board. the world's population grow old result decline fertility increase life expectancy. these trend manifest least two important dimensions: slowly grow population labor force, increase ratio elderly working-age population. the so-called elderly dependency ratio rise industrialize world least 150 years. the pace increase slow greatly birth baby-boom generation world war ii. but elderly dependency almost certainly rise rapidly generation reach retirement age. the acceleration particularly dramatic japan europe. for example, japan population share elderly, define least 65 year age, climb 12 percent 17 percent past decade, demographer expect reach 30 percent 2030. the absolute size japan's working-age population already decline project fall 20 percent next three decades. europe's working-age population also anticipate recede, share elderly overall population expect rise markedly, though le japan. the change project unite state severe project europe japan, nonetheless present daunt challenges. over next thirty years, growth rate working-age population unite state anticipate slow, 1 percent per year today 1/2 percent per year 2030. at time, percentage population 65 rise markedly - le 13 percent today perhaps 20 percent 2030. though overall population expect continue age, much age labor force already occur age baby-boom generation. once baby boomer begin retire, mean age u.s. labor force expect stabilize. these anticipate change age structure population work force result largely decline fertility occur follow birth baby-boom generation. after peak 1957 3-1/2 birth woman's lifetime, fertility rate unite state fell le 2 early 1970s, rise 2.1 1990.1 since then, fertility rate remain close 2.1, so-called replacement rate, level require hold population constant absence immigration change longevity. the decrease number child per family since baby boom inevitably led, lag, project increase ratio elderly working-age population. increase life expectancy, too, substantial. in 1950, man 65 year age could expect, average, live age 78, whereas expect live 81. and current trend continue, 2025 expect live 83 and, 2060, 85. women's life expectancy project increase amount, 81 1950 roughly 85 today, 86 2025 88 2060. of course, difficult predict age structure population distant future. although good idea size working-age population next twenty year - member largely already bear - forecast number child future immigration population growth much conjectural. just recently, example, unite nation revise forecast world fertility rate downward projection three year earlier; 1 the fertility rate use total fertility rate. it measure average number child would bear woman lifetime experience birth rate age observe give year. accord new forecast, world population expect begin actually decline latter part century, whereas previous forecast, expect continue growing. even substantial uncertainty surround forecasts, population age develop world likely temporary phenomenon, associate solely retirement baby-boom generation. rather, current projections, retirement generation view hasten transition current distribution age one population notably older. the population develop country likewise expect rise median age, remain significantly young grow fast population foreseeable future. eventually, decline fertility rate increase longevity may lead similar issue age population develop world likely well demographic transition unite states. a know, age population unite state significant effect fiscal situation. in particular, make social security medicare program unsustainable long run, short major increase immigration rates, dramatic acceleration productivity growth well beyond historical experience, significant increase age eligibility benefits, use general revenue fund benefits.2 indeed, accord intermediate projection social security trustees, level social security contribution current law begin fall short legislate benefit approximately 2017. while prospect shortfall social security reasonably certain give change composition population, range possible outcome medicare far wider. rapidly advance medical technologies, essentially inelastic demand medical service elderly, subsidize third-party payment system create virtually unconstrained demand.3 how finance pressure accompany increase retirement resolve profound, uncertain, effect structure private public pension plans. private pension asset already account 12 percent household financial asset unite states, level almost certainly increase next decade. the total investment income funds, conjunction retirees' form income, must sufficient finance satisfactory standard living. the real resource available fund pension benefit depend economy's long-term growth rate, simple term determine growth rate labor employ plus growth rate productivity labor. a already noted, 2030 growth rate working-age population expect decline half. the fraction working-age population actually employ doubtless affect improvement health change economic return working. labor productivity historically affect change amount capital available worker, pace technical progress and, perhaps subtly, change experience workforce. these element key assess economic effect aging. one natural response population age almost surely fit elderly population increase participation labor force. american live longer, generally live healthier. rate disability elderly declining, reflect improvement health change technology accommodate physical impairment associate aging. in addition, work become le physically strenuous demand intellectually, continue century-long trend toward conceptual le physical economic output. for example, 1900, one every ten worker professional, technical, managerial occupation. by 1970, proportion doubled, today type job account one-third workforce. despite improve feasibility work old ages, american retire young young ages. some analyst believe trend slowed, although anticipate rapid 2 because social security benefit tie productivity growth lag, rate productivity growth well historical experience could completely resolve social security’s long-term finance problem. 3 constrain outlay mechanism price involve form ration - approach past popular unite states. turnaround. but rise pressure retirement income grow scarcity experience labor could induce great labor-force participation. immigration, choose expand it, could prove even potent antidote slow growth working-age population. a influx foreign worker response tight labor market 1990s showed, immigration respond labor shortages. an expansion labor-force participation immigrant healthy elderly offer offset age population. however, heighten growth output per worker present great potential boost growth gross domestic product. a significant rise growth labor productivity necessary standard live retiree maintain worker continue advancing. one direct way raise growth output per hour increase save investment, augment capital stock available workers. another increase incentive innovation; efficiency gains, broadly defined, currently account roughly half growth labor productivity. though augment save investment raise future labor productivity thereby help provide age population, incremental benefit additional investment may affect aging. without grow labor force, amount new equipment use productively limited, return capital investment could decline consequence. what actually happen save rate next three decade depend importantly behavior baby-boom cohort retirement years. over post-world war ii period, elderly unite states, contrary conventional wisdom, seem draw save modestly. the reason entirely clear. often people bequeath significant proportion save child others rather spend retirement. if baby-boom generation continue pattern, u.s. household save rate may decline significantly, all. the fast rate age europe japan may also directly affect investment and, hence, growth labor productivity unite states. if save rate country decline, global capital flow unite state contribute significantly recent year finance domestic investment likely decline. a unite states, much depend extent retiree country draw savings. for example, save rate japan, even rapidly age population, decline extent predicted. however, household japan start consume save less, japan's trade surplus would likely shrink consumption import good rose. some elevate level import would export unite states, trade balance would improve, else equal. job require unskilled labor likely continue move develop countries, transfer may increase foreign direct investment u.s. firms. most develop country unlikely able offer high rate return already age fast unite states. many develop country potential offer high rate return young rapidly grow population currently low stock capital, realization potential far guaranteed. historically, return investment many develop country hold several inhibit factors: low level education, poor infrastructure, and, perhaps important all, capricious legal protections. clearly, net capital inflow unite state decline, must current account trade deficits. any decline must offset high domestic save - include government save - domestic investment plant equipment house maintained. future labor productivity, however, determine saving, investment, capital intensity. one remarkable feature economy past seven year acceleration pace innovative use capital workers, rather increase amount capital per worker. indeed, i point earlier, innovation account one-half rapid increase labor productivity observe late 1990s. therefore, important address possibility age affect rate innovation, either rearrangement exist capital resource technological advance. economist understand little technological progress occurs, research effect age population technological innovation sparse. on one hand, commentator worry age population lead le dynamic economy low rate technological progress; cite, example, fact majority nobel prize "hard" science award discovery make winner early careers. such issue may le import go forward, however, age workforce already occurred. on hand, slow rate growth decline working-age population may raise technological growth. although discovery new technology degree matter luck, know human activity respond economic incentives. a relative shortage worker increase incentive develop labor-saving technology may actually spur technological development. economic historian argue one reason unite state surpass great britain early nineteenth century leader technological innovation relative scarcity labor unite states. patent record period show innovation respond economic incentive scarcity labor clearly provide incentive develop new method production. * * * the age population mean government inevitably need make number change retirement programs. these change profound economic effects. for example, aside suppress economic growth, large increase payroll tax exacerbate problem reduction labor supply, whereas policy promote long work life ameliorate it. reduction benefit - change age receive full retirement benefit reform slow growth medicare spend mean - affect retirement, labor force, save behavior. in addition, policy link increase longevity time eligibility age social security, perhaps medicare, may need considered. such linkage would help protect financial and, hence, economic viability programs. the age population bind bring many change economy - foreseeable, many probably not. though challenge seem great, necessary adjustment likely small require develop countries. but adjust also matter. early initiative address economic effect baby-boom retirement could smooth transition new balance worker retirees. if delay, adjustment could abrupt painful. fortunately, u.s. economy uniquely well suit make adjustments. our open labor market adapt differ need ability old population. our capital market allow creation rapid adoption new labor-saving technologies, open society receptive immigrants. all factor put u good position adjust inexorability age population. bi review 16/2003 1 ian plenderleith: the aim operation monetary policy speech mr ian plenderleith, deputy governor south african reserve bank, merrill lynch macro day, johannesburg, 25 march 2003. * * * i honour delight opportunity join south african reserve bank deputy governor start year. a still much newcomer south african scene, i think i might take opportunity share early impression south african economy - specifically operation monetary policy, particular responsibility reserve bank i say outset impression positive. there is, view, great deal admire performance economy, contribution monetary policy make promote performance; parallel, great deal progress make press ahead structural reform, across wide front, order ensure economy fulfill potential future. perhaps remarkable achievement strike economic sphere south african economy continue achieve steady sustain growth past year despite global economic slowdown surround world economy. a world economy move slowdown past two year so, south african economy continue grow around 3% - not, sure, fast one would hope achieve favourable world environment, nonetheless great deal good many economy experienced. the current cyclical upswing south african economy, begin september 1999, progress 3½ years; and, look ahead, prospect encourage economy continue grow. how achieved? there doubt many contributory factors, i think important one coherent responsible macroeconomic policy framework authority steadily consistently pursue recent years, cover fiscal monetary policy. the fiscal side me, central banker, dwell on. but doubt steady commitment government show keep budget deficit low manageable level contain burden public sector debt deliver real benefit term strong sustainable structure public finances. the result, evident budget last month, that, economy grow revenue collection strengthened, enhance scope reduce tax continue build essential spend programme sustainable basis. in monetary field, i want say little more, similarly commitment coherent responsible framework steadily consistently pursued. this inflation-targeting framework, mandate reserve bank keep inflation low order deliver broad price stability across economy whole. south africa is, course, alone set price stability priority monetary policy. maintenance low inflation universal aim central bank around world set pursue. but pursue aim within framework explicit low inflation target, south africa much forefront international best practice. why emphasis low inflation commitment price stability? at one level, socio-economic damage flow failure control inflation evident. high volatile rate inflation disadvantage poor, least able protect ravage inflation, benefit able preserve standard living. inflation disadvantage particular live fix incomes, often elderly reliant pension savings. across board, inflation tend discourage save undermine ability people plan future personal finance prudent, long-term basis. by erode value corrosive insidious fashion, inflation undermine sociably responsible behaviour threaten stability society whole. not nothing inflation call silent invisible thief. in specifically economic terms, too, inflation enemy long-term sustainable economic growth, weaken capacity economy achieve rate growth capable. 2 bi review 16/2003 past history, south africa many countries, illustrate vividly. if demand economy allow grow fast output supply capacity economy, result inevitably rise inflation. this excess demand cannot induce economy deliver output capable producing: simply bid price output economy produce, generate inflation. if inflation allow gather pace, process rein back excess demand, high interest rates, inevitably wasteful, term extend period growth capacity, timely action take monetary authority keep pace demand line supply capacity economy. to try maintain balance, demand supply economy, essentially task monetary policy aim central bank pursue set interest rates. if succeeds, inflation keep low economy continue grow steady sustainable rate continue last basis. there important corollary process. this not, meaningful sense, trade-off growth low inflation. it practice feasible contemplate live somewhat high rate inflation, even period, hope would bring high growth. the reason low inflation alternative growth, necessary essential pre-condition. without commitment - make deliver - keep inflation low, achieve sustainable basis growth economy capable. with low inflation, demand, hence output, economy continue grow steady sustainable basis. in pursue low inflation, therefore, central bank aim exactly goal desire - continue sustainable growth output employment live standard across economy whole. the inflation-targeting framework south africa critical role play maintain low inflation. it strength lie fact structure contain i believe four key element effective monetary framework. let say word briefly each. first, framework provide explicit target set inflation. this currently inflation, measure cpix, bring back to, hold within, range 3-6%. the value set explicit target form help anchor inflation expectation low level. business industry, individuals, make financial plans, hopefully basis inflation keep range time; basis that, if, present, inflation move outside range, policy stance adjust promptly bring back within range - indeed do last year. anchor expectation way help turn build low inflation fabric economy whole. the target also, importantly, provide means, quite properly, hold central bank account performance. i shall touch last aspect moment. secondly, inflation-targeting framework give responsibility achieve target central bank, specifically reserve bank's monetary policy committee, act independently clear mandate deliver target. it also give mpc mean achieve target, decision set reserve bank's repo rate meetings. the framework thus ensure clear allocation responsibility; ensure interest rate decision take competent authority dedicate task act independently. thirdly fourthly, inflation-targeting framework one deliver high degree transparency accountability. transparency accountability achieve full statement mpc issue immediately meeting, range publication reserve bank issue set view developments, public appearance governor colleague make explain reserve bank's policy activities. i think important beneficial part process several reason - partly right democratic system public agency require open accountable explain activities; partly process hopefully help maintain public confidence performance agency public support objective low inflation; partly turn encourage business individual conduct affair basis low inflation maintained; partly openness accountability help promote good public debate issues. these element i believe help strengthen effectiveness inflation-targeting process. this framework has, course, test past 18 month inflationary shock economy face fall value rand latter half 2001 accompany upwards pressure food price fuel costs. the step take last year raise interest rate necessary prevent shock generate self-reinforcing process rise bi review 16/2003 3 inflation. a indicate statement issue last week's meet mpc, sign inflationary pressure begin abate outlook inflation improving, though little room complacency give considerable risk still face. but return initial impressions, particularly encouraging, i believe, coherent responsible policy framework provide inflation-targeting demonstrate ability address shock steady consider manner and, so, help considerably maintain confidence economy. this particularly evident international markets, confidence fundamental south african economy undoubtedly factor recovery rand; evident, too, positive attitude south africa encounter generally abroad - notably, example, upgrade already put place rat agencies, upgrade prospect. this, anything, - well-structured policy framework, steadily consistently pursue - help south african economy continue grow current world slowdown. this strong evidence commitment low inflation works, help maintain sustainable growth, help u achieve future growth essential enable u develop huge potential fine country. bi review 16/2003 1 lars heikensten: monetary policy potential growth speech mr lars heikensten, governor sverige riksbank, swedish economics association, stockholm, 28 march 2003. * * * let begin thank invitation come economic association. a former secretary association particular pleasure invite here. my intention today discus broad question i normally reason take up, namely swedish economy's capacity long-term growth. the great economy's capacity long-term growth, good development welfare. and i think merely material aspects, also possibility provide young people good education, elderly people good quality care environment long-term sustainable development. the long-term potential growth rate also important monetary policy. a high potential growth rate allow economy grow rapidly without inflation accelerating. i shall begin brief description intellectual framework riksbank us regard potential growth affect shape monetary policy. after that, i shall discus two factor determine potential growth, namely productivity labour supply. finally, i shall round conclusions. my hope able contribute initiate continue discussion in-depth analysis field, among researcher policy-oriented economists. the riksbank’s intellectual framework accord textbook model macro economics, level production (gdp) keep economy balance, i.e. actual expect inflation line target level, profit share wage stable, etc. this level production often call potential long-term sustainable level production. despite fact economy balanced, potential production level remain constant; normally grow time. the reason is, quite simply, technical development enable high production level achieve amount production factors, production factor often show increase trend. the actual inflation rate deviate target rate (and expect rate) production level economy, reason, deviate potential level. it often say positive negative production gap. a positive production gap mean actual production high potential level. in case, course, resource situation strained; bottleneck begin arise economy. the reverse apply negative production gap. a production gap usually see measure demand pressure economy demand pressure turn affect inflation, monetary policy many respect case choose steer interest rate lead small possible production gap. if production gap completely close equal zero - i.e. actual potential production coincide - inflation rate 2 per cent long credible policy pursue shock occur. figure 1 illustrate principle possible future developments. an important insight context change steer interest rate significant production employment short term, long term. if price wage adapt immediately - i.e. nominal lag - change nominal quantities, include riksbank's repo rate, entail change relative price real wages. these real price change affect economy's real aggregate demand thereby production employment. if, instance, wage agreement sign long period time, companies' price flexible, low steer interest rate real economy effect short term, companies' price increase lead low real wage high profit thereby increase production employment. in long term, new wage agreement sign wage formation take account high price increase adapt avoid change real wages. by change steer interest rate, riksbank affect actual, short-term production level potential, long-term level. the latter determined, i say earlier, factor 2 bi review 16/2003 technological developments, labour supply, etc. on hand, probable monetary policy indirectly, contribute stable economic development, create good condition good growth long term. reliable assessment potential growth capacity swedish economy important successful conduct monetary policy. give this, perhaps surprise spend significant amount time recent year make analysis issue relate economic growth. this demonstrate work report series, contain relatively large number study subject. a complicate factor regard study potential growth entail quantity cannot directly observe measured, estimate indirectly aid another method. there number statistical method this, advantage disadvantages. the estimate result prove relatively sensitive method applied. this turn mean good reason fasten one individual method, use several method thereby increase reliability estimates. at riksbank apply three different method calculate production gap regularly show discus result inflation report (figure 2). before make final assessment, base monetary policy, also weigh information resource utilisation, instance national institute economic research's business tendency survey publication shortage labour market. this also good idea macro data form basis method-based estimates, gdp growth, often change afterwards result revision statistics. the recent revision led, instance, upward adjustment gdp productivity great part 1990s. the development productivity labour supply i imply introductory discussion potential growth capacity economy determine constant development technology occur market economy trend increase production factors. a central element context labour productivity trend measure gdp per hour worked. this increase technological progress (e.g. machine become modern) addition real capital (a long-term extension production apparatus). if labour supply also show change trend time, must take account. the potential growth rate economy therefore calculate total historical growth labour productivity labour supply. a i soon show, however, often difficult even afterwards distinguish last trend temporary nature, e.g. cause fluctuation economic activity. this apply development productivity labour supply. at time, distinguish process last temporary nature one important aspect regard discussion country's capacity long-term growth. let u study determine factor one one. sign good growth productivity my third slide show development labour productivity, measure gdp per hour worked, together estimate trend (figure 3). we see productivity growth vary strongly, also show tendency increase time, particularly 1990s. this mark difference compare development 1970s, trend instead downward one. during 1980s actual productivity growth level low level often around 1 per cent - exception individual years. during 1990s, hand, rapid increase productivity growth stabilise level 2 per cent. we know exactly drive force behind development. but allow nevertheless indicate factor may play important role. the economic crisis begin 1990s probably play insignificant role raise productivity growth first half 1990s. during crisis year production low level productivity put business unemployment increase lead increase labour productivity measured. this one-off effect raise level productivity growth time mean large percentage society's available resource utilised. bi review 16/2003 3 in connection directly crisis also number change swedish economy affect development since then. new regulation establish fiscal policy, expenditure ceiling surplus target. at time, monetary policy successfully aim safeguard low inflation. also 1990s number market deregulate open domestic international competition. in addition, sweden join eu. this development entail increase international integration product labour markets, favourable effect productivity growth. a explanation shift sector swedish economy. during 1960s 1970s rapid growth employment public sector, private sector declined. follow crisis begin 1990s situation reverse (figure 4). a productivity growth public sector probably low productivity growth private sector, development result rise productivity economy whole. these effect reinforce fact national account base calculation assumption productivity increase public sector all. during second half 1990s particular, rapid development information technology, entail great efficiency knowledge transfer individual company companies. the expansion it sector one corner-stones "new economy". the effect actually productivity much discussed. it clear it sector itself, particular telecom industry, responsible significant part productivity growth end 1990s. development uneven among different industries, increase productivity "it user" industry much le impressive, despite large investment it products, "it producer" sector. the latter also clearly illustrate productivity increase trade industry adjust increase take place telecom industry (figure 5). when sector excluded, productivity second half 1990s increase 1.9 per cent year, compare 2.8 per cent sector included. the telecom sector greatly decline importance apparent confusion future development. the important question riksbank entail development long-term productivity growth future. the figure show trend increase large end 1990s period 1995. it also remember method use calculate trend characteristic reflect change actual underlie trend slow rate. in addition, high rate increase productivity latter part 1990s reflect relatively rapid growth private sector relative public sector strong growth it-producing sectors, particularly telecom industry. it likely future development follow paths. nevertheless, many indication long-term increase productivity high 1970s 1980s. factor favour fairly comprehensive change take place 1990s, particularly introduction new stabilisation policy regime great degree openness swedish economy. labour supply major cause concern let u move study labour supply develop period time. my next slide show actual growth trend number hour work (figure 6). to begin with, one conclude development relatively adverse great part 1980s 1990s. accord trend, actually detect increase second half 1990s, break recently due economic activity structural causes. several factor lie behind development. once natural go back crisis year early 1990s. at point number hour work decline significantly result large fall demand take place. parallel this, structural change implemented. young people verge work life choose continue studying, partly lack jobs, partly development labour market mean high educational demand made. another explanation could number old person labour force also decline considerably period. the labour supply age group 60-64 year fell approximately 40,000 person 1990s, despite fact group's percentage population change significantly. in addition, number people take early retirement increase alarm rate. recently, aware, amount sick leave increased. 4 bi review 16/2003 another factor appear significance swedish labour market able make adequate use labour reserve comprise inhabitant bear abroad. the employment frequency among people much low employment frequency among people bear sweden. this apply particular arrive quite recently. the efficiency match labour market also appear low people. one indication many university education either unemployed job competence levels. contrary many people believe, however, demographic development relatively favourable 1990s, labour force perspective. the population growth age group 20-64 year develop weakly entire 1970s year 1980s (figure 7). however, towards end 1980s rate increase begin accelerate. since relatively high, exception individual year mid-1990s. the fact growth number hour work end 1990s begin take mainly due rapid expansion private, extent also public, service sector. i mention early discussion significance "new economy" productivity increase 1990s i say productivity growth fell heavily begin new millennium. the apply number hour worked. this raise question, similar case productivity development, whether calculate trend growth diagram overestimate real long-term trend increase. to shed light upon need go cause development number hour work recent years. the number hour work economy determine partly number person work partly average work hours, i.e. many hour person works. one factor clearly pull average work hour recent year rise sick leave. it uncertain extent effect transitory nature. various study show amount short-term sick leave take tend increase situation labour market improve unemployment declines. if sick leave divide accord length, see long-term sick leave increase past years. to extent development result incentive effects, increase may structural nature, mean sick leave automatically decline economic situation deteriorates. in general debate imply change various institutional factor account interpretation, e.g. rule qualification early retirement pension become tight remuneration level sickness benefit raised. another important factor could percentage old people labour market increase somewhat recently. be increase sick leave explanation decline average work hours? no, not. and see clearly study development adjust absence due sickness (figure 8). here see average work hour show decline tendency even adjust people work due illness. compare period 1994-1995, average work hour decline around 3 percentage point negative tendency particularly strong 1999. moreover, curve diagram - number employ - show growth work hour last year curb low increase employment. this turn result economic slowdown long affect manufacturing, also service sector. the decline work hour appear depend three main factors, apart increase absence due illness. the first factor increase type absence illness, e.g. holiday look sick children. the second decline amount overtime work reduction work hour agree employer employees. the third factor shift people choose move full-time part-time work. the relative significance structural economic factor context difficult assess. there many indication variation overtime particularly affect economic activity. although difficult determine relate factors. the assessment make riksbank far average work hour show tentative rise economic activity improves. to summarise, reason considerable concern regard future labour supply. if reason slightly optimistic productivity growth, opposite apply labour supply. a number factors, demographic developments, absence due illness proposal short work hour indicate decline labour supply come decade, unless change policy. bi review 16/2003 5 future potential growth what mean assessment economy's potential growth capacity right come years? if uncritically assume simple model i outline earlier, could calculate estimate potential growth simply add together trend value i show diagram productivity growth number hour worked. i do next diagram (figure 9). measure way, potential growth 1.5 per cent around 1992. since rise gradually approximately 3 per cent 2001. however, discussion cause decline actual growth recent year show good reason believe 3 per cent overestimate growth potential swedish economy today. one way subdue effect trend variation individual year estimate trend mean value period's actual growth. this procedure give trend growth 2 per cent, i also indicate diagram. if one belief truth lie somewhere midway growth rate changeover economic policy, one instead calculate mean value mean value period 1980-1992 1993 onwards. the result 2.2 per cent. no procedure perfect, course. a i mention initially, estimate result vary significantly depend method apply one reason riksbank choose specify exact figure potential growth. we instead choose work interval 2 2.5 per cent, emerge gradually endeavour refine analysis improve knowledge. the interval indicate influence strong growth figure latter part 1990s, cautious stipulate great degree assessment form "new economy". a reason specify potential growth detail new information receive continuously affect assessment. a i mention earlier, national account recently revise new result indicate strong growth gdp productivity sweden period 1993-2002. such revision show considerable uncertainty statistic important overreact recent figures. when make assessment inflation connection monetary policy decision normally look two year ahead. in context also calculate potential growth aid detail data. this include labour market data, instance, ass labour force development reference development work population, people regular education labour market policy train number people sick leave early retirement pensions. a digression demography allow me, i finish, comment demographic developments. one factor we, like many countries, need grapple adverse demographic development take place years' time. this entail percentage elderly people population increase significantly result considerable reduction labour force participation. large demand make public finance labour supply growth trend subdued. my last slide show growth actual hour work period 1981-2001, together calculation growth period 2002-2050 (figure 10). the calculate growth work hour base statistic sweden's forecast swedish population 2050 fix determine parameter 2002 level. the average increase work hour amount approximately 0.4 per cent period 1981-2001. the calculate series' average increase 2002-2050 stop modest 0.01 per cent; practice almost increase all. conclusion i shall conclude summary. a high long-term growth rate one important objective economic policy. it become easy achieve almost political objective economic growth good. there great scope private consumption wage formation make easier. it become easy finance public sector service health welfare. high growth also give great scope political areas, environmental policy. in addition, potential, long-term growth rate variable essential significance monetary policy. the riksbank cannot influence development economy's long-term growth rate; 6 bi review 16/2003 govern factors, primarily much work efficient economy is. but potential growth rate great degree set framework monetary policy. simplified, one say task keep actual production close potential production possible. then inflation also come close target level. follow this, high potential growth rate, fast swedish gdp grow without put inflation target risk. a natural start point calculate potential growth economy growth trend productivity labour supply. productivity growth show tendency towards improvement 1990s. it probable factor new low-inflation rate regime great openness stiff competition play important role development. however, far certain high rate increase end 1990s continue. they mirror rapid growth private sector relative public sector strong growth it/telecom sector. nevertheless, probable long-term increase productivity high 1970s 1980s. the number hour work also develop relatively favourably since mid-1990s. however, development

international economic situation speech mr john hurley, governor central bank ireland, finance dublin conference, dublin, 25 march 2003. * * * the international euro area economy this time exceptional uncertainty world economy. this uncertainty drive number factors, notably deterioration equity financial market 2002 recently, rise geopolitical tension ensue war iraq. a result, outlook global economic growth weaken compare early expectations. the impact war iraq global economy depend extent duration conflict. the range scenario wide one characterise two contrast situations. in one case, prolong conflict could trigger mark increase oil price undermine consumer business confidence, slow consumption investment spend lead economic growth weaken. alternatively, short decisive conflict would eliminate uncertainty exists. it possible point ass conclusively implication euro area. but govern council make clear development monitor closely, stand ready act necessary provide liquidity required. the geopolitical situation mask fact that, historical standards, unusual economic recovery. evidence past half-century suggest typically recovery economic growth drive rise equity price fall save rates, addition low interest rates. over past year, however, equity market weaken further, save rate risen. these development reflect large degree attempt correct problem past, particular significant economic financial imbalance generate precede boom us. the current account deficit has, moreover, continue grow drive emergence sizeable fiscal deficit. ultimately, situation corrected, undoubtedly implication rest world. with external impetus growth likely modest, euro area growth drive largely domestic demand. however, recent track record large euro area economy encouraging. their underperformance act headwind sustainable economic recovery situation may change gradually. in summary, i would remain concern that, even event unwind geopolitical tensions, euro area growth set remain modest time yet. the irish economy turn irish economy, i say central bank’s spring bulletin due publish to-morrow. it give fairly detail analysis see outlook economy. i confine remark today, therefore, general observations. over past year so, pace economic growth slow greatly wake much subdue international performance. with high dependence international trade disproportionately large ict sector, inevitable ireland would feel draught development international economy. it also clear high growth rate experience since 1994 would decline economy increasingly encounter infrastructural pressure labour market tightness, inevitably happened. however, speed deceleration gnp growth much fast extent significantly great expected. such sharp deceleration clearly go felt people’s pocket job front. give deterioration general international economy, immediate cause slowdown weakness demand. export growth last year estimate 4 ¼ per cent, compare average annual increase 19 per cent, example, three year 2000. with large trade sector, slowdown bind felt right 2 bi review 16/2003 economy. this spill domestic demand consumption investment demand show modest growth last year. with business consumer confidence indicator quite weak, unlikely much recovery domestic spend short-term. on top this, outbreak hostility iraq major uncertainty add equation. at present, factor modest growth year domestic spending. with small pick-up export growth, gnp growth likely little le 2 per cent. there also downside risk forecast. in difficult environment, pursuit prudent policy leave u well-placed participate upturn world economy comes. an important element that, rate increase public expenditure need continue downward path sustainable level; contain 7% plan year. this help limit domestic inflationary pressures. it would also limit damage competitiveness event sharp appreciation euro. a spring bulletin point tomorrow, still inflation problem. the excess inflation euro area partner largely service sector phenomenon. nominal pay increase recent year much high euro area. while high productivity increase partly offset differences, confine relatively small number industrial sectors. the strengthen euro since middle last year exacerbate effect unfavourable trend competitiveness. it behove us, therefore, focus policy area order quickly reduce inflation rate average euro area partners. in regard, i happy see, part anti-inflation initiative propose national partnership agreement, representative employer union organisation work government effort target domestic source inflation. the financial sector i would like make comment financial sector. a major player economy, broad financial sector benefit strong economic performance recent slowdown. this reflect strong growth balance sheet size employment. the ifsc continue success story. the main area growth ifsc fund sector; account half total employment 11,000 aggregate authorise fund amount euro 300 billion. irish bank face mark deterioration business environment past year so. in response this, become conscious manage primary secondary exposure particular industry sectors. in term performance, early make assessment overall profitability bank sector 2002. however, key result publish date, suggest irish credit institution continue increase profits, slow rate previous years. irish bank remain well capitalise strong solvency ratio and, date, marginal increase impair loans. provision level also maintain suggest bank system well cover loan losses. notwithstanding currently stable picture, important bear mind bad debt lag economic cycle. therefore, loan quality topical issue time. regard broad property sector, weak state economy, together continuous expansion house output, would seem point subdue price ahead. in commercial property sector, price cease rising. the growth residential mortgage commercial property lending, nevertheless, remain strong despite underlie weakness economy uncertain outlook. our continue concern area deal bulletin tomorrow. the new regulatory authority before concluding, may i refer briefly establishment new regulatory authority. a know, interim board irish financial service regulatory authority place since last april. i work closely brian patterson ensure smooth transition new structures. we confident ready implementation date, expect early may.

industry. in address morning, liam o’reilly describe authority discharge functions. liam staff make excellent progress past several month map way forward supervision. i wish every success important work ahead. conclusion in summary, world economy currently labour aftermath past excesses, particularly regard asset markets, well present geopolitical uncertainties. these seriously affect consumer business confidence result weak demand across world economy. the international climate evidently important determinant economic performance, remain significant doubt world economy emerge current subdue state. our policy direct limit domestic inflationary pressure protect competitiveness. while, inflation look set moderate somewhat, year progresses, require concert effort narrow inflation differential average euro area. bi review 15/2003 1 eva srejber: future scenario house finance speech m eva srejber, first deputy governor sverige riksbank, institute house urban research, gävle, 19 march 2003. * * * introduction house finance sweden constitute significant part swedish financial system. at begin year, total lend bank mortgage institution amount approximately sek 2200 billion, fractionally high sweden's gdp. mortgage institution account 50 per cent lending, vital financial market player understand house finance market, participant affect affect swedish economy. for reason seminar today play important role advance knowledge within field. there several factor affect house finance. these include demand factors, supply factor structural factors. i mention instead focus three important factors, namely internationalisation, change regulation adjustment household corporate balance sheets. i also attempt make connection change three broad area influence finance housing. allow begin outline development recent year point departure future prospects. a process internationalisation ongoing many year drive several factors. the process particularly evident capital financial markets. it usually say global production increase 1 unit, international trade increase two unit capital movement four. the increase commercial possibility arise country become economically integrate perhaps great drive force. another force drive internationalisation process it. in spite it crash, still considerable potential afford information technology. while it company suffer badly stock market, use technology represent "bubble". it result good accessibility customer market well information. for example, enable mortgage institution find buyer service several location without physical presence there. moreover, reduce cost administration, give initial costs, ought lead good condition consumers. yet another drive force growth international organisation eu. with 13 accession countries, eu could soon enlarge include 10 new members, lead toward creation large important common capital market. contact neighbour baltic state poland stimulate even co-operation eu. the euro area, four year old, develop could include great number country future. another important development affect financial market introduction minimum standard number different areas, e.g. supervision banks, insurance companies, security trading, payment systems, account auditing, corporate governance money laundering. these standard establish create joint foundation country form basis safe efficient financial systems. the imf world bank assume task evaluate extent country fulfil requirement accord standard also assist address shortcoming found. so far 60 countries, one-third member imf world bank, assessed. in addition, many country perform "self-assessments" voluntarily. the increase implementation international standard positive development demonstrate country genuinely strive improve regulation supervision thereby also financial systems. it beneficial country also international community, make possible avoid weakness otherwise spread international network the development regulation through, instance, eu well initiative include new, major currency europe help enhance efficiency financial capital markets. it affect mortgage institution primarily term borrow costs. a third point, i would like mention balance sheet adjustment follow share price bubble impact financial markets. in light high 2 bi review 15/2003 expectation future growth, household finance consumption, company investment, increase indebtedness belief debt would easy repay due high future earn income. moreover, large proportion companies' finance obtain via stock market. balance sheet become inflated, actual growth economy. when earn prospect late prove low expected, fall share price value assets. debt level appear high, particularly corporate sector. in order low debts, company increase income reduce costs, result weak demand economy. furthermore, decline share price prompt household financial institution invest households' money seek investment alternative appear safer. the downward adjustment future outlook also result uncertainty. this turn compound uncertainty cause international terrorism attempt deal put pressure iraq. this contribute increase spread corporate treasury bond well great volatility markets. to counteract effect balance sheet income statement adjustment real economy, monetary policy ease several country around world. at time, fiscal policy become expansionary. the short-term interest rate fell subdue inflation prospect flight "safe" investment cause drop long-term rate well. the low interest rate together search safe investment spread asset markets. the price gold increased, rise house price several country household take advantage low level interest rate boost house consumption. the rise property price counteract fall value households' financial assets. this turn lead household several country continue increase indebtedness, particularly finance housing. however, historically large change asset debt market thus far proceed smoothly. in spite fact see big decline share price since 1930s, large suspension national debt payment history (argentina), big corporate bankruptcy (enron, worldcom), one major terrorist attack wave small ones, financial market strong enough handle this. risk diversification emergence new financial derivative two explanation preserve stability financial system. while development real economy affect balance sheet income statement adjustments, business cycle bottom high level growth feared, give considerable imbalance exist height bubble 2000. the economy undergo slow recovery, drive normal cyclical course event subdue balance sheet adjustment geopolitical uncertainty. balance sheet adjustment continue, however, still substantial save imbalance different region world. at time, risk war cause flight safe asset thereby result low interest rates. recently, improvement earn slight fall credit spreads. nevertheless, effect asset price adjustment pension funds, life insurance company non-financial enterprise still felt various part economy. should economy follow debt cycle future, also risk currently low interest rate lead implementation project would unprofitable normal rate levels. how house finance sweden affect recent year internationalisation, regulatory change balance sheet adjustments? development swedish asset debt market largely abroad. share commercial property decline value since 2000. investment residential property price permanent single-family dwell rise 8 15 per cent respectively past two years. price tenant-owner apartment also increased. the rise price owner-occupied housing, certain extent increase rate construction tenant-owner apartments, cause mortgage institution continue increase lend past three year average 8 per cent per year. the annual rate increase surpass 10 per cent toward end 2002. over past 20 years, lend bank mortgage institution grow approximately 8 per cent per year, lend mortgage institution alone grow around 10 per cent per year. this imply mortgage institutions' share lend rise years. if one study borrow non-financial enterprises, picture become somewhat different. here mortgage institution become le important. during middle 1990s account 40 per cent corporate borrowing, share fall back 25 per cent. this mainly effect increase international competition increase bond financing. bi review 15/2003 3 the structure house market house finance. ha internationalisation result increase competition? at time see large adjustment balance sheet household companies, longer-term trend continue effect structure competition house finance market. the market mortgage institution sweden characterise small number participant dominate entire market. there presently total 10 mortgage institution swedish market, slightly few 15 year ago. the five large approximately 95 per cent market, increase 10 percentage point compare 15 year ago. mortgage institution operate two different markets. the first national regional market lend consumers, second national international borrow market. mortgage institutions' borrow foreign currency amount last year around 20 per cent lend foreign currency negligible. if mortgage institution account size obtain good term borrow market should, give competition mortgage market, pass consumers. although mortgage relatively simple, standardise financial product well suit sell national boundaries, cross-border activity far limited. the relatively small number participant mortgage market sweden country explain fact market often highly national nature distinctive national characteristics. the sluggishness due part difficulty compare value collateral different national legal systems. this imply often domestic participant competition mortgage markets. in europe, national mortgage market rather different. this mainly factor regulations, tax legislation, market structure, bureaucracy corporate culture different different countries. moreover, mean cost entry high new participants, particularly foreign competitors, least marketing. the effect distinctive national feature market also apparent swedish participant set business abroad operate regulatory framework accord practices. another limit factor fact long sweden remain outside euro area, foreign company wish enter swedish mortgage market provide loan swedish kronor, swedish borrower generally want expose exchange rate risk. however, sweden join euro, interest rate offer lender different country euro area become directly comparable. with single currency, would easy borrower judge institution euro area offer best terms. swedish borrower would able take loan euro without expose currency risk, availability potential lender would increase. difference regulation taxation systems, however, would continue constitute limitation increase competition. challenge swedish house finance ahead future look toward year ahead, development house finance market drive number powerful forces: continue balance sheet adjustments, effect continue internationalisation process europe new rule financial institutions. i shall concentrate three challenges. challenge 1 - continue internationalisation allow deal different challenge turn therefore begin challenge pose internationalisation and, particular, european integration. one drive force behind trend capital credit market increase international competition increase awareness international opportunities. the diversification finance investment increasing, risk management instrument improved. europe affect financial market euro. in addition 12 euro country eu, large number country euro play pivotal role either mean payment form link euro. in come years, current accession country gradually introduce euro, euro market become larger. at time, harmonisation rule continue market become integrated. meanwhile euro accept rest market; unite state unite kingdom keep half official foreign exchange reserve euro. canada australia keep around 40 per cent euro. there therefore rise demand euro bond increase liquidity market. at time, supply bond rise increase number agents, company states, choose finance activity 4 bi review 15/2003 bond market. accord ecb, 30 per cent bond hold euro issue foreign residents. the total stock euro bond issue euro institution euro 7 400 billion. this market grow substantially since 1999. the introduction euro consequently affect interest rate markets. we see dramatic reduction yield differential 5-year treasury bond country introduce euro 5 7 percentage point year 1994-1996 approximately 0.2 0.3 percentage point recent years. in january february year, yield swedish 5-year treasury bond around 80 point high euro area average. of course, part reduction euro area consolidation government finance eu country meet convergence criteria, risk premium exchange rate risk currency disappear definitely contribute reduction. the remain yield differential largely explain different credit rat country euro area well difference liquidity various bond issues. the introduction euro also help increase width depth european capital market rate lead almost complete integration part money market trade closely connect eurosystem's monetary policy transactions. the grow capital market euro become increasingly important source finance swedish companies, far primarily major enterprise institution manage currency risk. this would provide large finance base without currency risk swedish company introduce euro sweden. it interest rate market affect european integration general trend toward internationalisation. the change market condition also affect competition thereby structure among market players. financial activity tend benefit considerably large-scale operation. high, fix cost form training, highly skilled staff, large resource-intensive computer analysis systems, information retrieval mean unit cost fall turnover volume increases. one way attain sufficiently high turnover volume fix cost limit disadvantage involve large-scale operation could strong specialisation activities. the trend see today individual countries, bank merge create large entities, result attempt reduce unit cost thereby increase profit margin economy scale. however, bank far establish operation large scale countries. most institution majority activity earn home country. the consolidation occur cross-border merger acquisition generally yet lead radically different market eu service traditionally provide bank household small companies. in part bank sector, remain substantial overcapacity eu prove time-consuming eradicate. presently, see problem german bank system cause part overcapacity, major cost different term competition different institution result slow restructure bank system. on hand, number bank western europe expand central eastern europe give rise development modernisation bank system former plan economies. the reason central eastern europe constitute developable market could soon part enlarge eu. at time, contribute improve profitability parent bank many country central eastern europe continue show favourable growth compare present eu countries. the bank acquire mostly full-service banks, mean parent bank get large customer base financial services, one mortgages. another structural trend great concentration financial activity certain centre order profit cluster benefits. company produce product service discern benefit locate close several reasons. these might, example, skilled labour force, accessibility market, supplier customers, specialise service companies, market information, market knowledge infrastructure. they reinforce economy scale benefit large financial company gather together locations. one example financial centre london. mortgage institution standardise product independent distance customer borrow international capital market ought activity profit cluster benefits. the concentration trend able perceive past 15 year among swedish mortgage institution demonstrate also follow structural trend. bi review 15/2003 5 challenge 2 - international regulation one intention behind eu's internal market introduction euro create efficient market product service competition increase customer obtain good product low prices. one aspect eu's financial service action plan realise 2005. the plan contain 42 measure aim remove remain obstacle cross-border trade financial service promote financial integration eu. at time, measure take support supply risk capital eu. these action plan help realise vision make eu competitive, knowledge-based economic area world 2010. three-quarters measure financial service action plan already decided. this also affect mortgage institutions, major participant market lend borrowing. another factor importance new capital adequacy rule plan introduction 2006. put simply, capital adequacy rule rule govern much capital bank require hold various borrower group krona lent. in new rules, intend risk weight good reflect actual credit risk. this mean bank careful assess relationship risk loan return. it therefore possible observe increase risk banks' interest rates. the new capital adequacy rule advantage disadvantages. the propose rule require bank hold capital risk loan increases. if capital prescribe rules, must either acquire capital reduce risk lending. in situation, bank decide renew loans, course would entail severe consequence borrowers. there therefore risk new rule reinforce cyclical developments. nevertheless, new rule entail several advantages: all-round, individual risk assessment good protect savers' fund reduce risk tax payer via government step in, opportunity cheap loan low-risk borrower well increase interest expenditure high-risk companies. consequently, price loan fairer. but new capital adequacy rule affect loan lend house company thereby affect finance housing? an initial reflection bank perform individual assessment object loan associate company before. a second reflection bank price loan also focus cash flow loan, case company's cash flow. in cases, house company large amount value property collateral continue positive future, bank currently focus customer's ability repay look collateral. the propose change capital adequacy rule apply 2006, development capital market probably entail bank adapt lend gradually advance new rules. it therefore important capital-intensive business start prepare activity individualise credit assessment future. opportunity find competitive finance lend market low rate interest available convince lender operation generate stable flow future earnings. high risk form vary earn flows, instance, cost more. challenge 3 - the effect balance sheet adjustment in wake fall share prices, thus far see effect house finance form low interest rates, enable household increase indebtedness slowly rise interest ratio. a interest ratio rise marginally, turn lead continue increase residential property price several countries, include sweden. the low expectation future earn result stock market decline far markedly reduce house finance demand sweden. thus far, effect low interest rate appear dominant factor. a balance sheet adjustment come end, geopolitical uncertainty abate economy continue recover, risk aversion decrease, turn lead normalisation market rates. consequently, dampen household demand house finance. on hand, expect earn flow rise tandem rise economic activity. the ability mortgage institution find "cheap" finance also affect normalisation interest rates. investor return risky investment risk aversion declines. furthermore, rise long-term interest rate reduce value bond hold acquire investor current risk aversion period. consequently, mortgage institution face challenge time come demand supply sides. 6 bi review 15/2003 conclusion all all, factor indicate competition mortgage market borrow finance increase. a potential swedish adoption euro, large market generate big finance base, eu's financial service action plan, basel ii efficiency improvement infrastructure conduct cross-border trade financial service important factor future perspective capital market. a mortgage standardise products, lender mostly compete prices, i.e. interest rate mortgages. competition ensure small variation prices, question finance primary importance mortgage lenders. a competition mortgage market increases, borrow cost mortgage institution become decisive factor ability conduct profitable, competitive operations. bi review 15/2003 1 klaus liebscher: a stable euro strong europe panel statement dr klaus liebscher, governor austrian national bank, european bank & financial forum, prague, 25 march 2003. * * * it great pleasure participate european bank & financial forum prague i congratulate organizer interest topic choose year. i would like focus deliberation state economy, stability-oriented framework emu, include need reform require enhance euro area's noninflationary growth potential, - last least - eu enlargement process. the govern council ecb decide march 6 reduce key interest rate 25 basis point 2½%. this decision take light improve outlook price stability, owe part appreciation euro subdue pace economic growth euro area. the latter must see context increase geopolitical risk protract period time, lead high oil prices. additionally, fundamental downward correction companies' profit expectation well increase pessimism part consumer investor substantially dampen demand depress stock price industrial world. however, apart unfavourable shocks, structural inefficiency also hold back euro area economy. forecast future notoriously difficult - even current geopolitical conditions. heighten volatility oil markets, instance, make problematic usual ass short-term inflation developments. however, assumption geopolitical tension decrease time, fundamental factor dominate price development euro area. the significant appreciation euro past year, fee economy via low import producer prices, subdue economic activity somewhat modest wage settlement dampen inflation medium term. if oil price moderate, indicate futures, inflation rate euro area likely fall 2% course 2003 remain level line price stability thereafter. against background, interest rate euro area fall low levels, nominal real terms. on basis currently available information, policy stance, contribute preservation price stability medium term, somewhat counterbalance multiple factor currently adverse effect economic activity. in current environment heighten uncertainty, stability become even precious asset. a well known, eurosystem's primary objective maintain price stability medium term, since price stability unambiguously represent precondition sustainable economic growth rise employment long run. moreover, time severe tension, utmost importance policymakers lose sight primary responsibility, reduce uncertainty strengthen confidence. consequently, govern council ecb stand ready act necessary. and financial market rely provision sufficient liquidity even exceptional circumstances, demonstrate past. a military action iraq, impact confrontation global economy vary significantly scope size, depend extent duration conflict. it therefore possible juncture conclusively ass short medium-term implication euro area. the euro area establish stable monetary anchor global economy. that notwithstanding, one acknowledge much remain done. the stability growth pact oblige euro area member state achieve budgetary position close balance surplus sustainable manner, order minimize risk breach budget deficit criterion 3% gdp course business cycle. sound budgetary position create enough leeway automatic stabilizer take full effect cycle, contribute reduce debt-to-gdp ratio consequently interest burden governments, increase investors' confidence euro area therefore keep interest rate low would otherwise be. moreover, demographic development make imperative bring public finance 2 bi review 15/2003 structural balance surplus. even though country current fiscal policy stance, envisage update stability programs, strike reasonable balance let automatic stabilizer operate seek consolidation needed, countries' current consolidation plan lack ambition, particularly medium run, current slump likelihood overcome. it necessary euro area country live obligation full. fiscal policy must part comprehensive growth-oriented strategy, focus - rule - restrain volume improve structure public expenditures. the euro area economy hold back current geopolitical tensions, also friction labor product markets. structural reform area utmost importance increase flexibility economy, thereby improve resilience detrimental shock raise euro area's noninflationary growth potential. policymakers well aware assessment. however, lack clear decisive progress implement structural reform weigh confidence. it high time reassure business, investor consumer deliver overdue structural reforms. such measure must gear towards flexible labor market high labor participation rates, full implementation eu single market, free sound competition along cutback state aid, consumer-friendly retail market regulations. this would enhance productivity, thereby make euro area attractive domestic international investment, would promote economic activity raise noninflationary growth potential euro area, would enhance employment, thus boost consumer confidence private consumption. indeed, u set motion virtuous circle! the policy program newly elect austrian government include several important measure foster austria´s attractiveness business investors. start small budget deficit 0.6% 2002, government´s fiscal policy stance foresee cyclically motivate widen deficit 1.3% year. look ahead, government intend make significant tax cuts. the cutback share government austrian economy appropriate line international endeavor improve quality public finances. the tax cut accompany one one expenditure cut ensure balance budget achieve cycle. where central eastern european country enter picture? it conviction historic reunification europe mutually strengthen today's accession country eu. have say this, challenge task lie ahead. first foremost, provide stability broad sense: political stability, macroeconomic stability, financial market stability price stability. the framework place provide broadly base stability. thus, enlargement encourage growth employment wide europe. economic monetary integration accession country proceed three stages: first, accede country join eu may 2004, second, new member state participate erm ii, exchange rate mechanism eu, least two years, third, sustainable fulfilment convergence criterion lay treaty, new member state adopt euro. throughout process lead introduction euro, new member states' economic situation policy strategy assess case-by-case basis. the role erm ii process, first, help participate member state orient policy stability foster economic convergence. second, participation erm ii without severe tension least two year one convergence criteria. finally, entry euro area base sustainable fulfilment maastricht convergence criteria. these criterion apply future euro area entrant way apply euro area countries. it may take quite new member state position fully participate emu. a fair share realism call avoid disappointment. in long run, equitable strict procedure advantage member state european union. in concluding, i would like reiterate many respects, euro prove drive force europe's continue political integration economic reforms. the euro regard important token identity modern, dynamic open europe. the euro provide stable anchor unfortunately stable times. but euro shield u external shock within limits. even though euro already trigger considerable fiscal structural reforms, must relinquish endeavor make euro area economy efficient productive. bi review 15/2003 1 david dodge: the benefit sound economic policy speech mr david dodge, governor bank canada, italian banker association, rome, italy, 18 march 2003. * * * it truly pleasure visit magnificent historic city. i certainly appreciate opportunity speak association today. canada italy share many similar characteristics. we belong g-7, among small member group. our two economy vary greatly region region, term structure strength. overcome regional disparity one great challenge face. after serious inflation problem 1970s early 1980s, canada italy enjoy benefit low-inflation environment. and trade great deal large partner - case, unite states, case, rest euro zone. we canada italy recently take step overhaul tax systems, face challenge age population. give similarities, clearly much take other. what i would like today talk lesson canada learn economic policy recent years. the "four legs" economic policy during 1980s, consensus begin take shape among oecd country set economic policy would provide strong base sustain economic growth. there four principle involve consensus. i like think four leg chair. just chair steady leg length, policy-makers get best result pay equal attention four principles. and one leg start weaken, best way restore stability build leg back up, cut three. over past decade so, canadian spend great deal effort put four element framework place. it certainly easy. it involve fair bite short-term economic pain. but phrase "short-term pain long-term gain" cliché. canada reap economic benefit effort. of course, part reason recent good performance basic structure economy. for example, current global economic uncertainty great effect large, multinational firms. but canada's economy consist small medium-sized enterprises. a well, hard-hit technology sector become increasingly important part canadian economy recent years, still represent small share economy, compare with, example, unite states. but good fortune part story. without canada's commitment oecd's "four legs" sound economic policy, recent performance would doubt poorer. so, "four legs" oecd consensus? the principle i refer deal monetary policy, fiscal policy, trade liberalization, structural reform. i spend minute these, draw canada's experience recent years. let start one relate directly bank canada's primary responsibility - monetary policy. the oecd consensus hold price stability appropriate goal monetary policy medium term. in canada, try achieve goal inflation-targeting framework. the bank canada reach agreement federal government introduce policy 1991. under agreement, aim keep inflation, measure consumer price index (cpi), 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent target range medium term. we find inflation-targeting system effective promote low, stable, predictable inflation canada. follow period high variable inflation 1970s 1980s, inflation-control target help anchor monetary policy. after agreement come effect, inflation quickly fell target range. subsequently, inflation expectation become focus target, help promote sustain economic growth. 2 bi review 15/2003 here italy, inflation-targeting monetary authority european central bank (ecb). italy's recent inflation record certainly favourable. but slight difference approach ecb bank canada i mention. at bank canada, explicitly run monetary policy symmetric way around 2 per cent target. the ecb's explicit commitment keep inflation 2 per cent. there always challenge operate single monetary policy country diverse regions. a i say earlier, canada, like italy, several region different economic structures. the ecb face even daunt challenge conduct monetary policy entire continent! but important point i want make ecb bank canada determine keep price stability medium-term policy goal. that first four legs. the second leg consensus fiscal policy. in year lead mid-1990s, provincial federal government canada habit run budget deficits. these deficit build government continue borrow, primarily finance current consumption. it unsustainable situation, make serious age population. clearly, social spend put viable long-term course. and fiscal policy need base plan put ratio public debt gdp steady downward track. in canada's experience, difficult hurdle overcome. the fiscal consolidation 1990s painful. i federal deputy minister finance time, i tell many difficult unpopular decision taken. equally important, province make hard choice reduce public spend restore fiscal health. but difficult year were, wait would make matter worse. now, here's good news: vicious circle rise deficit debt become virtuous circle balance budget fall debt. reduce deficit 1990s help canada's international credibility. and lead reduction risk premium demand international investors. the fiscal improvement mean bank canada able low interest rate easily economic circumstance warranted. not low interest rate reduce debt-servicing costs, also stimulate economic growth, bring revenue government. the extra revenue low debt-servicing costs, turn, lead even good fiscal position. canada's total government surplus end 2002 represent 1 per cent gdp, include surplus public pension plans. last month, finance minister john manley announce fifth consecutive surplus federal budget project budget continue balance position good next three years. the budget maintain fiscal plan framework previous years. that framework include $3 billion contingency reserve, use reduce debt need purposes. it also include $1 billion 2003–04 budget year additional economic prudence, $2 billion follow year, assurance canada fall back deficit position. not reduce debt-to-gdp ratio, federal government pay almost $50 billion debt. this lead restoration canada's triple-a credit rat free $3 billion resource every year federal government. the main point initial work fiscal consolidation certainly difficult, necessary order enjoy fiscal dividend late on. the third leg consensus deal trade liberalization. country need free international trade exploit gain come increase specialization, enhance productivity, great competitiveness. canada's recent experience area first involve sign canada-u.s. free trade agreement, come effect 1989. in 1994, mexico join group north american free trade agreement (nafta). both agreement spark great deal domestic political controversy. but also open market create tremendous opportunities. canada's export flourish result. but free trade mean set regional free-trade blocs, nafta european union. canada hop see meaningful progress world trade organization's doha round multilateral talks. clearly, agriculture go major hurdle. the develop countries, include u g-7, considerable way go term liberalize agricultural trade. and number sector also require major effort. this effort must make global economy benefit. it easy, long run, worth it. bi review 15/2003 3 the fourth policy leg structural reform. these adjustment always difficult reform affect various group differ often painful ways. further, economic benefit increase flexibility may take fairly long time emerge. but difficulty sway u task reduce rigidity increase efficiency economy good adjust rapidly change world. canada make progress number areas. the federal government make change system unemployment insurance, try base program insurance principle improve employability labour. canada also take step reduce distortion personal income tax system implement good service tax replace outdated tax manufacturers. more recently, make major change public pension system. the canada quebec pension plan establish 1966 use "pay-as-you-go" system. but change demographic put pressure plans, europe. by 1996, federal provincial government agree change would put canada quebec pension plan firm footing. this mean restructure benefit sharp increase contribution - move popular, certainly necessary. the canada quebec pension plan generate surplus represent almost 1 per cent gdp. these set aside special fund cannot touch government general use. indeed, federal provincial government agree set canada pension plan investment board, entirely independent body. it sole mandate invest contribution markets, order generate best possible returns, due consideration prudence, long term. i also point out, canadian italian system different, public sector employee canada belong pension plan fully funded. i know italy struggle pension reform, i know difficult issue is. but reform important, i wish well efforts. the challenge face serve highlight fact implement fourth leg oecd policy consensus easy. but must continue make progress lose sight four principles. the payoff canada see give confidence value oecd consensus. despite global economic slowdown, despite collapse share price many technology firms, despite effect september 2001 terrorist attack unite states, despite corporate governance account concerns, canada's economy remain strong. and forecaster expect u lead g-7 economic growth year. give uncertainty global economy, important ever national authority around world stick policy framework. it stay course establish steady base sustain growth long term. canada's economic prospect let give bank canada's view state canadian economy outlook. first, bite history. follow 11 september 2001 terrorist attack unite states, bank canada, like major central banks, move quickly aggressively cut policy interest rate shore confidence. that dramatic monetary policy action help great deal. by spring 2002, become evident economy knock track event 11 september. indeed, evidence start build economy grow fast production potential, take remain small amount economic slack. so, raise key policy rate three time april july, total three-quarters percentage point. but late last summer, see effect financial headwinds, geopolitical uncertainties, continue weakness global economy. these factor remain play autumn. a result, refrain raise interest rates, even though inflation accelerating. our initial analysis increase inflation would temporary. however, core total cpi inflation remain well target. this reflect impact higher-than-expected price crude oil natural gas, continue increase auto insurance premiums, price pressure certain sectors, housing, food, services. the high inflation also suggest underlie firmness price-setting environment. in words, relative price increase push trend inflation sufficient demand. 4 bi review 15/2003 indeed, final domestic demand - especially household spend - remain robust. however, economic growth canada moderate final three month 2002, largely weak export - notably, decline automotive shipment unite states. even slow growth fourth quarter, upward revision previous quarter leave level economic activity slightly high monitoring. in fact, canada's economy remain near full capacity. let list indicator support view: high industrial capacity utilization; near record-high labour force participation rates; record-high employment-to-population ratio; corporate profit high level since early 2001; and, i say moment ago, above-target trend inflation. while continue foresee growth somewhat potential first half year, expect increase demand second half 2003 2004, global uncertainty diminish. but appropriate reduction amount monetary stimulus, see level output remain close capacity year 2004. so, make interest rate decision 4 march, weigh follow considerations: domestic inflation pressures; expectation canadian economic activity remain near potential 2003 despite geopolitical uncertainties; stimulative stance monetary policy; improve condition capital markets. take factor account, bank raise key policy rate one-quarter percentage point 3 per cent. even increase, stance monetary policy remain stimulative. thus, time, reduction monetary stimulus require return inflation target medium term. but, said, time pace increase policy interest rate continue depend number considerations. these include strength demand pressures; evolution inflation expectations; impact confidence geopolitical global economic uncertainties; way development middle east affect demand inflation, globally canada. the bank continue closely monitor factors. * * * so, conclude, certainly challenge economic times. but canada remain convince merit economic policy consensus reach oecd. to reiterate, policy are: monetary policy aim medium-term price stability; fiscal policy aim reduce public debt-to-gdp ratios; trade liberalization; meaningful structural reform. canada's positive economic experience past couple years, face stressful time global economy, strong evidence framework right one. in canada, determination stick policy which, especially uncertain times, demonstrate value. bi review 14/2003 1 l wilson kamit, cbe: an overview financial economic development papua new guinea speech mr l wilson kamit, cbe,

respectively. thank attention. bi review 14/2003 1 yves mersch: the interplay monetary policy fiscal policy emu speech mr yves mersch, governor central bank luxembourg, algafi general assembly, luxembourg, 12 march 2003. * * * introduction it pleasure take part algafi general assembly luxembourg. i satisfy algafi give opportunity discus extremely interest issue, namely interplay monetary fiscal policy emu. for obvious reasons, i refer specific case luxembourg instead primarily talk european monetary union (emu) whole. however, i privilege luxembourg dimension need emerge illustrate contentions. the advent emu prompt renewal debate interplay fiscal monetary policy. although debate multifaceted, i narrow three basic questions. in opinion, question address relevant issue stake. the first question whether co-ordination fiscal monetary policy enhance euro area, order secure efficient policy mix. there would exist strong argument enhance coordination first sight, existence many interaction channel monetary policy fiscal policy. on one hand, monetary policy affect interest rate conditions, significant impact interest rate expenditure. let remember interest charge represent 4% gdp euro area consider whole, close 6,5% belgium, italy greece. on hand, fiscal policy influence aggregate demand long-term interest rates, course take board elaboration monetary policy. furthermore, aggregate demand interest rate direct impact balance sheet financial intermediary and, hence, transmission channel monetary policy. the second question conceptually link first one, become clear answer. this question whether fiscal policy play prominent role emu, order palliate so-called asymmetric shock context monetary policy long define national level. by definition, shock affect subset country embrace euro area whole. for reason, play central role conduct area-wide monetary policy. on hand, however, asymmetric shock could inflict macroeconomic instability member state concerned. on priori grounds, would justify enhance role active fiscal policy national level. the third last question relate whether fiscal policy rule encapsulate european union treaty stability growth pact constrain favorable impact way monetary policy conduct implemented, whether unduly restrict room maneuver national government context monetary policy long design national level. my conclusion center mutual reinforcement stability-oriented monetary fiscal policies. first question let provide answer three questions. a regard first one, i would simply say enhance coordination fiscal monetary policy way necessary condition smooth function monetary policy euro area. from purely theoretical viewpoint, improve coordination could help achieve appropriate combination monetary policy fiscal policy. the result policy mix would efficient, sense authority would able fine tune policy action response type economic shock face. however, conceptual validity contention guarantee widely held, several necessary condition design adequate policy mix fulfilled. 2 bi review 14/2003 first, usually extremely difficult differentiate type economic shock involve - whether shock permanent transitory, whether demand supply shock - except maybe several year occurrence problem. a fortiori, therefore impossible pick policy mix best suit economic circumstances. this undoubtedly cast shadow feasibility active explicit coordination monetary fiscal policy. the second “practical” argument opinion even powerful. the cornerstone “coordination paradigm” contention fiscal policy able impact aggregate demand timely significant way. for reason, combine monetary policy effective way, depend state economy nature underlie shocks. however, “ideal policy mix” would turn lame duck circumstance fiscal policy cannot activate timely fashion expect impact macroeconomic situation. in words, co-ordination monetary policy fiscal policy compare walk man, stand firm legs. should one leg fail respond timely coordinate way whatever reason, many adverse consequence would inevitably follow. although fiscal policy course extremely useful many respects, i quite skeptical regard specific feature important elaboration appropriate policy mix, namely stabilisation property active fiscal policy gear towards macroeconomic fine-tuning. this “leg” seem quite unreliable me, several reasons. first all, experience show fiscal impulse frequently implement late, occurrence shock. these delay simply reflect time-consuming decision-making process. let draw attention various step involved: identification problem, elaboration require measures, discussion measure political adoption, implementation time take exert impact aggregate demand. there many example allegedly contra-cyclical policy turn exert procyclical impact economy time lag involved. in circumstances, fiscal impulse could contribute magnify economic cycles. in addition, long variable delay increase uncertainty impact discretionary measure economy. this “impact uncertainty” increase uncertainty economic agent monetary policy-makers. furthermore, stabilisation policy conduct symmetrical way order avoid systematic drift level public expenditure. this condition unfortunately difficult fulfill, many expenditure item flexible downwards. they could increase easy way policy mix require expansionary fiscal policy, decline magnitude probability implement restrictive stance become appropriate. let give example luxembourg illustrate validity point. the compensation employee social transfer - two expenditure category characterise weak downward flexibility evident reason - jointly account 70% total general government expenditure. on priori grounds, intermediate consumption general government could use symmetric way timely manner, expenditure item account 3% gdp. in addition, split central government local governments, would also require close co-ordination two entities. the weak magnitude fiscal multiplier europe cast additional doubt validity fine-tune approach. all available empirical evidence indeed show so-called leakage effect significant euro area countries, due high import content expenditure and, far revenue concerned, high propensity save. multiplier course also small luxembourg, especially government revenue side, luxembourg really epitome small, open economy. a final reason skeptical ability fiscal policy fine-tune economy discretion existence so-called “non-keynesian” effects. although concept may seem complicate first sight, merely refer impact expect budgetary development private consumption. these non-keynesian effect could dampen impact active budget policy. for instance, private consumer might incline save government expenditure tend increase, expect tax levy future order finance budgetary imbalance associate fiscal impulse. accord specialise economic literature, effect would high high level public debt tax burden. give low public debt luxembourg, factor play prominent role country first sight. however, i convince non-keynesian effect could emerge also luxembourg context, case long-term sustainability public finance bi review 14/2003 3 long guaranteed. thus need monitor instance budgetary consequence population age inflow cross-border foreign workers. these various practical problem make extremely difficult design appropriate combination monetary policy fiscal policy, complicate fact monetary policy conduct proactive way, basis projection future inflationary developments. my answer question “is co-ordination fiscal monetary policy necessary condition smooth monetary policy” therefore clearly negative. in many circumstances, coordination could even turn counterproductive. it would blur clear delineation responsibility policy maker would undermine commitment national government fiscal discipline. second question my answer second question - whether fiscal policy play prominent role due fact monetary policy long conduct national level - also extremely clear. at first sight, fiscal policy could use active way member state order palliate disappearance specifically national monetary policy. this active use fiscal policy would dampen asymmetric shocks, would contribute reinforce homogeneity euro area economy. this argument conceptually appealing, practice foundation rather shaky, say least. more specifically, i think would extremely difficult iron impact asymmetric shock via active fiscal policy. this simply particular case general contention fine-tuning, demand management strategy would extremely difficult carry national level. this contention make relation first question co-ordination. my answer second question therefore increase role fiscal policy justify practical grounds, least far active fiscal policy concerned. however, absence national monetary policy conduct national level also magnify importance i would call “passive” form fiscal policy, base free play automatic fiscal stabilisers. the reliance automatic stabiliser - basically unemployment expenditure tax - would general preferable active fiscal policy, immediate impact aggregate demand. in addition, unlike discretionary policies, persistent effect fiscal variables, since reverse soon economic condition change. in luxembourg, automatic stabiliser tend exert stabilise impact public investments, investment programme typically go heavy legal procedures, result long variable implementation lags. of course, free play automatic stabiliser presuppose attainment sound budgetary position, demonstrate answer third question. third question but i address third question, let briefly recall salient point fiscal rule encapsulate treaty establish european community stability growth pact. the treaty (and protocol annex it) contain three crucial rule relate fiscal discipline. since widely known, i describe concise way. a first rule basically state general government deficit exceed reference value 3% gdp. a second, stock-oriented rule require general government debt high 60% gdp, unless ratio “is sufficiently diminish approach reference value satisfactory pace”. a third rule prohibit monetary finance different subcomponents public sector community institution bodies. the treaty supplement stability growth pact. the cornerstone pact two council regulation adopt 1997. under pact, member state expect adhere medium-term objective general government balance close balance surplus. in order establish adherence, member state require present stability convergence programme year. these programme present inter alia medium-term objective budgetary balance adjustment path towards “close surplus balance” position. the ecofin council require deliver opinion national programme, give way “peer pressure”. in case failure adhere treaty reference values, “excessive deficit 4 bi review 14/2003 procedure” principle implemented. sanction could apply case excessive deficit established. in opinion, framework way impediment smooth conduct implementation single monetary policy. i would indeed argue aforementioned fiscal rule clearly supportive stable monetary policy, least three reasons. - first, prohibition monetary finance couple high degree independence ecb national central bank ensure potentially destabilise link fiscal monetary policy long exists. a regime monetary finance allow indeed characterise “soft” intertemporal budget constraint. in situation, government may tempt resort inflation tax order finance budgetary deficits. the result situation could “mutually destructive” monetary fiscal policy. in context, fiscal discipline could indeed degenerate loose fiscal policy, latter would turn contaminate monetary policy. monetary policy would therefore become unpredictable would increase volatility monetary base inflation rate. in extreme case, situation could lead hyperinflation, illustrate instance situation germany weimar republic. emu congenitally immune episodes, owe prohibition monetary finance independence central bank euro area. - second, i convince fiscal rule embed treaty stability growth pact incompatible free play automatic stabilisers. a i tell earlier, automatic stabiliser especially important, help counteract asymmetric shock national level situation monetary policy conduct euro area level. provide member state able reach close balance surplus position, could indeed let automatic stabiliser operate full, without incur risk breach 3% reference value. a close balance surplus position indeed mean cyclically adjust fiscal balance equilibrium. in situation, would require negative output gap, equal 6% gdp, reach nominal deficit excess 3% free play automatic stabilisers. this underline override importance attainment close balance surplus position. let also highlight position would require nominal surplus favorable economic circumstances. in words, essential apply strict fiscal discipline also economic upturns. - third, attainment sound fiscal position compatible treaty stability growth pact would facilitate considerable extent conduct monetary policy. the absence clear bind fiscal rule could result non-cooperative equilibrium, characterise high long-term interest rates. this illustrate example individual member state will tolerate high deficit issue debt security order finance result gap. this additional debt issuance would likelihood give way crowd effect - namely upward pressure interest rate due drain private savings. the key point emu - exist single currency high degree integration national financial market - additional burden would bear euro area whole, individual member state responsible additional debt issuance. this kind spillover effect could encourage member state issue excessive amount debts. a result, euro area-wide interest rate would tend high require economic fundamentals. such situation could complicate considerable extent conduct monetary policy, underline need resort commonly share rule fiscal restraints. conclusion let conclude statement relationship monetary fiscal policy run ways. first, i would like point predictable fiscal policy foster aforementioned fiscal rule would produce stable environment regards, instance, inflation rate, aggregate demand tax burden. such environment would conducive economic financial stability, would enhance efficiency monetary policy. bi review 14/2003 5 it also go without say predictable monetary policy supportive fiscal discipline. more predictable short-term interest change indeed liable impact budgetary equilibrium several member states. in addition, stable monetary policy able anchor inflation expectation economic agent generate low le volatile long-term interest rates, dampen risk budgetary slippage induce unforeseen interest rate developments. more predictable interest rate also extremely important luxembourg general government, spite extremely low public debt level observe luxembourg. first, asset luxembourg general government - include accumulate reserve investment special fund asset hold general pension regime - quite substantial, associate income primarily dependent short long-term interest rate developments. second, soundness profitability financial sector, account one third tax collect luxembourg central government, sensitive level short-term interest rates, slope yield curve also stock exchange prices, namely three variable either directly fix strongly influence monetary policy. the importance predictable monetary policy luxembourg government particularly apparent context. bi review 14/2003 1 svein gjedrem: monetary policy

southern norway conference, kristiansand, 11 march 2003. the address base assessment present norge bank's press conference follow executive board's monetary policy meet 5 march previous speeches. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. * * * oil major component norwegian economy - advantage disadvantage entails. oil give u economic base available many countries. but also present u considerable challenges. how use petroleum wealth wisely? this question pose number economic policy challenges. in discussion today, i focus three points: first, must manage petroleum resource recognise part national wealth. when oil extract sold, natural asset transform financial wealth. this income ordinary sense. norway’s national wealth belong generation, also future generations. this mean petroleum wealth must equitably distribute generations. the authority must therefore discipline apply long-term consideration spending. moreover, size cash flow petroleum activity vary considerably. if use accrues, would enormous impact demand impulse norwegian economy, dramatically amplify cyclical fluctuations. third, use petroleum revenue impact competitiveness norwegian business industry. a high level earn substantial fluctuation use petroleum revenue may considerable impact operate parameter internationally expose industries. it therefore important succeed maintain industry structure promote learning, innovation development. we phase petroleum wealth convert natural resource seabed financial asset abroad. both type wealth involve large amount capital part national wealth, provide basis norway’s potential consumption long term. consequently, crucial national wealth manage sound prudent manner, return high risk acceptable. petroleum production generate profit excess normal return, i.e. economic rent. a economic rent accrue state, give central government cash flow petroleum activities. thus, central government accumulate substantial capital. management petroleum fund pose challenges. at time, demographic challenge faced: work population decline sharply, proportion receive income public sector rise. the chart illustrate development labour force number pensioner period 2050. the blue line show labour force project increase 150 000 2000 2030. old-age disability pensioner increase 500 000, show grey line. this mean number person labour force relative number pensioner fall 2.6 1.8. these rough estimate among thing base assumption labour immigration remain present level. the increase number pensioner result sharp increase obligation old-age disability pension funds. expenditure old-age disability pension expect double share total gdp course next 30 years. the increase number elderly, especially age 80, time require increase resource nurse care services. welfare reform adopt also contribute increase need resource public service sector year ahead. 2 bi review 13/2003 with age population strong growth expenditure pension nurse care services, petroleum wealth welcome source revenues. this particularly important manage sound manner. petroleum activity substantial component norwegian economy. in chart, petroleum investment show blue line, red line show central government’s net cash flow petroleum activities. petroleum investment rise sharply 1970s subsequently vary 4 8 per cent gdp. petroleum investment fluctuate considerably substantial impact cyclical development norwegian economy. the authority regulate petroleum investment limit extent. it therefore difficult prevent impulse norwegian economy generate fluctuations. consequently, important prevent fluctuation cash flow central government activity direct impact economy. allow illustrate consequence might have: let u suppose oil price temporarily increase nok 20 per barrel, little le usd 3 per barrel. this small change, well within normal variation one year next. the central government’s net cash flow petroleum activity would increase around nok 16 billion first year nok 20-22 billion next. this correspond almost 2 per cent norway's annual gdp. if increase cash flow take economy high expenditure reduce tax central government budget, aggregate domestic demand affected. high expenditure require increase public sector's use real resources, primarily labour. two per cent gdp substantial figure. if increase petroleum revenue use domestically, would correspond almost annual growth mainland economy normal year. if private sector economy also expanding, economy already close capacity limit, policy would swiftly lead strong pressure economic resources. this would result rise wage prices. this policy would also lead unstable condition foreign exchange market. when oil price fell central government expenditure dropped, economy would experience strong contraction. the government petroleum fund establish 1990 view safeguard long-term consideration use petroleum revenues. the idea behind petroleum fund cash flow increase oil price accrue fund invest abroad increase oil price affect wide budget. thus, rather affect domestic economy, increase cash flow would invest abroad petroleum fund. similarly, fall oil price would affect domestic economy, would result low accumulation foreign assets. by build fund, aim ensure several generation enjoy benefit petroleum wealth also take account. in march 2001, fiscal guideline new guideline monetary policy introduced. the guideline fiscal policy imply central government budget deficit shall equivalent time expect real return government petroleum fund. the new guideline economic policy receive broad support storting. the guideline specify real return petroleum fund use mean capital fund depleted. the capital petroleum fund increase long positive cash flow (to central government) petroleum activities. when conversion petroleum asset financial wealth completed, objective still restrict withdrawal real value fund’s capital maintain - principle, indefinitely. the guideline thereby provide long-term anchor fiscal policy. the guideline provide stable framework contribute curb fluctuation norwegian economy cause convert petroleum asset investment home abroad. the guideline adhere past two years. a mentioned, large conversion national wealth next thirty year oil recoverable reserve oil financial wealth. the question might, course, raise whether alternative option would keep wealth form oil extract needed. whether would profitable depend oil price development compare return financial assets. bi review 13/2003 3 if look period 1986 compare development nominal oil price return fund manage accord petroleum fund's investment strategy - global portfolio contain bond equity 60-40 distribution - see fund would yield far high annual return. what risk? how affect conversion oil financial wealth? history provide u clear, somewhat surprise answer. a conversion oil financial wealth increase return time reduce risk. this wealth seabed (somewhat simplified) consist one asset, petroleum, broadly invest financial wealth highly diversify many instrument whose return fluctuate different rates. today distribution financial wealth (the petroleum fund) petroleum 20-80. if venture base assessment historical relationships, fairly clear have, relatively speaking, much oil portfolio current conversion financial wealth advantage. we guarantee, course, history repeat itself, rely opposite require considerable courage. the petroleum fund invest two main type instruments; bond equities. the international bond market size equity market. government bond relatively safe investment, return low. long-term rate u europe currently stand around 4 per cent. new investment thus achieve annual real rate return 1½-2 per cent. by way comparison, authority base use petroleum revenue central government budget assumption petroleum fund generate long-term real return 4 per cent. it unlikely rate return achieve invest bonds. buy bond mean lend money others. buy equity invest real assets. buy equity give u direct ownership mean production global business industry. on one hand, ownership right provide high return company flourishing. on other, shareholder first sustain loss company fail. consequently, return share fluctuate far return bonds, reflect high level risk. over past 75 years, equity return u market negative almost every third year. an investor invest high-risk vehicle reasonable expect compensation risk. the compensation high risk stock market far high average return equity compare bonds. since 1926, annual return u equity average 4.8 percentage point high return bonds. also ten-year periods, invest u equity profitable, exception depression 1930s last half 1970s. equity return negative ten year year 1928 1938, word equity investment make year 1929 stock market crash. it may also worth note equity purchase recession - mid-1930s mid-1970s - bring solid return ten year later. the picture countries. since short-term fluctuation equity price difficult predict, may sound strategy keep share equity constant time. this mean buy relatively large volume equity price low, buy small volume - sell - price high. this strategy apply petroleum fund. let u revert norwegian economy norwegian economic policy. the revision economic policy march 2001 extent say consequence oil economy. the new guideline also change interaction different component economic policy. fiscal policy expansionary effect. in order prevent pressure become strong, monetary policy tight would otherwise case. monetary policy therefore give clear role stabilise economic developments. a clear monetary policy target necessary complement fiscal guideline view ensure reasonable macroeconomic stability. the operational target monetary policy define government inflation close 2.5 per cent time. the inflation target provide economic agent anchor decision concern saving, investment, budget wages. households, businesses, public entities, employee employer base decision assumption inflation norway 2½ per cent time. the rise labour cost important factor underlie norge bank’s assessment inflation outlook interest rate decisions. if wage growth high - manufacture industry industry - internationally expose sector affect two ways. first, high wage 4 bi review 13/2003 growth reduce earn employment. second, interest rate raised. normally, lead appreciation krone, reduction earn employment. this amplify impact high wage growth manufacture industry. since new guideline use petroleum revenue introduce period labour market tight, krone expect strong periods. the interest rate differential norway trade partner result strong krone. the wide interest rate differential due historically low level interest rate abroad. the slowdown global growth pronounce span long period expected. the norwegian economy also felt effect this. norge bank therefore low sight deposit rate 7 5.5 per cent since 11 december, recently 5 march. the interest rate differential narrowed. since mid-january, krone depreciated, partly reflect expectation low interest rates. monetary policy relaxed. there uncertainty associate development many factor influence inflation ahead, among others exchange rate. this imply gradual approach conduct monetary policy. increase spend petroleum revenue implication norway’s industry structure. high demand good service require domestic resources, necessitate high employment shelter sector. this labour recruit expose sector, natural increase labour force find way shelter sector. even employment output norwegian manufacture industry fall, development norwegian enterprise may necessarily negative. some enterprise may cut edge technology, increase efficiency pace rise cost norway. others may relocate labour-intensive activity abroad. the scale back manufacture still involve risk. it make economy vulnerable; foundation learning, innovation development may undermine small share business sector expose intense international competition. even sustain extra currency income form return petroleum fund, main share norwegian import must finance use revenue derive export good service mainland norway. this place demand profitability expose industries. in long run, cost competitiveness must adapt need finance import secure balance external economy. import currently account 30 per cent gdp norway. the return petroleum fund range 4-5 per cent gdp bulk oil resource extract convert financial wealth. this mean close 1/5 import finance basis oil long run. in words, share import remain current level, sizeable internationally expose sector need finance imports. both petroleum wealth financial wealth sizeable. however, discount value labour predominant asset. our livelihood essentially depends, continue depend future, ability produce good service efficiently labour, use creativity innovation become ever efficient. this illustrate follow example: if perception oil make u wealthy extent relax lead reduction annual productivity growth quarter percentage point, i.e. reduction trend gdp growth current level 2 per cent 1¾ per cent, income base would reduce entire return petroleum wealth. society suddenly gain access wealth derive natural resource tendency spend money fall decline. a clear example find spain already 1660s. the colonisation south central america give country access wealth natural resources, gold. spain choose spend large portion windfall luxury war. the attitude work lead make easy country get back foot gold come end. many country similar experience recent times. the expression “dutch disease” come turn event dutch economy 1970s 1980s revenue large gas find groningen field use finance strong growth public spending. when gas revenue declined, economic growth come halt economy policy tightened. bi review 13/2003 5 several study relationship long-term economic growth natural resource show country abundant suppy natural resource tendency experience low economic growth. why? in principle, abundance natural resource advantage country's economy. one main find study relationship long-term economic growth supply natural resource illustrate chart. the chart make jeffrey sachs andrew warner, two prominent researcher study phenomenon come know “resource curse”. they use size country’s export natural resource relation gdp 1970 measure rich various country term natural resources. there negative correlation supply natural resource economic growth period 1970-1989. the group country high growth rate include asian tigers, limit supply natural resources. several oil-rich country around persian gulf fall group country low growth. this could suggest necessarily advantage abundance natural resources. there many factor influence economic growth. sachs warner look one factor chart. the relationship prove relatively robust, however. it true economist argue negative relationship apply institutional factor country include study take account. venezuela one poor perform country sachs warner study. the country large know oil reserve world, also abundance natural resources. venezuela among large oil producer since 1920s. but result unsound economic policy, country able achieve solid stable economic growth. after rise oil price 1970s, government spend increase sharply. in 1980s, fiscal policy also highly expansionary. the result high inflation rise unemployment. close 85 per cent country’s population live poverty. economic growth weak. between 1970 2002, gdp per caput fall 20 per cent. why many country fail make good use windfalls? there may number reasons. in term economic policy, explanation wealth derive resource lead extreme focus acquire much extra wealth various groups. the contest profit often refer “rent-seeking behaviour”. country abundance natural resource may vulnerable extreme “rent-seeking behaviour” economy limit supply natural resources. the competition various faction lead inefficient tap natural resource unsound use revenues. the spirit enterprise, talent energy business political life use acquire share income rather foster productive activity public private sector. for individual company group, activity may seem rational - 10 per cent chance win jackpot could good invest business yield ordinary return. this may damage consequence country. a sociological explanation easily acquire wealth weaken incentive innovation work. we feel become rich want live good life. a possible economic explanation large broad sector expose international competition foster learn development. without sector, competitive intensity economy may decline ability willingness innovative may impaired. we must cautious draw final conclusion base historical comparisons. we would prefer assume manage wealth better. however, may particular relevance highlight three critical pre-conditions succeed this. first: decision-making form process political economic arena must provide effective protection acquisition interest group right use large share petroleum wealth. second: it important growth potential economy maintain broad sector mainland economy work intense competition maintain strengthen incentive acquire knowledge innovative. third: it important bear mind issue distribution across generation manage wealth asset. 6 bi review 13/2003 1. from petroleum financial

european central bank: press conference - introductory statement introductory statement mr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank mr lucas papademos, vice-president european central bank, press conference hold frankfurt, 6 march 2003. * * * lady gentlemen, vice-president i report outcome today's meet govern council ecb. we comprehensively review monetary, financial economic development today. we conclude outlook price stability medium term improve recent months, owe particular subdue pace economic growth appreciation exchange rate euro. a result, govern council decide low key ecb interest rate 25 basis points. let explain assessment recent economic development detail. a regard analysis first pillar monetary policy strategy, three-month average annual growth rate m3 7.1% period november 2002 january 2003, compare 6.9% period october december 2002. the continue strong monetary growth reflect ongoing pronounce preference liquidity environment high financial, economic geopolitical uncertainty. although liquidity remain ample, expect stage give rise inflationary pressures, give current economic context expectation portfolio shift reverse financial market uncertainty diminishes. recent data loan private sector, notably weak growth loan non-financial corporation late 2002, confirm assessment. turn analysis second pillar, available data survey indicate economic activity euro area remain sluggish late 2002 first month 2003. in light recent developments, outlook economic growth euro area 2003 weaken compare previous expectations, owe especially geopolitical tension associate rise oil prices. accordingly, modest rate economic growth expect year. consider price developments, accord eurostat, annual hicp inflation estimate 2.3% february 2003, slightly 2.2% january. the main factor behind change seem rise oil prices. in addition, base effect relate food price may contribute renew increase annual inflation february. the ongoing volatility oil market make difficult forecast short-term inflation developments. however, normalisation market occurred, fundamental factor dominate price developments. first, significant appreciation nominal effective exchange rate euro past year expect continue fee economy consumer prices, via import producer prices. second, moderate pace economic growth also reduce inflationary pressures, influence price cost-setting behaviours. if oil price moderate future, currently expect markets, likely outcome inflation rate fall 2% course 2003 remain clearly level line price stability thereafter. this baseline scenario rely assumption that, especially environment subdue economic growth, wage moderation prevail. in fact, recent indication suggest modest wage development towards end last year, picture would need confirm future. overall, ecb key interest rate reach level low. on basis currently available information, policy stance, contribute preservation price stability medium term, provide counterbalance various factor currently adverse effect economic activity. look ahead, likely scenario economic growth gradually recover factor contribute high economic uncertainty diminished. while expect weak economic activity begin year imply low average economic growth 2003, rise quarterly growth rate materialise course year. over time, euro area economy 2 bi review 13/2003 benefit global economic recovery prevail low level interest rates, well fall inflation support real disposable income underpin private consumption growth. however, judgement future development overshadow present geopolitical tension potential resolution. monetary policy cannot address kind uncertainty. depend developments, govern council stand ready act decisively timely manner. the prospect euro area economy depend much measure take policy areas. a fiscal policy, adherence country framework lay treaty stability growth pact support stable sustainable public finances, thereby contribute significantly

hence, commitment make stability programme request improve fiscal positions, subsequently agree ecofin council, must implement full. in respect, measure part comprehensive growth-oriented strategy, country mean put focus restrain volume, reform structure, public expenditure. finally, outlook euro area economy could significantly improve government strengthen effort implement structural reform labour product markets. such reform important ultimately raise euro area's production potential, improve flexibility economy, make euro area resilient external shocks. in particular current juncture,

swedish society financial analysts, stockholm, 5 march 2003. * * * thank invitation come speak swedish society financial analysts. this first public appearance new role deputy governor riksbank. it stimulate meet people discus economic issues. at time, i feel little nervous, i know i face audience use examine interpret statement riksbank. one difference post previous work member executive board must extent exercise caution speak publicly. this avoid create misunderstand among participant financial market, try translate statement representative central bank future interest rate policy. this mean may acquaint me, aim honest clear i possibly can. what i intend start talk today development economy recent year follow look ahead challenge face swedish international economic climates, finally say something monetary policy. those familiar economic assessment i make know i sometimes share riksbank’s conclusions. but please remember interpret mean i different opinion riksbank’s objectives. i consider good thing conduct open discussion policy pursued. and i hope intend take part discussion, whole point open central bank facilitate discussion allow improve monetary policy. riksbank focus total inflation picture i shall begin describe way riksbank works. the riksdag assign two main objective riksbank: maintain price stability promote safe efficient payment system. today i shall concentrate first two objectives. the riksbank define target monetary policy limit inflation 2 per cent, tolerate deviation interval plus/minus one percentage point. this tolerate interval indicate deviation likely, limited. the objective word term consumer price index (cpi), broad index consist price basket good service consume average swedish household. a interest cost indirect tax include cpi inflation assess long-term effect inflation, riksbank choose normally focus und1x, index exclude factors. from time time may also reason disregard price change assess temporary. our ambition make clear do so. by raise low steer interest rate - repo rate - riksbank attempt influence inflation. a difficult steer inflation short term, riksbank make assessment development come 1-2 years. this period time usually assume necessary interest rate adjustment work way economy full impact rate price increase, i.e. inflation. the riksbank us simple rule-of-thumb shape monetary policy. if total picture inflation show expect target level, steer interest rate adjust accordingly. there four main factor analysis future inflation stand central shape monetary policy: development total resource utilisation, international price trends, exchange rate general public’s inflation expectations. inflationary pressure vary accord demand situation change resource utilisation. the strong upturn demand relation potential production, great risk price wage rise rapidly vice versa. this work central bank around world must analyse picture economic activity whole, despite fact inflation target variable. international price trends, where, instance, oil price important factor, affect domestic inflation way imports. an assessment international resource utilisation provide indication, instance, international price may develop. the development value krona important assessment inflation. a change exchange rate direct effect inflation price import good service affected, also indirect effect via aggregate demand. if value krona change relation important trade currencies, affect competitiveness swedish good service thereby demand resource utilisation. inflation expectation among household company also affect price-setting wage formation process thereby inflation. one purpose clear inflation target monetary policy govern target firmly establish inflation target general public. at time, one remember riksbank force take account many factor influence price trends. these often non-recurring factors, supply shock various forms, often difficult predict. but difficult use monetary policy prevent impact inflation. monetary policy impact time lag, always reach source price rise. for instance, central bank cannot prevent oil price rise wake concern possible war middle east. on hand, central bank could course try quickly tighten demand country push price area thus ensure average rate price increase remain line target level. the focus inflation 1-2 year ahead, entail monetary policy conduct gradually, little little, rather constant acceleration braking, would risk create unnecessary variation demand could turn negative effect production employment. the focus come 1-2 year period thus mean temporary rise fall inflation rate tolerated. however, important riksbank clear communication whether consider rise temporary expect subside. one-off shift price level last effect future inflation if, instance, involve believe rise temporary, assess last thus wish compensate upturn. if occurs, monetary policy must use intervene, even economic situation provide cause concern regard inflation, prevent inflation take hold expectations. the reason quite simply costly term reduce production employment force inflation expectation become establish high level rather prevent rising. parallel current situation 2001 plus 2002 let u take look current situation begin price rises. now, spring 2001, inflation rise result temporary factor pull general level prices. during 2001 mad-cow disease foot-and-mouth disease push meat price poor harvest lead soar price fruit vegetables. then also water shortage hydroelectric power companies’ reservoirs, push electricity prices. at moment, electricity oil price soar push inflation figure target level january. this become particularly clear one separate energy price inflation figure january (diagram 1). the riksbank’s assessment upturn inflation temporary, 2001, expect see low inflation early late spring summer. however, assessment base assumption set price try compensate temporary price increase. if occurs, risk induce tendency towards inflation spiral, riksbank could stand witness silence. at time, would unfortunate, particularly light challenge face swedish economy, force manage contagion effect energy price rise interest rate rises. if one look economic climate, i consider similarity present situation time last year strike comparison 2001. here i mainly refer fact economic prospect time uncertain regard far adaptation process come over-optimism previous years, lead abnormally high share price overly large investment company usa. let go back time roughly one year see conclusion draw last year implication might future developments. development 2002 2003 at begin last year sign light end economic outlook tunnel. i wasn’t work riksbank then, don’t surprise part historical description differ slightly riksbank, express inflation reports. the sign turnaround pronounce usa, also signal europe threshold recovery. the reduction stock appear well way, usually first requirement upturn production. however, production increase bring adjustment stock durable, must support last increase demand. household consumption continue increase, upturn investment. the imbalance trade industry usa perhaps tangible many anticipated. bankruptcy account scandal create unease financial markets, fell rate reminiscent 1930s crisis. in europe sign economic recovery mainly concern optimistic expectations; expectation late realised. the large euro economy, germany, particular prove poor condition anticipated. however, question imbalance like usa, structural problems, high level unemployment set weak public finances, make difficult conduct economic policy would support business climate. furthermore, expect support force side atlantic export industry weak expected. in sweden, slowdown 2001 limit effect unemployment. the riksbank’s calculation begin 2002 indicate resource utilisation relatively strained. economic policy stimulate effect economy, low tax high transfers. give conditions, signal recovery become clear begin 2002, riksbank elect raise steer interest rate two occasion spring, total 0.5 percentage point 4.25 per cent. these increase also regard light fact inflation still high level risk negative effect inflation expectations. during spring rate price increase turn back towards target 2 per cent forecast. a external analyst assessment differ slightly riksbank. this apply international picture, uncertain whether turnaround actually take place, resource utilisation sweden risk tension could cause rise inflation. i interpret high rate wage increase delay effect overheat labour market 2000 part 2001. shortage labour market ease considerably spring 2002. in service sector, construction, capacity utilisation fall significantly, indicate wage increase would gradually become subdued. i therefore perceive inflation risk le evident see immediate need raise interest rate. it clear inflation risk riksbank seem see decline unease financial market grow wake bankruptcy corporate scandal usa. gradually, unease increase security policy developments. the financial unease gradually infect real economy; confidence among company consumer begin fall several country summer become increasingly clear total demand negatively affected. this contribute enable riksbank low repo rate twice autumn, measure assessment quite fit circumstances. what observe today, compare one year ago, question baffle forecaster roughly dominate question far adaptation process follow stock market bubble come. today additional factor make assessment difficult threat war middle east. we know whether war end. the crisis also create uncertainty make difficult correctly interpret economic signals. in addition, prolong crisis is, great risk actual uncertainty negative effect real economy. i shall turn towards future discus development come 1-2 years. right condition recovery usa… one difference compare situation one year ago adaptation imbalance u economy probably progress further. consolidation balance sheet continued, productivity strong normal business activity pattern indicate condition relatively favourable increase industrial production spring. low stock level relation sale investment ratio long-term trend would indicate case. an expansionary economic policy provide support optimism. however, question people ask now, 2002, whether adaptation imbalance reach sufficient stage enable broad, last increase demand take drive force behind production increase. it much early able give clear answer here. if look household usa, see become passive since december inflation report published. the explanation could security policy unease still weak stock markets. continue high oil price also cut disposable incomes. however, expansionary economic policy partly counteract effects. all all, i believe picture relatively prolong recovery usa, growth gradually increase year attain economy’s long-term sustainable level, remain part intact. … condition turnaround euro area poorer. the total international recovery expect come year look strong riksbank anticipate december. the background development euro area general germany particular look rather gloomy before. the euro area’s export industry hamper international uncertainty, well strong euro weak labour market affect households’ consumption confidence future. this mean international economic prospect look rather poor now, also conclusion executive board monetary policy meet 6 february. however, assessment base assumption iraq crisis develop way significantly deteriorate economic prospects. flat growth path swedish economy the financial unease also affect swedish economy. industrial production stand still autumn order book slow fill. this perhaps strange light “wait-and-see” mentality prevail important export markets. however, international economic climate improves, cyclical pattern investment expect give impetus industrial production sweden. over past six months, swedish household become increasingly pessimistic view future, perhaps understandable take account negative news confronted: rise energy prices, high tax expect cuts. the scope consumption pressure factor near future. at time, households’ save high level 2002, mean may scope increase consumption despite restrain effects. altogether, i believe also reason downward revision estimate swedish growth rate come years. the expect upturn assess somewhat superficial. this also assume iraq conflict develop way seriously deteriorate future prospects. the shape monetary policy a decisive factor shape monetary policy future total picture inflation prospects. a slightly subdue growth demand sweden abroad expect lead capacity utilisation slightly le strained. at time, energy price push inflation. however, riksbank’s assessment upturn inflation temporary reason expect low inflation early late spring summer. although, i say earlier, assume set price wage attempt compensate temporary price rise. all all, question balance risk of, instance, weak growth economy, risk upturn inflation contagion effects. this executive board must monetary policy meet 17 march. und1x includingand

statement mr linah k mohohlo, governor bank botswana, gaborone, 25 february 2003. * * * introduction i privilege honour welcome important event calendar bank - presentation monetary policy statement 2003. let begin refresh memory objective content monetary policy statement, bank botswana issue every year. the statement serf several purposes. first, provide opportunity bank report inflation monetary policy development previous year, present assessment outlook inflation current year. second, enable bank outline policy issue approach take formulate policy stance response inflation-related development throughout year. third, monetary policy statement contains, certainly since last year, bank’s annual objective inflation credit growth, explanation derived. the statement, therefore, play important role convey stakeholder public large range information relate one bank’s core function - formulation implementation monetary policy. while transparency entail presentation monetary policy statement important right, also important influence economic financial expectations, well behaviour economic agents. the bank’s aim engender public expectation sustainable low inflation consistent broad objective macroeconomic balance basis sustainable growth. in addition, statement serf vehicle enhance accountability bank stakeholders. in remark evening, i present main highlight full text 2003 monetary policy statement. it important, therefore, take time read full text statement, obtain detail analysis monetary policy developments. i briefly review behaviour inflation 2002 underlie causes, assess extent monetary policy succeed achieve objective 2002. i outline bank’s view prospective economic financial development 2003 and, basis assessment, policy outlook current year. the bank’s monetary policy framework objective i believe aware principal objective monetary policy botswana, central bank around world, control inflation; particular, ensure inflation predictable maintain low levels. by carry responsibility control inflation, bank contributes, along government policies, ultimate objective promote stable macroeconomic environment. this support rise income live standard batswana, along national objectives, especially economic diversification which, turn, depend export competitiveness. you agree export competitiveness cannot achieve unless botswana’s inflation low comparable average trade partner countries, south africa, unite kingdom, unite state america mainland europe. this requirement basis determine desire range inflation. the framework within policy determine identify key relationship inflationary process. it well-known fact excessive expenditure relation available good service give period push price - concept refer demand-pull inflation. it also well know much expenditure, especially private sector, finance borrow bank system. hence bank determine growth rate bank credit would consistent low sustainable level inflation. the framework also identify tool use control inflation, case central banks, tool use bank interest rates. obviously deploy interest rate instrument, bank strike careful balance need discourage excess credit growth, need encourage productive investment well financial savings. in formulate monetary policy stance, bank closely examine factor influence inflation. this analysis necessary bank equip deal change inflation primarily due domestic demand pressures. furthermore, pressure tend persistent, rather erratic effects, may due transitory development supply fluctuations. that why, addition headline inflation data publish central statistic office, bank examine underlie inflation trend, core inflation. this measure inflation exclude impact factor transient nature; also exclude exceptional change administer price and/or indirect taxes, precise measure price development economy. the bank recognise need, however, respond impact transitory development may underlie inflation, particularly effect inflation expectation second-round influence price changes. in market-based economy botswana’s, monetary policy influence inflation indirectly effect interest rate changes, influence credit key mean finance expenditure consumption investment. the effectiveness interest rate control credit monitor closely. the bank also recognise rate growth government spend important component domestic demand, since government allocate large amount fund finance public consumption investment. the fact government play large role economy underscore need complementarity fiscal monetary policy achieve inflation objective. this policy framework provide backdrop bank’s assessment economic financial environment past year, inflation price development take place. development inflation 2002 a doubt recall, monetary policy statement 2002 set inflation objective range 4 - 6 percent. in set objective, bank aware headline inflation would influence number transitory factors, especially introduction 10 percent value add tax (vat) july 2002. before introduction vat, annual headline inflation stabilise around 6 percent first half 2002. however, follow introduction vat, recall, inflation start rising, increase 5.9 percent june 2002 11 percent end year. the bank anticipate temporary increase headline inflation arise introduction vat, 4 percent 6 percent underlie inflation. this prospect convey press release june 2002. it point out, time, vat-related price increase would one-off temporary adjustment that, absence significant second-round price effects, due instance compensatory wage increases, impact vat would result sustain rise inflation. in event, line bank’s expectations, effect vat month-on-month rate change price rise average 0.5 percent twelve month june 2002, 3.2 percent month late july 2002. thereafter, monthly rate price increase progressively slow reach 0.4 percent october. the monthly price increase high november, primarily due technical adjustment component consumer price index (cpi) basket, particularly adoption new bill system botswana telecommunication corporation. although overall inflation increase sharply second half year, analysis inflation trend discount impact vat technical adjustment data suggest underlie inflation around 6 - 7 percent 2002, little upper end bank’s policy objective year. a close look source inflation 2002 provide support conclusion that, headline inflation influence vat price adjustments, underlie rate mostly contained. price almost category commodity rise high rate 2002 compare 2001 expected, give wide-ranging impact vat. food prices, however, rise much fast rate average, due part drought condition region. food price inflation rise approximately 4 percent december 2001 14 percent end 2002. this account almost half rise overall inflation year, reinforce view that, take account impact vat exceptional factors, volatile food prices, underlie inflation largely contain 2002. the relatively moderate rise underlie inflation extent support fairly benign inflationary environment world’s major economies. although major economy experience moderately high inflation, mainly result rise energy prices, especially oil, average inflation rise le 1 percentage point, 1.2 percent 2001 2 percent 2002. the inflation trend south africa somewhat different; price increase sharp, mostly due effect depreciation rand occur towards end 2001. inflation south africa also affect increase food price labour costs. core inflation south africa 12.2 percent december 2002 compare 5.8 percent end 2001. the combine effect development average inflation botswana’s trade partner rise 4.2 percent end 2001 8.4 percent end 2002, reflect rise cost imports. in connection, point botswana’s inflation briefly fell trade partner country middle year, although subsequently high due impact vat. in light moderate upward trend underlie inflation, bank continue restrain growth rate commercial bank credit private sector. after adjustment take account extension subsequent early repayment loan certain large borrowers, use offshore funds, credit rise 21.4 percent year, compare 18.1 percent 2001. this growth rate well bank’s target range 12.5 - 14.5 percent, judge consistent economy’s underlie growth potential inflation objective. moreover, high rate growth government spending, estimate 18 percent 2002, albeit 20 percent growth rate record 2001, also continue exert pressure inflation, thereby place heavy burden monetary policy. the expansionary fiscal policy imply undesirable imbalance fiscal monetary policy deal inflation. monetary policy implementation during 2002 in light high growth rate credit need contain inflationary expectation follow introduction vat, bank tighten monetary policy towards end year raise interest rate total 1 percent october november 2002 - half percent time. consistent past practice, two change interest rate immediately follow press releases, emphasise increase interest rate response rise inflation result introduction vat, bank consider vat-induced impact inflation transitory event, directly justify monetary policy response. the bank’s focus impact vat may inflationary expectations. hence important forestall development expectation high inflation point danger accommodate second-round effect vat-related price increase advise possible compensatory wage increases. high interest rate were, therefore, aim partly ensure expectation develop. this do order demonstrate bank’s commitment contain inflation arise temporary vat-related price increases, order expectation rise price become entrenched. there also need tight monetary policy give credit growth still high desired. the effect exchange rate inflation benign 2002. while pula appreciate nominal term major international currencies, depreciate 8 percent rand, result overall stable nominal effective exchange rate pula. however, inflation high botswana trade partner countries, largely due impact vat, real effective exchange rate pula appreciate 2.6 percent year december 2002; extent, botswana’s trade competitiveness eroded. the outlook inflation 2003 the performance global economy expect improve course 2003, world output currently forecast grow 2.5 percent, estimate 1.7 percent 2002. despite forecast improvement growth, inflation expect remain low stable since growth world output still trend. there is, however, considerable uncertainty respect oil price due situation middle east venezuela, well imminent war iraq. nevertheless, inflation continue largely control, anticipate major world economy maintain stimulative monetary policy which, instances, support expansionary fiscal policy. inflation south africa, important external influence inflation botswana, rise sharply 2002. it is, however, expect slow 2003, reflect recent strengthen rand, tight monetary policy stance supportive fiscal policy. despite favourable developments, unlikely south africa’s inflation target 3 - 6 percent meet 2003. forecast core inflation south africa year put 7 percent 8 percent, 12 percent 2002. for key trade partners, inflation expect remain around current rate 2 percent. therefore, nominal effective exchange rate pula unchanged, botswana’s import inflation likely low 2003 last year. demand botswana, reflect growth commercial bank credit government expenditure, still undesirably high end 2002. however, expect increase interest rate last quarter 2002 will, due course, moderate growth bank lending. furthermore, recently release 2003/04 government budget indicate expenditure grow much slow rate around 4 percent. this laudable fiscal restraint, together expect reduction credit growth, help moderate inflationary pressures. the government’s decision award public sector pay rise 2003 contribute towards restrain demand pressures. it hop favourable scenario undermine find ongoing salary structure review commission. be may, prospect 2003 generally good balance monetary fiscal policies, augur well sustainable low inflation 2003. against background, bank’s view inflation first half 2003 around present level 10 12 percent, fall middle year remain month 2003. this projection base fact year-on-year effect vat consumer price index drop july 2003. the outlook also predicate success monetary policy restrain credit growth, fact government spend indeed slow down. it also expect undue external inflationary pressure generate large increase price food and/or oil, import price generally. bank’s monetary policy stance 2003 a highiighted earlier, bank seek achieve rate inflation that, minimum, maintain relative stability real exchange rate avoid need devaluation pula. the annual inflation objective base assessment forecast inflation trade partner countries. although forecast botswana’s trade partners’ inflation 2003 slightly high initial forecast 2002, use calculation last year’s inflation objective, strong reason maintain inflation objective range 4 - 6 percent 2003. first, reduce botswana’s inflation forecast average trade partner countries, range 4 - 6 percent provide opportunity regain competitiveness lose last year result relatively high level inflation botswana. second, underlie inflation remain close upper end inflation objective, mean 4 - 6 percent range remain desirable feasible objective 2003. third, remain concern risk vat-induced increase inflationary expectations. hence important bank promote expectation sustainable low inflation. the range growth rate private credit consider compatible achieve inflation outcome 12 - 14 percent. a past, range calculate expect annual capacity growth non-mining sector economy, contain ninth national development plan (ndp 9); also base desire level inflation year, allowance process financial deepen economy develops. conclusion i wish conclude underscore main message year’s monetary policy statement - inflation continue restrain 2003. this effort support expect favourable external domestic developments, although uncertainty price oil. in major industrial countries, output growth expect improve, inflation forecast remain control. except threat possible oil price increase lag impact last

chairman board governor central bank iceland, publish morgunbladid newspaper, reykjavík, 28 february 2003. * * * when central bank iceland become independent institution 1961 generally believed, iceland abroad, several different simultaneous objective could set central banks. low inflation, full employment strong economic growth among objective people felt central bank able achieve. gradually become clear would work. in work central bank, objective come conflict one another, result economic fiasco. a result, recent year legislation central bank alter many country bank assign one principal objective: ensure price stability. inflation primarily monetary phenomenon, persistent inflation result insufficient restraint monetary policy. in long term, monetary policy thus impact price level le economic growth employment. with free movement capital countries, principal instrument central bank interest rates; long run instrument achieve one macroeconomic objective, i.e. ensure price stability. new legislation when new legislation adopt central bank iceland 2001, international development take consideration icelandic act pattern recent legislation industrialise countries. there broad political consensus this, people realise low inflation one cornerstone economic growth improve live conditions. in addition legislation, inflation target introduce bank’s objective joint declaration government central bank. the decision float icelandic króna take time, since experience show long run impossible ensure specific exchange rate free movement capital country. in case exchange rate determine market supply demand control value króna. this new framework monetary policy immediately subject baptism fire. the icelandic economy overheat inflation rise rapidly. the central bank respond raise interest rates. the fall króna play part elimination current account deficit much rapidly anyone dare hope two year ago. the economy stable moment time and, acccording outlook, current slight slowdown short-lived. the central bank’s tight monetary stance has, hand, bring results, last november inflation drop target 2½ %. old theory reappear recently extensive discussion concern central bank iceland, policy objectives. now inflation subdued, old theory effect central bank pursue multiple objective come fore. the bank ensure full employment, specific exchange rate objective ensure economic growth. these view reflect considerable over-estimation power central bank instrument disposal. it also oversimplification focus exclusively interest rates, many people do, expect interest rate reduction solve problems. the central bank has, past two years, cut rate thirteen times, bank’s policy rate currently 5.3%. while naturally high rate euro zone, problem grapple include long-term economic stagnation high unemployment, future mean bright. in norway, hand, central bank rate 6%, take example neighbour industrialise country. the central bank iceland’s real policy rate currently around 2¾% consider future prospects, slightly current estimate equilibrium interest rate. the bank’s interest thus stimulate effect economy, note real interest rate present low since spring 1996. it also bear mind change interest rate affect demand inflation considerable time lag, full effect interest rate cut recent month felt time yet. isk exchange rate no one doubt importance isk exchange rate icelandic economy. the exchange rate enormous impact price level performance export competitive sectors. on hand, people must realise central bank limit long-term effect exchange rate. many aspect economy affect exchange rate. these include, instance, foreign trade, foreign investment iceland investment icelander abroad, forget expectation future economic developments. there little doubt expectation concern power-intensive industry development influence exchange rate recent months. interest rate certainly affect exchange rate, experience iceland elsewhere show effect eventually disappears, long monetary policy aim maintain long-term inflation comparable country’s trade partners. at time, intervention central bank temporary impact. if, however, exchange rate forcefully head certain direction, central bank withstand trend length time. this experience throughout world, wherever free movement capital countries. this also experience central bank iceland attempt check slide króna mid-year 2000 autumn 2001. to demand central bank adopt exchange rate objective unrealistic. the option peg currency return former practice introduce currency restrictions, want go back that? cut interest rate beyond bank’s inflation target allow, order force exchange rate, would highly inadvisable. the nominal exchange rate might temporarily drop somewhat, practically certain inflation would heat soon would end real exchange rate before, addition kindle flame next period overheat instability. slowdown economy after protract period high economic growth, end overheating, slight slowdown economy increase unemployment. it has, among things, claim slowdown particular result tight monetary policy. our experience, well countries, show temporary slowdown often unavoidable consequence strict economic management, aim control over-expansion hold inflation check. this one reason important prevent wave become high. it is, however, oversimplification claim monetary policy alone make decisive difference. interest rate primarily affect demand economy. there are, hand, many factor affect demand supply economy. these include, instance, fish quotas, public finance public investment, foreign investment, e.g. heavy industry, wage policy social partners. people make decision control important economic instrument beyond reach central bank. there thus many party involve manage economic affair central bank far party responsible here. action boost economic growth reduce unemployment recently number action announce relax restraint economy. the full effect major interest rate cut recent month yet felt. the central bank also announce imminent relaxation reserve requirements, release fund bank system lead interest rate decrease there. each day central bank puchased foreign currency, place isk 11 billion circulation since september, certainly slow exchange rate rise. the government decide accelerate certain project spend isk 6 billion. local authority party announce measure aim objective. so clear much do expect increase economic growth reduce unemployment come months. ahead u extensive construction project icelandic history, major impact economy short long term. they require sound economic management. it important foresee early enough effect development could action taken. it would completely irresponsible simply allow thing take course nothing need do compensate developments, actually propose quarter recently. the central bank’s analysis propose development indicate that, appropriate economic management actions, possible maintain economic stability keep inflation control. the central bank iceland utmost achieve this, naturally bear indisputable legal responsibility so. bi review 12/2003 1 nout wellink: the position woman financial sector address dr nout wellink, president nederlandsche bank president bank international settlements, conference “women decision make positions”, organise russian association regional banks, amsterdam, 24 february 2003. * * * i rarely privilege address audience largely make women. that tell - good sign. but fact matter financial world still dominate men. that apply commercial central banks, netherlands exception. so, run-up international women’s day, every reason hold conference focus role woman senior management level financial sector. the position woman labour market must improved, notably financial sector. that’s i think woman deserve good deal also, mainly, would good company society whole see improvement women’s labour market participation chance advance top. the world would bleak place consist men, apply organisations. an organisation mix men woman level pleasant atmosphere, possibly make good performance. moreover, economy whole benefit high woman participation rates, participation rate among woman euro area one reason growth income per caput lag behind unite states. and woman appropriately rewarded, course. which remind write alan greenspan recent biography. when still run financial consultancy, 40 year ago, greenspan choose recruit woman rather men. his motivation purely rational. he convince woman qualify men, since labour market fully appreciate quality woman undervalue hence cheaper. greenspan use sharp insight benefit arbitrage opportunity. back present day. the good news euro area labour market participation woman age 24 45 far high 45 over. this indicate improvement time promise development. the bad news woman still lag far behind term qualitative participation. let keep netherlands point. accord report social cultural plan office year ago, single woman sit manage board top 25 dutch companies. in top 100, one woman 400 men, woman make 2.5% top 5000. the situation supervisory board better, average one woman 12 men, still exactly positive. and far bank sector concerned, i sure whether would sufficient woman top manager create delegation like yours. a regard position woman senior management, i must unfortunately share blame. the nederlandsche bank one woman among 12 member supervisory board. prince claus, late husband queen beatrix, instrumental get supervisory board stress time successor woman. our govern board make entirely men, respect lot learn country. two eight deputy executive director women. while improvement past, still long way go. we hence actively work plan large number woman nederlandsche bank, advancement top. before i tell intend this, let first go reason woman lag behind. both demand supply factor play role. a regard demand, often, woman pass potential candidate recruitment promotion. whereas feel do intent, i incline think unconscious process, arise stereotype view men women. in fact, research indicate men incline appoint men, woman incline appoint women. since management traditionally consist men, easy see glass ceiling come from, disappear unless make conscious effort. turn supply, woman role play here, several cause present themselves. woman le self-confident men, quick think they’re suitable push forward. that impression, confirm psychological research. another factor woman sometimes preference respect combine career family. that respect mean that, wherever can, create condition combine work childcare. not every job do part-time plenty positions, even senior levels, offer flexibility woman prefer personal circumstances. that bring nederlandsche bank’s policy area. let begin plus-es. our general term employment well-disposed towards women. we standard 36-hour work week, opportunity all, include senior staff, work part-time, flexible work hour good financial arrangement childcare. our recruitment policy gear attract woman employees, fact time women, especially high educate high potential advance top, join bank. to give figures, whereas percentage female employee increase merely 30 34 percent last 6 years, percentage woman high salaried position double period. but, minus, apparently don’t enough allow woman advance top. whereas 25% female employee academic background, 11% reach level senior management. so still long way go. one initiative netherlands promote advancement woman boardroom creation network ambassadors, comprise top male executive large organisation will push opportunity women. i recently ask join network. a one ambassadors, i oblige draw three personal point action stick them. your conference give wonderful opportunity announce three personal point action or, use word i feel confortable with, policy targets. if it’s me, nederlandsche bank near future stimulate women’s advancement top? (cid:1)(cid:2)my first personal point action make visible, outside world everyone work nederlandsche bank, i commit promote career possibility woman organisation. research show explicit commitment board member make woman confident apply senior positions. moreover, make manager aware expect pay attention woman candidate come promotion, flexible come demand ambition combine career care family. this conference one way create visibility, i thank you. give interview subject another i promise course year i actively look possibility get press coverage view subject. (cid:1)(cid:2)my second point action invite high potential woman work nederlandsche bank discussion problem encounter job fulfilment career planning. if i want promote opportunity woman organisation, i must clear picture perceive glass ceiling. i intend discus outcome conversation management. i expect exchange information able draw lesson may translate specific measure improvement career possibility women. (cid:1)(cid:2)for third point action i would like draw upon information. i intend establish (moving) target figure participation woman candidate management trainee programme. not high potential woman may interest career top, reason i mention earlier. but, depend number woman are, i establish target rate participation woman management development programme. moreover, come promotion i want every shortlist contain rule least one woman. stick three personal point action, policy targets, question commitment. be central banker, i well aware importance reputation hold commitment. but reputation stake. promote opportunity woman financial sector important, responsible bring best human capital, male female. i hope conference, activity organise international women’s day, contribute equal fair representation management general financial sector particular. bi review 11/2003 1 jean-claude trichet: the european monetary union euro speech mr jean-claude trichet, governor bank france, financial forum 2003, organise the wall street journal europe the new economy forum, madrid, 25 february 2003. * * * lady gentlemen, great pleasure honour today, occasion “financial forum 2003”, organise new economy forum wall street journal europe. i would like present view successful set-up euro, economic financial integration europe challenge euro-zone confront go forward. the euro: build successful set set-up eurosystem the single monetary policy formulate implement within sound institutional framework, eurosystem, comprise european central bank twelve national central bank euro area. three principle underpin eurosystem: independence, transparency decentralisation. the independence european central bank national central bank enshrine treaty. when exercise power carry task duties, neither central bank eurosystem member decision make body shall seek take instruction community institutions, government member state body. independence refer institutional, operational financial independence. we consider independance define contribute clarity credibility single monetary policy. transparency accountability: elect authorities, key economic players, well european citizen must fully inform conduct single monetary policy. at european level, ecb maintain permanent dialogue european council european parliament, national central bank national institutions. the ecb central bank world enforce concept regular, frequent, real-time communication domain monetary policy. indeed, month, immediately meet govern council, president ecb hold press conference. the independence central bank democratic accountability two side coin. in respect, public speech testimony president european central bank governor national central banks, attention institution well public opinion, crucial. an important part collective duty consist tirelessly explain rationale underpin govern council’s decisions. lastly, decentralisation: subsidiarity principle underlie whole european construction, decentralisation major principle architecture eurosystem. the eurosystem team whose member work close co-operation, team spirit really strong fruitful. monetary policy decision taken, centre, govern council, implement national central bank closely coordinate way. ecb governance on 3 february 2003, govern council ecb unanimously approve recommendation european council decision, aim adjust vote modality govern council enlarge euro area, accordance article 10.6 statute introduce treaty nice. this adjustment become necessary maintain efficiency timeliness govern council’s decision-making process. the recommendation submit eu council. we hope eventually endorse head state government european parliament european commission, already deliver opinion, consulted. 2 bi review 11/2003 a soon number member govern council reach 22, total number vote right limit 21. the six executive board member permanent vote right ncb governor share remain 15 vote right rotate among accord pre-established rules. to ensure decision take govern council representative euro area economy whole, governor allocate group differ respect frequency member vote rights. the allocation governor group therefore do accordance rank respective ncb’s, reflect mainly size economy financial sectors. all all, recent recommandation govern council testimony ability smoothly adapt internal governance challenge pose enlargement. strategy single monetary policy the maastricht treaty clearly define ultimate objective single monetary policy, say maintain price stability. however, attain goal, essential clearly define price stability: define year-on-year increase overall harmonise index consumer price (hicp) 2% whole euro area. bear mind objective, monetary policy strategy base two “pillars”. we first assign key role monetary aggregate m3. this “pillar” base reference value set 4.5% annual growth rate broad monetary aggregate m3. the concept reference value mean eurosystem commit automatically correct deviation monetary growth short term. naturally, also follow component counterpart m3 closely. in regard, development loan private sector, well evolution government finance capital flow rest world, deserve particular attention. however, common sense say monetary development account risk price stability. this define second “pillar” monetary policy strategy, consist broad range variable refer indicator euro area price outlook. the relatively low yield long-term euro-denominated bond confirm investors’ confidence new currency. this case four five year ago. at time, financial market convince euro would weight arithmetic mean legacy currency would inherit level confidence credibility strong these. the euro actually found benchmarking principle, convergence towards average. this may explain interest rate euro low europe outset. to sum up, consider maintenance price stability medium term eurosystem’s great contribution foster environment conducive sustainable growth employment. and, also great contribution limit unnecessary volatility output employment short run. the success, thus far, strategy mean current monetary policy strategy engrave marble. with benefit hindsight, 2003 seem appropriate point time take stock experience thus far reflect various element strategy. this issue actively deal eurosystem’s staff plan complete evaluation course spring publish it. needle say decision undertake in-depth assessment experience necessarily imply substantial change contemplated. successful technical framework the launch euro financial markets, 1 january 1999, indisputable success technical point view. this great achievement since many observer doubt immediate success technical challenge magnitude. three orientation still shape success: • monetary policy framework include set instrument choose view observe principle market orientation, equal treatment, simplicity, transparency. the decentralisation operation undoubtedly contribute smooth function framework. maintain close contact commercial bank national central bank help financial market quickly adopt harmonise practice bi review 11/2003 3 relate open market operations, eligible collateral credit operation minimum reserve systems. • operational efficiency highlight precise adjustment bank liquidity effective steer short-term interest rates; eurosystem demonstrate efficiency, day tragic event 11th september 2001, act quickly ensure smooth orderly function european financial markets. here again, doubt previously raise ability govern council make decision swiftly. • security provide procedure system implemented, execution inter-bank transactions, vis-à-vis large-value payments. the inter-bank market become highly integrate thank set target system real-time transfer large-value payment throughout euro area eu countries. let turn introduction euro banknote coins, last step more-than-twenty-year process monetary integration. euro changeover on 1 january 2002, euro banknote coin issue become legal tender country euro area. this unique highly symbolic milestone europe. let first stress that, thank national effort co-ordination european commission eurosystem, almost 100 % cash transaction euro area carry euro two month changeover. although practical changeover euro might consider outstanding achievement, remain vigilant follow issues: • first, price stability. although increase price certain number consumer good service reported, first evidence show that, overall, effect changeover price stability marginal. but consumer must keep alert, company retailer remain responsible regard price setting. in end, competition also contribute low price short-to-medium term. • second, must closely monitor risk counterfeit note coins: information campaign eurosystem “the euro. our money” aim familiarise european citizen new banknote coin (and security features) and, so, help identify obviously fake banknotes. all institution concerned, national european, co-operating closely prevent fight counterfeiting. right now, counterfeit banknote scarce conspicuous. the credibility eurosystem single monetary policy, successful changeover euro represent major achievements. they certainly contribute efficient function emu european economic financial integration, i explain right now. * * * emu: balance concept foster economic financial integration emu economically sound well-grounded concept. a year ago, necessary convince great number sceptic euro would really launched. the opinion single currency would never exist course disprove facts. nevertheless, objection still raise time time, allege grind euro area economy comprehend inconsistency could endanger challenge viability emu, since european union welcome new members. some observer thus claim lack co-ordination european economic policies, absence political federation, likely deprive area appropriate policy-mix. others blame lack instrument allow u tackle asymmetric shock may arise, underline lack flexibility absence mobility european labour force. others claim 4 bi review 11/2003 presume economic divergence structural gap among euro area country large ensure viable monetary union. how respond important objections? (1) it disputable emu function well, member states, especially major one term gdp, must aware spill-over effect national economic policy may trigger. the existence spill-over justify implementation close co-ordination national economic policies. this embody treaty itself, oblige member state consider national economic policy “as matter common concern” subject multilateral procedure. practically, member state design institution mechanism promote appropriate co-ordination. we say emu turn beneficial european economic financial integration whole. indeed, coherent operational framework provide co-ordination economic policy close mutual surveillance (under responsibility “euro group” ecofin council) implementation stability growth pact. moreover, broad economic policy guidelines, discuss year head state governments, help monitor macroeconomic structural development member states. i would like briefly recall stability growth pact play important role: • by supervise fiscal policy euro area member states, pact together broad economic policy guideline contribute ensure appropriate policy mix within euro area. it essential conduct meaningful monetary policy, counterbalance fact europe significant federal budget. • by set penalty system excessive deficits, pact also help prevent well-managed economy bear unjustified risk premium would transfer poorly manage economy channel single currency. a regard second common criticism emu, say lack instrument respond asymmetric shocks, i would like stress stability growth pact help counter argument. indeed, urge country aim fiscal position “close balance surplus” medium term, pact enable let fiscal deficit increase, need be, provide exceed 3% reference value. in short, allow create fiscal buff normal economic periods, draw counter economic divergence asymmetric shocks. the last set criticism focus presume economic divergence economy within euro area. to answer last objection, i would like put forward ideas: • firstly, monetary union necessarily imply that, give point time, participate country rate inflation growth, even though creation euro base successful completion convergence process. for example, inflation divergence across country region may accommodate monetary union part process convergence productivity live standards. • secondly, i would like quote professor robert mundell, made, begin 1998, interest clarification optimal currency area theory, argue event shift demand one member country another, create unemployment first inflationary pressure second, flexible exchange rate would necessarily able solve problem. i quote: “if argument devaluation valid, could apply every state, province sub-region country, proliferation new currencies, could devalued!”. even though emu relate single monetary policy, also relate harmonisation markets, i.e. good services, well financial markets. in areas, integration process well track. bi review 11/2003 5 emu foster economic financial integration financial europe construction: reorganisation capital market in 1999, soon euro launched, one expect advantage prospect deeper, large integrate capital market contribute reduce cost capital business give european great range save options. these expectation become reality money market longer-term capital markets. on euro money market, unsecured deposit inter-bank market highly integrated. eonia euribor provide market uniform benchmark fully accept market participants. this reflected, instance, huge development euro interest-rate swap market. on euro bond market, integration process register three main developments: • rapid internationalisation: the introduction single currency foster euro-denominated private bond market, enlarge potential pool investors, notably international investors. • increase competition issuers, encourage standardisation sovereign bonds, gradual convergence towards “best practices”, development range attractive actively trade benchmark issue (especially sovereign bonds). besides, competition also enhance liquidity issuer increase average size outstanding bonds. • modernisation market structures: besides rapid development electronic trading, consolidation central security depository also pave way efficient function delivery-versus-payment procedures, easy safe channel settlement cross-border security transactions. this last point particular relevance eurosystem, smooth function european security settlement infrastructure key practical implementation monetary policy. on equity market, elimination currency risk within euro area lead investor shift domestic orientation international, sectoral one. the creation wide range pan-european sectoral index was, thus, direct consequence change investor strategies. additionally, introduction euro strong catalyst merger acquisition financial sector. for instance, respect, stress current trend merger close co-operation banks, stock exchanges, security settlement systems, clear houses. have euro created, would thinkable amsterdam, brussels, lisbon paris security exchange jointly create euronext? the large european good service market. such change european financial landscape significantly improve efficiency capital allocation. the euro contribute enable european saver easily select efficient investments. it also help productive sector company achieve significant economy scale, enhance transparency market boost competition innovation benefit consumers. moreover, pace internationalisation euro area economy spur euro. allow give one example: level accumulate foreign direct investment abroad french resident since 1999 amount eur 380 billion (i.e. four time pre-1999 level). indeed, capital flow euro area rest world mirror high degree attractiveness: year 1999-2001, euro area register total inward direct investment worth 719.8 billion euros. at point, one may wonder condition require ensure success euro emu medium term. i believe tackle three main challenges: structural reforms, financial stability accession eu new member states. * * * 6 bi review 11/2003 challenge ahead structural reform the first challenge is, beyond dispute, implement structural reform euro area’s economies. structural reform crystallise european level call lisbon strategy. the first objective strategy substantially raise potential output growth. the second make economy competitive. implement reforms: lisbon strategy the european council meet hold luxembourg december 1997 explicitly mention structural policy among item select achieve enhance co-ordination. the lisbon european council, hold march 2000, enhance medium-term strategy introduce structural reform union. this strategy aim make european union world’s dynamic knowledge economy 2010. it since amend include social issue (at council nice late 2000) environmental issue (at council gothenburg mid 2001). what achieve date field structural reform quite encouraging. noticeable success already register regard policies, new rule telecommunications, electricity gas markets. the current 2002 broad economic policy guideline evaluation exercise opportunity check progress accomplish reform agree lisbon recently reassert barcelona. before review priority area fresh impetus required, i wish briefly make two remarks: first, responsibility structural reform european union rest individual member states. consequently, wide variety institutional solution regulatory arrangement across country sectors. i nevertheless consider decentralise approach consider opportunity, rather disadvantage. it encourage “cross fertilisation” best practice increase co-ordination member states’ structural policies. my second remark relate changeover euro. this event major structural reform itself, i.e. powerful drive towards restructure european economy. an important objective consist raise potential output growth european economy if france europe seek secure sustainable growth level high possible, key variable potential output growth. there three way raise level potential output growth: first, boost investment: invest low inflationary pressures, strong potential output growth. for example, two-point increase productive investment ratio (productive investment / gdp, 11,4 % last five year france) next decade would bring average acceleration 0,5 point potential output growth period. the second way raise potential output growth increase quantity actual labour: the european council lisbon set central objective rise employment rate population 60 70 % 10 years. the council also fix two sub objectives: raise employment rate woman 60 % employment rate old worker (from 55 64 year old) 50 %. a comparison, overall employment rate stand 75 % usa. although progress achieve area, lack substantive change tendency member state continue use early retirement scheme remain cause concern. the third way raise potential output growth promote way boost gain labour productivity: this achieve increase competition, encourage enterprise innovation, improve workforce’s skills. indeed, basis hour worked, productivity eu reach 2001 83% level us, point room improvement. bi review 11/2003 7 that strategy pursue whilst increase overall competitiveness economy the euro area display sound macroeconomic fundamental satisfy price competitiveness. sound macroeconomic fundamental make euro area attractive place invest : major imbalance may observe contrary major areas. indeed, euro area provide low stable inflation environment, roughly balance external accounts, abundant private savings, sound financial systems. then, term real effective exchange rate, euro area constantly gain competitiveness past years. in 3rd quarter 2002, even though euro real exchange rate deflate unit labour cost total economy versus rest industrialise country appreciate 5.4% year-on-year, still long term average (1987-2001) 12.3%, accord european commission calculations. if i refer specifically observe past france, economic strategy, base moderate increase unit cost production, give u important edge: considerable improvement cost competitiveness french industrial sector mid-1980s contribute extensively boost growth. the french economy grow fast major euro area economy 1997 2001 (+ 15,4 % france compare + 13,4 % euro area), repeatedly record large current account surplus. this improvement overall cost-competitive situation progressively materialise growth, job creation solid external accounts. competitiveness also link european harmonisation fields, example service industries. most barrier trade service appear due national regulation abolish alleviated. while eurosystem act mainly stimulus process structural reforms, also play lead role ensure financial stability. this bring second challenge emu take up. financial stability like independent central bank, eurosystem fulfil two main functions: firstly, ensure price stability, key condition sustain growth, secondly, preserve financial stability, become critical challenge globalize world economy. i insist highly complementary nature two objectives, price stability foundation financial stability built. the adequacy european institutional arrangement financial stability the adequacy european institutional arrangement financial stability review depth eu level. in two reports, april 2000 april 2001, economic financial committee (efc) take stock supervisory regulatory mechanism eu examine issue financial crisis management. it conclude current arrangement provide coherent flexible basis safeguard financial stability recommend strengthen cross-border cross-sector co-operation. i fully share assessment put forward report i would like stress special responsibility central banks, due to: position heart financial systems, role liquidity supplier economy, close constant contact credit institutions, contribution bank supervision safe efficient function payment systems, least them, contribution safe efficient function security clear settlement systems. to sum up, institutional framework eurosystem’s responsibility monetary policy euro area couple extensive supervisory responsibility ncbs domestic markets, reinforce co-operation area-wide level, seem appropriate tackle change trigger current financial trend introduction euro. 8 bi review 11/2003 two point particular relevance financial regulatory framework let conclude important topic stress two point particular relevance european financial regulatory framework: • there still barrier integration eu capital markets. in regard, eurosystem welcome objective european council meet lisbon march 2000, accelerate completion internal market financial services, set tight timetable financial service action plan implement 2005. this plan regularly review european authorities, progress made. • the eurosystem also support strategic conclusion committee chair a. lamfalussy integration european security markets, ratify european council meet stockholm 2001 approve european parliament early 2002. we convince implementation broad guideline new cooperation structure european level help make possible take full advantage introduction euro. • in field financial regulation supervision, ecofin council (december 3rd 2002) approve report economic financial committee make proposal concern cooperation structure european level financial regulation supervision. these new arrangement implemented. in regard, one statutory task eurosystem is, accord treaty, contribute smooth conduct prudential supervision policy stability financial system. i therefore convince involvement central bank issue remain absolutely crucial. • finally, since tragic event 11 september impact financial stability, concern potential abuse financial system finance terrorism receive top priority international european regulatory discussions. the international community and, within it, financial community, step effort hunt money use organise crime terrorism. we shall successful overnight, but, today, strong political determination part international community co-operate issue. a far fight organise crime terrorism concerned, long accept certain player prepare observe rule international legal co-operation. beyond structural reform financial stability, accession new member state european union emu third challenge i identified. the last challenge least. accession new member state eu emu twelve country central, eastern southern europe currently negotiate accession eu, ten, accord calendar endorse european council, join e.u. early 1st january 2004. this provide evidence attractiveness european framework, provide u political stability economic progress half century. the accession country accomplish significant progress stabilise strengthen economy institutions. observe accession country since begin nineties, see major improvement country make road towards convergence eu. nevertheless, also general agreement fact gap term average gdp per caput accession country euro area, although diminishing, still remain quite significant. on average, gdp per caput term purchase power parity around 44% euro area, term current exchange rate around 22%. the size gap, combine limit growth differential two group countries, suggest process real convergence gradual. indeed, real convergence essential create economic cohesion within emu promote integration member states, thereby help minimise risk effect asymetric shocks. the eurosystem, notably banque de france, follow enlargement process great deal attention. let stress point particular relevance eurosystem bi review 11/2003 9 accession country themselves, road towards catch eu achieve convergence. • firstly, nominal convergence, request order adopt euro, must sustainable therefore constitute medium-term objective, rather short-term priority. indeed, eu treaty calls, prerequisite adopt euro, high degree sustainable convergence field price stability, government fiscal position, stability exchange rate, long-term interest-rate levels. therefore, nominal real convergence pursue parallel, antagonistic, interest access country euro area. • secondly, i note many accession country already express intention join erm ii soon possible eu entry. this intention welcomed. however, clear erm ii expect adopt new member immediately eu accession, intend limit two years, minimum period time prior adopt euro. it would mislead consider erm ii mere “waiting room” euro. on contrary, erm ii consider “training room”. this mechanism allow country retain limit exchange rate flexibility catching-up process. erm ii membership also offer meaningful, flexible credible framework : - increase convergence euro area, - tackle challenge face accession country road towards adoption euro, - contribute macroeconomic exchange rate stability, - help determine appropriate level eventual irrevocable fixation parities. this accomplish best interest candidate country themselves. • thirdly, sound efficient bank financial system key. significant progress make past year rehabilitate bank sector encourage structural reform foreign ownership. progress corporate governance, enhancement legal supervisory framework support bank sector also crucial. they conducive achieve macroeconomic objective accession countries. * * * to conclude, let stress two words: rapidity stability. rapidity key word. we much time meditate, decide, implement. the structural reforms, badly need of, must implement rapidly possible europe historical challenges. the chinese say “it late think” never true. in case, history wait us. and i look back, last twenty years, seem unfortunately well-founded criticism could constantly under-assessed rapidity stream history: rapidity deterioration situation ussr, rapidity collapse itself, rapidity enlargement process, depth, strength intensity “desire europe”, spread country transition. second word: stability. economic financial stability, period excessive volatility wide boom-bust episode, financial real stability appear precious asset. we build new world: technology permit instantaneous communication incredibly powerful real-time computation. globalization create new cultural, conceptual, commercial financial link economy include previously centrally plan systems; together technology globalization progressively drive u unify planet universal rule regulations, code conduct practices, market procedure market instruments, account standards, etc. in new world, phenomenon traditionally local national impact may amplify become dangerous global level: amplification financial cycles, herd behaviour, global contagion. analyse opportunity risks, understand function system view make stable possible exciting, ambitious urgent task. i thank attention. bi review 11/2003 1

erm ii, is, all, intermediate regime. how dilemma resolved? the retreat intermediate regime before i discus greece’s experience, let address reason underlie retreat intermediate regimes. what cause retreat? first, explosive increase capital flow 1990s make operation intermediate regime problematic. a already discuss seminar jorge braga de macedo helmut reisen, accord thesis impossible trinity, develop 1980s, system peg exchange rate free capital mobility, possible pursue independent monetary policy sustain basis. eventually, current-account disequilibria change reserve provoke attack exchange rate. the enormous increase capital flow accompany abrupt reversal flows. whereas logic thesis impossible trinity suggest exchange-rate attack typically originate response current-account disequilibria build gradually, fact, recent speculative attack often originate capital account, sudden difficult predict, include currency country without substantial current-account imbalances. capital-flow reversal involve progression speculative attacks, mostly pegged-exchange-rate arrangements. these reversal capital inflow result exchange-rate devaluation depreciation often accompany sharp contraction economic activity have, times, entail “twin crises” - crisis foreign-exchange market bank system. finally, tendency instability foreign-exchange market transmit one pegged-exchange-rate regime others process come know “contagion”. the victim contagion seemingly include innocent bystander - economy sound fundamental whose currency might attack adopt one corner solutions. 2 bi review 11/2003 this triad factor - (1) difficulty conduct independent monetary policy exchange rate peg capital account open, (2) sudden capital-flow reversals, (3) contagion - profoundly affect way think exchange-rate regimes. the experience greece: pre-erm the forego factor significantly affect greek economy 1990s. through 1994, performance greek economy pretty dismal. growth almost flat, inflation fiscal deficit percentage gdp, double-digit level throughout period. other eu country move forward quest become member emu greece fall farther farther behind. clearly, regime change call for. it come 1995. the sign maastricht treaty 1992 government’s publicly-stated objective join euro area provide powerful incentive mobilise broad public support policy adjustment. among policy measure undertake following: • fiscal policy progressively tightened. the fiscal deficit, percentage gdp, fell 10 per cent 1995 around 4 per cent 1997. • financial deregulation, begin late 1980s, complete 1994 capital account opened. the deregulate financial system facilitate use indirect instrument monetary policy small, frequent change instrument become feasible, enable rapid policy responses. • the greek parliament approve independence bank greece provide bank mandate achieve price stability. for part, begin 1995, bank greece adopt become know “hard drachma policy”, exchange rate use nominal anchor. for first time, bank announce specific exchange-rate target. underlie policy, greece elsewhere 1990s, belief adoption visible exchange-rate anchor could enhance credibility dissinflationary effort (1) traded-goods component price level could stabilise (2) wage-settling price-setting behaviour restrained. i go detail operation hard-drachma policy. suffice say that, year 1995-97, real interest rate short-end keep vicinity 5 per cent. fairly specific target exchange rate announce three year achieved. importantly, inflation fell 11 per cent 1994 5 per cent end 1997 while, first three year policy, real growth almost triple compare rate 1991-94. yet, typically case nominal-anchor exchange-rate pegs, regime produce difficulties. a predict thesis impossible trinity, ability conduct independent monetary policy exchange-rate peg open capital account become increasingly demanding. the wide interest-rate differential favour drachma-denominated financial instrument lead capital-inflows problem. the bank greece respond sterilise inflows, limit appreciation nominal exchange rate, reduce impact inflow monetary base, buy time policy adjust. still, sterilisation entail quasi-fiscal cost and, prevent domestic interest rate falling, tend maintain yield differential give rise inflows. additionally, greek economy experience fundamental problem associate exchange-rate nominal-anchor peg move low inflation; real exchange-rate appreciate significantly contributing, along strong domestic demand, widen current-account deficit. this circumstance bring second third triad factor - sudden capital-flow reversal contagion. the widen current-account deficit, combine rapid wage growth, feed market expectation drachma overvalue provide basis contagion asia, commence devaluation thai baht july 1997. the sharp rise interest rate require support drachma increasingly undermine growth fiscal targets. a regime shift needed. that regime shift provide erm. effective march 16, 1998, drachma join erm central rate imply 12.3 per cent devaluation ecu. a i explain, entry erm allow greece orient policy stability, foster convergence. because participation bi review 11/2003 3 erm, without severe tensions, play role convergence criterion join euro area, act test phase central rate well sustainability convergence general. lesson erm before i discus drachma’s experience erm, let posit question: what kind intermediate exchange-rate regime mind refer erm? in view, present erm system result evolutionary process. like darwinian evolutions, several distinct version specie distinguished. to provide analytic focus, i think useful distinguish among following. erm mark 1. this specie last inception ems, 1979, 1987. compare 2 per cent band bretton-woods system, erm band fluctuation, 4.5 per cent, fairly wide system support capital controls. for currencies, band even wider, 12 per cent. small realignments occur frequently. between march 1979, system started, january 1987, realignments occur eleven occasions. the forego feature system allow france, example, devalue franc shift upper low limit band without affect market exchange rate, help forestall possibility large profit opportunity give rise speculative attacks. erm mark 2. what dub “new ems” begin take shape 1987. increasingly, deutsche mark use nominal anchor, bundesbank’s reputation stalwart inflation fighter support monetary authority participate country effort attain anti-inflation credibility. except implicit devaluation italian lira january 1990, currency move wide band narrow band, realignments cease characteristic system. in 1990, remain capital control eliminate participate countries. german reunification require tight monetary policy counterbalance large fiscal deficit generate reunification. with erm country recession require loosen monetary policy, erm confront classic (n-1) problem. erm mark 3. begin september 1992, many currency participate erm subject attacks, eventuate series devaluation suspension pound sterling italian lira system. these attack sudden massive. thus, different currency realignments 1980s, mainly result pressure build gradually response current-account disequilibria. with lift capital controls, attack 1992-93 arise capital account sometimes infect currency country seemingly-sound fundamentals, france. several new term make way lexicon economists: (1) capital-account-driven crises, (2) sudden-stops, (3) contagion. erm mark 4. in last-ditch effort rescue system, august 1993 erm band widen ± 15 per cent. a thing turn out, move help salvage system. it provide necessary breathe space nominal convergence occur. erm mark 5, formally, erm ii. under present arrangement, exchange-rate stability explicitly subordinate primary objective price stability participate currency obligation system deliberately asymmetric previous erm. the notion asymmetry particularly important underline principle country whose currency come pressure undertake necessary policy adjustments. let return case drachma erm. by time drachma enter erm, march 1998, participate country demonstrate determination form monetary union attain considerable nominal convergence, specify maastricht criteria. this convergence take place backdrop market-based economy could compete effectively open economic financial system. in conditions, system build considerable amount trust. a otmar issing point several recent papers, trust evoke governments, include ability deliver credible, non-inflationary policies, prerequisite existence stable currency, internally externally. when drachma enter erm, become beneficiary credibility establish system previous years. it also benefit market’s knowledge availability system’s mutual support facilities, very short-term finance facility. yet, greece’s participation free ticket. the participant system wish endanger 4 bi review 11/2003 credibility take long achieve. they rightly ask entry fee. this fee include follow elements. • the new central rate - i noted, involve 12.3 per cent devaluation - agree members. • the devaluation drachma backward look foreward looking. the magnitude devaluation take account past inflation differential greece eu country prospective differential period lead greece’s expect entry euro area. thus, new central rate mean sustainable. • a package supportive fiscal structural measure announced. effort restructure public enterprise step up. the aim measure ensure sustainability drachma’s new central rate. in words, erm mean test phase emu participation, free pas euro area. unlike many devaluation mid-1990s late-1990s, drachma’s devaluation follow round speculative attacks, financial crisis. unlike devaluations, follow contraction economic activity, acceleration. moreover, contrast devaluation period, impact drachma’s devaluation inflation strictly contained. what account drachma’s successful exit one central rate another? in view, key ingredient successful devaluation following. • unlike currency devalue mid-1990s late 1990s, drachma exit unilateral peg enter systems’ arrangement, benefit credibility erm. • fiscal tighten continue follow devaluation. the fiscal deficit, per cent gdp, fell 1 per cent 1999, 4 per cent 1997. labour-market policy gradually adjust need fiscal discipline enhance international competitiveness. • prudential regulation supervision bank system strictly enforce net foreign exposure bank system. thus, currency-mismatching problem - i.e., large, uncover foreign-currency positions, which, condition currency devaluations, raise debt burden domestic foreign-currency borrowers, result bankruptcy financial crises. in addition place bank greece’s disinflation strategy within new institutional framework give add credibility, erm provide another important advantage. entry standard fluctuation band ± 15 per cent give bank ample room manoeuvre. thus, capital inflow resume follow erm entry, bank allow exchange rate appreciate relative central rate, help maintain tight monetary-policy stance contain inflationary impact devaluation. the exchange rate remain appreciate relative central rate throughout rest 1998 1999. in 1999, example, drachma trade (on average) 7.7 per cent central rate while, year, three-month interbank rate stand 700 basis point correspond german rate. a result tighten consistent policy mix, inflation reach low 2 per cent second half 1999. then, order limit degree depreciation would require market rate reach central rate result inflationary pressures, central rate revalue 3.5 per cent january 2000. the rest, say, history; fulfil maastricht criteria, january 1, 2001 greece become 12th member euro area. conclude remark what key lesson emerge greece’s experience? let highlight following. first, intermediate exchange rate regime viable today’s world high capital mobility provide (1) participant adhere sound sustainable policies, include ensure existence well-functioning market economy, and, (2) intermediate regime use transitional arrangement road corner solution monetary union. there contradiction existence erm ii hypothesis vanish middle regime. second, erm ii provide credibility systems’ arrangement, build darwinian evolution, flexibility wide fluctuation band may necessary achieve nominal bi review 11/2003 5 convergence. the credibility derive participate erm ii not, however, endanger use frequent adjustment central parity. a erm experience 1980s 1990s vividly demonstrated, frequent adjustment central parity within peg regime feasible presence capital controls. in today’s world high capital mobility, exchange-rate change instrument policy-makers use flexibly costlessly. the often used, le credibility peg exchange-rate system. third, need consistent policy mix crucial important implication term need view policy analysis. an implication mundell-fleming model mundell’s famous assignment problem monetary policy fiscal policy constitute two, separate policy instruments. yet, simple account fact government expenditure finance either taxation, borrowing, and/or money creation, imply analysis monetary policy must make consistent assumption fiscal policy. monetary policy fiscal policy, words, independent policy instruments. they must work tandem road emu, emu. fourth, ultimately, credible exchange-rate regime depend upon trust evoke governments. a governance structure enforce rule law sanctity contract political system deliver credible, non-inflationary policy prerequisite existence stable exchange-rate regime. lady gentlemen, thank attention. bi review 10/2003 1 roger w ferguson, jr: basel ii testimony mr roger w ferguson, jr, vice chairman board governor u federal reserve system, subcommittee domestic international monetary policy, trade technology, committee financial services, u.s. house representatives, washington, d.c., 27 february 2003. * * * chairman king, congresswoman maloney, member subcommittee domestic international monetary policy, trade technology: it pleasure appear morning behalf board governor federal reserve system discus basel ii, evolve new capital standard internationally active bank bank hold companies. at time, bank supervisor country abroad evaluate result recent survey ass potential quantitative impact current proposal world's large banks. in addition, supervisor unite state still incorporate feedback discussion bankers, ongoing process continue even final rule adopted. from u.s. perspective, hallmark basel ii process effort tailor capital framework evolve industry best practices. we intend dynamic effort continue. that said, almost five year discussion revision, basel ii ready last round comment - anticipate spring summer. we expect basel committee approve package late year, correspond u.s. rulemaking process complete next year, implementation begin late 2006. bank need certainty planning, inconsistent change 2004 2006, thereafter, learn practice evolve. why new capital standard necessary? the supervisor country determine basel i, current capital regime adopt 1988, must replace complex bank three major reasons: defect basel i apply large entities, evolution art risk management, increase heterogeneity concentration bank system. defect basel i basel i major step forward capital regulation. indeed, bank country, basel i - foreseeable future - adequate capital framework. most bank institution country engage business risk counterparties supervisor evaluate relatively easily. moreover, lack geographical diversification and/or limit alternative fund sources, market continue force bank carry capital position considerably excess regulatory minimum basel i. for reasons, u.s. supervisor believe benefit would exceed cost require bank shift basel ii. however, small number large, complex, internationally active bank organizations, basel i serious shortcomings, become evident time. develop replacement supply bank organization imperative. first, basel i simplistic adequately address activity complex bank institutions. basel i categorize bank's asset one four categories, represent certain risk class. each risk class risk weight multiply 8 percent get minimum capital charge: zero sovereign debt, 20 percent 8 percent intra-bank exposure agency securities, 50 percent 8 percent residential mortgages, 100 percent 8 percent exposures. these "all other" credit include essentially corporate consumer loans, mean whole spectrum credit quality bank much lend - aaa speculative credit - receive regulatory capital charge. the lack differentiation among degree risk mean resultant capital ratio often uninformative might well provide mislead information bank risky problem credit or, matter, portfolio dominate safe loans. moreover, limit number risk class limit value capital requirement also create regulatory loophole create incentive bank game system capital arbitrage. capital arbitrage, case, avoidance certain minimum capital charge sale securitization asset capital requirement market would impose le regulatory capital charge. clearly, market belief 4 percent capital charge residential mortgage (50 percent 8 percent) 8 percent credit card (100 percent 8 percent) high real risk, facilitate securitization sale large volume loan holders. this behavior perfectly understandable, even desirable economic efficiency sense. but mean bank engage arbitrage retain higher-risk asset regulatory capital charge - calibrate average quality asset - average low. supervisors, examination process, are, sure, still able evaluate true risk position bank, capital ratio large bank become le le meaningful, trend accelerate. not creditors, counterparties, investor le able evaluate capital strength individual bank suppose risk-based capital ratios, regulation statutory requirement tie capital ratio le mean well. the evolve state art at time, risk management appropriate capital determination evolve significantly beyond state art time basel i developed. bank develop adopt new technique improve risk management internal economic capital measures. but clearly bank go considerably further. basel ii would speed adoption new technique promote future evolution risk management establish framework risk-sensitive. increase heterogeneity concentration bank finally, market pressure lead consolidation bank around world. our bank system immune; it, too, become increasingly concentrate small number large bank operate across wide range product geographic markets. their operation tremendously complex sophisticated, significantly different strategy add high degree heterogeneity operations. at time, significant weakness one entities, let alone failure, potential severely adverse macroeconomic consequences. it seem clear regulatory framework encourage bank adopt best possible risk measurement management technique allow considerable difference business strategies. basel ii present opportunity supervisor encourage bank push management frontier forward. of course, change always difficult, new mechanism expensive. but risk-sensitive regulatory capital system would provide strong incentive adopt best practice internal risk management. let clear. if apply risk-sensitive capital requirement large institutions, usefulness capital adequacy regulation constrain excessive risk-taking entity continue erode. such erosion would present u.s. bank supervisor highly undesirable choice. either would accept increase risk instability bank system, would force adopt alternative - intrusive - approach supervision regulation institutions. basel ii i want stress u.s. supervisory authority intend apply so-called advance internal rat base (a-irb) version basel ii. we adopt two variant basel ii - standardize foundation internal rat base approach - develop basel committee. we expect require ten large u.s. bank adopt a-irb approach, anticipate small number large entity choose adopt well make necessary investment support participation. all bank country remain current basel i capital standard new accord implemented. for thousand banks, shortfall current rules, noted, sufficiently large warrant mandatory shift basel ii regime. however, institution option adopt a-irb requirement, expect large entity outset. if seek so, however, meet high standard internal infrastructure control require core group. the federal reserve board belief a-irb approach basel ii address material defect basel i entities. by require strong internal standard entry criterion, basel ii approach ensure bank adopt structured, formal, empirically base method manage credit risk, lead significantly improve risk-management capability large bank adopters. capital requirement become risk sensitive le prone artificial distortions. the poor incentive structure basel i remove a-irb banks. supervisory practice also become consistent evolve risk-management practices. risk-based capital ratio become reliable indicator financial strength. i turn another aspect basel ii: three pillars. at outset basel ii process, supervisor basel committee determine robust capital adequacy framework include three important element pillars. pillar i consist minimum capital requirement - is, rule bank calculate capital ratio supervisor ass whether compliance minimum capital threshold. pillar ii, supervisory oversight pillar, encompass concept well-managed bank seek go beyond simple compliance minimum standard perform comprehensive assessment whether sufficient capital support risks. in addition, supervisor position provide constructive feedback bank management internal assessments, "economic capital", base knowledge industry practice range institutions. finally, pillar iii seek complement activity market discipline require bank publicly disclose key measure relate risk capital positions. the concept three mutually reinforce pillar key basel ii effort. pillar i: minimum regulatory capital requirement the minimum capital requirement credit risk a-irb approach build around concept underlie modern portfolio-based method systematically measure credit risk. the first, perhaps important, input approach estimate likelihood probability borrower default. second, lender need sense size loss event default often able recover something default borrower's asset collateral guarantee. third, lender, often undrawn credit line loan commitment borrower, need estimate amount borrow likely time default occurs. these key input - probability default (pd), loss give default (lgd), exposure default (ead) - build block a-irb approach estimate capital requirements. many bank currently work improve ability estimate quantities, use wide variety technique expert judgment methodology quantitative statistical models. a-irb permit bank use these, require procedure estimate three key parameter base empirical information, rigorous, reproducible third parties, process subject strong internal controls, result show measure risk accurately. the supervisor must, fact, validate estimation procedure control support bank use a-irb. a part validation process, bank must demonstrate risk measure fact use credit-granting decisions, well management purpose reserve pricing. the intention supervisor manager focus issues. these estimate risk variable input regulatory formula determine minimum require capital give portfolio exposures. just method determine input change state art changes, formula translate input capital requirement modify well regulators. basel ii improve knowledge improves. the rule surround pillar i clearly complicate i described, volume comment letter number page publish comment attest that. one reason complexity large, complex bank organizations, rule address are, word, complex. simple rule cannot address issue nature business. these rule adjust modify significantly result comment banker interest parties. sometimes comment lead simple rules. but, often, lead even complex rule complex bank apply operate somewhat differently banks. thus rule modify address important meaningful difference risk. simple rule often become straightjackets; flexibility require complex rules. pillar ii: supervisory oversight indeed, even complex rule cannot adequately capture risk desirable procedure bank, a-irb establish pillar ii mechanism dialogue risk capital bank manager bank supervisors. i already note supervisor verify process determine credit-risk measurement, ensure ongoing control process determine risk-measure inputs, ensure risk input use calculation regulatory capital. in addition, pillar ii require bank maintain internal assessment risk relative capital - currently cycle well period stress - supervisor review respond assessment. the focus ensure bank strong risk-assessment capability supervisor bank jointly ass evaluate capability. this kind dialogue cannot capture set rules. it focus frank discussion loss potential unusual capital need associate unbundled risk capture pillar i. it address individual bank's special risk profile, special business strategy - might, example, imply geographic borrower concentration - unique cyclical sensitivities. such discussion, review, analysis focus individual bank's possible unique need capital buff - amount excess pillar i minimum. such buff design minimize risk loss capital erosion could trigger undesired response prompt corrective action associate reaction could affect financial real macroeconomic stability. pillar ii, clear, drawbacks. it inherently le transparent pillar i outsider know portion bank's excess capital deem "necessary" address particular risk specific bank portion truly "extra" cushion. it also difficult - although impossible - supervisor require uncooperative bank hold pillar ii capital rule-imposed pillar i capital. pillar iii: market disclosure basel ii seek minimize public difficulty interpret capital ratio require public disclosure considerable quantitative qualitative information, including, effect, risk input i describe earlier. such disclosure also provide incentive bank - disclosers - adopt good risk-management technique link capital requirement risk profiles. all result enable public make comparison among bank easily. indeed, ability compare important constraint supervisor, foreign u.s., might diligently apply rule banks; outlier appear unusual and, insufficient explanation, subject market discipline. indeed, key reason pillar iii seek harness market discipline bring pressure bank adopt safe sound practices. public disclosure increase market discipline two ways. first, provide information, enable market impose differential fund cost availability banks, relate risk take; additional risk require additional pillar i capital, disclosure risk size capital buff also affect minimum price counterparties require provide funding. second, noted, facilitate comparison across banks. because outlier subject particularly close review market national regulators, bank regulator difficulty evade minimum capital requirements. key issue not surprisingly significant proposal, concern certain aspect basel ii. it might useful subcommittee if, remainder comments, i focus number issue raised. before i do, however, i want reiterate subcommittee process develop basel ii proposal involve truly unprecedented dialogue bank wide variety issues. that dialogue still go on, especially regard technical issue involve retail credit, risk-mitigation techniques, securitization, matters, include call attention. operational risk one early decision participant basel ii process focus clearly credit risk capital determination process. do require risk combine credit risk basel i unbundled. several year ago, first necessary step unbundling risk take market risk trade activity separate treatment. the basel ii effort focus carefully credit risk bank take seek ensure framework appropriately measure marginal contribution risk bank's total risk profile. but focus imply need consider way address important bank risks. some risk sufficiently modest address supervisory process - pillar ii. but one risk, operational risk, historically important depletion capital failure bank subject specific pillar i minimum capital requirements. operational risk define risk loss result inadequate fail internal processes, people, system external events, include legal compliance-related risks. these risk associate loss often news: rogue traders, fraud forgery, settlement failures, inappropriate sale practices, poor account lapse control, trouble act custodian manage assets, legal settlement involve significant payment loss allege cause banks. all cost substantial abroad. indeed, many banks, internal economic calculations, already allocate significant portion capital operational risk - average 17 percent subset large bank sampled. a couple bank even make amount public, increasingly market sensitive fact excess regulatory capital hold general buffer, is, excess regulatory capital necessarily excess economic capital. but public unable case differentiate excess regulatory capital hold specific purpose hold general purposes. this inability particular problem basel i entity modest credit risk dominant operate risk. under basel i, regulatory capital drive solely credit risk, therefore requirement tend low activity entail much credit risk expose bank operational risk. the a-irb bank basel ii specialize activity - example, process security payment act custodian - experience increase regulatory capital requirement activities. every day entity transfer large amount federal funds, act custodian massive quantity securities, dominate payment security transfer systems. disruption operation cause, caused, serious difficulty world financial markets. u.s. supervisor propose bank required, choose, adopt a-irb approach basel ii also require hold capital operational risk, use procedure develop size charge know advance measurement approach (ama). because early comment u.s. bankers, amount require operational risk capital subject minimum floor charge base revenue. rather, ama, a-irb bank primary responsibility assess operational risk capital requirement. this requirement pillar i charge disclose market participant pillar iii. the bank remain basel i subject operational risk capital charge unite states. the advance measurement approach give bank flexibility develop methodology calculate operational, "op", risk capital charge. the supervisor, sure, require procedure comprehensive, systematic, consistent certain broad guidelines. these guideline specify factor necessity independent risk management, board senior management oversight, audits, use historical internal external loss data, scenario analysis, forth. the supervisor must review validate bank's process, considerable flexibility exist individual bank application. the op risk capital charge expect reflect banks' environment control mechanism reduce insurance risk mitigants. for example, bank invest improve contingency procedure approaches, would expect investment reflect reduction need operational risk capital ama. several u.s. bank develop op risk capital requirement advance measurement approach tell u comfortable result far. importantly, say procedure allow good identify business activity practice pose operational risk take step minimize risks. that result critical supervisor believe ama methodology produce last discipline banks, encourage think carefully minimize risk associate business activities. supervisor expect advance measurement approach provide incentive invest new system practice reduce potential serious loss operational risk. operational risk ama issue i call subcommittee's attention i aware bank aggressively oppose aspect basel ii. accordingly, i hold number discussion banker subject last year, include many direct conversation senior banker express concern issue. a i indicate earlier, i believe sort dialogue essential appropriate development basel ii framework something continue emphasize. but bank supervisor central banker, i say find argument operational risk skeptic convincing. the skeptic argue cost develop use advance measurement approach associate capital charge divert resource away actual investment risk-reducing system good backup systems. a i discus fully, basel ii, without doubt, costly; final judgment expenditure must rest balance cost benefits. we and, noted, many bank believe ama critical kind formal analysis focus banks' attention operational risk face. we also convince explicit pillar i capital charge create incentive reduce risk ensure minimum capital allocate absorb remain risk. critic also argue explicit pillar i capital charge would upset competitive balance nonbank foreign bank competitors. foreign regulators, argued, le aggressive rule enforcement u.s. regulators. a i early suggested, pillar iii - disclosure - highlight significant difference across banks, expectation counterparties penalize inconsistent risk measures. in addition, basel supervisor committee set implementation group senior supervisor coordinate application rule across countries. a nonbanks, argument ignore significant edge bank continue access discount window federal reserve's payment system. this competitive edge attract customer low fund cost relative nonbanks. in addition, bank express concern operational risk capital charge already carry large excess regulatory capital positions, supplement quite small current regulatory capital. indeed, believe entity would raise new capital meet propose op risk charges, rather would simply shift excess require capital. "excess" regulatory capital may reduce bank basel ii, believe reduction op risk perfectly consistent make capital requirement risk sensitive transparent, mention accurate. the effort raise regulatory capital requirement underline critics' preference op risk capital need address pillar ii - is, part undisclosed capital buff develop part supervisory oversight bank case-by-case basis. we disagree. excess regulatory capital would appear large should, transparency propose procedure would lost. inevitably, approach would treat bank similar risk differently. supervisor would also le leverage bank's capital allocation op risk third party would difficulty compare capital among bank would pillar i rule. in short, convince argument heard, still believe op risk every bite real risk credit risk treat way - explicit pillar i capital charge. commercial real estate some bank - mostly would subject a-irb capital requirement unless choose become - oppose high capital charge a-irb bank would generally face commercial real estate loans. these bank argue bank lender learn loss 1980s early 1990s much good underwrite insist borrower equity good appraisal procedure commercial real estate. these improvements, critic argue, reduce default rate loss and, anything, argue lower, higher, capital requirement least capital charge apply business loan a-irb. set aside system test true real estate cycle since early1990s, supervisor agree commercial real estate underwrite significantly improved. these improvement incorporate empirical analysis staff use develop basel ii proposals. in view federal reserve, however, capital requirement base chance individual loan default: they also base tendency default occur time, "clumps" - economist refer high asset correlation. default loss occur clump require high capital loss spread time. accord analysis, clump tendency much strong commercial real estate credit business loans. moreover, though improvement underwrite make individual loan safer, asset correlation among loan give portfolio - "clumping" tendency - change result improve underwriting. the staff federal reserve discuss issue banker show analysis - base several data set use different methodology - request evidence error new data set challenge staff's conclusion. the federal reserve process make analysis widely available ask critical evaluation contradictory information. we are, short, will listen. if bank provide evidence proposal embody erroneous assumption otherwise analytically faulty, change it. cost. implement a-irb country go expensive small number bank required, bank choose it, supervisors. for banks, great expense establish mechanism necessary bank evaluate control risk exposure formally. nonetheless, cost modest relative size recent charge-offs. the a-irb approach eliminate losses: bank business take risk risks, losses. but believe good risk-management require a-irb reduce loss provide benefit bank stakeholder economy. the cost-benefit ratio look right. furthermore, attribute cost associate adopt modern, formal risk-management system basel ii logical fallacy. the large bank require adopt a-irb - bank must compete fund global marketplace - would ultimately undertake measure without basel ii. basel ii may well speed adoption process, many cost attribute basel ii actually reflect cost business increasingly complex financial environment. competitive equity some regional bank tell u concern regional, perhaps smaller, bank competitively disadvantage basel ii, even require adopt a-irb. their concern two parts. first, regional bank feel market pressure rat agency force adopt a-irb and, result, incur significant costs. our discussion rat agency support regional banks' fears. indeed, sense rat agency feel adoption a-irb regional bank time would cost effective. in opinion, regional bank interest adopt a-irb approach inception carefully ass cost benefit so. that said, expect art science and, indeed, language, risk management migrate toward use a-irb. over year ahead, new risk-management technique become cost effective them, regional banks, suspect, adopt technique and, thereafter, probably adopt a-irb regulatory level. but adopt would premature, believe regional bank pressure either rat agency regulators. the second part competitive equity concern belief regional community bank place competitive disadvantage a-irb bank large banks' low regulatory capital charge residential mortgages, loan small businesses, certain retail loans. the direct competitive impact basel ii basel i bank important. of course, rulemaking process unite state probe issue fully. however, number factor suggest concern competitive impact well founded. in term overall capital, a-irb bank likely face low capital charge type lending, also face high charge loan categories, commercial real estate finance high cost develop risk-management infrastructure a-irb bank. they also subject explicit capital charge operational risk cyclical buff pillar ii impose non-irb banks. in individual loan market basel ii low a-irb capital charges, also reason believe competitive balance disrupted. in business loan market, example, small bank directly compete bank require adopt a-irb. small banks' close tie local community afford substantial information advantage large banks. a result, tend focus relationship lend small business individuals. a-irb banks, contrast, tend make retail loan use automate underwrite tools. large regional bank likely compete directly a-irb banks, two good reason believe basel ii affect bank significantly. first, today regulatory capital economic capital - individual bank's management judgment internal capital allocation decisionmaking - drive loan price origination decisions. nothing basel ii change capital charge imply economic capital. moreover, years, i discuss earlier, difference regulatory economic capital, sophisticate bank use capital arbitrage technique reduce effective regulatory minimums. asset securitization deals, particular, allow bank dramatically reduce amount capital currently hold residential mortgage many retail loans. regulatory capital arbitrage - market reality - thus already reduce effective capital charge loan a-irb bank receive low on-balance capital charges. basel ii increase transparency bring regulatory minimum line reality, change status quo competitive environment much, all. in short, basel ii bring a-irb banks' regulatory capital charge line capital charge have, arbitrage, already obtained. the second reason minimum regulatory capital requirement unlikely significantly affect competitive behavior well manage bank carry sizable excess capital buffers. small bank particular, operate le leverage large banks, hold substantial excess regulatory capital, reflect lack diversification limit access funding. basel ii change fact. under basel ii, small bank continue hold capital a-irb banks, a-irb banks' true risk-based capital position measure accurately. conclusion the basel ii effort reflect collective judgment supervisor world's large complex bank organizations, include unite states, activity practice firm outgrow exist supervisory approaches. at time, role bank financial system continue grow. in judgment, alternative adopt, soon practical, approach appropriately suit task bank supervision large bank twenty-first century. the basel ii framework product extensive multiyear dialogue bank industry regard state-of-the-art risk-management practice every significant area bank activity. accordingly, provide roadmap improve regulation supervision global banking. basel ii provide strong incentive bank continue improve internal risk-management capability well tool supervisor focus emerge problem issue rapidly ever before. i please appear today report effort near completion. open discussion complex issue heart basel ii development process outset doubt continue characterize basel ii evolve further. bi review 10/2003 1 alan greenspan: deposit insurance testimony mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u.s. senate, washington, d.c., 26 february 2003.

consumption expenditure deflator gross domestic product accounts. despite initial quite limit intent, congress raise maximum amount coverage five time since 1950, current level $100,000. the last increase, 1980, double limit clearly design let depositories, particularly thrift institutions, offer insure deposit free then-prevailing interest rate ceiling instruments, apply deposit $100,000. insure deposit exactly $100,000 thus become fully insure instrument 1980 subject interest rate ceiling. the effort thrift institution use $100,000 cd stem liquidity outflow result public withdrawal smaller, below-market-rate insure deposit lead first earn squeeze associate loss capital high-risk investment strategy lead failure failure. depositor acquire new larger-denomination insure deposit aware plight thrift institution unconcerned risk principal amount $100,000 deposit fully insure federal government. in way, 1980 increase deposit insurance $100,000 exacerbate fundamental problem face thrift institution - concentration long-term asset environment high rise interest rates. indeed, significantly increase taxpayer cost bailout bankrupt thrift institution deposit insurance fund. despite problematic episode, deposit insurance clearly play key - time even critical - role achieve stability bank financial market characterize nearly seventy year since adoption. deposit insurance, combine component bank safety net (the federal reserve's discount window payment system guarantees), mean period financial stress long entail widespread depositor run bank thrift institutions. quite opposite: asset holder seek deposit - insure uninsured - safe haven strong doubt financial assets. look beyond contribution deposit insurance overall financial stability, minimize importance security bring million household small business relatively modest financial assets. deposit insurance give safe secure place hold transaction balances. the benefit deposit insurance, significant are, come without cost. the process end deposit run make insure depositor largely indifferent risk take depository institutions, depositor 1980s regard insolvent, risky thrift institutions. the result weaken market discipline insure depositor would otherwise impose institutions. relieve discipline, depository naturally feel le cautious take risk would otherwise assume. no type private financial institution able attract fund public without regard risk take creditors' resources. this incentive take excessive risk expense insurer, potentially taxpayer, so-called moral hazard problem deposit insurance. thus, two offset implication deposit insurance must keep mind. on one hand, clear deposit insurance contribute prevention bank run could destabilize financial structure short run. on other, even current level deposit insurance may already increase risk-taking insure depository institution extent future systemic risk arguably risen. indeed, reduce market discipline increase moral hazard depository intensify need government supervision protect interest taxpayer and, essence, substitute reduce market discipline. deposit insurance component safety net also enable bank thrift institution attract resources, low costs, would otherwise case. in short, insure institution receive subsidy form government guarantee allow attract deposit low interest rate would necessary without deposit insurance take risk without fear lose deposit funding. put another way, deposit insurance misallocates resource break link risk reward select set market competitors. in sum, beginning, deposit insurance involve tradeoff. deposit insurance contribute overall short-term financial stability protection small depositors. but time, also subsidize deposit growth induce great risk-taking, deposit insurance misallocates resource create large long-term financial imbalance increase need government supervision protect taxpayers' interests. deposit insurance reform must balance tradeoffs. moreover, reform aim primarily protect interest economy overall profit market share particular businesses. the federal reserve board belief deposit insurance reform design preserve benefit heighten financial stability protection small depositor without increase moral hazard reduction market discipline. in addition, urge implement detail keep straightforward possible minimize risk unintended consequence come complexity. issue reform the fdic make five broad recommendations. 1. merge bif saif the board support fdic's proposal merge bank insurance fund (bif) save association insurance fund (saif). because charter operation bank thrift institution become similar, make sense continue separate funds. separate fund reflect past neither present future. merge fund would diversify risks, reduce administrative expense, widen fund base increasingly concentrate bank system. most important, bank thrift institution receive level federally guarantee insurance coverage, premium face set institution identical well. under current arrangements, premium face equally risky institution could differ significantly one fund fall designate reserve ratio 1.25 percent insure deposit fund not. should occur, depository institution would induce switch charter obtain insurance fund low premium, result could distort depository structure. the federal government sell single service, like deposit insurance, different prices. 2. reduce statutory restriction premium current law require fdic impose high premium risky bank thrift institution prevent impose premium well-capitalized highly rat institution correspond fund's reserve exceed 1.25 percent insure deposits. the board endorse fdic recommendation would eliminate statutory restriction risk-based price allow premium impose every insure depository institution, matter well capitalize well rat may high fund's reserves. the current statutory requirement free deposit insurance provide well-capitalized highly rat institution ratio fdic reserve insure deposit exceed predetermine ratio maximize subsidy provide institution inconsistent effort avoid induce moral hazard. put differently, current rule require government give away valuable guarantee many institution fund reserve meet ceiling level. this free guarantee value institution even sound financial condition macroeconomic time good. at end third quarter last year, 91 percent bank thrift institution pay premium. that group include many institution never pay premium their, case substantial, coverage, also include fast-growing entity whose past premium extraordinarily small relative current coverage. we believe anomaly never intend framer deposit insurance fund act 1996 address congress. the congress intend fdic impose risk-based premiums, 1996 act limit ability fdic impose risk-based premium well-capitalized highly rat bank thrift institutions. and two variable - capital strength overall examiner rat - capture risk institution could create insurer. the board belief fdic free establish risk category basis economic variable show relate institution's risk failure, impose premium commensurate risk. although robust risk-based premium system would technically difficult design, close link insurance premium risk individual institution would reduce moral hazard distortion resource allocation accompany deposit insurance. we note, however, although significant benefit risk-based premium system likely require substantial range premiums, fdic conclude report premium risky bank would probably need cap order avoid induce failure weak institutions. we believe cap premium may end cost insurance fund long run weak institution fail anyway, delay increase ultimate cost resolution. the board concluded, therefore, cap premium required, set quite high risk-based premium effective possible deter excessive risk-taking. in way, could begin simulate deposit insurance price market would apply reduce associate subsidy deposit insurance. nonetheless, delude believe even wide range risk-based premium structure would eliminate need government back-up deposit insurance fund, is, eliminate government subsidy deposit insurance. to eliminate subsidy deposit insurance - make deposit insurance real insurance system - fdic average insurance premium would set high enough cover fully small probability large losses, incur great depression, thus perceive cost systemic risk. in contrast life automobile casualty insurance, individual insure loss bank independent losses. bank subject systemic risk thus subject far large extreme loss tail probability distribution real insurance premium would calculated. indeed, price deposit insurance risk fully fund potential loss - price eliminate subsidy - could well require premium would discourage depository institution offer broad coverage customers. since congress determine broad coverage, subsidy deposit insurance cannot fully eliminated, although eliminate much subsidy can. i note difficulty raise risk-based premium explain real private-insurer substitute deposit insurance government. no private insurer would ever able match actual fdic premium cover risks. a private insurer confront possibility, remote may be, loss could bankrupt would need set especially high premium protect itself, premium few, any, depository institution would find attractive. and premium fully price government private sector, depository institution would likely low offer rates, thereby reduce amount insure deposit demanded, consequently amount outstanding would decline. 3. relax reserve ratio regime allow gradual adjustment premium current law establish designate reserve ratio bif saif 1.25 percent. if ratio exceeded, statute require premium discontinue well-capitalized highly rat institutions. if ratio decline 1.25 percent, fdic must develop set premium restore reserve ratio 1.25 percent; fund ratio likely restore statutorily designate level within twelve months, law require premium least 23 basis point impose insure entities. these requirement clearly procyclical: they low eliminate fee good times, bank credit readily available deposit insurance fund reserve build up, abruptly increase fee sharply time weakness, bank credit availability pressure deposit fund resource draw cover resolution fail institutions. the fdic recommend surcharge rebate use bring fund back target reserve ratio gradually. the fdic also recommend possibility target range designate reserve ratio, premium may remain constant, rather fix target reserve ratio abruptly change premiums. we support increase flexibility smooth change premiums. indeed, recommend fdic's suggest target reserve range widen reduce need change premium abruptly. any floor ceiling, regardless level, could require premium increase exactly time bank thrift could stress and, similarly, premium reduce time depository best position fund increase reserves. build large fund good time permit decline necessary prerequisite le variability premium. in addition support widen range designate reserve ratio, board recommend fdic give latitude temporarily relax floor ceiling ratio basis current anticipate bank condition expect need resource resolve fail institutions. in short, enhance macroeconomic stability, prefer reduction specificity rule fdic operate and, within broad guideline set congress, increase flexibility board fdic operate. 4. modify rebate system since early days, fdic rebate "excess" premium whenever consider reserve adequate. this procedure replace 1996 law requirement premium impose well-capitalized highly rat institution relevant fund reach designate reserve ratio. the fdic's 2001 proposal would re-impose minimum premium bank thrift institution risk-sensitive premium structure. these provision would couple rebate strong entity fund approach upper end target range surcharge fund trend low end target range. the fdic also recommend rebate uniform strong entities. rather, fdic argue rebate small bank pay premium short period past pay premium commensurate present size consequent fdic exposure. the devil, course, details. but vary rebate way make considerable sense, board endorse it. more 900 bank - quite large - never pay premium, without modification would continue pay virtually nothing, net rebates, long strong capital high supervisory rat maintained. such approach competitively inequitable contribute moral hazard. it addressed. 5. index ceiling coverage insure deposit the fdic recommend current $100,000 ceiling insure deposit index inflation. the board support recommendation belief current ceiling maintained. in board's judgment, increase coverage, even indexing, unlikely add measurably stability bank system. macroeconomic policy element safety net - combine current, still-significant level deposit insurance - continue important bulwark bank runs. thus, problem increase coverage design solve must relate either individual depositor, party originally intend protected, individual bank thrift institution. clearly, group would prefer high coverage cost nothing. but congress need clear nature specific problem increase coverage would solution. depositors. our recent survey consumer finance suggest depositor balance well current insurance limit $100,000, large balance apparently adept achieve level deposit insurance coverage desire open multiple insure accounts. such spread asset perfectly consistent counsel always give investor diversify asset - whether stocks, bonds, mutual fund - across different issuers. the cost diversify insure deposit surely great assets. a bank would clearly prefer depositor maintain fund bank would prefer reduce need depositor diversification able offer high deposit insurance coverage. nonetheless, depositor appear great difficulty - want insure deposit - find multiple source fully insure accounts. in addition, one remarkable characteristic household hold financial asset increase diversity portfolio choice since world war ii. and, since early 1970s share household financial asset bank thrift deposit generally decline steadily household take advantage innovative, attractive financial instrument market rate return. the trend seem bear relation past increase insurance ceilings. indeed, dramatic substitution deposit shift insure uninsured deposit equity mutual fund hold equities, bonds, money market assets. it difficult believe change ceiling 1990s would make measurable difference shift. rather, data indicate weakness stock price recent year mark increase flow bank thrift deposit even without change insurance coverage levels. depository institutions. doe problem solve increase deposit insurance coverage concern individual depository institution? if so, problem would seem disproportionately relate small bank insure deposit much large proportion total fund small bank large banks. but small bank appear well. since mid-1990s, adjust effect mergers, asset bank small large 1,000 grow average annual rate 13.8 percent, twice pace large 1,000 banks. uninsured deposits, adjust effect mergers, grow average annual rate 21 percent small bank versus 10 percent large banks. clearly, small bank demonstrate skill ability compete uninsured deposits. to sure, uninsured deposit expensive insure deposits, bank cost would decline profit rise currently uninsured liability receive government guarantee. but issue whether subsidize bank profit additional deposit insurance serf national purpose. i might add throughout 1990s present century, return equity small bank well maintained. indeed, attractiveness bank evidence fact 1,350 bank charter past decade, include 600 1999 2002. some small bank argue need enhance deposit insurance coverage compete large bank depositor prefer put uninsured fund institution consider big fail. a i noted, however, small bank hold market uninsured deposits. in addition, board reject notion bank big fail. in fdic improvement act 1991 (fdicia), congress make clear systemic-risk exception fdic's least-cost resolution fail bank invoke unusual circumstances. moreover, resolution rule systemic-risk exception require uninsured depositor creditors, much le stockholders, make whole. the market clearly evidence view, consistent fdicia, large institution big uninsured creditor take least loss institution fail. for example, u.s. bank organization, matter large, aaa-rated. in addition, research indicate creditor impose high risk premium uninsured debt relatively risky large bank organization market discipline increase since enactment fdicia. to sure, real purchase power deposit insurance ceiling declined. but evidence significant detrimental effect depositor depository institutions, possible exception small reduction profit accrue deposit guarantee subsidy low cost insure deposits. the current deposit insurance ceiling appear adequate achieve positive benefit deposit insurance i mention earlier, even real value erode further. another argument often raise small bank regard need increase deposit insurance coverage. some small institution say unable match competition large security firm bank hold company multiple bank thrift institution affiliate entity offer multiple insure account one organization. i note since committee's last hear issue, force small banks' concern reduce recent market development small bank thrift institution use clearinghouse network broke deposit allow offer full fdic insurance large accounts. the board agree practice large small depository misuse deposit insurance. moreover, raise coverage limit account remedy small bank would also increase aggregate amount insurance coverage multidepository organization would able offer. the disparity would remain. conclusion several aspect deposit insurance system need reform. the board supports, modifications, recommendation fdic make spring 2001 except index current $100,000 ceiling inflation. the thrust recommendation would call wide permissible range size fund relative insure deposits, reduce variation insurance premium relative size fund change bank economic conditions, positive risk-based premium net rebate depository institutions, merge bif saif. there may come time board find household business modest resource difficulty place fund safe vehicle level deposit coverage appear endanger financial stability. should either event occur, board would call concern attention congress support adjustment ceiling index methods. but today, judgment, neither financial stability, depositors, depository disadvantage current ceiling. raise ceiling would extend safety net, increase government subsidy depository institutions, expand moral hazard, reduce incentive market discipline without provide clear public benefit. with clear public benefit increase deposit insurance, board see reason increase scope safety net. indeed, board belief financial system become ever complex exceptionally responsive vagary economic change, structural distortion induce government guarantee risen. we way ascertain exactly point subsidy provoke systemic risk. nonetheless, prudence suggest exceptionally deliberate expand government financial guarantees. bi review 29/2003 1 toshiro muto: structural change world economy challenge face japan(cid:146)s economy speech mr toshiro muto, deputy governor bank japan, jcif international finance seminar, tokyo, 17 june 2003. * * * i. structural change world economy a. economic globalization innovation information technology (it) look back, turn century, second half 20th century, ass era mark lengthy cold war world war ii. before close 20th century, however, cold war come dramatic end, collapse berlin wall november 1989. behind change cold war structure, worldwide spread market economy work drive force, see expansion free market former soviet union eastern europe. the end cold war accelerate globalization market economy 1990s. eastern europe join world trade structure play increasingly important role supply base especially euro area. in asia, china, already introduce market mechanism end cold war, become giant supply base develop country include japan. export china currently account approximately 15 percent world export adjust purchase power parity, rise around 5 percent 1990. in unite states, import latin america currently account approximately 16 percent, increase around 11 percent 1990. these fact vividly illustrate trend economic globalization drive chemistry market mechanism change international political system. b. industrialization emerge economy development it-related industry against background economic globalization 1990s, emerge economy industrialize rapidly elevate importance world economy. in meantime, innovation it also contribute economic globalization, nurture it-related industry come great influence world economy. since it-related industry multinational structure involve emerge economies, growth it-related industry inevitably strengthen global economic linkages. although change help facilitate new economic structure long run, sometimes engender negative aspects. the global inventory adjustment it-related area begin around end 2000 still fresh memories. in developments, unite state also europe japan, well east asian economies, experience simultaneous stagnation due mainly decrease exports, production, investment it-related areas. c. globalization financial market the expansion market economy technological innovation encourage development financial market emerge economies, well realize new financial instrument derivatives. they consequently strengthen global linkage capital markets. the globalization financial market facilitate rapid industrialization emerge economy promote capital inflows. on hand, financial crisis certain country area could spread easily countries, see asian currency crisis 1997, russian financial crisis, collapse long-term capital management 1998. central bank many countries, include bank japan, cooperate various form research issue recently. 2 bi review 29/2003 d. worldwide disinflationary trend structural change world economy also affect environment prices. a worldwide disinflationary trend become conspicuous 1990s, reflect increase supply capacity worldwide due industrialization emerge economies, technological innovation, macroeconomic policy adopt many country restrain inflation. inflation rate g-7 country average 10 percent 1970s 5 percent 1980s. the simple average rates, however, decline 2-3 percent start 1990s, second half decade remain 2-3 percent unite states, unite kingdom, italy, fell 2 percent g-7 countries. japan experience gradual deflation, consumer price range -1 zero percent year year since middle 1998. in europe unite states, disinflationary trend bring real economic benefits, secure stable foundation economic activity. the unite state enjoy long-lasting economic expansion accompany price stability 1990s. the improvement productivity reflect technological innovation it-related industry often credit this, particularly discussion so-called (cid:147)new economy.(cid:148) in europe, european monetary union achieve since inflation rate country join union decline level satisfy convergence criteria. on hand, central bank many country become increasingly concern risk price declines, occur decade since great depression. the background inflation rates, particularly major industrialize countries, trend downward nearly zero percent amid disinflationary trend worldwide. although positive effect real economy, bring risk inflation rate could turn negative downward pressure price increase either demand supply side. the federal reserve low federal fund rate gradually 2001 response economic developments, accordingly decline 6.5 percent start 2001 1.25 percent. the european central bank (ecb) also gradually reduce main refinance operation rate 4.75 percent begin 2001 2.5 percent, follow reduction 2.0 percent june 5, 2003. in line monetary policy developments, central bank overseas sometimes refer risk price decline statements. the federal reserve, example, comment (cid:147)the probability unwelcome substantial fall inflation, though minor, exceed pickup inflation already low level(cid:148) public statement meet federal open market committee may 6, 2003. in addition, several central bank official comment manoeuvrability monetary policy background price declines. conventional monetary ease call reduce short-term interest rates. however, definite answer yet, either theoretically empirically, question whether remain scope stimulation economic activity monetary policy measure (cid:147)zero low bound(cid:148) short-term interest rates. for reason, central bank overseas pay great attention conduct monetary policy bank japan, take unprecedented quantitative ease measure since march 2001. ii. issue face japanese economy a. the catch-up emerge economy bear mind structural change worldwide i described, i would like focus issue face japanese economy. during cold war period, japan achieve remarkable economic growth, drive mainly enhance competitiveness manufacture sector, extent japan become know (cid:147)factory world.(cid:148) however, many japanese industry bring economic growth postwar era face competition counterpart emerge economy rapidly catch up. the share trade partner japanese export import change substantially. in past, unite state take overwhelm majority japanese exports, fairly large proportion import oil produce countries. however, share import middle east, nearly 30 percent mid-1970s, declining, 10 percent recently. on hand, share trade (both export imports) east asian economies, bi review 29/2003 3 around 25 percent mid-1980s, recently exceed 40 percent. in particular, share import china total japanese import expand 18 percent 2002 5 percent 1990. the share import china overtake unite states, make china large importer japan. an examination import reveal character japan(cid:146)s trade structure - import raw material manufacture export product - changed. for instance, share raw material total import east asian economy decline 15 percent recently, 35 percent 1990. in meantime, machinery textile good exceed 50 percent recently, compare around 25 percent 1990. the degree penetration import product domestic market illustrate rise value add import products. in 1990s, growth penetration textile good conspicuous, since 2000 level around 30 percent. the penetration electrical general machinery increase nearly 30 percent recently, 17-18 percent 2000. these change reflect progress industrialization accumulation technology east asian economy since 1990. they also attributable japanese firms(cid:146) activity transfer production site overseas. at time, change make u consider kind industry nurture type economic value create source japan(cid:146)s future growth. b. the age economy japan shift grow economy mature one unprecedentedly fast pace. since second half 1980s, japan(cid:146)s birthrate decline significantly age population pyramid accelerated. the nation(cid:146)s population expect decrease 2006. give circumstances, japanese socioeconomic system, include employment system, social security, local budget tax systems, need drastically reconstruct one base grow economy one suit mature economy. the reform system comprise economy society nation inevitably entail conflict interest, become increasingly difficult resolve conflict benefit economic expansion. thus, difficult challenge indeed japan implement reconstruction socioeconomic system order catch change economic social environments, achieve national consensus. c. emergence burst bubble economy give various change i mentioned, second half 1980s 1990s necessary japan embark nurture new industry could lead industry 21st century, well implement fundamental change socioeconomic system. however, period bubble emerge burst, cause serious delay structural changes. overheat domestic demand sharp rise asset price due bubble allow inefficient sector preserve permit unprofitable investment business expand. in financial sector, substantial rise land price cause expansion bank lend period emphasis place finance capital market securitization. furthermore, burst bubble combine characteristic financial system indigenous japan - high proportion bank lend - cause serious problem restrain economic activity long time, problem nonperforming loan (npls) firms(cid:146) debt overhang. efficient reallocation resource structural adjustment realize result risk-taking activity various economic entity explore business frontiers. however, financial strength bank firm hence risk-taking capacity damage significantly. against background, macroeconomic policy 1990s continuously deal downward pressure economy stem burst bubble. d. recent development economy now i would like touch briefly recent development economy. in first half 2002, japan(cid:146)s economy record relatively high growth support increase export reflect global inventory restock it-related goods. since second half 2002, however, economic activity japan basically flat. despite fact corporate profit recover 4 bi review 29/2003 reflect increase export production, firm yet embark active investment due uncertainty economic outlook. the employment income situation household remain severe, firm continue reduce personnel costs. in situation, private consumption, constitute major part aggregate demand, remain flat, although fairly firm relative level income. with regard outlook, japan(cid:146)s export expect start increase moderate pace, base assumption gradual recovery overseas economies. however, pace recovery europe unite state likely moderate. in addition, seem likely growth east asian economies, fairly rapid far, slow least time due impact severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). we must continue careful monitor japan(cid:146)s economy, take account effect development overseas economy japan(cid:146)s financial system. iii. monetary policy bank japan a. conduct monetary policy in order place economy back sustainable growth path overcome deflation soon possible, bank implement extraordinary monetary ease measures, far exceed category (cid:147)conventional(cid:148) monetary policy. in march 2001, bank implement (cid:147)quantitative easing(cid:148) framework increase liquidity provision money market situation short-term interest rate decline virtually zero. the outstanding balance current account deposit bank expand 4 trillion yen time close 30 trillion yen present. the bank announce would continue framework quantitative ease consumer price index (cpi) record year-on-year increase zero percent sustainable basis. the bank also steadily increase purchase japanese government bond (jgbs), currently purchase little le 15 trillion yen worth jgbs annually, roughly equivalent half total value newly issue government bonds. the bank also introduce lombard-type lend facility whereby financial institution borrow funds, within eligible collateral pledged, bank official discount rate 0.1 percent. the bank widen range eligible collateral asset-backed security (abss) many new financial assets. a i mention earlier, several central bank official overseas comment recently conceivable option monetary ease (cid:147)zero low bound(cid:148) short-term interest rates. a possible measure take solely central bank, raise increase liquidity provision, announcement continue monetary ease future, increase outright purchase government securities, extend central bank(cid:146)s discount window commercial bank low interest rates, widen range eligible collateral. the bank already implement unconventional measure quantitative ease framework. the effect extraordinary ease measure bank japan observe financial markets. even various shock due problem domestic financial system, terrorist attack unite states, military action iraq, liquidity shortage materialize money market, short-term interest rate continue virtually zero, include longer-term rate term instruments. this situation mark contrast 1997-98 failure large financial institution trigger concern availability liquidity japanese banks, result, so-called (cid:147)japan premium(cid:148) expand sharp credit contraction occur corporate financing. the bank(cid:146)s policy commitment - continue current framework monetary ease cpi record year-on-year increase zero percent sustainable basis - lead market participant believe short-term interest rate continue zero least actual inflation rate turn positive. a result, risk premium reflect future fluctuation interest rate decline considerably, decline interest rate spread even longer-term rates. the yield five-year jgbs range 0.1 0.2 percent, ten-year jgbs fall 0.5 percent, 30-year jgbs around 1 percent. thus, government able raise fund almost zero extremely low cost. the cost private sector raise fund also declined. bi review 29/2003 5 however, despite drastic monetary ease bank, economic activity price development influence much far. this due various factors. first, originally little room interest rate decline further. a consequence bank(cid:146)s large-scale monetary ease since burst bubble, overnight call rate already 0.5 percent 1995, long-term interest rate already around 1.5 percent time introduction quantitative ease framework. in situation, effect various additional ease measure remain marginal, especially economy substantial adjustment pressures. the concern many central bank risk price decline base reflection uncertainty limitation effectiveness monetary ease (cid:147)zero low bound(cid:148) short-term interest rates. the second factor, i mention earlier, risk-taking capability private entities, commercial bank firms, greatly impaired. the transmission mechanism monetary ease effect depend heavily private entities(cid:146) risk-taking activity. in normal situation, liquidity provision central bank commercial bank encourage lend liquidity constraint eased. however, present, capital constraint arise mainly npl problem, liquidity constraints, bind commercial banks(cid:146) lend capacities. this major reason bank lend continue decline growth money stock sluggish, although monetary base expanding. furthermore, whether portfolio rebalancing effect - is, mechanism whereby central bank(cid:146)s increase liquidity provision still increase financial institutions(cid:146) investment risk asset even short-term interest rate reach zero bind - occur also depend extent financial institution actively take risks. so far, reluctant take risks, mostly invest fund provide bank credit-risk-free asset cash, excess reserves, government securities. a i mentioned, bank struggle many constraints, (cid:147)zero low bound(cid:148) interest rate fundamental problem monetary easing, also impair risk-taking capability private sector, malfunction transmission mechanism monetary easing. this issue monetary policy also recent macroeconomic policy whole japan. throughout 1990s, i charge execute fiscal policy. during period, japan take substantial measure monetary fiscal fronts. however, give fiscal policy determine political situation time, since growth expectation decline private sector(cid:146)s risk-taking capability impaired, multiplier effect public investment tax cut also constrained. a central bank struggle problem malfunction transmission mechanism, fiscal authority also struggle problem fiscal expenditure lead vigorous spend private sector. b. issue regard policy measure there various debate outside bank policy options, bank always examine wide range imaginable options. i would like raise point i think important discuss future policy conduct. first all, must bear mind japan(cid:146)s effort overcome deflation ultimately aim realize sound continuous prosperity economy. with grow number country shift market-led economy economic globalization advancing, essential make full use private sector(cid:146)s initiative market mechanism well maintain favorable relationship economy japan continue enjoy economic prosperity future. if japan take policy measure distort market mechanism medium long term, cause inefficiency economy, greatly impair relationship overseas, prospect economic prosperity 21st century would substantially narrowed. it important various policy option consistent direction desire economy. furthermore, conduct economic policies, essential maintain capacity respond various shock uncertainties, often unpredictable imperfect knowledge, order secure economic stability. once confidence public market participant capacity economic policy lost, cause serious instability economy financial markets. past experience tell u public confidence policy entities, lost, extremely difficult restore short period time. 6 bi review 29/2003 a independent central bank, bank bear mind accountability public policy measures. there argument outside bank bank purchase risky asset central bank normally purchase. in respect, must bear mind central bank ultimately belong people. if central bank buy assets, virtually mean us people(cid:146)s money buy them. in current situation short-term interest rate reach zero bind conventional monetary ease tool exhausted, bank must consider measure go beyond boundary traditional monetary policy sometimes approach realm fiscal policy. however, vital bank evaluate policy option perspective whether consistent bank(cid:146)s accountability public thus make balance judgment. this point become serious policy option could great influence distribution income risk private sector. c. issue inflation target i would like briefly talk issue inflation targeting. inflation target policy framework adopt several country state price stability, goal monetary policy, express term desirable rate inflation numerical values. i think background argument regard inflation target japan differ somewhat original think i described. the think underline current argument advocate adoption inflation target japan seem follows: real interest rates, derive subtract inflation expectation rate nominal interest rates, might reduce inflation expectation rate increased, declaration numerical target might contribute even virtually room reduction nominal interest rates. whether inflation target bring intend benefit, is, enhance transparency monetary policy stabilize people(cid:146)s expectation, largely depend following: credible target? that say, extent tool mechanism achieve target assured? a least, hard say sufficiently equipped, consider several constraint surround current conduct monetary policy. like central bank, bank need examine every possible measure enhance transparency conduct monetary policy. the bank fully recognize fact inflation target could important policy tool purpose, enter stage manoeuvrability restore monetary policy transmission mechanism recover function. the bank continue examine issue future. bear lack manoeuvrability malfunction transmission mechanism present, however, i think critically important urgent take practical step restore effectiveness transmission mechanism monetary ease influence economic activity prices. i would like emphasize would complete misunderstand bank(cid:146)s policy intention conclude bank actively implement monetary policy overcome deflation, base solely fact bank adopt inflation target juncture. the bank will bring inflation rate back zero percent, is, slightly positive rate, utmost maintain around level. d. enhance transmission mechanism monetary ease amid various constraint impose policy i mentioned, important policy task bank enhance transmission mechanism monetary easing. a credit intermediary function bank work properly, one contribution central bank enhance transmission mechanism encourage development securitized finance tool capital market could complement substitute bank lending, improve finance environment small firms. the relatively high share bank lending, one feature japan(cid:146)s financial structure, contribute absorb shock downturn economic activity within banks(cid:146) assets, thus succeed diminish effect economy long impact shock limited. however, significant shock accompany asset price fall occurred, concentration loss bank sector cause substantial damage capital base risk-taking capability. this, turn, amplify effect shock tighten corporate finance conditions. bi review 29/2003 7 this problem could partially resolve alternative financial market substitute bank lend develop significant degree. the development market would contribute smooth corporate financing, would also work discipline banks(cid:146) lend activities, example, encourage bank formulate lend rate reflect credit risk accurately. in addition, broaden scope economic entity take credit risk attach corporate sector could enlarge risk-taking capacity banks. investor would able realize portfolio utilize broad range instrument various combination risk returns. a new finance channel kind imperative cope finance need corporate sector, economy become mature. base think i described, april bank start examine policy option temporary purchase abs underlie asset receivables loan relate small medium-sized firms. the bank decide purchase scheme monetary policy meet june 11, 2003, take account various comment market participants. although unconventional measure central bank directly take private-sector credit risk, think necessary promote smooth corporate finance nurture ab market enhance effectiveness monetary easing, give due consideration require function japan(cid:146)s financial system future current weakness credit intermediary function bank system. at time, bank pay careful attention avoid distortion ab market maintain soundness bank(cid:146)s balance sheet. iv. for revitalize japan(cid:146)s economy a. the need effort wide range economic entity i would like briefly discus think effort necessary revitalize japan(cid:146)s economy. a i mention outset, world economy undergo structural change industrialization emerge economy advancing. in situation, japan foster new industry lead economy 21st century high productivity value-added suitable develop nation. such effort indispensable ensure economic prosperity future, since able count increase population source economic growth improvement productivity virtually way create growth. at time, necessary drastically reconstruct socioeconomic system, base expand economy, one fit mature economy. it difficult achieve national consensus regard change system itself. if change socioeconomic system cannot catch actual economic social developments, however, economic revitalization hamper effect disincentives. there another problem regard private economic entities: risk-taking capability financial institution firm impair sluggish growth expectation burst bubble. this problem undermine effect various policy actions. therefore, effort government, private sector, central bank must concert overcome complex issue face economy. a part this, japan present vision future socioeconomic system seek attain, include social security system relationship central local governments, seek continuously take action accordance vision. japan(cid:146)s prosperity 21st century achieve maximum utilization private-sector initiative market mechanisms, example investment fund intermediary, throughout economy. at present, private sector cannot fulfill role utmost limit financial strength, case public authority require support private-sector initiatives. the industrial revitalization corporation japan establish last month major example public initiative support private activities, i hope utilize effectively contribute revitalization economy. at time, policy support whole must line nation(cid:146)s vision, is, economy exploit full benefit private-sector initiative market mechanisms. continue take policy action harmony future vision heighten growth expectation private sector induce demand. 8 bi review 29/2003 b. revive financial system finally, i would like comment specifically issue concern japanese financial system. in order revive economy, indispensable realize situation japan(cid:146)s financial system perform credit intermediary function fully. discussion put financial system sound basis often focus attention disposal npls. although issue important, disposal npls one prerequisite achieve much broad task revive financial system. the vital necessity medium long term construct new financial infrastructure, play key role economy 21st century. after world war ii, japanese financial institution raise profitability maintain certain asset size, support high economic growth private savings. in undertake risk management, basic function commercial banks, work associate assess profitability risk individual project often substitute monitor price real estate pledge collateral. this system base condition real estate price continue rise. market participant keenly watch whether japanese financial institution generate new business model establish sufficient foundation profitability future, external environment support profitability postwar era drastically changed. the value-added profit financial institution ultimately generate activity take control various risk credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk. for japanese financial system economy revive, extremely important japanese financial institution create new business model ensure foundation profitability support japanese economy 21st century. i think essential financial institution make effort respect. the bank japan make best effort various fronts, enhance transmission mechanism monetary easing, promote permeation ease effect economy, well ensure financial market stability. a develop country keenly watch monetary policy conduct, sincere hope japan realize sustainable economic growth accompany price stability, succeed record victory deflation. bi review 29/2003 1 michael c bonello: population age - major challenge policymakers speech mr michael c bonello, governor central bank malta, open session two workshop pension reform, organise floriana, malta, world bank institute, 9 june 2003. * * * i first like thank world bank institute choose malta venue workshop welcome country. your presence continue centuries-old tradition whereby malta exploit location centre mediterranean reputation hospitality bring people idea together. malta currently undergo rapid transformation bid seize opportunity arise accession european union consolidation trade relationship southern eastern neighbours. the economy, albeit small, number vibrant sector range high-tech manufacture world-class conference tourism. a case many countries, however, long-term prospect economic development malta inevitably affect impact population ageing. give population support ratio, define number person work age pension age, expect halve next 25 year 2, impact likely significant. the global regional dimension population age malta mean exception regard. by middle century, median age world population expect increase 10 year 36 years. globally, proportion person age 60 year old forecast double. the fast grow group old population make 80 year old more. this age category project increase five-fold next 50 years. while age indeed global phenomenon, likely represent onerous challenge develop country develop ones. the majority person age 60 find increasingly develop countries; pace population age much fast countries, le time adjust effect develop countries. develop countries, moreover, meet challenge start low level socio-economic development. for instance, elderly develop country live mostly rural area hence face additional difficulty compare counterpart develop country tend live urban centres. these difference imply policymaking capacity develop country test severely. more specifically, important decision take regard social security schemes, particularly traditional pension system today(cid:146)s worker pay benefit today(cid:146)s retirees. this doubt involve make difficult choices, may painful consequence short run, essential sustain economic development. the economic consequence population age this case population age expect wide-ranging long-lasting economic effects, involve government revenue expenditure also national save investment ratio well labour market. the main issue come mind mention population age impact government finances. most countries, include malta, presently operate pay-as-you-go pension systems. the age phenomenon undermine financial viability pay-as-you go system reduce number contributor relative beneficiaries. age also entail increase government expenditure health, especially care elderly. the challenge public finance even great if, case malta, budget already deficit. change age distribution population also likely affect country(cid:146)s private consumption save patterns. the (cid:145)life-cycle hypothesis(cid:146) suggest individual tend even consumption outlay lifetime, person save work year order 2 bi review 29/2003 finance consumption retirement. a rise trend proportion elderly people, therefore, tend accompany decline national save ratio. oecd projections, fact, point reduction save rate 5 12 percentage point gnp period 1980 2025. such contraction could lead vicious circle, result high interest rate reduce investment, adversely affect economic growth and, turn, ability finance social security commitments. age could also negative impact financial markets. pension fund present major player stock markets. a baby boom generation retire current decade, fund gradually liquidate assets, probably lead downward pressure share prices. this would turn create negative wealth effect, decline asset price dent purchase power household give rise reassessment consumption patterns. the simultaneous decline fertility rates, meanwhile, expect adversely affect supply labour quality. a small labour force would act drag potential output growth, impact negatively competitiveness tighten labour market conditions, lead upward pressure wage inflation. an old work force also likely le mobile flexible, albeit experienced. policy measure address challenge in economic terms, population age tantamount negative supply shock, fiscal impact manifestation. more fundamentally, age phenomenon undermine economy(cid:146)s productive base competitiveness. the adverse effect reduction output meanwhile compound high consumption, tend crowd investment expenditure exert adverse pressure price level external balance payments. the desirable outcome policy intend meet population age are, therefore, hard identify. such policy must aim produce increase productive capacity output, stimulate save investment, thereby alleviate pressure inflation, fiscal resource external account. indeed, outcome desirable independently population ageing, render even urgent onset phenomenon. it way strategy implement often subject contention. opinion tend diverge always appreciate course action chosen, include passive stance, involve sacrifices. an increase resource devote pension must imply high taxation, reduction fund allocate equally worthy causes, burden society whole term high inflation interest rates. on hand, reform engender win-win situation long run could perhaps impose sacrifice number individual short term. it is, therefore, important promote inform debate take account cost benefit involve course action, view reach agreement viable solutions. the nineties, fact, saw many government implement pension reform initiatives, generally base three-pillar approach advocate world bank. under approach, individual may three different source revenue retirement, namely basic state pension, balance accumulate mandatory pension account voluntary save arrangements. a number international study show replacement pay-as-you-go pension regime fund system provide incentive private saving, reduce scope tax evasion link contribution pay system directly benefit received. this contribute increase investment augment productive base, thereby facilitate finance social security expenditure commitments. apart specific reform social security system itself, improvement fiscal position would overall positive macroeconomic effect, compensate part addition aggregate demand bring ageing. the low absorption resource state could also lead high average level productivity improvement country(cid:146)s balance payments. productive capacity would also enhance state create fiscal incentive individual provide need retirement, lead increase household save rate and, consequently, also fast accumulation capital. fiscal consolidation will, however, solve part problem create population ageing. the negative supply shock cause phenomenon must also counter positive shock. bi review 29/2003 3 supply-side reform aim increase availability efficient use economic resource are, therefore, essential. the efficiency market improve implement vigorous competition policy reduce public sector involvement economy. productive capacity would also improve policy market liberalisation, great investment infrastructure education, market-driven industrial policy. structural rigidity labour market must eliminate order decrease disincentive effect term labour supply work ethic. a labour market policy intend increase skills, consequently employability individuals, also desirable. conclusion this (cid:147)grey cloud(cid:148) horizon, therefore, appear silver line form appropriate policy response would effectively enhance welfare populations. moreover, secretary-general unite nations, kofi annan, said: (cid:147)trees grow strong years, river wider. likewise, age, human be gain immeasurable depth breadth experience wisdom. that old person respect revered; utilize rich resource society are.(cid:148) the wealth skill experience old people bring workplace, public life family generally recognized. technological advance new way organize society put good use increase participation old people work make appropriate socio-economic changes. bi review 29/2003 1 lars heikensten: the riksbank euro speech mr lars heikensten, governor sverige riksbank, society international treasurer convention, stockholm, 17 june 2003. * * * let begin thank invitation come speak subject emu. approximately three month remain 14 september swedish people vote whether participate monetary union. in event (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote, sweden enter monetary union 2006 introduce euro currency. the right determination interest rate level transfer european central bank (the ecb). on hand, (cid:147)no(cid:148) vote would generally imply (cid:147)business usual(cid:148) riksbank. today, i speak implication riksbank operation event (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote referendum. i begin speak preparatory phase, is, 14 september 1 january 2006, time preparation conduct swedish economy changeover euro, krona join exchange rate mechanism, erm2. subsequently, i talk issue monetary policy conduct ecb point difference well similarity conduct today. thereafter, i touch upon effect changeover work financial stability. finally, i mention number issue concern role riksbank event entry monetary union implication operations. but i go issue i would like emphasise number points. this campaign speech. in 1994 1997, riksbank adopt position favour sweden join monetary union inception. the general council riksbank opinion advantage participation outweigh disadvantages. however, executive board riksbank decide take position issue. we interpret role provider factual information make easy swedish people form opinion matter. have say that, nothing prevent individual member executive board express personal opinion issue. we do that. i favour swedish participation monetary union. the preparation should majority swedish vote (cid:147)yes(cid:148) euro, work begin pave way swedish entry monetary union. the riksdag expect autumn make formal decision enable sweden practice become member monetary union. at time, necessary legal practical adaptation precondition participation prepare decide upon eu(cid:146)s finance minister within scope ecofin council take final decision. if referendum result (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote, riksbank require help ensure entry monetary union proceed stable, smooth manner. since middle 1990s, riksbank collaborate financial sector via sif group - consultation information financial sector - view ascertain adaptation measure necessary ahead potential swedish changeover euro long measure would take implement. the aim make time swedish riksdag decision favour participation entry short possible. the swedish government recommend sweden, event (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote, strive enter monetary union 1 january 2006, carry direct changeover (cid:147)big bang(cid:148). the switch-over electronic transaction society would make simultaneously cash changeover. this proposal welcome financial sector, good chance therefore smooth, efficient changeover euro begin 2006. for riksbank, changeover euro would course major project. the practical preparation would include ensure production new banknote coins, well replacement old ones. the latter would entail considerable logistical operation. for example, couple hundred large lorry would require simply deliver necessary coin time 2 bi review 29/2003 introduction. but that. computer system would need converted, least riksbank, also many area society. the riksbank would also expend lot effort provide information general public implication changeover. in addition, would number change operations, i return later. participation erm2 one important question would become relevant preparatory phase best ensure exchange rate stability euro within scope exchange rate mechanism erm2, successor erm system. in regard, may reason say something history. the riksbank previously, mainly year 1995-1997, consider issue erm participation possibility combine inflation target policy conduct number years. during time, riksbank legally responsible exchange rate regime, reason therefore consider erm participation quite simply prevent regime float exchange rate constitute formal obstacle swedish participation monetary union, event become possibility. when government decide insufficient popular support swedish participation monetary union, question change exchange rate regime dropped. in connection riksbank make formally independent 1999, new legislation exchange rate policy also introduced. nowadays, government decide upon issue exchange rate regime, although riksbank determine implemented. in words, government would decide whether krona join exchange rate mechanism erm2. follow that, ministry finance riksbank would decide rate krona euro ass consistent stable development economy. there good reason agree upon common line action. this hold discussion already among toplevel official appropriate line reasoning, result produce different estimation methods, etc. if reach agreement, likely difficult hold effective discussion european partners. a decision participation erm2 central rate fluctuation band krona join would take common accord finance minister euro area member states, ecb, central bank governor finance minister applicant country erm2 countries, i.e. denmark present. in practice, decision would precede contact representative ministry finance riksbank well colleague number euro area member state denmark. the first official step negotiation would take within framework eu(cid:146)s economic financial committee (efc). only committee fail reach agreement would direct negotiation concern central bank governor finance minister take place. then, irrevocable conversion rate euro determine connection entry monetary union, would decide unanimously ecofin council member euro area member state sweden. central rate erm2 the central rate krona/euro exchange rate criterion exchange rate stability would evaluate prior entry monetary union. it natural seek ensure central rate set level also become conversion rate swedish krona monetary union. generally, also norm; couple case central rate change two year precede entry monetary union. it important point possible exactly determine (cid:147)best(cid:148) central rate irrevocable conversion rate. what may appear best value exchange rate economic climate today appropriate time new data economy received. a certain capacity adjustment therefore necessary within economy manage consequence alter circumstance fix exchange rate. with aid various models, describe conceivable development path exchange rate, give certain assumption economy develop respects. when perform kind forecasts, analysis usually carry term real exchange rate instead nominal rate. the real exchange rate nominal rate adjust bi review 29/2003 3 difference price level country question. the reason often interest perform analysis use real exchange rate important macroeconomic relationship theory base real instead nominal exchange rates. the real exchange rate relative price basket good different countries, thus reflect international competitiveness purchase power. in principle, suitable central rate krona could estimate produce forecast nominal krona/euro rate exact date erm2 membership expect begin. however, complicate existence several theory exchangerate determination uncertainty forecast themselves. nor model capable encapsulate relevant aspect could conceivably affect development exchange rate, would necessary complement modelbased analysis different kind expert assessments. this imply confine narrow interval conceivable central rates. in various situations, include december inflation report 2002, riksbank show forecast krona(cid:146)s real exchange rate euro accord number model assumption float nominal exchange rate future. forecast kind underline i(cid:146)ve said: forecast outcome highly dependent choose model application. common models, however, predict strengthen real exchange rate come years. accord models, strengthen due expect development number factor include relative gdp, sweden(cid:146)s relative net assets, term trade, relative demography, etc. when adjust forecast real exchange rate expect difference inflation sweden euro area, get similar development path nominal krona/euro rate. a difference inflation expect small, forecast strengthen real rate also reflect nominal rate. towards end forecast period, rate lie, accord assessment riksbank, within interval approximately 8.20 9 kronor per euro. the forecast rate end 2003, however, consist narrow interval, around 8.50 around 9 kronor per euro. consequently, sweden join erm2 around end year, kind estimate would advocate suitable central rate interval 8.50 around 9 kronor per euro. it note model imply expect strengthen real nominal term strengthen next year onward rather limited. when choose central rate, vital find rate vis-(cid:224)-vis euro consistent balance development swedish economy short long term. it important remember real exchange rate, i.e. relative price basket good sweden euro area member state would variable even introduce euro currency. but adjustment would occur relative rate price increases. a central rate overly weak would therefore provide stimulus swedish economy could lead high inflation participant country well unemployment late stage impact weak competitiveness make felt. with overly strong rate, risk instead low inflation countries, initially negative impact growth employment. this line reason also clearly demonstrate connection fiscal policy. a weak exchange rate require tight fiscal policy vice versa. in practice, possible base choice central conversion rate model estimate desirable longterm rate. it also important take account expect development come years. it interest either sweden involve country problem arise period swedish participation erm2. in respect, economic climate factor demand attention. previous experience also indicate negotiation central rate would influence rate prevail krona euro recent years. recent market assessment interval 8.50 9 kronor per euro, i mention earlier. monetary policy strategy erm2 if sweden join monetary union, responsibility ensure balance development economy would essentially lie government riksdag. there reason underline fact would already occur erm2 period, even shift responsibility 4 bi review 29/2003 stabilise economy monetary policy fiscal policy would gradual one. a effect economic policy exert time lag, something fiscal policy decisionmakers already considering. for riksbank, issue would define strategy monetary policy light boundary impose fiscal policy central rate conversion rate choose krona versus euro. essentially, question conduct monetary policy way would make condition favourable possible ensure attainment price stability target objective hold exchange rate close central rate. this pre-requisite meet entry requirements, convergence criteria, monetary union. from perspective, interest forecast development exchange rate inflation indicate relatively stable development variable expect come years. in erm2, riksbank would still control repo rate. give boundary establish fiscal policy particular, set aim ensure price stability, case today. normally, constitute problem regard exchange rate. erm2 provide considerable scope target monetary policy price stability. this apply course normal band width –15 per cent, would also apply narrow band –2.25 per cent, european commission use evaluations. just like today, therefore reason continue publish inflation report hold regular monetary policy meetings. swedish experience recent decade fix exchange-rate regime have, know, entirely positive. the event 1992 still fresh memories. but lot happen past ten years. our economic policy become credible successful. in recent years, follow principle euro area characterise effort achieve price stability sound public finances. participation erm2 would change stance objective policy course. tension stem lack competitiveness swedish economy also unlikely; rate set partly ensure reasonable level competitiveness, inflation come year expect le line euro area. moreover, process countries(cid:146) entry monetary union smooth spite fact circumstance many case le favourable time sweden today. for instance, uncertainty surround implementation third stage introduction euro gone. in light this, reason concern participation erm2. the objective keep exchange rate stable close central rate would facilitate fact central rate choose erm2, i mention earlier, expect conversion rate vis-(cid:224)-vis euro know date future. this absolutely crucial difference compare system fix exchange rate previously adhere sweden. if exchange rate nevertheless unexpectedly move extent consider inappropriate, intervention could make foreign exchange market. such intervention would certain potency due fact would involve purchase sale currency trade price time. to clarify this, intervention could make form future contract maturity date beyond date entry. the single monetary policy entry monetary union would imply sweden become part euro area european central bank assume responsibility monetary policy. target strategy both riksbank ecb task maintain price stability and, extent conflict price stability target, promote balance development economic activities. the riksbank(cid:146)s inflation target entail keep annual inflation measure consumer price index, cpi, 2 per cent tolerance deviation 1 percentage point upwards downwards. give monetary policy exert impact economy time lag, work base practice ensure future expect inflation 2 per cent. our underlie assumption time lag policy mainly one two years. however, sometimes reason refrain achieve target define way. this may case inflation affect transitory effects, quickly rise fall energy price change indirect tax bi review 29/2003 5 mortgage interest expenditure. for reason, riksbank also make use measure inflation exclude effects. inflation measure index und1x one example. moreover, may reason shock bring inflation back target somewhat long term. this enable u avoid overly negative implication production employment. the ecb measure price stability year-on-year increase consumer price below, close to, 2 procent. the target relate inflation measure harmonise index consumer prices, hicp. the idea reach goal medium term, imply ecb also disregard transitory effect inflation. consequently, ecb(cid:146)s definition similar own. there differences, however. one ecb(cid:146)s target define term hicp. the consumption basket hicp narrow cpi due fact area statistic yet harmonise excluded. the difference hicp different measure normally use riksbank generally rather small. another difference target level. the riksbank work definite central target surround symmetrical interval. previously, ecb(cid:146)s target inflation 2 per cent. it ecb govern council(cid:146)s evaluation monetary policy strategy may year target keep inflation close 2 per cent specified. with this, ecb become precise definition. compare riksbank, difference target level small make great difference practice. the significant difference target definition ecb(cid:146)s target relate inflation euro area whole, riksbank(cid:146)s target apply course sweden only. the ecb(cid:146)s policy imply therefore rate inflation individual member state high low 2 per cent without constitute neglect ecb(cid:146)s target. this also case reality, show clearly inflation outcome measured. the apply sweden small scale; inflation different norrbotten sk(cid:229)ne. when formulate monetary policy, ecb attache special importance monetary aggregate credit variables. a reference value annual increase monetary aggregate set, currently amount 4.5 per cent. in general, however, interest rate adjustment implement ecb justify basis development monetary aggregate. this clear several occasion recent years, refi rate low spite fact rate increase monetary aggregate clearly exceed reference value. the evaluation strategy may also result measure monetary aggregate give role primarily indicator future inflation. naturally, riksbank also follow monetary aggregate credit variables, even assign special significance assess inflation. therefore, formulation policy nowadays also quite similar respect well. finally, allow point despite similarity formulation policy, rule price wage increase sweden may sometimes high low. the main reason ecb(cid:146)s policy target average price increase euro area whole. partly result this, reason discus role fiscal policy function labour market event introduction euro sweden. it particularly important fiscal policy conduct way ensure reserve available economic decline institutional condition create facilitate necessary decision tight fiscal policy take time. decision-making communication in event participation monetary union, riksbank governor would become member ecb govern council, high decision-making body european central bank. i would then, like member govern council, opportunity say interest rate level i believe best take account development entire euro area. i would member govern council personal capacity, i.e. i would permit seek receive instruction individual institutions. one issue subject much discussion vote modality govern council. initially, riksbank governor would always right vote interest rate decisions. this would change future, however. once number member state euro area exceed 15, new decision-making arrangement enter force. the member state divide group accord size, vote right rotate participant 6 bi review 29/2003 respective groups. for sweden, long-term implication central bank governor, current new eu member state participate monetary union, would able vote approximately 60 per cent decisions. the central bank governor large country like germany, hand, around nine time many inhabitants, would able vote 80 per cent meetings. however, central bank governor would right attendance expression meetings. from swedish perspective, appear rather advantageous solution opinion. the ability exert influence formulation policy important course, particularly democratic point view. but simply question vote rights, impression one get sometimes listen debate. firstly, important remember central bank governor must act interest entire euro area set interest rates. in words, must give priority national interests. thus far, vote hold ecb govern council; rather, monetary policy determine consensus. in addition, central bank governor right attendance, even new proposal, therefore involve discussion stance policy. my experience other, similar discussion central bank sphere solid, wellfounded argument weigh heavily and, practice, play important role size country possibility press vote button. what i know ecb govern council work monetary policy discussion support viewpoint. for part, i believe much attention pay vote modalities. other factor particularly important ensure effective monetary policy. personally, i would emphasise internal discussion processes, i believe vital. these high quality transparent, provide scope different decision-makers become involve equal terms. clarity transparency also important externally, ensure precise meaningful criticism, turn improve speed internal think processes. also respects, number similarity riksbank ecb. both institution publish assessment inflation prospects, hold press conference connection interest rate decision justify explain formulation policy various political bodies. in addition, gradual evolution intellectual think take place within riksbank ecb. it likely bring u close together. the significant differences, opinion, relate clarity assessments, riksbank country work explicit figurebased target publish inflation report clearer. the riksbank also internal preparation process broad participation. finally, publish minute executive board meet opinion member evident. the latter issue different (cid:147)charge(cid:148) european level since risk genuinely single monetary policy would undermine individual position make public. monetary union financial stability sweden the riksbank task maintain price stability also promote safe efficient payment system. in light this, allow also say something potential implication entry monetary union perspective. the financial market europe develop rapidly past decade, partly result fact freedom trade financial service fundamental cooperation eu. competition national bank hardened. the single currency contribute evolution far good capital market outside banks, increase competition further. in several large european countries, process structural transformation bank system underway, much like experience sweden connection bank crisis begin 1990s. when competition grow stiffer, course pose threat stability, especially bank accustom competition also weakly capitalised. in sweden, bank operate competitive environment since deregulation 1980s force process considerable rationalisation. capitalisation also satisfactory. there reason believe swedish bank would able take advantage le expensive borrow condition single currency market would able spread risk great number counterparties, would positive stability. in long run, banks(cid:146) customer may find easy come contact european banks. this important aspect increase bi review 29/2003 7 competition, although wise lender nevertheless respect (cid:147)church tower(cid:148) principle, namely lend know well - see local church tower. i believe single currency would increase credit risk banks. if monetary union long run result integrate market financial services, current swedish bank would likely rather small participant market, bank would le important effective function payment system. their significance financial stability would decrease need public intervention safeguard stability financial system would therefore also reduced. the reason quite simply effect one number participant fail would big system support european level large number participants, oppose dependent small number participants, swedish system today. a advance security market would also serve buffer, borrower savers. this would make bank le systemically important. all all, i believe swedish bank well equip face stiff competition effect monetary union stability financial system would primarily positive. the security markets, stock exchange system clear settlement transactions, presently undergo rapid development europe. it likely principal force drive development technological advance enable cost savings, sweden able take part whether use kronor euro. however, trade markets, trade stock exchange course facilitate single currency. a regard system large-value interbank payment - real-time system gross payment know rix sweden manage riksbank - monetary union would involve major changes. it likely would separate system payment membership, way would connect new european system (target2). there would considerable efficiency gain make here. however, stability aspect must give attention. the operational risk would increase great number become dependent one big system. with regard riksbank, direct effect participation monetary union work financial stability would particularly large. even sweden join monetary union, riksbank, present rules, would responsible make decision provide emergency liquidity assistance swedish institutions. furthermore, vulnerability bank payment system would change overnight would continue largely national nature, long european bank payment system become genuinely integrated. the oversight management crisis would therefore carry national authorities. the big difference international cooperation would become even important. in long term, bank security market become increasingly integrated, new interest issue would arise best carry international supervision oversight. in discussion, sweden join monetary union, voice would carry great weight member ecb govern council cooperation finance ministers. this also important ability influence integration general proceed thereby also financial sector(cid:146)s condition sweden. the role riksbank if sweden join monetary union, riksbank would become part big whole, eurosystem. this mean riksbank(cid:146)s task would disappear, however, claim time one predecessor lars wohlin. the majority riksbank(cid:146)s task would remain relatively unaffected participation. a i mentioned, apply work financial stability, would essentially remain national responsibility foreseeable future. the riksbank(cid:146)s operational task monetary policy transactions, management riksbank(cid:146)s assets, collection statistics, management banknote coin various administrative task would also remain. i also object claim riksbank would become branch office ecb. in actual fact, national central bank eurosystem ecb. if sweden join eurosystem, would become member board able influence system whole develop future. that hardly opportunity available local office organisations. in addition, eurosystem decentralise system, vast majority task carry 8 bi review 29/2003 national central banks. many task also perform national level completely outside framework eurosystem. the main change sweden participate monetary union would decision interest rate level sweden would take ecb govern council instead executive board riksbank. the decisive factor set rate would inflation prospect euro area whole. a riksbank governor, i would become member ecb govern council take part monetary policy decision there. naturally, would affect work monetary policy. prior take interest rate decisions, ecb perform assessment inflation prospect small member state sweden, would remain responsibility. in light this, natural continue publish assessment swedish economy couple time per year. in way, would able make contribution economic policy debate sweden. these assessment would also important motivate, explain justify single monetary policy sweden. a part eurosystem, riksbank would participate comprehensive analysis activity ecb. if influence process, important perform good analysis tailor essential, relevant issue prior ecb(cid:146)s meetings. this point certain shift focus day-to-day forecast activity in-depth analysis also relevance policy. one consequence riksbank long set interest rate level sweden would undoubtedly decrease level attention pay activity medium elsewhere. this would primarily direct effect member executive board something worry me. however, could also affect ability attract employees. certain category employee may long consider u excite workplace. for others, opposite may case, particularly want work international environment. transparency guide principle riksbank many years. should sweden decide join monetary union, riksbank would continue transparent institution. in respects, action would naturally restrict common regulation euro area. to extent perceive problem operation obstacle transparency safeguard, would course seek effect change. conclude remark approximately three month remain 14 september, swedish people say (cid:147)yes(cid:148) (cid:147)no(cid:148) euro referendum. in light this, i address issue today directly relevant riksbank(cid:146)s operation preparatory work carry event (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote. during preparatory phase, sweden may - government decide - join erm2. we well prepare this, economy step euro area. membership erm2, country way monetary union, different system fix exchange rate sweden previously participated. this partly due fact central rate choose expect become conversion rate entry emu. this would reduce risk uncertainty krona(cid:146)s development. a member erm2, would still scope riksbank promote price stability, although scope would diminish close entry come. responsibility stabilise economy would gradually shift fiscal policy. if sweden join monetary union, interest rate level would set ecb. the difference exist riksbank(cid:146)s ecb(cid:146)s work method exaggerated. with ecb(cid:146)s late clarifications, become even obvious. but regard internal preparation processes, clarity transparency, number difference remain. if referendum result (cid:147)yes(cid:148) euro, i talk active part issue member ecb govern council. the riksbank also work financial stability. in area, institutional change would great result sweden join monetary union. in long term, however, financial system europe would reshaped. it important insight influence process order able good job riksbank also able contribute create best possible condition swedish financial sector. bi review 29/2003 9 finally, i mention riksbank(cid:146)s activity potential entry monetary union. medium interest riksbank would certainly diminish somewhat long set repo rate. however, work task operation would affect much. most important would change area monetary policy. our perspective would become european, would also important part domestic debate economic policy. in conclusion, allow note (cid:147)no(cid:148) euro would entail major change riksbank(cid:146)s day-to-day business. i expect would continue conduct operation much way before. there risk, however, significance international arena would diminish further. bi review 29/2003 1 toshihiko fukui: challenge monetary policy japan speech mr toshihiko fukui, governor bank japan, spring meet japan society monetary economics, occasion 60th anniversary, tokyo, 1 june 2003. * * * introduction i honor opportunity today address distinguish audience. member esteem society generous enough provide u bank opinion fruit researches, turn take consideration examine policy measure angles. i like, therefore, outset speech, express sincere gratitude continue stimulate intellectual debate way. the society bank long history good communication, indeed record archive, first example speech give keizo shibusawa, deputy governor bank, inaugural meet society june 1943. the meet hold incidentally year bank japan law 1942, model law govern reichsbank, central bank germany, become effective wartime legislation. in speech, deputy governor shibusawa emphasize principle maintain value currency formulate monetary policy, state that, although demand policy give time situation may exert influence, fundamental principle change. while i guess actually deputy governor shibusawa(cid:146)s mind time make statement, understand that, time war produce upheaval economic financial environment, wish remind listener importance orthodox central banking. at time, i believe wish convey sincere hope society(cid:146)s member would continue analyze fundamental currency system, make full use expertise. another example may find speech give 40th anniversary meet society 1983, japanese economy peak postwar prosperity. discuss mandate bank japan, governor haruo mayekawa state that, conduct monetary policy, high priority naturally place upon stability prices. he conclude speech observe formulation execution successful policy could achieve policy measure employ solid theoretical foundation. ten year ago june, i was, executive director bank, invite 50th anniversary meet society present speech title (cid:147)missions responsibility central bank contemporary context.(cid:148) at time, economy deteriorate follow burst asset price bubble, look back, i prepare speech today(cid:146)s occasion, path tread japan(cid:146)s economy last decade, i impress fact surround environment become much severe, although basic mandate central bank, maintain stability prices, change least. even restrict attention area monetary policy, undoubtedly number change worthy note. the first important change take place financial environment, substantial decline interest rate notable. in fact, level interest rate already low decade ago, economy continue deteriorate follow burst asset price bubble, weak balance sheet corporate financial sector suggest deep adjustment inevitable. in circumstances, bank take series monetary ease measures, official discount rate decline unprecedented level 1.75 percent end 1993. the period saw moderate decline overnight call rate range 2.0-2.5 percent 3.5-4.0 percent. at time official discount rate 1.75 percent consider extremely low indeed low level rate since bank begin operation 1882, period include financial crisis 1927 fiscal expansion policy adopt finance minister korekiyo takahashi 1930s. in retrospect, however, enviable amount room leave interest rate reductions, hence interest rate useful policy tools. 2 bi review 29/2003 recently, contrast, overnight call rate almost money market rate decline level close zero percent. moreover, since spring 2001, bank move territory unexplored central bank history implement quantitative ease interest rate already zero bound. i state inaugural press conference central bank conduct monetary policy little room leave interest rate reduction like boxer fight hand tie behind back. even hand tied, bank give fight indeed best can. it was, however, beyond anyone(cid:146)s imagination 1993 bank would fight deflation constraint. the second major change concern revision bank japan law. a sense previous bank japan law quite tune current change characterize world(cid:146)s central bank system financial market would doubt already exist 1993, yet advance stage make specific proposal revision law. the situation change rapidly, four year later, 1997, revise bank japan law enacted, effect since april 1998. the focus revision great independence bank conduct monetary policy call improve transparency. this turn lead significant reorganization policy board, bank make monetary policy decision independently, bank mark new start completely new govern structure. the transparency bank(cid:146)s policy conduct also improve publication minute every monetary policy meet (mpm) bank(cid:146)s policy board. any visitor bank(cid:146)s web site see that, addition minutes, significant amount information release include report governor(cid:146)s press conferences, text speech give senior officials, abundance research material detail background policy decisions. the third recent change concern increase global interest monetary policy within economy suffer deflationary trends. in 1993, spite similar background situation, is, strong downside risk world economy consistently fall inflation rates, seem particular concern anywhere world decline inflation rate per se. a quick check keywords appear article major newspaper time reveal people(cid:146)s attention overwhelmingly focus inflation rather deflation. recently, however, disinflation progressed, interest rate fall across world. an international comparison level money market rate reveal several country whose current rate lie within 0-1.0 percent bracket, particular switzerland 0.2 percent singapore 0.5-0.6 percent. in unite states, policy interest rate currently stand 1.25 percent, which, make direct comparison, level see japan begin 1995. an increase number people interest deflation. look back development last decade, i strike anew immensely important central bank gain reliable insight outlook economy. at time, clearly cannot surprise fact that, passage time, change take place debate surround monetary policy. we central bank must continue make effort gain new insight learn new ideas, allow fall captive whatever mindset dominant particular point time. i feel acutely importance interaction academic world, cutting-edge research financial economic theory fundamental efforts. since i assume office governor march year, indeed before, i opportunity listen wide range advice, learn much opinion voice bank forward member society also academic home abroad. at time, i afraid i must admit feel certain degree frustration, light long year experience central banker, i listen opinions. i cannot help feel still significant progress make establish creative process whereby bank first provide academic sufficient information issue facing, work together base information search fresh policy solutions. bi review 29/2003 3 we fortunate among current nine member policy board three member spend number year senior academic positions. in addition, increase number former bank staff currently work academic institution devote effort bridge gap theory practical policy. with help, expect able extend link academic world, thus gain benefit academics(cid:146) advice also contribute research share practical experiences. this somewhat protract introduction. my aim today, however, share you, frankly possible, current think regard conduct monetary policy, i hope interest you. i hope also remark play part strengthen constructive relationship already exist academic central bank. i. function quantitative ease framework first, i would like briefly explain basic framework underlie current monetary policy describe monetary policy measure implement within framework. the current framework adopt call quantitative ease introduce march 19, 2001. it three main features. i explain implication point contemporary context possible. a. adoption quantitative indicator money market operation the first feature quantitative ease framework change operate target money market operation uncollateralized overnight call rate outstanding balance current account deposit bank. whether possible enhance monetary ease effect even short-term interest rate reach zero bind major issue continue attract debate. still, quite natural central bank pay attention amount liquidity provision expect effect increase liquidity provision even short-term interest rate fall zero percent, rather reason reach zero bound. when quantitative ease framework introduce march 2001, target outstanding balance current account deposit bank 5 trillion yen, exceed total reserve requirement time slightly le 1 trillion yen. when i take office governor, target range outstanding balance already set (cid:147)around 17 22 trillion yen,(cid:148) bank since steadily raise it. at mpm april 30, bank raise range 5 trillion yen (cid:147)around 22 27 trillion yen,(cid:148) (cid:147)around 27 30 trillion yen(cid:148) mpm may 20. a result, outstanding balance increase sixfold course last two years. the bank(cid:146)s repeat raise target outstanding balance decide view economic outlook financial market situation. a mention bank(cid:146)s (cid:147)outlook risk assessment economy prices,(cid:148) release april, monetary ease measure effectively block channel various shock induce liquidity concerns, thereby secure financial market stability, help prevent economy fall deflationary spiral. on hand, also point that, even though outstanding balance current account deposit increase considerably since introduction quantitative ease framework, bank(cid:146)s drastic quantitative ease quite strong enough boost economy prices. why so? it may adjustment pressure economy was, is, still quite strong. however, one effect expect introduction quantitative ease so-called (cid:147)portfolio rebalancing effect.(cid:148) the bank think that, even marginal value liquidity service become zero, people would start rebalance portfolio invest asset high marginal value whether real financial assets, bank increase provision liquidity. the aim process thus generate positive economic momentum, acting, example, push asset prices. so far, however, effect widely observed. it might also fair touch upon issue decline function financial markets, especially money market, since introduction quantitative ease framework. with zero interest rates, money market participant le will invest fund market, return transaction sufficient cover trade costs. due bank(cid:146)s ample provision liquidity, sharp decrease trade volume among 4 bi review 29/2003 market participants, exception trade carry bank. a result, market participant become concern whether able raise fund market smoothly future even offer high interest rates. ironically, decline function money market increase precautionary demand financial institution increase current account deposit bank. at time introduction quantitative ease framework, doubt whether bank would able provide sufficient liquidity achieve target outstanding balance. in fact frequent case undersubscription, bid fall short bank(cid:146)s offers, bank(cid:146)s funds-supplying operations. however, undersubscription occur recently, bank able push substantial increase target outstanding balance current account deposits. the bank proceed monetary ease secure financial market stability, demand current account deposit increase due impair function market. a result, bank meet increase liquidity demand order secure market stability. this dilemma bank currently faces. all drastic policy measure negative side effects. the fundamental issue, therefore, whether side effect exist; rather, make effective use stimulative effect quantitative ease measure economy prices, give due consideration possible emergence excessive side effects. before move deal point depth, i would like comment remain two feature quantitative ease framework. b. increase bank(cid:146)s outright purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) the second feature quantitative ease framework decision increase bank(cid:146)s outright purchase jgbs deem necessary smooth provision fund meet target balance current account deposit bank. at time, ceiling bank(cid:146)s outright purchase jgbs prevent amount jgbs hold bank exceed outstanding amount banknote issued. with interest rate finance bill (fbs) treasury bill (tbs) close zero, emerge situation holder fbs tb similar hold equivalent amount current account deposit bank. for reason, likely demand hold current account deposit sell fbs tb become saturated. realize this, bank decide secure smooth provision liquidity purchase jgbs. the effect increase purchase jgbs raise total purchase bank 1.2 trillion yen per month, 400 billion yen march 2001. a result, outstanding amount jgbs purchase bank present equivalent roughly 60 percent monetary base. the bank(cid:146)s purchase jgbs indeed contribute smooth implementation quantitative easing. however, long-term interest rate declining, even jgbs almost become substitute current account deposit bank. at present, ten-year jgbs fall slightly 0.5 percent even 30-year jgbs 1.0 percent. the average maturity newly issue jgbs japan currently five years. the fact yield five-year jgbs range 0.1 0.2 percent indicate government already raise fund interest rate virtually zero percent. thus, bank(cid:146)s execution market operation involve exchange jgbs current account deposit bank become equivalent exchange ten 1,000 yen note one 10,000 yen note. in opposition view, argument that, long long-term interest rate fact zero percent, still difference current account deposit bank jgbs. the corollary market operation involve exchange jgbs current account deposit indeed meaningful, massive large-scale purchase jgbs bank would effective. there also argument inappropriate allow long-term interest rate decline close zero percent. accord view, bank enhance effect quantitative ease merely increase quantity also introduce qualitative improvement quantitative ease measure purchase type assets. c. policy commitment base consumer price index (cpi) the third feature quantitative ease framework bank(cid:146)s explicit commitment base year-on-year growth rate cpi: namely bank maintain current framework bi review 29/2003 5 money market operation cpi (excluding fresh food, nationwide basis) record year-on-year increase zero percent sustainable basis. the idea first feature, i already explained, achieve increase bank(cid:146)s provision liquidity even short-term interest rate reach zero bound. the idea third feature achieve ease effect bank(cid:146)s commitment keep short-term rate low level well future. in way, even short-term rate come low bound, bank still (cid:147)borrow(cid:148) effect future low rates. thus, fundamental aim third feature low longer-term interest rate across board (cid:147)borrowing(cid:148) future monetary ease commitment. this policy commitment show bank(cid:146)s determination put stop price decline bind future monetary policy actual inflation rate. however, misunderstand inflation targeting. i fully aware view bank adopt inflation target instead current commitment. however, note that, sense, commitment significant implication go beyond standard inflation targeting. in standard inflation target regime, central bank raise policy interest rate expect inflation rate rise target inflation rate, even actual inflation rate considerably target inflation rate. give people(cid:146)s expectation regard inflation rate vary greatly, may inevitable even slight change price trigger speculation early stage future monetary policy. in contrast, bank(cid:146)s policy commitment state bank continue implement drastic quantitative ease year-on-year change cpi, is, change actual prices, become positive. in words, policy commitment mean that, unless year-on-year change cpi become positive sustainable basis, bank continue implement drastic monetary ease measure even economy start improve inflationary expectation emerging. this thus extremely strong policy commitment bank implicitly (cid:147)borrowing(cid:148) effect future monetary easing. the bank(cid:146)s strong policy commitment, (cid:147)borrowed(cid:148) effect low future interest rate keep long-term interest rate stable low levels, say succeed keep real interest rate low enough prevent economy, suffer deflation, fall deflationary spiral. however, potential growth rate economy marginal productivity capital declined, cause firm revise downward forecast gdp growth rate remain cautious investing. in accordance relationship natural market interest rate define knut wicksell, natural interest rate quite low, market interest rate continue high relative natural interest rate, thus seem fail boost economic activity. thus, still remain many issue must resolve current framework quantitative ease become effective. it also true, i mention earlier, monetary ease measure effectively block channel various shock induce liquidity concerns, thereby secure financial market stability, contribute prevent economy fall deflationary spiral. the effect quantitative ease measure therefore underestimated. in 1997-98, financial crisis asia failure large japanese financial institution trigger concern among financial institution availability liquidity, result, sharp credit contraction economy deteriorate rapidly. in contrast, although factor cause uncertainty japanese financial system, terrorist attack unite states, military action iraq, decline japanese stock prices, credit contraction stem liquidity concern occur since introduction quantitative ease framework. and thus, deterioration economy contraction might cause avoided. a describe above, even short-term interest rate reach zero bound, bank throw hand defeat rather continue make effort provide ample liquidity (cid:147)borrowing(cid:148) effect future monetary easing. at present, japanese financial institution still process improve soundness, globalization economy, progress it, extremely rapidly age society, equally rapidly decline birthrate, economy face major structural changes. the people entire country struggle find way overcome difficulty unprecedented process transition. in situation, natural public high expectation country(cid:146)s 6 bi review 29/2003 central bank. in order meet expectations, i adamant determination duck challenges, put knowledge experience overcome difficulties. ii. issue improvement monetary policy in order improve monetary policy, i think important address various issue relate monetary policy discus thoroughly. some issue may fall within scope conventional economic analysis may thus deal use appropriate analytical tools. other issues, define purview central bank address position within democratic society, may however fall outside scope conventional economic analysis. keep point mind, i would like elaborate follow issue need clarify regard bank(cid:146)s effort improve current quantitative ease framework. currently, variety view hold people outside bank request monetary ease measures. some view follows. one view hold that, effect quantitative ease economy price fairly strong, bank increase provision liquidity significantly. this view recommend that, so, bank consider option purchase financial asset whose risk profile differ jgbs, not, normal circumstances, object central bank purchases. another view propose bank seek exert strong pressure public expectation fundamentally change structure current policy commitments. a. change structure policy commitment i would like start section discuss possible change structure bank(cid:146)s policy commitments. here, clearly, focus attention must whether adopt inflation targeting. a i already mentioned, comparison current policy commitments, one problem adopt inflation target follows. assume target establish (for example, 2 percent), expect inflation rate rise target bank start tighten early stage, actual inflation rate likely go beyond target. since bank(cid:146)s current policy commitment assume tighten early stage, actually run risk direction great inflation case standard inflation targeting. therefore, follow issue become important: whether truly desirable particular juncture exchange current policy commitment one might require early forceful tighten monetary policy set target; whether bank allow temporary overshoot inflation rate; either situation, bank would able restabilize expect inflation rate. when set inflation target, either certain range level inflation rate, bank would aim achieve target within specify period, although would allowance slippage. clearly prerequisite policy convince public bank least reasonably, absolutely, confident disposal policy tool necessary achieve goal. in regard, maintain bank need boldly commit take unconventional policy measure necessary achieve inflation target. indeed, economist seem form critical view bank(cid:146)s skepticism effectiveness monetary policy prevent hammer forceful commitment potent influence public(cid:146)s expectations. however, expectation economy would return sustainable growth path leave unfulfilled often since burst asset price bubble, people japan naive trust unconditionally mere announcement inflation target policy bank; indeed would rest economy respond take immediate turn better. unless japan(cid:146)s economy benefit positive external factor surge foreign demand, policy announcement bank aim influence public expectation become effective bank successfully demonstrate effective transmission mechanism exist bank(cid:146)s policy actual stimulative effect economic growth. therefore, important bank pursue monetary easing, also devise implement variety policy measure contribute directly improve transmission mechanism. the bank fully aware inflation target enjoy relatively wide support among academics, many central bank adopt inflation target one kind another. it become one bi review 29/2003 7 important policy tool central bank enhance transparency. in sense, i intention flatly deny concept behind policy measure relate inflation targeting. i would like examine, process review make full use monetary ease policy future, whether reorganize policy framework bank, whether room introduce tool inflation target within framework. i cannot predict honestly result produce wide-ranging discussion, when. b. additional measure encourage effect monetary ease permeate economy the fundamental policy issue confront bank exactly order encourage effect monetary ease permeate economy. the bank(cid:146)s quantitative ease policy, provide ample liquidity form current account balance bank, aim improve overall financial environment firm households, thus stimulate economy. if current quantitative ease strong effect economy, interpret follows. the transmission mechanism bank(cid:146)s ample provision liquidity stimulative effect firm household function properly. to put another way, liquidity provide bank circulate within financial sector flow it, stimulative effect low interest rate work way permeate economy. this phenomenon choke block channel finance closely relate fact financial institutions(cid:146) credit intermediary function deteriorate due nonperforming-loan problem. the important issue make effect monetary ease permeate economy actively support financial institutions(cid:146) effort reestablish soundness. at time, bank belief necessary also apply second, parallel policy front, exercise ingenuity devise measure area money market operation corporate financing. a aware, mpm hold early april 2003 bank decide start examine new scheme promote smooth corporate finance nurture asset-backed security (abss) market. the bank(cid:146)s initiative regard unprecedented sense purchase abss, private debts, outright thus step realm credit risk. abs posse number advantageous characteristics. by pool risks, act reduce overall level credit risk, relative sum individual risks. in addition, restructure overall risk multiple layer represent different degree risk, also attract investor variety different risk preferences. indeed, rationale behind bank(cid:146)s decision examine feasibility ab purchase follows. give current situation financial institution perform credit intermediation function imperfectly, bank succeed make use feature produce process financial innovation, able promote interaction market-based finance bank lending. and thus contribute establish new channel smooth corporate finance firms, especially small medium-sized firms. some people argue bank restrict purchase abs also boldly purchase wide range asset relate stock real estate, break traditional framework. the bank, course, always ready give serious consideration measure might help bring economy back sustainable growth path. have say this, i would therefore like discus possible perspective criterion important consider kind asset bank purchase. the first criterion, may overlap somewhat i mention earlier, whether bank(cid:146)s purchase particular type asset help monetary ease effect permeate real economy; whether purchase offer actual improvement exist transmission mechanism. the second criterion relate whether bank(cid:146)s purchase might distort market mechanism. if bank(cid:146)s decision take credit risk, describe above, end distort market evaluation price weaken reflection risk contain credit spreads, supply credit increase effectiveness monetary ease suffer result. if bank dare take risk purchase new type assets, desirable bank(cid:146)s initiative become catalyst enhance development market. 8 bi review 29/2003 the background seek public comment examine possible purchase abs bank felt important find way participate market bank(cid:146)s initiative distort price-discovery function market also enhance development market. now receive many valuable comment market participants, work concrete plan scheme, refer comments. c. role capital central bank i discuss bank may expose credit risk implement new measure start ab purchases. the corollary step possibility bank might incur capital loss. give current severe economic financial situation, bank start purchase stock hold banks, determine take measures, even highly risky one unthinkable conventional conditions, absolutely necessary fulfil mandate. at time, set principle limit bank(cid:146)s risk exposure level impair bank(cid:146)s financial soundness. the bank give due consideration principle decide stock-purchasing plan, also apply principle draw concrete plan framework ab purchases, particularly assess risks. i would like consider detail subject central bank(cid:146)s financial soundness, particularly role capital. i aware fully understand, economic perspective, central bank concern soundness capital base. it is, all, reasonable assume that, unlike ordinary commercial banks, central bank continue operation avoid bankruptcy, even face insolvency, since authority issue banknotes. so explain observation consistently fact central bank exert maintain substantial capital holdings? also, explain case develop country country(cid:146)s central bank fall excessive debt grand scale, capital position properly restored, ability conduct monetary policy greatly damage practice, even though phenomenon predict theory? the case actual behavior central bank indicate central banks(cid:146) concern soundness capital base might ground purely economic theory may motivate rather political economic instinct central bankers. in words, restriction (cid:147)the central bank take risk consistent level self-imposed capital base(cid:148) violated, boundary function central bank government may become difficult discern. consider case where, whatever reason, central bank(cid:146)s capital become depleted, bank require financial support government. the central bank might either run difficulty conduct policy business operation might cause view spread will, eventually become difficult maintain public confidence currency. this argument bring u fundamental issue central bank function democratic society. there two problem pertain central bank(cid:146)s significant risk-taking activity purchase risk-bearing assets. the first might potentially incur losses, burden would effectively transfer public reduction payment national treasury, or, worst-case scenario, injection public fund restore balance sheet central bank. the second problem purchases, depend central bank(cid:146)s selection assets, would inevitably affect allocation resource microeconomic level. both problem lead u question role central bank, whether approach territory fiscal policy. the basic principle underlie determination tax revenue spend democratic nation follows: expenditure carry fiscal policy, follow formal approval government budget parliament. if resource allocate outside market mechanism part economic policy, government take initiative, central bank. the purchase risk-bearing asset central bank therefore carefully plan conduct discipline. draw clear line issue difficult task. in practice, monetary policy cannot conduct great degree flexibility central bank purchase fbs tb bi review 29/2003 9 strict rule prevent take risk, would involve step territory fiscal policy. this reason feasible practice adopt many country whereby central bank reserve ability act flexibly within level risk consistent maintain adequate level capital relatively long term. if public allow central bank take certain level risk within context flexible monetary policy, would appropriate public support risk-taking behavior central bank restore capital base latter damage result take risks. in way, balance democracy central bank(cid:146)s flexibility conduct monetary policy could maintained. conclude remark when i attend society(cid:146)s meet ten year ago, i conclude remark cite famous statement john maynard keynes run follows: (cid:147)there subtler, sure mean overturn exist basis society debauch currency.(cid:148) i comment quotation (cid:147)these word often use describe evil inflation come find general acceptance. yet, i believe statement also understand connote stability financial system. i believe money truly capable function social economic lifeblood country value properly maintain monetary policy, also smooth function payment settlement system fully ensured.(cid:148) i still believe truth i said. i must add another aspect maintenance price stability require particular attention today. that necessity confront deflation, new enemy central bank must engage, i believe equal importance fight inflation. neither macroeconomics finance textbook yet manage provide practical solution problem relate deflation faced. on hand, late research unite state start produce useful theoretical analysis fundamental effect monetary fiscal policy zero interest rate constraint, one issue bank tackle last years. this area study eagerly await progress. i also believe bank(cid:146)s deflation-fighting experience add important chapter finance textbook 21st century. bi review 29/2003 1 david dodge: recent economic development conduct monetary policy speech mr david dodge, governor bank canada, metropolitan halifax chamber commerce, halifax, 18 june 2003. * * * good afternoon, thank invitation speak today. it(cid:146)s great back halifax, one canada(cid:146)s colourful port cities. it wonderful juxtaposition new old - halifax(cid:146)s modern focus rich maritime tradition - make city special. it(cid:146)s year since i last speak halifax, lot change since then. we(cid:146)ve witness extraordinary events, canada around world. on whole, canada(cid:146)s economy withstand turmoil quite well. the impact recent event yet clear. still, i try today outline economy evolve past year lay issue we(cid:146)ll assess prepare july monetary policy report update. watch condition demand pressure a bank canada set monetary policy, watch event affect economy, include global geopolitical, economic, financial conditions. we view keep domestic inflation near 2 per cent midpoint canada(cid:146)s inflation target range 1 3 per cent. a often said, deliver environment low, stable, predictable inflation best contribution monetary policy make strong, sustainable economy rise live standard canadians. such low-inflation environment also help keep economy near production potential time. to achieve goals, keep close eye factor influence demand production capacity - factor will, turn, influence inflation medium term. and adjust monetary policy keep future trend inflation near 2 per cent target midpoint. where we(cid:146)ve a i(cid:146)ve said, it(cid:146)s year since i last speak halifax. but place recent experience context, i go back bite - 11 september 2001 terrorist attack unite states. in wake terrible event, bank canada quickly aggressively cut policy interest rate shore confidence support domestic demand. this action, together early reduction policy interest rate, mean bank inject considerable stimulus economy. by spring 2002, evidence already start build demand recover quickly anticipated. so, even though demand pressure yet show prices, begin remove monetary stimulus. we raise key policy interest rate three time april july 2002, total three-quarters percentage point. by last autumn, inflation canada rise. but refrain raise interest rate time, judge pickup inflation mainly result one-off factor would reverse next year so. a well, considerable geopolitical financial uncertainty, which, combine global economic weakness, point restrain total demand canadian good services. through first quarter year, cpi inflation climb well 2 per cent target. much rise result high energy prices. we also saw mark increase measure core inflation, strip eight volatile item - include gasoline, heat oil, natural gas - cpi basket, well effect change indirect tax remain cpi components. the rise core inflation exacerbate increase automobile insurance premiums. but even allow unusual extraordinarily large increase insurance premiums, inflation well target. this suggest strong domestic demand put pressure production capacity. in environment, indicator short-term inflation expectation edge up, although longer-term expectation remain around 2 per cent. 2 bi review 29/2003 in view inflation developments, momentum domestic demand, narrow interest rate spread credit markets, diminish geopolitical uncertainty, raise target overnight rate 25 basis point march mid-april - bring 3.25 per cent. in april monetary policy report, state risk confront world economy appear evenly balance autumn. the canadian economy project strengthen appreciably towards end 2003 grow somewhat production potential 2004, thank pickup economic activity unite state improvement business consumer confidence. we conclude april although growth would likely remain somewhat potential canada first three quarter year, small amount economic slack would open year would close end 2004. we project core inflation would likely fall 2 1/2 per cent second half year 2 per cent early 2004 special factor push inflation run course. we also point total cpi inflation would continue importantly affect swing crude oil price would likely fall temporarily core rate first half 2004 steady rate close core inflation. factor influence monetary policy in april monetary policy report, list number factor intend watch closely set monetary policy. these factor pace economic expansion unite state overseas, strength domestic demand, financial market conditions, evolution inflation inflation expectations. so, let review see factor evolving. i(cid:146)ll start external environment. in europe, domestic demand economic growth continue disappoint. japan(cid:146)s economy also remain weak. while demand growth rest asia strong, outbreak severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) clearly go slow growth countries. in unite states, domestic demand recover quickly expected, negative implication canadian exports, least short term. consumer spend continue underpin economic activity country. however, business fix investment yet pick up. expectation u.s. recovery occur push back late year confidence level improve, impact expansionary monetary fiscal policy begin fully felt. now, let(cid:146)s turn second factor - domestic demand canada. on whole, demand remain quite strong, support healthy employment market, low interest rates, recovery corporate profits. while growth consumer spend slow slightly first quarter, still quite strong, especially housing. government business increase spending. a result strong domestic demand, gross domestic product grow annual rate almost 2 1/2 per cent first quarter, 1 1/2 per cent final quarter 2002. in nova scotia, see fall-off consumer spending. business investment prospect also dampen postponement natural gas projects. still, forecaster predict nova scotia(cid:146)s economy continue grow canadian average rate year. a third factor watch list evolution condition financial markets. last autumn, witness sharp increase risk premium uncertainty financial markets. in recent months, risk premium declined, condition debt equity market continue improve. this reflect reduce uncertainty bode well business spend go forward. before move fourth factor, i(cid:146)d like mention several development since april implication economic outlook. together, development point near-term growth canada low expect time april monetary policy report. sars significant impact hospitality industry, toronto, across country - include atlantic canada. more recently, closure export market discovery alberta isolate case bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse) impact beef beef-processing industry. and, course, problem several important east coast fishery affect employment production region. bi review 29/2003 3 a well know, since mid-april also sharp adjustment value u.s. dollar major currencies, include ours. the magnitude speed canadian dollar(cid:146)s rise great anyone anticipate dampen influence aggregate demand late year next. we work understand factor behind exchange rate movements. in set monetary policy, take account effect aggregate demand factors, well effect exchange rate movement themselves. exchange rate movement also direct effect price trade good service and, therefore, inflation. however, research show that, economy canada(cid:146)s, effect exchange rate movement consumer price le pronounce recent years, inflation relatively low, case early year inflation high. the inflation picture this lead fourth factor watch closely set monetary policy(cid:151)the evolution inflation inflation expectations. let start inflation. in 3 june press release announce late interest rate decision, point inflation decline expected. some decline due transitory factors, notably, rebate electricity price ontario. thus, expect temporary rebound core inflation come months, factor unwind. nevertheless, appear core total cpi inflation return 2 per cent target somewhat early bank anticipate april. this is, part, near-term softness demand. also, appreciation canadian dollar somewhat dampen rise total cpi, although expect large direct effect core cpi. now, word inflation expectations. a i mentioned, concern april sharp rise cpi inflation last winter start push canadians(cid:146) expectation inflation. the recent ease inflation likely act moderate influence expectations. we seek evidence regular survey business prior next fix announcement date. ********************** let sum up. today, i outline recent development influence demand canadian good services. they include continue weakness u.s. global economies, concern economic impact sars bse. these development likely mean weak second quarter point continue softness canadian economy third quarter. look forward, remain view growth canada(cid:146)s economy underpin strength domestic demand rebound u.s. economy towards end 2003 2004. however, appreciation canadian dollar u.s. dollar, outcome various influence work canadian global economies, factor influence aggregate demand. we provide canadian consider complete picture view economy next monetary policy report update, publish 17 july. lady gentlemen, halifax city withstand extraordinary event long history. the canadian economy, too, buffet remarkable wind year - fair foul. but weather well, i believe continue so. i assure bank canada continue provide monetary policy contribute strong, stable, sustainable economy. bi review 28/2003 1 niklaus blattner: the financial system regulatory challenge security clear settlement system speech prof dr niklaus blattner, member govern board swiss national bank. seventh conference central security depositories, lucerne, 12 june 2003. the reference speech find swiss national bank's website. * * * lady gentleman i would like talk basic issue regulatory oversight challenge security clear settlement systems. judge grow number reports, way industry perform closely scrutinise last years. considering, example, g-30 report global clear settlement second giovannini report, strike emphasis put identification potential difficulty issues. in addition, responsibility resolve difficulty assign timetable established. the debate thus gain new dimension. i shall start rather academic perspective, nevertheless please count devotion number practical issues. i shall first discus one basic function financial system, provision clear settlement services, contribution welfare. however, live le perfect world, i shall focus number important imperfection tend affect smooth function financial system. then, since imperfection shape responsibility intervention regulatory oversight authority include central bank i shall deal nature oversight. finally i shall turn number contemporary challenge regulatory oversight authority face field security clear settlement systems. 1. the provision clear settlement service financial system contribution welfare what basic role financial system? in context financial system understand set instruments, market institutions. follow merton bodie (1995) primary role financial system “to facilitate allocation deployment economic resources, across border time, uncertain environment”. in word financial system understand dynamic response institution process change imperfection information transaction costs. from practical point view financial system mean provide allocation economic resource productive investment opportunities, trade risks, collect process information. prominently also include provision clear settlement services. let concentrate latter, i.e. provision clear settlement services. there doubt central security depository (csds), international central security depository (icsds) central counterparties (ccps) among crucial build block well-organised financial system. they facilitate allocation resource deployment within financial system reduce risk transaction costs. by facilitate market exchange complex financial service take mean achieve efficiency gain within financial system. various mechanism provide clear settle security transactions. common feature mechanism are, e.g., provide technical infrastructure exchange payment settlement instruction rely commonly agree rule processes. there widespread agreement mechanism fairly successful reduce settlement risk transaction costs. with respect business activity market utility i mention, e.g., dematerialization immobilisation security increasingly pervasive application delivery-versus-payment principle. in essence clear settlement function provide financial system contribute reduction imperfection thereby make possible increasingly integrate efficient 2 bi review 28/2003 economic systems. this improvement, turn, facilitate capital accumulation technological innovation underlie implementation investment projects. thereby long-term economic growth process support and, correspondingly, welfare improved. let state obvious levine (1997): “the development financial market institution critical inextricable part growth process […]”. however, despite tremendous efficiency gain obtain emergence financial system, improvement process far over. in reality continue remain important imperfections, always u tend re-emerge new shape whenever measure take eliminate them. i would like discus imperfection implication industry. 2. some imperfection financial system among imperfection affect smooth function financial system i shall focus asymmetric information, negative externality limit competition. a first imperfection typically impair smooth function financial system asymmetric information (mishkin, 1997). indeed, information may universally commonly share within financial system. difference information endowment – another way define asymmetric information – likely lead differ behaviour different class agents. this impact price formation affect market exchange. the first example know adverse selection derive akerlof’s seminal contribution market “lemons” (1970). for u native english speakers: in colloquial english lemon good low quality. what go market “lemons”? accord akerlof seller know intrinsic quality good service supplied, buyer mean know it. the buyer ready pay price reflect average quality. however, since price high quality good service lie average price seller high quality item withdraw market. therefore market medium low quality good emerge. consequently buyer disappoint high quality supplier frustrated. ultimately might even lead extinction market good service quality cannot correctly assess buyers. to eliminate breakdown market exchange due adverse selection quality screen required. market utility csds, icsds ccps contribute soften problem adverse selection. indeed, utility may monitor participant define financial technical criterion meet permanently. this ensure certain quality participants. for example i may refer central counterparties long recognise value-added monitor function. a know, ccps replace numerous bilateral counterparty risk market participant face single counterparty risk towards itself. this transfer risk tend efficient since ccp best position monitor risk participant system. another mean soften problem adverse selection provision delivery-versus-payment mechanism since eliminate principal risk security settlement. all all, market utility ensure certain minimum quality participant reduce principal risk contribute limit damage adverse selection. the second example base asymmetric information moral hazard. while adverse selection stand way closure deals, moral hazard occur contract concluded. if contract insufficiently structure counterparties incentive adopt behaviour undesirable partners. moral hazard thus refer negative effect behaviour contract-taker contract-issuer. the textbook example one holder fire insurance contract take enough precaution prevent outbreak fire since trust insurer’s cover. only introduce certain degree co-insurance contract negative effect contract partner behaviour mitigated. in field security clear settlement systems, design implementation various mechanism may contribute overcome problem moral hazard. let give examples. an obvious mechanism forbid uncover (or unpriced) overdraft since overdraft might encourage exaggerate risk taking. some form collateralisation usually provide correct incentives. another mean create right incentive avoid moral hazard ccps set margining mechanism collateralise participants’ open positions. lastly, market utility bi review 28/2003 3 may design implement default fund default survive participant contribute, thereby reduce occurrence moral-hazard-like behaviour among them. the second imperfection typically affect financial system externalities. “externalities” stand indirect impact behaviour agent cause failure market pricing. negative externality external cost result uncompensated disadvantages. positive externality external benefit result advantage pay for. externality lead market failure, i.e. loss efficiency. in financial system efficiency loss particular negative externality exacerbate contagion. more specifically failure one institution may negative impact others. a example world csds icsds take risk operational failure. in world interlink system operational problem easily spill one system another. possibly, large part financial system infect event first occur one system only. asymmetric information negative externality affect csds icsds fundamentally. these institution mean facilitate exchange financial services. in order succeed must structure reduce asymmetric information externalities. the elimination market imperfection even see “raison d’être”. however, elimination market imperfection formidable task. partly public good nature. consequently, clear settlement institution may effectively reduce market failure thereby create value economy whole, narrow-minded nevertheless rational market participant might contrary pursue limit goals. the protection exist creation additional market failures, although inefficient whole, profitable activity individual single group participant financial system. therefore market imperfection identify address appropriate measure likely permanently change form place challenge even best exist institutional arrangement time again. a third imperfection may affect financial system unsatisfactory level competition. when say i refer perfect competition describe textbook rather mind market contestability. contestability exclude undue price power market participants, existence collusion among market participant barrier entry. you certainly agree i say guaranty kind “natural law” lead market organise accord requirement contestability. the free play market force exception rather rule. economic agent individually benefit rule bending. in addition, particular relevance clear settlement, presence high fix cost constitute relevant barrier entry. from experience know barrier reduce competition eliminate together. in extreme case speak “natural monopoly” call regulation public authorities. market imperfection asymmetric information, negative externality limit competition shape evolution financial system everywhere. financial market institution create partly reaction imperfection continuously adapt face fresh challenges. additional support come public regulatory oversight regimes, especially field security clear settlement systems. 3. the definition oversight at stage i switch perspective i would like briefly explain central bankers, include myself, mind refer effective oversight regime. broadly speak oversight define central bank’s contribution smooth function payment, clear settlement systems. oversight differ supervision, aim monitor soundness financial institution micro level. it also differ surveillance, focus smooth function financial markets. furthermore wide consensus, least among central banks, objective oversight be: maintain safety payment, clear settlement system promote efficiency. it worth stress consensus result sometimes lengthy never discourage learn process within central bank community. keep mind positive achievement regulatory oversight authority reach far i would like address challenge still face field. 4 bi review 28/2003 4. regulatory oversight challenge security clear settlement system first let clarify fundamental point. some people claim regulatory oversight authorities' objective promote stability financial system hide undue interventionist activism. well, claim besides mark. financial stability depend deal imperfection financial system. thus waste time discuss whether intervention necessary not. we rather focus authority shape process. the challenge regulator overseer face area csds, icsds ccps numerous and, i dare say, well know consider avalanche standard recommendation publish last three years. the cpss-iosco recommendation security settlement systems, report wise men, g-30 report global clear settlement giovannini report provide indeed excellent view improvement achieve area security clear settlement systems. i also strongly believe co-operative approach among financial intermediaries, service provider regulator right way achieve efficiency gain risk reduction. there sense pursue complex goal market efficiency financial system independently. a i mention before, clear settlement institution nature mean overcome market imperfections. this task huge, however. support public authority sometimes come handily; sometimes sine qua non success financial system. but relevant perspective co-operation “autonomous” infighting representative free enterprise hobbes leviathan-type government. against background let take bird’s eye view challenge regulatory oversight authority tackle facilitate initiative resolve identify issues. a first challenge need common approach regulatory oversight authorities. this need arise several factors. for instance, clear settlement security transaction occur different institution locate different jurisdictions. the whole infrastructure underlie transaction reach global dimension. over past decade cross-border infrastructure deploy activity essentially complement domestic systems, i expect start play powerful role domestic level well. the common approach regulate oversee cross-border security clear settlement systems, i refer previously, work on. the various standard recommendation issue recently proof this. some may set accent divergences, misinterpretation incompleteness standard recommendations. i refute i also see value add share language tackle complex issues. regulatory overseer tend adopt pragmatic approach one authority take leadership role consult relevant authorities. such model base lamfalussy standard (1990) already put place among central banker prove effective context continuous link settlement system (cls). a second challenge authority face lie risk cross-border financial transactions. indeed, whereas nature risk remain basically same, probability occurrence adverse event risk exposure clearly increased. the add dimension cross-border activity lie potential spillover effect due interlink systems. credit, liquidity operational risk event occur one jurisdiction may indeed trigger systemic crisis spill foreign financial markets. not system nature, i.e. payment systems, also different system payment, clear settlement system link international level. a promise outcome would cross-border delivery-versus-payment mechanism rely central bank money. all all, current and, feasible, future linkage explain regulatory oversight authority widen focus responsibility further. a third challenge relate in-house clearing, payment settlement mechanism large custodians. this commercial function undergo remarkable process concentration last years. some service provider become significant stability financial system witness event september 11, 2001. however, independent specific events, question arise whether regulatory oversight control keep development everywhere. it indeed rather problematic custody activity lie grey area bank supervision system oversight. in country task derive bank supervision system oversight perform separate authority regulatory oversight bi review 28/2003 5 framework likely incomplete least sub-optimal unless two authority succeed establish strong effective co-operation. this aspect seem important large custodian tend become direct competitor traditional market utility like csds icsds. this said, i must admit regulatory oversight authority address issue aim allow acceptable level play field among large custodian provider market utilities. the aim protection incumbent efficient predator - little red rid hood big bad wolf - rather restrict use make large individual supplier powerful market position eventually could lead outright dependency former customer csds icsds huge incontestable financial service suppliers. in view challenges, good reason critically reassess rule regulation relate security clear settlement system well way regulatory oversight responsibility implement practice. a predominantly national approach long serf market needs. and essentially sectoral solution, payment system overseer security regulator co-operate integrate way, inappropriate. therefore i welcome second giovannini report provide excellent view efficiency gain risk reduction field security clear settlement system achieved. in switzerland several country oversight clearing, payment settlement system still work progress. a draft revise national bank law submit discuss parliament. the revise law presumably enter force may 2004. it intend explicitly vest responsibility oversee payment system well security clear settlement system swiss national bank (snb). the revise law thus formally express efficient secure financial market infrastructure imperative implementation monetary policy stability financial system. the inclusion clear settlement system follow obvious fact that, give linkages, market utility considerable systemic importance. the snb, however, fulfil expand mandate closely co-operating authorities. domestically snb work hand-in-hand swiss federal bank commission (sfbc), bank supervisor. the snb focus systemic issue sfbc deal institutional aspects. this job-sharing base premise authority able make use comparative advantage. furthermore, oversight activity require it, snb able co-operate foreign authorities. 5. conclusion i would like conclude address repeat call co-operation. in field financial system stability alternative close co-operation private market player like regulatory oversight authorities. on one hand make sense field rely market force stimulate, energetically possible, eagerness progress innovation. institution like csds, icsds ccps make make market work. on hand take consideration economic force work area may nevertheless lead sub-optimal outcomes. therefore, regulator overseer must take active, complementary role. first, financial system affect problem asymmetric information, particular form moral hazard. it may also entail negative externalities, definition internalise individually optimise market players. specifically field clearing, payment settlement systems, externality present, regulatory oversight authority aim take account system whole, thereby focus link components. in words, system "too interlink fail" must therefore regulate oversee special care. second, financial system may subject limit competition. in field security clear settlement system production service base process high fix costs. there thus risk free play market force limit actual market development might lead monopoly greatly damage efficiency. regulatory oversight authority must therefore also make goal prevent potential abuse market power. against background, i strongly believe trust-based co-operation provider market utility regulatory oversight authority remain key continue successful 6 bi review 28/2003 development efficient secure financial system handle fast-changing need future. lady gentlemen, thank attention. bi review 28/2003 1 roger w ferguson, jr: basel

appreciate opportunity provide institute international finance participate all-day session basel ii. it take long time reach stage negotiation new capital accord: five years, 3-1/2 quantitative impact surveys, three consultative papers, numerous outreach meet industry representatives. the process yet complete. in continuation one transparent effort vet regulatory proposal, ask comment, carefully consider suggestion improve proposal basis evidence analysis submitted. perhaps suggestion come session today. i think see comparison third consultative paper (cp3) predecessor listen public industry saying. our response comment often add complexity provide option context worldwide bank system country individual bank different procedure approaches. we make every effort avoid cookie-cutter rule complicate bank structures. those effort continue. for example, unite states, advance notice propose rulemaking (anpr) seek comment additional option securitization risk mitigation well treatment various retail exposures, one may require negotiation basel. complexity also add attempt include principle modern finance risk-management, involve complex statistical, thus mathematical, techniques. of course, exactly direction bank best-practice management take last decade. in short, complexity many case provide option case simply part modern finance. the detail yet cast concrete. a point i want keep mind is: we seriously consider suggestion further objective more-risk-sensitive capital requirement good risk measurement management least costly efficient way. at point, however, comment must analytical empirical helpful likely modify proposal. the framework a involve fine detail basel ii, useful keep mind try do. we develop replacement current capital accord, basel i, agreement simply long consistent way world's large bank conduct business. from perspective banks, supervisors, and, let u forget, counterparties stakeholders, capital cushion ensure safety soundness provide benchmark financial condition bank measured. the large bank world change nature business basel i neither provide appropriate cushion accurate risk benchmark. it must replaced, particularly world whose financial

country economic stability paramount supervisory regulatory judgments. it worth emphasize substantial disruption financial system link large bank failure could raise risk regulatory, legislative, response would likely add restriction greatly limit flexibility efficiency bank system. in addition, perhaps one large risk safety world bank system competitor - either local cross-border - erroneously evaluate risk, act evaluation, induce competitive response increase risk exposure broadly. for reasons, action imperative. it must take bank supervisor improve risk measurement management; link extent amount regulatory minimum capital amount risk taken; attempt focus supervisor-bank dialogue measurement management risk risk-capital nexus; make 2 bi review 28/2003 transparent counterparties uninsured depositor ultimately fund - hence share - risk positions. in rather large nutshell, basel ii seek do, time seek level regulatory play field bank compete across borders. cyclicality many critic - outside industry - raise concern framer basel ii unintentionally overlook byproduct package tend destabilize world's economies. with world's bank regulatory structure, critic argue, typical business cycle accentuate basel ii perfectly reasonable estimate probability default loss give default decline economic expansion rise economy weakens. the resultant change cost availability credit pro-cyclical, is, exacerbate cyclical pattern real economy. but recognize important response emerge regulator markets: flat risk function adopt basel ii proposal; bank maintain buff capital stocks; basel ii require that, pillar 2, supervisor bank discus size necessary buff capital bank carry cyclical purposes; propose rule require stress-testing risk parameters. perhaps important point that, evaluate pro-cyclicality argument, forget cyclicality bank credit flow see history. if truly evaluate critics' concern post-basel ii pro-cyclicality bank credit flows, sure compare pre-basel ii pattern. until quite recently, systematically formally manage many key risk take banks, particular credit risk, quite difficult. the technique quantify measure risk, technology instrument manage distribute it, simply exist. individual credit-risk decision tend make lend credit officer use judgment decide give credit not. a characteristic lend officer pay make loans, competitive lend market want make sure maintain, increase, market share. this say lend officer uninterested risk management rather focus find way make loan. in world judgment, risk manager considerable difficulty persuade lend officers, indeed management, excessive risk quantitative procedure system exist. difference judgment difficult resolve. that probably reason bank credit availability historically demonstrate clear cyclical pattern consistent credit-making decision process i describe that, turn, exacerbate real economic cycles. during economic recoveries, bank credit officer would become optimistic will lend, attitude strengthen booms; time voice risk managers, even supervisors, call caution likely carry le weight. during recessions, loss clear write-off rising, caution would come forefront, more-restrictive attitude toward lend would reinforce argument risk manager supervisor could point losses. one can, i think, begin notice change recent year typical pro-cyclical behavior bank credit availability unite states. the change first become apparent minimal credit loss large u.s. bank asian debt crisis russian debt default late 1990s. it also noticeable entity begin tighten lend standard late year last expansion, contrast typical patterns, tighten occur near peak. the moderation pro-cyclical behavior also apparent continue strength portfolio

without good risk-management technique require propose basel ii. the response more-formal risk bi review 28/2003 3 management thus create reasonable prospect reduction concern pro-cyclicality capital

pro-actively possibility offer hope significant improvement way manage course business cycle. risk continue vary time. ignore fact one's interest. in fact, capital ratio basel i default fail convey pattern managers, stakeholders, supervisor risk category insufficient recognize change risk. the propose basel ii, contrast, would convey managers, supervisors, importantly, public risk change capital requirement respond change real underlie risk. a sufficiently risk-sensitive capital regime would impart timely information regard risk. that, turn, would allow adjustment lend policy sufficiently early limit excessive swing lend behavior. risk sensitivity capital requirement would damp swing credit availability thereby reduce credit spree credit crunches. supervisor prefer - least ought prefer - regulatory capital ratio convey information. supervisors, banks, public want understand bank portfolio face high risk update estimate risk relative capital reveal warn sign require attention. no early warn system provide system capital requirement signal bank problem problem severe enough already erode underlie capital. that is, capital system little risk sensitivity create potential problem escape undetected long periods. such delay increase likelihood underlie problem address soon enough grow larger. dispersion capital requirement basel ii basel ii design deliver capital requirement risk sensitive. a such, one expect bank - le risk exposure - see require capital decline; large risk exposure see require capital rise. on average, expect capital requirement total credit risk operational risk remain unchanged bank system. a i discussed, resultant dispersion capital requirement seem desirable supervisor portfolio inducements, aid supervisory evaluations, contribution safe sound banking. the dispersion capital requirement also create unexpected criticism observers: distort competitive landscape, somehow low capital requirement random gift high capital requirement random penalty, rather correctly reflect underlie risk. to sure, some, all, concern country reflect objection bank require apply basel ii - thus see capital requirement change all. some entity fear face rival get capital break rival follow basel ii low risk exposure recognize new accord. the extent regulatory capital requirement drive price profitability empirical question. my view world bank hold capital buff securitize sell assets, bank management increasingly allocate resource make decision basis internal economic capital measures, answer must be: much, all. rather, i believe increasingly observe price decision reflect economic capital allocation risk based. we try hard set risk-based regulatory capital requirement basel ii economic capital measure regulatory requirement affect

uncertain time - economic challenge face unite state japan speech mr roger w ferguson, jr, vice-chairman board governor u federal reserve system, institute international bankers, new york, 11 june 2003. * * * despite heavy do monetary fiscal stimulus, japanese economy remain mire mild, yet protracted, deflationary slump. the origin slump date burst land equity price bubble early 1990s. economic weakness, turn, lead sustain deflation prove unexpectedly difficult cure. here unite states, economy also struggle late, follow sequence adverse shock past three years. we asset bubble, course, steep fall equity price since spring 2000 almost halve household equity wealth. the horrific event september 11, 2001, shake financial markets, trouble evidence corporate malfeasance reveal enron scandals, combine heighten geopolitical tension precede war iraq, test willingness market participant assume risk. these adverse development reflect precipitous decline capital expenditures, contribute year subpar growth. these development also put considerable downward pressure inflation, point increase core consumer price rate see sustain basis almost forty years. in fact, recent meeting, federal open market committee note probability unwelcome downward pressure price next quarter exceed pickup inflation. with near-term economic prospect unite state still somewhat clouded, market commentator increasingly focus possibility unite state may follow japan deflationary slump. however, i believe unite state brink significant sustain deflation. indeed, i believe probability eventuality quite low. but japanese experience shows, onset deflation unexpected, leave topic unexamined would imprudent. of course, public interest another reason discus issue contribute, one hopes, stock intellectual capital. accordingly, i think useful discus lesson draw japanese experience and, background, examine reason harmful deflation unlikely take hold unite states. before proceeding, let note comment express reflect view necessarily colleague board governor fomc. first, i want explain theoretical view danger associate deflation. a harmful deflation, type experience japan since mid-1990s, almost always consequence depress aggregate demand. a deflationary slump drive contract demand dangerous typical economic downturn potential adverse effect financial market limitation place conventional monetary policy. deflation sufficient magnitude may result fall nominal interest rate zero - practical minimum. this floor, commonly call (cid:147)zero bound,(cid:148) exist lender always prefer hold cash rather credit instrument bear negative nominal interest rate. in recession short-term nominal interest rate already push zero, therefore, downward adjustment nominal interest rate difficult, impossible. because real interest rate equal nominal interest rate le expect rate inflation, zero bind nominal interest rate lead rapidly increase real rate deflation intensifies. rise real interest rates, turn, discourage borrowing, capital outlay businesses, purchase home families, type spend decline further. this deterioration aggregate demand add deflationary pressure push real interest rate even higher. besides raise real cost borrowing, deflation erode quality business household balance sheets. even debtor refinance exist loan zero (or low) nominal interest rates, sustain fall price transform might otherwise manageable level nominal debt accumulate business household rise potentially debilitate level real debt real debt service costs. the consequent financial distress debtor lead widespread defaults, bankruptcies, bank failures, potentially devastate consequence entire financial system. 2 bi review 27/2003 the adverse effect deflation go beyond financial markets. deflationary pressure impede effective clear labor markets. because employer often difficulty cut nominal wage employees, real wage may rise price decline, high unemployment may result. deflation also raise barrier monetary policy action conventionally use stimulate aggregate demand. face normal economic downturn, central bank would low target short-term nominal interest rate - overnight federal fund rate unite state overnight call money rate japan - stimulate aggregate demand. in deflationary environment, short-term nominal interest rate already push zero, central bank long ease policy usual way. that say central bank traditional policy rate zero lack tool boost aggregate demand thereby combat deflation. in fact, central bank number mean disposal stimulate spend nominal interest rate hit zero bound. a central bank increase supply reserve financial system regular open-market operation even short-term nominal interest rate hit zero. such action may demonstrate resolve central bank keep short-term interest rate zero prolong period time, intention raise inflation expectation low real interest rates. arguably, effective approach combat deflation - relatively straightforward extension current operate procedure - would central bank stimulate aggregate demand low interest rate along maturity spectrum. a central bank could expand open market purchase longer-term government securities, sizable quantity necessary, drive term premium lower. of course, long-term interest rate incorporate term premium well discount expectation future short-term interest rates, success operation focus influence part yield curve would bolster credible promise move short-term policy rate along trajectory consistent target longer-term yields. alternatively, economist long recognized, central bank could influence expectation future short-term interest rate directly commit keep policy interest rate zero specify relatively long period time intermediate macroeconomic target - termination decline price - achieved. a practical matter underscore commitment boost aggregate demand, central bank could write option would, pre-specified time, make raise interest rate costly, could operate forward interest rate market. if action successful, yield longer-term government security would decline. through arbitrage across financial instruments, yield longer-term private instruments, corporate bond home mortgages, would likely follow suit. a sufficient downward adjustment interest rate term structure government private security stimulate spend thus help end deflation. importantly, describe central bank could easy, action simple execute without downside risks. in particular, policy would pose considerable challenge central bank regard communication. for example, central bank try cap longer-term yield prevail market rate, would, effective, need convince market participant commit keep short-term policy interest rate low extend period. if commitment view credible, central bank(cid:146)s purchase security low longer-term yield would likely massive, give term premium component longer-term interest rate appear rather insensitive outstanding supply various securities. such situation would give rise risk target security might become disconnect rest yield curve private interest rates. the federal reserve experience use tools, although admittedly deflationary environment. therefore, describe tool (cid:147)unconventional(cid:148) may entirely appropriate. rather, (cid:147)rarely used.(cid:148) in particular, 1942 1951, federal reserve successfully maintain interest-rate ceiling longer-term treasury yield 2-1/2 percent. from 1979 much 1982, fomc target amount nonborrowed reserve bank system effort reduce inflation. and around century date change, federal reserve write option repurchase agreement reassure market participant adequate liquidity would available. to sure, understand monetary transmission mechanism unite state price distinct downward trend inform recent experience, calibrate effect policy action may difficult. thus, prevent deflation remain preferable reverse it. however, economy slip deflation, belief sufficiently determine central bank spur aggregate demand end deflation. bi review 27/2003 3 skeptic may point japan, interest rate cut monetary policy measure ineffective jumpstart economy. the bank japan low short-term interest rate considerably 1990s, burst asset price bubble backdrop stagnant economy. the overnight nominal interest rate fell slightly 8 percent 1991 1/2 percent 1995, stay low essentially zero 1999. however, loosen monetary policy early 1990s, though probably appropriate give expectation future economic development generally hold time, retrospect prove slow light decline spend price subsequently occur amid persistent price deflation - face face constraint monetary policy impose zero low bind short-term nominal interest rate - bank japan introduce call (cid:147)quantitative easing(cid:148) framework march 2001. this framework include switch operate target money market operation overnight interest rate outstanding balance reserve account hold financial institution central bank. in attempt change deflationary expectations, bank japan state would continue target reserve account core consumer price index show twelve-month inflation rate zero above. over roughly two year since then, reserve account bank japan rise nearly six-fold, ¥5 trillion march 2001 ¥28 trillion today. in addition, since march 2001 bank japan increase monthly amount outright purchase long-term government bond ¥400 billion ¥1.2 trillion. i assume monetary policy action provide support economic activity. however, japanese economy appear return path sustainable growth several reasons, may require response entity bank japan. first, bank japan introduce quantitative ease price already sustain downward trajectory; perhaps, even then, effort aggressive enough, give entrench deflationary expectations. since early 1995, consumer price inflation around zero, march 2001, price decline nearly 1 percent per year.1 accord survey private economist evidence low interest rate long-term japanese government bonds, deflation clearly become embed expectations. second, stimulus provide monetary policy japan continue damp well-recognized problem japan(cid:146)s bank sector. factor low profitability insufficient action restore bank sector(cid:146)s health combine erode banks(cid:146) capital base. because i believe strongly capital level fully reflect differ category risk, i think recent strengthen audit rule evaluate use defer tax asset bank capital step right direction. however, insufficient capital continue plague bank sector, without cushion strong capital base, bank give evidence remain extremely risk averse. commercial bank lend thus continue decline, banks(cid:146) hold le risky long-term government bond soared. because bank play even crucial role japan(cid:146)s financial system industrialize countries, problem bank sector particularly damage transmission monetary policy economy generally. finally, demand business consumer credit japan weak accord result various surveys. in deteriorate economic environment, business well bank appear pull back risk-taking. a evidence low long-term interest rates, expectation future economic growth seem bleak. capital-output ratio still high, return asset low, corporate profit poor, economic outlook fraught uncertainty. it surprise firm borrow finance new investment. rather, observer argue much bank lend keep ail inefficient firm afloat crowd field dynamic, innovative enterprise need fuel sustain expansion. japan appear become society economic agent - banks, insurance companies, corporations, household - lose appetite risk. this risk aversion hurt japan(cid:146)s economic performance, since risk-taking critical growth market economy. these crucial factor limit effectiveness conventional unconventional monetary policy measure japan. in unite states, economic financial fundamental much sound prevail japan bank japan start implement unconventional 1 measure inflation, even adjustment hike value-added tax 1997, show small positive rate 1996 1997. but change consumer price index widely consider bias upward, suggest true inflation probably remain negative. 4 bi review 27/2003 measures. the available evidence suggest u.s. real economy currently stronger, good balanced, productive dynamic japanese economy comparable period. the economy(cid:146)s ability weather adverse shock recent year reflect flexible efficient market labor capital dramatic gain information technology, markedly improve ability business address incipient economic imbalance inflict significant damage. to sure, considerable uncertainty attend near-term outlook u.s. economy, recent read production employment disappointing. however, balance assessment would also take consideration fact reduction iraq-related uncertainty recent positive news regard corporate earn cause tenor financial market improve noticeably: equity price risen, risk premium corporate debt fallen, crude oil price decline sharply, consumer confidence rebound since early spring. whether improvement overall financial condition precursor sustain recovery broad economy unclear. fortunately, long term, productivity growth unite state remain remarkably robust. rapid growth output per hour boost expectation future advance wage profits, lead eventually high aggregate demand. another key difference two country u.s. financial system continue function smoothly. domestic commercial bank profitable overall well capitalized, bank regulator show willingness move quickly address problems. in contrast, japanese bank remain saddle significant volume nonperforming loans. accordingly, process financial intermediation bank constricted, hamper bank japan(cid:146)s attempt increase liquidity stimulate flow credit. on relate point, existence highly develop integrate u.s. financial market mean proportion finance flow intermediate bank system unite state considerably small japan(cid:146)s bank-centered financial system. a result, transmission monetary policy unite state operate multiple complementary channels. japan(cid:146)s dependence bank system, system largely cease function, represent constraint transmission monetary policy country. thus, seem appropriate japan continue effort develop deep liquid capital markets. demand business consumer credit unite state strong japan, corporate balance sheet good shape. the continue rapid pace technological innovation likely create expand opportunity profitable investment thereby strengthen demand credit. although business spend fix capital yet stage convince comeback, firm eventually increase outlays, give relatively high rate depreciation certain type capital. finally, mention earlier, time bank japan implement quantitative ease framework march 2001, yield long-term government security already reach low level. in unite state today, contrast, relatively steep treasury yield curve afford great scope reduce longer-term interest rates. in conclusion, risk deflation, decline general price level, appear remote unite states. although near-term outlook uncertain, fundamental sound. furthermore, i confident that, unlikely event harmful deflation emerge unite state federal reserve need turn broad range monetary policies, tool effective boost aggregate demand put economy back track sustainable growth. we federal reserve able glean much bank japan(cid:146)s experience monetary policy zero bound. in particular, bank japan(cid:146)s implementation many innovative policy measure enhance understand monetary transmission mechanism low-inflation environment, valuable ingredient monetary policy decisionmaking today. for reason, i please opportunity address japan society today. bi review 27/2003 1 joseph o sanusi: information communication technology social transformation nigeria special

switzerland introductory remark mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 13 june 2003. * * * the national bank decide leave target range three-month libor rate unchanged 0.0%-0.75%. for time being, three-month libor keep low end target range 0.25%. in past two year take decisive step response decline economic growth upward trend swiss franc. owe low inflationary pressure narrow target corridor three-month libor total 3.25 percentage point since march 2001. interest rate last low 6 march year. the recovery global economy likely delay still switzerland, too, perceptible economic upswing expect materialise course 2004. we therefore maintain expansionary monetary policy shall keep attractiveness swiss franc investment low. this jeopardise price stability. assume three-month libor rate remain stable 0.25%, average annual inflation expect amount 0.6% year, 0.4% next year, 1.2% 2005. for 2003 anticipate real economic activity stagnate overall. let continue say word financial markets. after that, i focus swiss economy new inflation forecast. the last part remark concentrate late adjustment ecb(cid:146)s monetary policy concept national bank(cid:146)s profit distribution. financial market after war iraq financial market reassess economic situation. the risk emanate international political situation lose significance, market return focus fundamentals. the different market give mix signals. on one hand, yield long-term bond major currency fell low level years. this reflection fact bond market expect low inflation subdue economic movement extend period. equity markets, hand, recover somewhat second quarter. risk premium corporate bond go well. this sign market participant quite confident corporation make strong showing. exchange rate undergo revaluation too. the mark decline u dollar euro partly interpret normalisation previous exaggerations, partly attribute widen disequilibrium balance payment u budget. moreover, give extremely low u dollar interest rates, currency risk could hedge favourable condition conclude forward contract - attractive option time decrease risk capability. with result forward sale dollar come pressure. a regard swiss franc, note euro/franc exchange rate first time reach pre-9/11 level. the price loss equity past year - spi today approximately 40% peak - significant effect switzerland. they put pressure corporation individuals, foreseeable high old-age provision nascent insecurity area one concerns. the swiss financial sector, make above-average contribution gross national product, particularly hard hit stock market correction. the cut-backs necessary financial sector put strain swiss economy extend period come. economic activity economic activity switzerland weaken first quarter 2003. accord preliminary estimate seco, real gross domestic product contract compare previous period slightly previous year(cid:146)s level. the renew deterioration economic situation come unexpectedly. it primarily result recur downturn global economy, partly reflection uncertainty connection iraq war. swiss export 2 bi review 27/2003 first quarter, foreign trade contribution become distinctly negative. consumer spend slightly stabilise effect investment continue decline overall. even though geopolitical uncertainty meanwhile largely give way, economic situation switzerland remain difficult. the mark deterioration labour market make uncertainty depress consumer sentiment. even though first sign suggest stabilisation demand capital goods, corporate investment activity still low ebb. despite weak franc euro, incoming order order backlog stay unsatisfactory level april. capacity utilisation industry remain inadequate. swiss gross domestic product therefore likely grow second quarter 2003 either. any recovery swiss economy dependent sustain increase growth exports, lead turnaround currently still weak capital spending. we expect upswing set gradually second half 2003 continue vigorous pace next year. private consumption also pick little more. gdp growth therefore likely increase somewhat second half year nevertheless remain moderate. in current year anticipate real economic activity stagnate overall. for next year expect perceptible economic upswing. we likely see continue rise unemployment end year expect labour market improve middle 2004. inflation forecast i shall turn course inflation new inflation forecast. annual inflation, measure national consumer price index, stand 1.0% fourth quarter 2002 first quarter 2003. in april, inflation drop 0.7% amount 0.4% may. this decline primarily attributable basis effect. while inflation domestic good remain fairly stable late, inflation import good relatively volatile. this result oil price fluctuate sharply recent past. with regard domestic goods, strike rent rise price service - particularly public service - augment above-average rate. the core rate inflation calculate national bank stand slightly 1% while. this year national bank begin publish inflation forecast every quarter. our inflation forecast march 2003 (the dash-dotted green curve graph) show time assumed, base stable three-month libor rate 0.25%, inflation would gradually rise 2.5% fourth quarter 2005. this inflation forecast base assumption u economy would see decisive recovery already second quarter 2003, follow upswing europe toward end 2003. this prove optimistic scenario. in late inflation forecast (red dash curve) anticipate renew delay global recovery half year. growth us, however, likely pick early 2003. the u economy expect reach growth potential end 2004, however. economic activity europe see modest growth time being. we anticipate significant acceleration growth set middle 2004, potential growth reach course 2005. we assume dollar/euro rate remain current level oil price around $25 per barrel. on assumption three-month libor rate remain stable 0.25% next three years, average inflation amount 0.6% 2003, drop 0.4% 2004 climb 1.2% 2005. it thus forecast remain 1% mid-2005. in course 2005, however, acceleration get way, forecast inflation reach 2.5% mark second quarter 2006. the new forecast consistently march 2003. the low inflation begin 2004 attributable basis effect result development oil prices. the low inflation forecast period thereafter due delay economic upswing. accord new forecast, inflation 2006 long range national bank equate price stability. it note forecast assume monetary policy remain expansive next three years. we preempt rise inflation tighten monetary policy late time. bi review 27/2003 3 relax monetary policy our interest rate cut 50 basis point last march last possible downward interest rate adjustment. our intention resolutely counter appreciation swiss franc vis-(cid:224)-vis euro current difficult economic environment. so far, successful step: swiss franc depreciate markedly euro. monetary condition become considerably relaxed. for time being, intend continue implement expansionary monetary policy support economic recovery switzerland. swiss franc investment remain unattractive foreseeable future. economic recovery still uncertain. there even recur talk deflation risk switzerland. we consider minimal risk. in months, inflation may well negative. an actual deflation spiral lead strong decline demand good output is, however, highly unlikely long swiss franc appreciate inordinately. we shall therefore continue take decisive step combat tighten monetary condition bring significant rise swiss franc euro. you certainly take note high growth rate money supply aggregate last quarters. the money supply aggregate currently grow rate last see end eighties. the question arise extent expansion money supply inflationary effect. first, let say deliberately conduct expansionary policy. that partly explain above-average money supply growth. it also must noted, however, painful experience investor make stock market uncertain economic situation significantly heighten preference liquidity. a look credit statistic confirm money supply grow result credit creation therefore serve finance exist demand goods. moreover, economy currently free capacity increase demand immediately push prices. we therefore convince sufficient time disposal keep inflation within bind price stability tighten monetary policy late point time. i like emphasise present situation effort need besides expansionary monetary policy order maintain enhance attractiveness switzerland industrial business centre. such effort include liberalisation domestic economy, increase competitiveness structurally weak sectors, sound public finances. adjustment monetary policy concept ecb a week ago, european central bank (ecb) finalise monetary policy assessment slightly adjust monetary policy concept. in future, ecb long lay reference value money supply m3 every year keep unchanged long period time. in communicate monetary policy decisions, ecb will, past, first comment general price economic development afterwards development money supply. furthermore, ecb confirm definition price stability. it consider price stability achieve inflation rate 2%. at time, ecb announce aim inflation rate nearly 2% medium term. the national bank define price stability way ecb. the question thus arise whether we, too, principle aim upper level range price stability. we see reason make change concept. switzerland small open economy proportion import good national consumer price index amount 25%. a result exchange rate fluctuations, inflation rate significantly volatile euro area. there therefore sense aim excessively narrow range inflation. such temporary fluctuation inflation pose problem swiss economy counter mean special monetary policy actions. furthermore, euro area also problem large spread inflation peripheral country country centre. in strive inflation rate le than, close to, 2% medium term entire euro area, ecb try prevent inflation central country push towards zero, even zero, length time. in switzerland, problem exist inflation measure switzerland relevant monetary policy. 4 bi review 27/2003 additional agreement federal department finance snb distribution profit free asset at yesterday(cid:146)s meet bank council national bank agree additional

authorities(cid:146) concern late return (cid:147)normal level(cid:148), amount approximately sfr 1 billion, likely create considerable political difficulties. from today(cid:146)s vantage point, cannot rule out, moreover, result additional distribution income-yielding free asset national bank(cid:146)s provision reduce rapidly assume main agreement national bank(cid:146)s profit distribution conclude april 2002. at 2.9% year, income forecast agreement base rather optimistic give low yield level financial market time come. it may therefore well downward adjustment become necessary early 2007, when, term agreement, level distribution reconsidered. in case, national bank consider annual profit distribution sfr 3 billion 2007 onward mean certainty. we think important draw attention risk well time. we also explain head federal department finance ask advise responsible person canton misgivings. inflation forecast june 2003 libor 0,25% 2003 2004 2005 annual average inflation % 0.6 0.4

institution hold additional capital risks, concentrations, basel i rule capture directly. for unite state bank authorities, pillar ii basel ii require nothing new. finally, bank country quite disclose capital ratios. the bank publicly hold issue publicly hold security require disclose even data, although admittedly le requirement propose pillar iii basel ii. moreover, even small bank organizations, considerable information publicly disseminate - example, call report - available counterparties. when u.s. authority consider cost-benefit ratio require thousand bank become subject basel ii - presumably standardize version - saw benefit (1) slightly risk sensitivity calculation minimum regulatory capital requirement standardize version presumably bank would select, (2) disclosure pillar

cross-border activity may decide remain basel i-based rule country. we anticipate that, long capital position remain strong present supervisory issues, entity able continue cross-border activities. in effect, believe well-capitalized standards, combine strong supervisory framework, allow u.s. bank meet requirement consolidate capital requirement foreign country standard result capital requirement least prudent basel ii approach home country banks. in case, too, foreign subsidiary u.s. bank would naturally adhere host country rule apply bank subsidiary there. we acknowledge detail still clarify - exactly task aig undertaken. but i would like emphasize issue relate basel ii necessarily new, since deal difference capital rule among country many years, perhaps complex. implication treatment foreign bank unite state now arrive point wait patiently hear. what propose scope application basel ii unite state mean treatment foreign bank operate subsidiary branch country? it has, course, implication branch unite state directly subject u.s. capital requirements. in addition, u.s. supervisor expect whichever basel ii approach foreign bank choose consolidate operation acceptable allow branch subsidiary operation unite state evaluate financial hold company well-capitalized criterion apply consolidate level. for matter, anticipate continue accept basel i-based calculation purpose approach home country supervisor continue employ. any u.s. bank subsidiary foreign bank will, course, comply u.s. rule banks, foreign bank subsidiary u.s. bank host countries. the principle subsidiary must comply host country rule discuss aig, long-held view widely accepted. moreover, national treatment require rule apply purely domestic bank apply equally subsidiary foreign bank operate host country. in u.s. context, principle mean u.s. subsidiary foreign bank eventually choose whether want a-irb ama approach basel ii, require meet infrastructure prerequisite u.s. banks, remain current basel i-based rules. admittedly, policy path choose u.s. supervisor may present important choice foreign bank operate u.s. bank subsidiary. for foreign bank operate a-irb ama consolidate basis home country rules, choose a-irb ama u.s. bank subsidiary would present particular problems. granted, could difference area national discretion specific element accord; term overall approach, thing align well. the u.s. authority understand, however, foreign banks, include subsidiary here, target f-irb approach prefer global start point basel ii. there would, course, significant issue organization subsidiary bank unite state choose a-irb ama parent remain f-irb. in instance, u.s. subsidiary would meet u.s. requirement a-irb ama, would able deliver necessary input f-irb consolidate level. a difficult problem arise u.s. bank subsidiary remain basel i-based rules. the subsidiary would generate irb parameter input u.s. regulatory capital requirement could naturally fee calculation consolidate capital requirement f-irb home country level. clearly u.s. supervisor see latter case could burdensome foreign banks, prepared, colleague aig, assist local subsidiary develop input need consolidate parent. in general, bank already employ sophisticate risk-measurement technique order compete u.s. market. moreover, exposure skew toward large corporate firm information use estimate necessary risk input abundant. the difficult problem occur foreign bank choose f-irb home choose a-irb here. the bank determine parameter loss give default (lgd) exposure default (ead) regulatory capital requirement corporate exposure use bi review 26/2003 5 parameter risk measurement management u.s. bank, whereas parent bank develop use probability default (pd) estimate exposure home. gather data generate viable estimate lgds eads pose challenges. to sure, believe availability external data source develop unite state help generation variable reasonably wide. still, effort required, effort costless. the cost develop parameter use u.s. operation likely difficult problem foreign bank adopt a-irb home. the u.s. agency make decision implement advance version basel ii lightly. we conclude that, markets, entity large enough use irb technique use more-sophisticated approach include lgds eads process risk measurement management. we felt important tailor implementation basel ii individual bank financial environment, authority markets, even though mean reconciliation different approach implementation across country create complication bank organizations. the aig work hard minimize effects, confidence ability develop reasonable effective solutions. nonetheless, appreciate responsibility work u.s. subsidiary whose foreign bank parent will, least initially, adopt f-irb home country. for example, prepare explore possibility allow u.s. subsidiary foreign bank use conservative estimate lgd ead finite transitional period, data yet available part portfolios. if adopted, approach would apply equally fully domestic u.s. bank adopt a-irb. for set banks, transition measure would need limit scope duration. we also will consider methodology would permit foreign bank allocate portion overall operational-risk capital charge consolidate entity u.s. bank subsidiary, possibly include allocation non-ama approach limit period time. such transitional approach indicate willingness approach implementation basel ii pragmatically. the upcoming anpr lay issue detail, perspective unite states, also incorporate parallel work aig. to extent concern cross-border implementation issue now, urge engage discussion u.s. supervisor provide comment u.s. document address issue. in perhaps would follow naturally, also suggest inform home country supervisor issue discussion aig level much efficient. in short, let u know problem scope application proposal may cause you, particularly, please let u know suggestion address them. a i indicated, start presumption intend implement a-irb ama alternative basel ii unite state eager reverse course regard. nevertheless, want consider element would allow u meet objective consider important limit unnecessary burden institutions. a digression please allow comment briefly treatment capital requirement commercial real estate (cre) exposures. i understand issue primary concern foreign banks, may become confuse many observer u.s. position basel ii. for many, all, u.s. supervisors, cre exposure general, cre exposure finance certain property type particular, believe involve risk than, say, commercial industrial (c&i) loans. this view maintain despite clearly improve underwrite appraisal method follow u.s. banks' experience late 1980s early 1990s associate change regulations. the continue perception high risk cre credits, despite developments, reflect judgment evidence loss individual default cre property increase default rise. in words, cre exposure high asset correlation thus require high capital charges. for reason, u.s. representative basel supervisor committee argue strongly two cre capital function translate risk parameter capital requirements: one would identical c&i function would cre exposure low asset correlation, one would require large capital risk parameter would apply exposure high asset correlation. further, committee propose cp3 that, certain exceptions, 6 bi review 26/2003 acquisition, development, construction (adc) loan cre property would high asset correlation function nation would option apply jurisdiction high function cre loan in-place property felt meet threshold high asset correlation. importantly, committee also agree that, country so, supervisor would ensure irb bank - domestic foreign - make similar loan jurisdiction would subject definitions. thus, institution finance office build unite states, example, discussion purely academic. the evidence available federal reserve seem support need unite state high asset correlation function type cre loan in-place property. these data banks, unfortunately, limit period, additional data recently come attention lender long period produce conflict evidence. although supervisory judgment still exposure high asset correlation, mix evidence support position standard believe necessary apply distinction regulatory framework. consequently, anpr release next month propose cre loan unite state in-place property low asset correlation function, c&i loan are. we propose comment cp3 approach adc loans, certain exceptions. however, reflection supervisory concern judgment, propose estimate loss give default - key risk parameter basel ii - cre loan in-place property base historical loss rate period high default. this approach, believe, capture risk historically accompany exposures. i would like emphasize change position reflect evidence provide u supplement evidence gather ourselves. it show willingness regulator remain open-minded basel ii proposals, long comment base analysis evidence remain consistent objective basel ii. summary i conclude note highlights. the u.s. authority propose country a-irb ama approach basel ii require large, internationally active bank meet certain criterion size foreign activity permit bank meet infrastructure prerequisite a-irb ama approaches. all bank organization would remain basel i. the proposal offer basel standardize foundation irb approach additional alternatives. this proposal, authority believe, consistent level play field internationally require bank compete materially across national boundary basel ii capital regime. it would apply sophisticate option large u.s. organization good risk measurement risk management critical. it permit u.s. organization wish choose more-sophisticated approach so. but avoid additional cost burden u.s. bank organization - le press need improve risk-management technique already high capital positions, effectively subject pillar ii supervisory oversight, disclose considerable information. the u.s. authority believe u.s. bank remain basel i small office subsidiary abroad permit host country maintain operation long organization retain high capital position strong u.s. supervisory oversight. foreign subsidiary u.s. banks, course, would subject whatever requirement host country impose bank operate jurisdiction, include basel ii requirements. we work aig basel minimize issue may arise different capital regime consolidate operation foreign bank choice available subsidiary unite states. u.s. supervisor cooperate foreign supervisor provide require input u.s. subsidiary foreign bank home country supervisor need consolidate supervision. the bank agency also will consider transition methodology assist foreign bank want use irb adopt a-irb ama approaches. we

australia, house representative stand committee economics, finance public administration, melbourne, 6 june 2003. * * * in six month since last appear committee receive lot information world economy, resolve uncertainty live year now. a recall, 2002 start promise note, momentum global growth wan second half year. a return firm growth expect early 2003, observer watch sign quickly find picture cloud concern grow likelihood war iraq, actual occurrence. the war carry obvious risks, least big rise price oil, effect confidence mask underlie economic trends. the relatively quick resolution hostilities, associate drop price oil, major plus global economy, compare possible alternative. confidence recover grind attention return underlie economic trends, incoming data give encouragement; clear pick-up global growth occur first half 2003. the international forecast community push forecast pick-up back second half year, though sign support view yet. it surprising, environment, financial market give rather mix messages. around world bond yield fall recently historical lows, indicate participant market see weak outlook growth inflation. equity markets, hand, steadier, two-and-a-half year falls. in unite state market even make noticeable gain recent weeks, suggest gloom may lifting. foreign exchange market continue trend start 18 month ago, u dollar falling, yen remain broadly stable group currency include euro, swiss franc canadian, australian new zealand dollar rising. where leave australia? i start answer question traditional way evaluate update forecast i give committee last time. when meet december last year, i say expect gdp grow 3 per cent year june 2003, present financial year. this slow recent years, important reason temporary contractionary influence drought. when move forecast horizon along six months, end 2003, expect growth rate rise 3¾ per cent. the outcome growth 2002/03 look like close 3 per cent forecast, little it. a look slightly ahead, however, prospect strong were. instead 3¾ per cent calendar 2003, growth might like 3 per cent. what cause downward revision outlook? the main explanation weak performance world economy see date, affect australia’s trade performance. our import continue grow line quite strong domestic demand, export fall appreciably, le confidence lift near future firm foreign demand. i say minutes. the inflation forecast i give last time rise cpi exceed 3 per cent near term ease 2¾ per cent 12 month end 2003. the first part forecast occur cpi recent 12-month period (to march quarter 2003) run 3.4 per cent, push high oil price quarter. but oil price pressure already reversed, look likely outcome remainder 2003 2004 may statement monetary policy, reduce inflation forecast 2¾ per cent 2½ per cent, largely high exchange rate australian dollar. since statement released, course, exchange rate rise further. 2 bi review 26/2003 let say little domestic economy. the thing stand domestic demand grow high rate. for example, grow 6½ per cent last year. this unlikely continue long period, recent four quarters, slow 5½ per cent. we expect deceleration look ahead, recent data suggest large. consumption grow 3½ per cent year march quarter recent data retail trade show good rise two recent month – march april. give growth employment incomes, fact consumer confidence longer-term average, prospect consumption look quite good. similarly, private investment accord late capex survey hold well. we cannot expect repeat 20 per cent growth last year, figure order 10 per cent likely, give strength investment build structures. the corporate sector excellent financial health, conservative gearing, good profitability ready access credit, although use much ample internal source funds. most survey show read average business condition business confidence. i wish say much residential construction hold long forecaster expected, appear peak despite boost continue receive alteration additions. the experience among different industry is, usual, quite varied. although, aggregate, growth good, sector suffering. agriculture drought obvious example, recently tourist international transportation sector suffer sharp fall activity associate public reaction sars virus, look like recover drop travel associate iraq war. employment grow 2½ per cent past year although, usual, record figure show irregular pattern growth. the unemployment rate 6.1 per cent low present expansion. a explain earlier, consumer price rise 3.4 per cent per annum, wage cost 3.6 per cent. inflation close 3 per cent year. this would source concern expect situation persist long enough become entrench expectations. but, i say earlier, inflation likely decline come quarters, overall growth labour cost consistent inflation target. these figure contrast much low rate increase occur major economy overseas demand much weak inflation target – implicit explicit – are, danger of, undershot. before leave domestic economy, i make remark growth credit. aggregate credit grow 13 per cent past year, quite high figure economy nominal gdp grow 6 per cent. when look closely, find household credit grow 20 per cent credit household sector house purpose grow 21 per cent. credit investor house grow pace 28 per cent. thus, situation credit grow good deal fast appear necessary satisfy need economy, situation wholly due credit channel house sector. when see kind figures, hard conclude significant part must direct speculative purposes. there is, course, plenty evidence support supposition. overall, examination domestic economy lead u conclude little evidence suggest monetary policy tight, currently exert constrict influence domestic demand. but part story, possibly small part – policy must also take account impact international forces. let return, therefore, global economy, i conclude try make assessment balance risk face australian economy. after short-lived optimism follow end iraq war fall oil prices, amidst flow mix economic data, observer international economy confront two piece news, emanate unite states, give pause thought. the first fed’s communiqué early may federal open market committee meeting. in it, feed state balance risk inflation downward direction. while feed mention word “deflation”, clearly regard likely outcome, bi review 26/2003 3 market interpret feed say deflation least possibility include range conceivable outcomes. u bond yield soon drop 45-year lows. the second piece news unite state secretary treasury’s comment value u dollar. this virtually unanimously interpret signal end “strong dollar policy” acceptance decline dollar interest u economy. the interpretation gain add plausibility, despite late denials, see conjunction fed’s early announcement downward risk inflation outlook. the likelihood u dollar might decline further, tacit acquiescence u authorities, lead many observer believe significant change occur international environment. a decline u dollar help u economy adjust problems, also shift problem part countries. in passing, i say i criticise unite state – date, shoulder fair share responsibility get global expansion going. but, interest increase global growth, rather redistribution pattern growth countries, many country enjoy stimulus export unite state u dollar high need find domestic source expansion. there great deal scepticism successful two main area outside unite state – japan euro area – endeavour. it general context central bank reduce interest rate past days. a know, not. this unaware downward risk present global economy, think economy somehow immune international problems. it clearly strong domestic condition place already result current policy set (not mention high inflation countries), hence sense urgency reduce interest rate several others clearly did. we are, however, conscious risk australian economy faces. obviously, first one world economy fail recover that, time, fee protract weaken australian economy. the main direct channel could occur would weaken exports. at time, see economy healthy relative others, hence interest rate low others, foreign investor find australian dollar-denominated asset attractive acquire. thus, second channel could excessive appreciation australian dollar. not i think happen date could way label excessive. the trade-weighted exchange rate return post-float average, rate u dollar still well post-float average. on purely domestic front, main risk associate rapid growth household credit. not seem excessive term purely domestic needs, far high comparable country. most credit direct towards bid price house and, part house market, motivation dominate pursuit speculative gain. will continue? i think evidence speculative hot spots, degree common sense returning. investor interest inner-city apartment well down, number propose project shelved. in addition, estimate vacancy rate revise upwards rent falling. if interpretation correct, time reflect normal statistical collection credit prices. but statistic inevitably contain quite long lags, last indicator turn down. when put two set risk together, several possible outcomes. a weaken world outlook abate domestic credit asset market pressure would provide reasonably clear prognosis monetary policy. in direction, would combination clear strengthen world economy continue domestic buoyancy. a third possible combination, favourable one australia, would firm world economy ease domestic pressures, result balance growth outcome australian economy. but combination would damage australian economy would household sector continue put expose position rate past years, time weaken world economy start fee activity incomes. that would recipe ensure that, house price correction came, inevitably would world economy weak enough, would big disruptive otherwise. i say likely outcome, risk take account. it risk add extra degree complexity make monetary 4 bi review 26/2003 policy australia, give context early remark le urgency australia elsewhere respond weaken world economy. in conclusion, international environment yet improve way hoped, change fortune u dollar throw additional complication mix. to date, domestic economy weather unfavourable international environment well. nonetheless, growth adversely affect period ahead international situation improve. if occur, would change balance force keep interest rate steady past year. bi review 26/2003 1 european central bank: press conference - introductory statement introductory statement mr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank mr lucas papademos, vice-president european central bank, press conference hold frankfurt, 5 june 2003. * * * lady gentlemen, vice-president i report outcome today's meet govern council ecb. follow comprehensive economic monetary analysis, conclude outlook price stability medium term improve significantly since last decision low interest rate march. a result, decide reduce key interest rate 50 basis points. this decision line monetary policy strategy, include aim maintain inflation rate close 2% medium term. at time, interest rate reduction take account downside risk economic growth. the govern council continue monitor carefully factor relevant assessment. let explain assessment detail. in context economic analysis, late data release real gdp growth confirm economic activity euro area remain subdue first quarter year. this outcome also reflect negative impact iraq crisis global economy euro area. however, survey evidence april may suggest immediate improvement resolution conflict best mixed. accordingly, economic growth first half 2003 likely weak, expectation annual average economic growth year 2004 scale down. nevertheless, still expect gradual strengthen real gdp growth course 2003, gather pace next year. all available forecast well recent financial market reaction seem reflect similar assessment. the main factor support outlook external domestic nature. on external side, expect upturn extra-euro area demand compensate dampen effect appreciation euro. evidently, significant rapid appreciation euro recent month dampen external price competitiveness. however, current level euro's real effective exchange rate, thereby competitive position euro area exporters, close longer-term averages. thus, put perspective, current euro exchange rate level line economic fundamental interest strong stable euro. on domestic side, private consumption growth recover second half 2003 onwards. this would reflect growth real disposable income support positive term trade effect low inflation rates. moreover, significant imbalance household sector whole would hind recovery. at time, contribution investment growth likely remain modest, although improvement global economic environment historically low level interest rate contribute upswing. the govern council conscious continue downside risk economic growth. notably, risk stem past accumulation macroeconomic imbalance outside euro area, ongoing concern regard sars virus. in addition, uncertainty remain extent adjustment still need euro area corporate sector enhance productivity profitability. this could also impact employment growth thus private consumption. give environment, outlook price development become favourable. follow eurostat's flash estimate inflation rate may 1.9%, annual inflation rate expect hover broadly around level remainder year fall significantly 2004. this assessment base assumption favourable import prices, reflect generally stable oil price development high exchange rate, well low domestic price pressure context moderate economic recovery. in particular, wage growth expect remain broadly stable. couple productivity gains, therefore result moderation unit labour costs. 2 bi review 26/2003 in context monetary analysis, saw persistent strong growth broad monetary aggregate m3. consequently, euro area economy continue accumulate liquidity significantly amount need sustain non-inflationary growth. there are, however, several consideration counterbalance concern ample liquidity lead inflationary pressure medium term. in particular, monetary development continue foster portfolio shifts, reflect sustain preference part investor liquid secure assets. this confirm evidence component counterpart m3. indeed, loan private sector increase much moderate pace m3. moreover, high monetary growth accompany much low net acquisition foreign equity non-mfi euro area residents, also imply portfolio reallocation away risky assets. consequently, portfolio shift affect m3 growth past two year unwind time. finally, perspective economic activity remain moderate reduce likelihood excess liquidity give rise increase spending. nevertheless, one bear mind monetary growth also support low level interest rates. therefore, monetary development need closely monitor respect implication price stability medium long term. sum economic analysis, currently appear inflation rate decline 2% medium term, follow recent movement exchange rate euro give sluggish growth performance euro area. our monetary analysis indicate strong expansion m3 time adversely affect outlook. hence, cross-check information two pillar lead u conclude outlook price stability medium term become favourable. let point comment debate hypothetical risk deflation. a far euro area concerned, recall inflation hover around 2% quite time currently forecast indicate deflationary risks. the ecb's monetary policy aim inflation close 2% medium term. in respect, inflation expectation remain well anchor level, irrespective shorter-term development prices. at regional level, period relatively low price increase even price level decline improve region's competitiveness within currency area. within monetary union, deflation meaningful concept apply individual regions. at juncture, may particularly warrant stress monetary policy cannot generate last sustainable growth employment euro area. this achieve appropriate structural measure address fundamental weakness tackle urgent adjustment requirements. in respect, fiscal policy great potential foster confidence thereby support activity, even short run. establish well design medium-term consolidation strategy country currently struggle increase fiscal imbalance would make major contribution direction. this would imply comprehensive growth-friendly measure including, particular, courageous reform structure level public expenditure. curb spend growth would eventually also create room manoeuvre address future pressure arise pension system scope future tax cuts. procedurally, crucial underpin fiscal policy framework decisive consistent implementation rule treaty stability growth pact, rigorous monitor peer pressure amongst member states. by measure, bold structural reform labour product market would increase euro area's growth potential enhance ability good withstand external shocks, would also eliminate great deal uncertainty currently overshadow long-term plan perspectives. this, turn, would also positive effect short term. in particular, renew momentum process structural reform would foster consumer investor confidence thereby greatly facilitate spend investment decision euro area. we disposal questions. bi review 25/2003 1 jürgen stark: reflection maastricht process one architect dinner-debate dr jürgen stark, vice president deutsche bundesbank, droege & comp. ltd., london, 3 june 2003. * * * the creation economic monetary union introduction euro mean continental europe achieve high degree monetary policy integration. for inhabitant country one found state european economic community great historical past own, process, political “euro project”, may perhaps difficult appreciate. however, emu late development european monetary exchange rate cooperation, which, turn, part much broad process initiate europe 50 year ago. the euro cannot fully understand unless appreciation process. only mind begin grasp country different language traditions, enjoy amicable relation various period history also fight many cruel wars, could eventually take momentous decision entrust monetary policy supranational decision-making body: govern council eurosystem. it exaggeration state creation single market completion mark introduction euro banknote coin 2002, launch comprehensive challenge economic reform project history continental europe. this particularly clear demonstration european policymakers’ ability take decisive action. in le decade emu evolve remote unlikely possibility reality. apart difficulty challenge face present weak growth, high unemployment increase budget deficit one outside continental europe underestimate magnitude achieve monetary union date. the europe today confuse europe 10 15 year ago. we liberalize deregulate markets. however, need done. the convergence process permit creation emu bring fundamental change irreversible. admittedly, economic performance continental europe weak present. however, european economy resilient economic shock ever before. the process european integration decrease likelihood asymmetrical shocks. in particular, unwarranted monetary exchange rate policy long cause disturbance national level. what more, integration process create highly integrate economic area without tendency protectionist measures. what expect monetary union? what achieve five year establishment ecb four half year euro era? initial expectation varied. some positive others negative. in create single currency, politician fundamentally set make process european integration irreversible. economic monetary union expected: • complete single market create european area monetary financial stability (stability union); • act catalyst political integration economic structural reforms; • least (non-german) politicians: counterbalance currency dominance u dollar mean euro. the expectation sceptic sum follows: • euro area optimal currency area; “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy appropriate; • emu premature insufficient convergence; • without political union, emu fail. 2 bi review 25/2003 i go comment arguments. to frank: know benefit emu materialize time. in historical term 4 year extremely short period time. but allow ass actually take place since june 1998. the ecb third stage economic monetary union launch difficult times. even achieve sufficiently high degree convergence start third stage, creation new still diverse euro area 1999 generate uncertainty possible structural change exist economic relationships, include change transmission mechanism monetary policy decisions. the eurosystem’s monetary policy thus face challenge differ confront central banks. in first five year existence, ecb’s main challenge • gain credibility • build confidence new environment totally new policy regime • centralise monetary policy • decentralise closely coordinate economic budgetary policy carry state retain large extent sovereignty. another challenge determine, adopt implement appropriate monetary policy strategy define term “to maintain price stability medium term”. this achieve two-pillar approach • give prominent role money growth • establish broad range indicators, signal effect future price developments. the recent review ecb’s strategy confirm appropriateness approach. no substantial change planned, merely clarification communication reasons. the ecb strategy heavily criticised, particular anglo-saxon economist anglo-saxon media. without go detail, i like make follow remarks: 1. my profound conviction ecb modern mandate appropriate strategy. it must bear mind mean symmetric definition price stability. 2. both mandate strategy base continental european conviction price stability best contribution monetary policy make improve economic prospect raise live standards. 3. the medium-term orientation avoid introduce additional, unnecessary volatility economy make clear monetary policy instrument fine-tune business cycle. activist policy direct exploit short-term trade-off price economic activity risk contribute instability long horizons. 4. the ecb pursue strategy cannot compare strategies. the recent experience stock market house market bubble demonstrate money matters. monetary growth remain important element ecb’s economic analyses. i know many economist ignore role money supply. however, underlie relationship monetary aggregate inflation persist. the establishment ecb escb success. from outset tension serious problem implement single monetary policy. the cash changeover national currency euro start 2002 go smoothly historically unique logistical achievement. moreover, ecb broadly successful fulfil mandate. price stability largely achieved. what yet achieve current problems? first all, neither unduly positive unduly negative expectation bear out. bi review 25/2003 3 those saw emu drive force behind political integration disappointed. this already look likely 1999 confirm past nine months; political integration move forward even treaty amsterdam nice. in fact, opposite happened; considerable damage do image common european foreign security policy. it clear familiar european process automatic spin-off one integration move next. political ambition political leadership need sadly lack – result national interest move back fore. much say economic policy coordination eu stability growth pact. it disappoint find national interest cause economic policy coordination work le well might. peer pressure – make felt 2000, even implement stability growth pact – become significantly weaker. the instrument procedure economic policy coordination become bureaucratic exercise. the responsibility policy ensure “smooth functioning” emu hardly exercised. the solidarity discipline need regard single currency lacking. there little respect fact that, monetary union, parliamentary sovereignty national governmental power de facto limited. in monetary union, common rule must apply observed. the budgetary policy rule stability growth pact great achievement europe. they must observed. unfortunately, 1996-97 germany prove unable enforce requirement political influence exert procedure stability growth pact. the rule would cut weight good economic time today’s dilemma would probably avoided. the euro yet act catalyst structural reform either. the expectation enhance transparency competition would make adjustment inevitable frustrate unexpected development: monetary union seem shield member state undertake structural reform. there long nominal exchange rate change make adjustment necessary. however, happen adjustment merely postpone time. although economic monetary union away nominal exchange rates, real exchange rate adjustment still made, relate different rate inflation within euro area. inflation difference case increase since start emu. that expect happen. however, inflation rate differential europe generally much low first half 1990s. in country high inflation rate go hand hand strong growth. the low inflation rate germany mirror poor economic performance. diverge inflation rate monetary union mean different real interest rates. however, monetary union, monetary policy gear situation euro area whole individual region economic sectors. when join emu, country aware fact accept rule. however, degree dispersion inflation alarm notably high different see long-established monetary union, usa. this bring another issue currently discussion europe: deflation. the inflation rate germany currently low euro area. with german economy stagnation third consecutive year, imf staff recently publish paper ring alarm bell state many indicator point deflationary force work germany. however, imf talk “mild deflation”, comparable deflationary downward spiral japan. the debate suffer confusion mean term “deflation”. i think word use extreme caution. properly defined, deflation describe prolong period decline price level conjunction economic slump. what see far germany ongoing process disinflation. however, risk “mild” deflation occur germany cannot completely rule risk least high euro-area economies. however, relevant point need made. • the expect decline cpi inflation drive mainly energy price appreciation euro. 4 bi review 25/2003 • there indication restraint private consumption induce negative price expectations. price expectation positive. the decline consumption expenditure cause negative prospect low disposable income – high tax increase cost social security system expect – employment risks. • accord empirical studies, current weak credit growth germany due general credit crunch mainly low demand credit. • furthermore, liquidity situation germany well euro area whole favourable. however, concern remain prospect continue stagnation stable prices. to bring i say even close, i like make couple remark issue lie ahead u emu. a i say earlier: maastricht treaty european leader demonstrate ability take decisive action. it's time europe deepen integration process further. 1. we need overcome disappoint weak economic performance. to clear: economic problem continental europe cannot reduce monetary policy issues. what need structural reform member states, include pension reform, health insurance labour market reform. reform need even time crisis. not reform mean continue pay high price renounce high growth employment. in combination flexible market dynamism adaptability benefit emu materialize medium long term. 2. put fiscal position back sound track stick fiscal rule stability growth pact help restore confidence. the credibility consolidation measure crucial. fiscal adjustment see lead permanent increase future disposable income. moreover, appropriately designed, consolidation raise output employment medium term. 3. the ecb do excellent job difficult environment, especially one consider start activity uncharted territory. in heterogeneous euro area future, ecb’s task provide stable money become even harder. 4. the integration adjustment fatigue follow introduction euro overcome. the true prevail national interest eu. this become even important background enlargement eu. more political ambition political leadership europe crucial. bi review 25/2003 1 ben s bernanke: some think monetary policy japan speech mr ben s bernanke, member board governor u federal reserve system, japan society monetary economics, tokyo, 31 may 2003. the reference speech find board governor federal reserve system’s website. * * * i delight address meet japan society monetary economics. i would particularly like thank professor shimizu invite help arrange series meet official bank japan, ministry finance, financial service agency. those meet give first-hand look difficult challenge current economic situation pose japan's leader japanese people. the economic situation indeed enormously complex. it involve structural, monetary, fiscal problem also underlie political social forces, time limit flexibility policy. the sometimes frustratingly slow pace change japan reason, however, nation's economist speak present clear, persuasive argument help guide policy debate urge leader effective action. at stake economic health country also, significant degree, prosperity rest world. from side ocean, seem many people look unite state take responsibility lead world economic recovery. clearly, however, fast growth japan major industrial country would support stronger, balanced, durable recovery one drive u.s. growth alone. although change macroeconomic policy japan past decade generally slow deliberate, also willingness experiment, least bank japan (boj). for reason, recent appointment new leadership team boj stimulate considerable interest expectation around world. although governor fukui colleague far make radical break previous boj policies, reason hope open fresh idea approaches. in spirit, remark today focus opportunity monetary policy innovation japan, include specifically possibility more-active monetary-fiscal cooperation end deflation. in focus primarily macroeconomic policy deflation problem, however, i wish imply microeconomic measure - bank restructure recapitalization, development liquid capital markets, revitalization distress corporate sector, broad structural reform - essential urgent. indeed, element crucial japan's economy return satisfactory rate growth. however, i think end deflation carry banking, financial, corporate, structural reform pursue parallel tracks, progress make wherever possible. indeed, definitive end deflation consumer price - restore confidence stimulate spend - would much help moderate unemployment financial distress might otherwise arise result aggressive program reform restructuring. i preface body remark two important caveats. first, opinion i give today strictly attribute colleague board governor federal reserve federal open market committee; reflect official position unite state government. second, remark follow prepare visit japan therefore reflect discussion i hold week japanese officials. obviously, then, inference make meet comment follow.1 today i would like consider three relate issue bear contemporary monetary policy japan. first, i discus option ask bank japan announce quantitative objective prices, well objective might best structured. rather propose familiar inflation target, i suggest boj consider adopt price-level target, would imply period reflation offset effect price recent period deflation. second, i 1 a number board staff provide useful comment assistance talk. special thank due linda kole dave small help. 2 bi review 25/2003 would like consider important institutional issue, relationship condition bank japan's balance sheet ability undertake aggressive monetary policies. although, principle, balance-sheet consideration seriously constrain central bank policies, practice do. however, i discuss, relatively simple measure would eliminate constraint available. finally, important, i consider one possible strategy end deflation japan: explicit, though temporary, cooperation monetary fiscal authorities. what objective japanese monetary policy? before set trip, one know one's destination. in spirit, discussion japanese monetary policy begin discussion policy objective. i leave late objective achieved. the bank japan law, pass 1998, set price stability primary objective central bank. a federal reserve act, price stability not, however, precisely define law. currently, boj promise zero-interest-rate policy maintain deflation bring end, policy might deem consistent price stability objective. two objection conclusion might raised, however. first, boj's statement seem imply current level policy stimulus might start withdraw soon measure inflation return zero; particular, explicit commitment make maintain inflation zero, much le positive rate, long run. but presence measurement bias japanese price index suggest measure inflation rate least one percent likely require order achieve true price stability long run. moreover, inflation zero need real interest rate japan negative period, many observer think necessary full recovery. in short, would helpful zero-interest-rate policy explicit happen deflationary period ends. second, past five years, since onset current deflationary episode - and, incidentally, since passage new bank japan law - price level trend down, register cumulative decline (depending price index) 4 9 percent. for example, period gdp deflator drop nearly 9 percent, private consumption deflator fall 5-1/2 percent, wage salary 4-1/2 percent. one might argue legal objective price stability require commitment stabilize price future also policy actively reflate economy, order restore price level prevail prior prolong period deflation. a may know, i advocate explicit inflation targets, least quantitative definition price stability, lead central banks, include federal reserve. a quantitative inflation target range show many country valuable tool communication. by clarify objective central bank, explicit inflation target help focus anchor inflation expectations, reduce uncertainty financial markets, add structure policy framework. for japan, give recent history costly deflation, however, inflation target may go far enough. a good strategy japanese monetary policy might publicly announced, gradually rise price-level target. what i mind bank japan would announce intention restore price level (as measure standard index prices, consumer price index exclude fresh food) value would reach if, instead deflation past five years, moderate inflation of, say, 1 percent per year occurred. (i choose 1 percent allow measurement bias issue note above, slightly positive average rate inflation reduce risk future episode sustain deflation.) note propose price-level target move target, equal year 2003 value approximately 5 percent actual price level 1998 rise 1 percent per year thereafter.2 because deflation imply fall price target price-level rises, failure end deflation give year effect increase i call 2 of course, choice 1998 benchmark year somewhat arbitrary. it seem however good compromise choice aggressive tack try make extensive unanticipated disinflation occur half decade prior 1998 strategy ignore past deflation altogether use 2003 base year. bi review 25/2003 3 price-level gap (bernanke, 2000). the price-level gap difference actual price level price level would obtain deflation avoid price stability objective achieve first place. a successful effort eliminate price-level gap would proceed, roughly, two stages. during first stage, inflation rate would exceed long-term desire inflation rate, price-level gap eliminate effect previous deflation undone. call reflationary phase policy. second, price-level target reached, nearly so, objective policy would become conventional inflation target price-level target increase time average desire rate inflation.3 although restoration pre-deflation price level mean price-level target might reasonable interpretation boj's price stability objective, i would want push purely legal argument far. for example, base mandate price stability, i would ask either boj federal reserve restore price level prevail respective nation 1950! rather, i think boj consider policy reflation re-stabilizing low inflation rate primarily economic benefit policy. one benefit reflation would ease intense pressure debtor financial system generally. since early 1990s, borrower japan repeatedly find squeeze disinflation deflation, require pay debt yen great value expected. borrower distress affect function whole economy, example weaken bank system depress investment spending. of course, decline asset value structural problem japanese firm contribute greatly debtors' problem well, reflation would, nevertheless, provide relief. a period reflation would also likely provide boost profit help break deflationary psychology among public, would positive factor asset price well. reflation - is, period inflation long-run prefer rate order restore early price level - prove highly beneficial follow deflation 1930s japan unite states. finance minister korekiyo takahashi brilliantly rescue japan great depression reflationary policy early 1930s, president franklin d. roosevelt's reflationary monetary bank policy unite state 1933 subsequent years. in cases, turnaround amazingly rapid. in unite states, example, price fell 10.3 percent rate 1932 rise 0.8 percent 1933 briskly thereafter. moreover, year follow roosevelt's inauguration march 1933, u.s. stock market rally 77 percent. eggertsson woodford (2003) advance second argument price-level target japan important recent paper monetary policy zero bound. these author point (as many others) that, nominal interest rate near zero, central bank low real rate interest create expectation inflation part public. eggertsson woodford argue publicly announce price-level target type describe conducive raise near-term inflation expectation inflation target.4 one way understand argument imagine public expect leader central bank take aggressive actions, announce objective. now suppose that, economy experience stable deflation, central bank leadership announce fix inflation target make progress toward target give period. then next period, central bank position previously, term distance objective; hence, hypothesis, central bank incentive increase effort meet announce target, public reason expect so. in respect inflation target "forgiving" objective; failure penalized, great effort demanded. in contrast, price-level-targeting scheme, continue deflation combine upward-sloping path price-level target cause size price-level gap increase time. thus, failure central bank meet target give period lead expectation (and public demand for) increase effort subsequent period - great quantity asset purchase 3 some difference inflation target price-level target interest need detain u here. see cecchetti kim (2003) comparison. in view, contemporary inflation-targeting regime actually practice combination inflation target price-level target (or price-path targeting), overshoot undershoot inflation usually partly, entirely, subsequently reversed. 4 wolman (1998) provide early analysis similar conclusion. 4 bi review 25/2003 open market, example. so even central bank reluctant provide time frame meet objective, structure price-level objective provide mean bank commit increase anti-deflationary effort early effort prove unsuccessful. a eggertsson woodford show, expectation increase price level gap give rise intensify effort central bank lead public believe ultimately inflation replace deflation, belief support central bank's objective low current real rate interest. a concern one might price-level targeting, oppose conventional inflation targeting, require short-term inflation rate high long-term inflation objective. be danger inflation overshooting, deflation problem replace inflation problem? no doubt concern basis, ultimately one make judgment. however, side scale, i would put follow points: first, benefit real economy rapid restoration pre-deflation price level second, fact publicly announce price-level target would help bank japan manage public expectation draw distinction one-time price-level correction boj's longer-run inflation objective. if distinction made, effect reflation program inflation expectation long-term nominal interest rate small reflation interpret permanent increase inflation. a barrier aggressive policies: boj's balance sheet discuss optimal objective japanese monetary policy well, argument, advance officials, bank japan lack tool achieve objectives? without deny many difficulty inherent make monetary policy current environment japan, i believe possible method ease monetary policy japan fully exploited. one possible approach end deflation japan would great cooperation, limit time, monetary fiscal authorities. specifically, bank japan consider increase still purchase government debt, preferably explicit conjunction program tax cut fiscal stimulus. before go detail possibility, however, i want discus specific institutional factor currently constrain - somewhat artificially, i would argue - ability bank japan pursue aggressive policies, include so-called non-conventional more-orthodox policies. this institutional constraint, often cite boj officials, condition boj's balance sheet, fear, particular, successful program reflation might inflict capital loss boj thereby weaken institutional position. like central banks, bank japan balance sheet, assets, liabilities, capital. also like central banks, boj purchase interest-bearing asset money create thus typically earn significant profits, seignorage. some profit use cover expense boj itself, subject review ministry finance (mof). the boj also reserve possible loss security foreign exchange transaction permit article 53 bank japan law retain 5 percent surplus settlement profit loss reserve fund. the portion surplus retain bank pay national treasury. from point view conventional private-sector account - which, i discuss, necessarily correct standard case - boj's balance sheet become noticeably risky recent years. for example, boj's recent financial statement show 68 percent asset hold form government securities, two-thirds long-term japanese government bond (jgbs). this represent substantial increase customary level boj's hold long-term government debt. because yield government bond currently low, hold expose boj's balance sheet considerable interest-rate risk (although loss would partly offset unrealized capital gain early acquisition bonds). indeed, ironically, bank japan succeed replace deflation low positive rate inflation, reward would likely substantial capital loss value government bond hold arise result increase long-term nominal interest rates. with concern mind, boj official say strengthen bank's capital base need allow pursue aggressive monetary policy easing. in fact, boj recently request allow retain 15 percent (rather 5 percent) surplus 2002 fiscal year end increase capital, ministry finance indicate bi review 25/2003 5 approve request. even additional cushion, however, concern part boj balance sheet likely remain. the public debate boj's capital distract u underlie economics situation. in particular, private shareholder notwithstanding, bank japan private commercial bank. it cannot go bankrupt sense private firm can, usual reason commercial bank hold capital - reduce incentive excessive risk-taking, example - directly apply boj.5 indeed, put aside psychological symbolic reasons, important may circumstances, appear two conceivable effect boj's balance sheet position ability conduct normal operations. first, boj's income low support current expenditure budget, bank might force ask mof supplemental funds, boj might fear would put independence risk. this consideration necessarily make boj le will undertake aggressive monetary policies, however, purchase additional asset non-zero yields, even asset risky illiquid, normally increase bank's current income. second, imaginable, though quite unlikely, possibility bank could suffer sufficient capital loss asset make unable conduct open-market sale security scale large enough meet monetary policy objectives. in short, one could make economic case balance sheet central bank marginal relevance best determination monetary policy. rather engage would probably heat unproductive debate issue, however, i would propose instead japanese government fix problem, thereby eliminate concern boj's list worries. there many essentially costless way fix it. i intrigue simple proposal i understand suggest japanese business federation, nippon keidanren. under proposal ministry finance would convert fix interest rate japanese government bond hold bank japan float interest rates. this "bond conversion" - actually, fixed-floating interest rate swap - would protect capital position bank japan increase long-term interest rate remove much balance sheet risk associate open-market operation government securities. moreover, budgetary implication proposal would essentially zero, since increase interest payment boj mof arise bond conversion would offset almost equal increase boj's payouts national treasury.6 the budgetary neutrality proposal course consequence fact that, matter arithmetic, capital gain loss value government security hold boj precisely offset opposite change net worth issuer securities, government treasury. although mof could insulate, without budgetary cost, boj's balance sheet interest-rate risk hold government bonds, similar program offer mof private-sector holder bonds, commercial banks, would costless mof's point view, inflation interest rate subsequently rise.7 however, mof enter propose swap agreement boj, new purchase government bond private sector bank japan would costless national treasury. thus, conditional swap arrangement force, open-market purchase government bond boj would combine expansionary monetary policy reduction interest-rate risk bank system budgetary cost.8 the simple step immunize boj's balance sheet thus open number interest policy options. 5 there appear provision bank japan law address whether bank cannot negative net worth, would happen report negative net worth. 6 an alternative approach would mof offer fixed-floating swap boj hold government bond specify level. an advantage approach would provide current income meet boj expenditure needs. 7 however, loss would offset degree nominal gdp grow inflation, raise tax revenues. a historical note, u.s. treasury initiate bond conversion program time treasury-federal reserve accord 1951, allow private holder long-term bond well federal reserve avoid capital loss imply un-pegging long-term nominal rate time. because private bondholder assist well central bank, budgetary cost government zero; cost protect private long-term bondholder absorb treasury. see, example, eichengreen garber (1991) discussion. 8 i assume boj sterilize effect purchase bonds, is, allow current account balance rise amount purchases. 6 bi review 25/2003 the bond conversion (or interest-rate swap) describe would need protect boj's balance sheet side effect operation government bonds. incidentally, approach could extend insulate boj's balance sheet potentially adverse effect type asset purchase government might want encourage. for example, facilitate expand purchase asset-backed commercial paper, government might agree, request boj, exchange government debt maturity commercial paper. the net effect would fiscal authority would assume credit risk flow nonstandard monetary policy action, seem appropriate. what bank japan give exchange ministry finance's remove significant amount risk boj's balance sheet? one option would bank use increase ability bear risk undertake new policy action would entail accept type risk onto balance sheet. today i argue different approach suggest bank japan cooperate temporarily government create environment combine monetary fiscal ease end deflation help restart economic growth japan. to this, boj might scrap rule set - example, informal rule quantity long-term government bond balance sheet must keep outstanding balance banknote issued. monetary fiscal cooperation there unique solution problem continue decline japanese prices; variety policy worth trying, alone combination. however, one fairly direct practical approach explicit (though temporary) cooperation monetary fiscal authorities. let try explain i think direction promise may succeed monetary fiscal policy apply separately not. demand part consumer potential purchaser new capital equipment japan remain quite depressed, resource fully utilized. normally, central bank would respond situation low short-term nominal interest rate, rate effectively zero. other strategy central bank act alone exist, include buy alternative asset try low term liquidity premium attempt influence expectation future inflation announcement commitment expand monetary base. the bank japan take step direction generally reluctant go far might, part difficulty determine quantitative impact action part bank's view problem bank system "jammed" usual channel monetary policy transmission. ironically, obvious reluctance part boj sail uncharted water may effect mute psychological impact nonstandard action taken. likewise bank japan resist call manage value yen (see, example, mccallum, 2000, svensson, 2001), cite lack authority well prospect retaliation trade partners. the alternative approach stimulate aggregate demand fiscal policy - government spend increase tax cuts. here perception policy le successful, although posen (1998) - criticism reminiscent complain bank japan "do more" - argue problem le fiscal policy ineffective use extent one might gather official plan announcements. in posen's view, japan's debt problem primarily result slow economic growth rather active fiscal policies. however, besides possibly inconsistent application fiscal stimulus, another reason weak fiscal effect japan may well-publicized size government debt. the severity government debt problem may overstate respect - 95 percent outstanding debt domestically held, example, 59 percent hold public institutions, japanese people truly "owe debt themselves" - government's annual deficit 8 percent gdp nevertheless serious concern. moreover, age japanese population add government's budgetary burden come decades. in addition make policymakers reluctant use expansionary fiscal policy first place, japan's large national debt may dilute effect fiscal policy instance used. for example, people may incline save rather spend tax cut know cut increase future government interest cost thus raise future tax payment children. (it strike that, despite low interest rates, 20 percent japanese central government budget, 16.8 trillion yen year, devote service bi review 25/2003 7 national debt.) in economics textbooks, idea people save rather spend tax cut imply increase future tax obligation know principle ricardian equivalence. in general, evidence ricardian equivalence real economy mixed, seem likely apply situation like prevail today japan, people make highly aware potential burden national debt. the principle ricardian equivalence apply exactly increase government purchase (for example, road building) may apply approximately. if, example, people think government spend project generally wasteful add little national wealth productivity, taxpayer may view increase government spend simply increase burden government debt must bear. if, result, react increase government spend reduce expenditure, net stimulative effect fiscal action reduced. in short, strengthen effect fiscal policy, would helpful break link expansionary fiscal action today increase tax people expect pay tomorrow. my thesis cooperation monetary fiscal authority japan could help solve problem policymaker face own. consider example tax cut household business explicitly couple incremental boj purchase government debt - tax cut effect finance money creation. moreover, assume bank japan make commitment, announce price-level target, reflate economy, much increase money stock view permanent.9 under plan, boj's balance sheet protect bond conversion program, government's concern outstanding stock debt mitigate increase debt purchase boj rather sell private sector. moreover, consumer business will spend rather save bulk tax cut: they extra cash hand, - boj purchase government debt amount tax cut - current future debt service burden create imply increase future taxes. essentially, monetary fiscal policy together increase nominal wealth household sector, increase nominal spend hence prices. the health bank sector irrelevant mean transmit expansionary effect monetary policy, address concern boj official "broken" channel monetary transmission. this approach also respond reservation boj official bank "lacks tools" reach price-level inflation target. isn't irresponsible recommend tax cut, give poor state japanese public finances? to contrary, fiscal perspective, policy would almost certainly stabilizing, sense reduce debt-to-gdp ratio. the boj's purchase would leave nominal quantity debt hand public unchanged, nominal gdp would rise owe increase nominal spending. indeed, nothing would help reduce japan's fiscal woe healthy growth nominal gdp hence tax revenues. potential role monetary-fiscal cooperation limit boj support tax cuts. boj purchase government debt could also support spend programs, facilitate industrial restructuring, example. the boj's purchase would mitigate effect new spend burden debt future interest payment perceive households, reduce offset decrease consumption. more generally, replace interest-bearing debt money, boj purchase government debt low current deficit interest burden thus public's expectation future tax obligations. of course, one never get something nothing; public finance perspective, increase monetization government debt simply amount replace form tax inflation tax. but, context deflation-ridden japan, generate little bite positive inflation (and associate increase nominal spending) would help achieve goal promote economic recovery put idle resource back work, turn would boost tax revenue improve government's fiscal position. conclusion the bank japan become fully independent 1998, guard independence carefully, appropriate. economically, however, important recognize role 9 the boj's announcement price-level target credible: it feasible, interest boj, government, public. 8 bi review 25/2003 independent central bank different inflationary deflationary environments. in face inflation, often associate excessive monetization government debt, virtue independent central bank ability say "no" government. with protract deflation, however, excessive money creation unlikely problem, cooperative stance part central bank may call for. under current circumstances, great cooperation time bank japan fiscal authority way inconsistent independence central bank, cooperation two independent nation pursuit common objective inconsistent principle national sovereignty. i argue today quid pro quo, mof act immunize boj's balance sheet interest-rate risk boj increase purchase government debt, good way attack ongoing deflation japan. i would like close reiterate point i make early - end deflation consumer price part need do put japan back path full recovery. bank structural reform crucial need carry soon aggressively possible. although importance reform cannot disputed, however, i agree argue deflation minor part overall problem japan. address deflation problem would bring substantial real psychological benefit japanese economy, end deflation would make solve problem japan face much easier. for sake world's economy well japan's, i hope progress soon make fronts. bi review 25/2003 1 svein gjedrem: financial stability, asset price

development equity bond prices, house prices, credit debt may impact inflation important information central bank set interest rates. asset price may also indicator future development output demand. sharp change asset price often occur considerable imbalance economy. there episode bubble accumulate form sharp increase asset price equity house market inflation low. high asset price increase optimism often contribute high debt growth. increase access credit push asset price further. there therefore interaction development debt asset prices. when bubble burst, result may economic downturn deflation. in way, development asset price may give rise unstable inflation environment. development kind may also threaten stability financial system, cf. bank crisis nordic country around 1990. today, i discus whether monetary policy take build-up financial imbalance account. i also touch upon drive force foreign exchange market. the krone affect mechanism similar find asset markets. finally, i say word current economic developments. internationally, development weak expected. interest rate cut expect number countries. the fall international interest rate level dampen effect interest rate reduction inflation. growth norway likely fairly weak now, unchanged interest rate, inflation likely remain target period ahead. the ease monetary policy therefore continue. norge bank's executive board also carefully consider reduce interest rate large steps. price stability financial stability seek foster price stability financial stability often consider natural task central banks. in norway, government set operational objective monetary policy. this objective low stable inflation. financial instability often define absence financial stability.1 financial instability

norway since 1890s, forthcoming article bi work papers. 4 bi review 25/2003 monetary policy financial stability norge bank’s operational objective monetary policy inflation time 2½ per cent. this objective normally achieve apply different interest rate paths. the choice path may impact development output employment short term. it may also affect quickly achieve inflation target. choose different strategy involve balance fluctuation output employment deviation inflation target short term. a rapid pronounce change interest rate would appropriate case risk inflation may deviate considerably target long period, heighten turbulence financial market cost-push shock result wage negotiation indicate confidence monetary policy jeopardy. financial market confidence inflation target provide norge bank great opportunity promote stability real economy, even inflation target incorporate anchor wage determination. the impact monetary policy occur lag. the current inflation rate therefore provide sufficient information determine level interest rate set now. our analysis indicate substantial share effect interest rate change occur within two years. two year thus reasonable time horizon achieve inflation target 2½ per cent. use time horizon, avoid substantial variation output employment. a short horizon two year would result wide swing production. credit development development equity property price influence inflation. with inflation target regime, take variable account certain extent set interest rates. equity dwell account substantial share household wealth. high equity house price increase value wealth. the increase wealth relatively rapidly result rise consumption. several study indicate increase value house wealth likely lead high consumption correspond increase value equity wealth. high price commercial build may pass form high price good services. development asset price thus affect inflation directly. in norway, high proportion household dwelling. even include security fund insurance claims, norwegian households’ house wealth far high equity wealth. for norwegian households, change house price therefore probably great impact consumption change equity prices. in norway, become common equity income age group 1990s. this large extent reverse last year result fall equity prices. we nevertheless rule possibility fluctuation equity price future may strong effect real economy witness far. development various asset price may also influence investment. high equity price may make easy gain access capital finance acquisition new machinery buildings. a rise property price provide scope raise large loan collateral asset. possibility increase credit may contribute high demand good services. the process may self-reinforcing since part available credit use purchase dwell property. similarly, bubble stock market result overinvestment. when equity property price start fall, company leave much real capital investment declines. this may lead amplify economic downturn. there may several factor imply particular emphasis place financial imbalance conduct monetary policy. first, may take long time imbalance triggered. the uncertainty surround development far ahead considerable. in addition, often difficult determine sufficient degree certainty whether financial imbalance developing. it also difficult determine magnitude imbalance close triggered. an increase interest rate necessarily curb build-up financial imbalance sufficient extent. it cannot rule case substantial interest rate change required. the cost may high. history demonstrate basis downturn lay upturns. financial crisis often characterise initial phase excessive optimism, risk assessment deteriorate, willingness incur debt increase asset price rise. when negative news appear spreads, investment match expectation sentiment reversed, asset price fall. many bi review 25/2003 5 experience problem service debt. the factor contribute upturn may also amplify downturn. a rule, period expansion accompany high inflation. the objective price stability financial stability imply medicine: high interest rate. however, always case. in japan, equity property price surge 1980s, inflation low. in us, household corporate debt rise fairly sharply equity price treble 1994 1999, inflation moderate. some observers3 therefore pose follow question: function economy change high demand necessarily translate high inflation, instead result grow financial imbalances? if so, conflict may arise achieve inflation target short term financial stability. there several reason financial bubble develop period low inflation. first, highly credible monetary policy result low inflation expectations. explicit implicit long-term price wage contract become common. it take long high demand translate high inflation. cyclical change le impact inflation. moreover, period high productivity growth may lay basis high corporate earnings, heighten optimism reduce risk awareness. at time, strong productivity growth, inflation remain low. bank record low loss solid result increase lend without erode capital adequacy level. debt-financed investment may lead fast rise house property prices. a third factor strong international competition may contribute curb inflation period strong economic expansion. china, access abundance cheap labour substantial production capacity, contribute fall price many manufacture goods. in norway, experience situation conflict objective financial stability price stability. prior last bank crisis, household debt rise sharply house price increased, time inflation high. when monetary policy ease last year, sharp rise domestic costs, outlook point high inflation, accompany high credit growth. house price falling, long run probably contribute curb credit growth. wage growth reduce inflation subdued. even though high asset price strong credit growth build period low inflation, imbalance may influence inflation somewhat long run. in event, tighten monetary policy may consistent objective maintain low stable inflation time. this also stabilise development production. in order achieve this, economist recommend monetary policy place emphasis development credit growth asset price extraordinary condition warrant. in cases, mean somewhat long horizon normal apply order achieve inflation target. the advantage substantial deviation target would avoid somewhat long run. if imbalance allow time become severe, however, situation may arise interest rate set low imply inflation target, order prevent financial instability triggered. in norge bank watch report 25 september 2001, norge bank encourage place great emphasis asset prices. a two-stage strategy proposed. the first stage current flexible inflation targeting. the second stage consist monitor credit development asset price and, special cases, overrule signal give first stage. this line reason above. statement monetary policy committee bank england last autumn example emphasis place risk factor future economic developments. in minute meet 9-10 october 2002, committee point build-up financial imbalance factor imply interest rate keep unchanged rather reduce it. considerable work remain available indicator financial imbalance regard satisfactory. high credit growth sharp rise asset price alone necessarily pose threat financial stability. research conduct bi show period strong credit growth, 3 see, example, borio, english filardo (2002): "a tale two perspectives: old new challenge monetary policy?", bi work paper no. 127. 6 bi review 25/2003 rise asset price high level investment almost always put pressure financial system.4 early bank crisis may provide indication critical level are. the imf show bubble burst house market lead financial crisis often stock market bubbles.5 the imf also find probability bubble burst house market great case stock markets. a decline house market also great impact output employment. house wealth great impact consumption assets. the contagion effect via bank system strong house property loan normally account substantial share banks’ loans. a sharp rise asset price debt build-up may pose risk economic stability. to minimise risk, may situation appropriate apply somewhat long horizon normal two-year horizon achieve inflation target. a precondition financial market participant confident inflation low stable time. the current situation today, private sector debt house price historically high level. banks’ loan loss probably rise. however, assessment bank sector reasonably well equip cope increase. for long time, household debt norway rise far high rate income growth. the debt burden therefore rise rapidly high historical context. partly result reduction interest rates, interest expense moderate. high grow debt means, however, household vulnerable sharp increase interest rate substantial rise unemployment. some group household particularly risk. the change monetary policy exchange rate target inflation target probably make le likely household expose "dual shock" form high unemployment high interest rates, case bank crisis. this may imply household bear somewhat high debt burden case prior bank crisis. the level household debt norway also high international standards, although high denmark. however, look debt relation wealth, picture similar nordic countries. in denmark, household financial wealth high, house wealth relatively high among household norway. the value house stock may partly explain level debt. however, house wealth provide liquid buff payment problems. after lengthy sharp increase, house price edge recently. from may last year may year, house price fell 1.1 per cent.6 the price level nonetheless high historical context. growth corporate debt moderate, debt burden high. debt growth among norwegian borrower also illustrate credit gap, indicator develop bis. the credit gap derive development ratio credit nominal gdp define deviation

commerce bloomington, eden prairie edina bloomington, minnesota, 22 may 2003. * * * thank invitation today. i would like focus remark largely i think will, time, lead u.s. economy back path solid economic expansion. in particular, i want explain i believe that, although economy still face substantial risk although time extent pickup activity remain uncertain, stage set improvement economic climate. to lay groundwork discussion put current situation perspective, i briefly step back touch recent economic history. i note comment today reflect opinion necessarily colleague board governor federal reserve federal open market committee. a know, latter half 1990s time remarkable economic performance. business add worker expand output rapid clip. the unemployment rate fell 7-1/2 percent middle 1992 4 percent end 2000. in minnesota, unemployment rate fell 5.2 percent 3.4 percent period. the stock market soared, - remarkably enough - core inflation moderated. much performance fuel investment boom also contribute importantly rapid growth labor productivity. to sure, acceleration productivity period cyclical nature; critical longer-run economic performance least portion pickup appear sustainable. by late 2000, boom come end. the stock market begin retreat early 2000, end year, analyst revise expectation future earnings. many business cut back sharply capital investment - particularly high-tech equipment - demand profit weaken many companies, telecommunication industry, find overspend equipment boom. the downturn economy, begin 2000, two distinct characteristics. first, thankfully, turn one shallow economic history. second, one business-led recession unite state since end second world war. most recession since bring sharp cutback spend households, house consumer durables among sensitive sectors. the recent experience clearly different. consumer spend residential investment relatively well maintain throughout 2001, even firm cut employment stock market loss erode household wealth. despite modest increase nominal wage salaries, households’ real disposable income support tax cut low inflation. in addition, low interest rate help promote spending. a know, consumer take advantage fall mortgage rate buy new homes, refinance exist mortgage debt, tap increase home equity pay expensive debt finance spend things. a result, contraction real gdp first three quarter 2001 turn quite shallow despite disruptive economic fallout horrific event september 11. by early last summer, economic recovery appear way. real gdp increase annual rate roughly 3-1/2 percent first three quarter year. business seem bring inventory good alignment sales, employment begin rise again, though gain small make dent unemployment rate. a particularly encourage development, give nature downturn, contraction business investment appear slow household spending, still support low interest rate gain real disposable income, continue trend up. although government statistic look bite better, sign appear summer economy’s resilience would test several new shocks. a banker experience several previous economic downturns, i know whatever weakness exist economy become problematic low point economic cycle. at times, typically see loan loss evidence weak business models. what emerge early 2002 i expected. the enron worldcom scandal raise serious concern adequacy corporate 2 bi review 24/2003 governance system tend cloud outlook business expansion. abroad, mount tension iraq begin take toll consumer business confidence. the stock market move again, condition erode corporate debt markets, risk spread widened. a move fall, industrial production faltered, business investment post modest uneven gains. by final quarter 2002, real gdp growth slow pace 1-1/2 percent, heighten caution business sector show renew layoff sharp cutback inventory investment. that brief review bring u year, begin bright spots: concern corporate governance apparently receding, employment industrial production move solidly january, unemployment rate edge bit. unfortunately, improvement short-lived. in late february early march, confrontation iraq heat up, uncertainty pervasive. no one know war would start, end. the possibility chemical biological weapon might used, war might spread, terrorist might attack u.s. soil seem quite real. there risk iraq’s oil field might damaged. the range possible outcome economic consequence extremely wide. the uncertainty hit consumer confidence hard. the university michigan’s survey consumer attitude report that, middle march, confidence fall low level since early 1990s would expect give state economy. the oil, equity, financial market show sign strain. oil price rise nearly $40 per barrel early march, though civil strife venezuela undoubtedly play role increase. broad stock market index move 10 percent two month lead war, equity risk premium widened. measure imply volatility stock edge up. all all, economy’s performance first quarter 2003 end little good fourth quarter 2002. real gdp rise annual rate 1-1/2 percent household business rein spending. our overall economic performance would even weak house market remain vibrant. fortunately, range plausible outcome narrow significantly even official conclusion hostility iraq. a onset war become imminent, financial market rallied. oil price fell sharply week end coalition missile attack baghdad. two month pass since war began, yet clear understand strongly economy emerge recent shock. the positive sign response energy equity markets. the price crude oil return level prevail end last year, household business welcome low energy bills. equity values, additional support generally favorable earn reports, substantially. spread narrow significantly, continue downward trend begin last fall. other positive sign include reduction mortgage interest rate rebound consumer confidence. all told, indicator point noticeable reduction economic tension build early year. though market respond instantly positive news, business investment decision adjust slowly, distinction evident current production employment data. business cut another 80,000 job april, jobless rate move 6 percent, new claim unemployment insurance recent week remain level associate little net change jobs. (in minnesota, jobless rate move 4.4 percent march, 28,000 worker file claim unemployment compensation april.) industrial production fell 1/2 percent march april, capacity utilization 75 percent. retail sale been, balance, lackluster recent months. turn briefly inflation, last week’s report consumer price index showed, expected, consumer energy price begin retreat noticeably last month, reverse one-third run-up first three month year. in april, price core good service - is, consumer price exclude food energy - unchanged second month. a result, core cpi 1-1/2 percent last april. on balance, indicator suggest economy probably remain soft near future inflation remain low. nonetheless, i continue believe piece place future robust growth. look back past three years, i strike much u.s. economy contend with. for much period since mid-2001, large negative wealth effect fall stock market, shakeout high-tech sector, slowdown economic activity abroad bi review 24/2003 3 combine restrain economic activity. outside shocks, september 11, corporate scandals, war iraq, provide additional drag renew expansion. the economy, however, prove remarkably resilient. look forward, one must ask, lead economic growth? the best way start answer question look fundamental force shape economic activity. in regard, first consideration financial condition prove conducive strong economic growth next year so. monetary policy accommodative. the nominal federal fund rate currently 1-1/4 percent, level that, use standard measure core consumer price inflation, imply real fund rate zero, compare real rate’s long-run average 2-3/4 percent. with corporate risk spread narrow considerably, borrow term quite favorable. business finance need limit recently, demand credit weak. but financial sector well capitalize little stress, lender well position fund pickup business demand credit. in addition, i note earlier, equity price move again. fiscal policy, like monetary policy, provide fundamental stimulus economic growth past two years, tax cut high outlay defense. the tax proposal currently consideration congress could add stimulus, either accelerate tax cut enact previously exclude portion dividend taxable income. a third factor underpin longer-run prospect growth sustain strong uptrend labor productivity. labor productivity rise 2 percent 2001, remarkable show recession year, additional 4 percent 2002. productivity appear strong underlie trend, could support overall income growth even weakness labor market continue longer. in assess factor play time, i find useful consider separately translate pickup demand among household among businesses. from perspective households, combination low energy price tax cut help bolster real disposable income near term. in addition, drag household spend early decline stock market wealth gradually diminish, especially stock market hold recent gains. low interest rate allow consumer continue finance purchase relatively cheaply, whether home equity loan standard instruments. the outlook business sector perhaps critical consideration. here, too, fundamental look favorable. in near term, low oil price reduce cost production many business free fund uses. also, interest rate low, incentive capital expenditure tax code place late 2004, price high-tech good still falling, cost capital remain low. over long run, continue rapid pace technological innovation imply many potential investment offer attractive returns. in uncertain business environment prevail time, many business probably make exist equipment, stretch normal replacement cycles, especially rapidly depreciate high-tech equipment. overall, though shift business attitude difficult measure, i believe market reward business outperform competitor that, demand pick up, company respond opportunity incorporate technological advance production, communication, organization. because uncertainty restrain investment, predict exactly firm act difficult; i believe act. a see, i remain generally optimistic longer-run prospect u.s. economy. however, i want mention significant question outlook. perhaps significant whether slump capital spend prolong expected. such slump could occur firm remain uncertain outlook pickup sale continue shelve plan upgrade expand businesses. give low level capacity utilization factory service-providing industry telecom air transportation high vacancy rate many office buildings, risk trivial. for example, twin city metro area, one-fifth available office space sit empty end last year. another question frequently ask whether financial stress household sector might restrain growth. specifically, argue high level consumer debt might mean household unable increase spend substantially time come. to sure, debt service burden quite high historical standards, personal bankruptcy move 2001 2002. however, household convert expensive, non-tax-deductible debt 4 bi review 24/2003 mortgage debt, help keep debt service burden fairly stable past years. what more, bank experience broad weakness consumer loan portfolio increase delinquency narrow spectrum households. on whole, look available evidence, i tend give le weight question concern financial situation household i risk continue uncertainty business sector. a third question bear outlook u.s. economy regard prospect pickup activity among major trade partners. concern strength global economy remain, emergence sars pose threat economic prospect several emerging-market economy asia. to date, however, evidence new disease affect u.s. economic activity. nonetheless, continue slow growth abroad could damp effect recovery here. to summarize, recent news oil financial market consumer confidence clearly suggest reduction risk associate situation iraq number favorable effects. at time, available indicator production employment suggest pace economic activity may remain slow longer, likely restrain linger uncertainty time economic recovery. look ahead, however, seem likely that, point combine effect fundamentally solid financial sector, sustain consumer spend power, improve consumer confidence demonstrate sufficient demand potential stimulate increase level capital investment. bi review 24/2003 1 joseph o sanusi: management nigeria(cid:146)s domestic debt keynote address dr joseph o sanusi, governor central bank

increase concern rapid growth nigeria(cid:146)s public debt implication economic stability. an escalate debt profile present serious obstacle nation(cid:146)s path economic growth development. the cost service public debt (domestic external) may expand beyond capacity economy cope, thereby impact negatively ability achieve desire fiscal monetary policy objectives. furthermore, rise debt burden may constrain ability government undertake productive investment programme infrastructure, education public health. to avoid situation, imperative quantum structure nation(cid:146)s debt carefully manage manner consistent country(cid:146)s growth development aspirations. to appreciate dimension nigeria(cid:146)s domestic debt burden, would pertinent undertake brief review development. first, nigeria(cid:146)s domestic debt stock stand n23.5 million 1.0 per cent gdp 1960 subsequently, increase rapidly n8,231.5 million 16.2 per cent gdp 1980, reach n1,160.0 billion 83.6 per cent gdp end-december, 2002. the sharp increase domestic debt stock, years, attributable largely failure embark necessary adjustment, particularly time decline revenue, result grow fiscal deficit domestic debt accumulation. secondly, bulk debt short-term treasury security maturity le one year. thirdly, bank system, mainly cbn remain dominant holder federal government securities. lady gentlemen, bear repeat one major problem hind attainment macroeconomic stability sustainable growth excessive reliance federal government borrow bank system, particularly cbn, finance large unsustainable fiscal deficits. a aware, borrow cbn amount injection high-powered money system, serious adverse implication price exchange rate stability. similarly, crowd private sector credit market, thereby stall investment output

rather, size, source finance quality expenditure. over years, fgn rely largely money market le capital market, thus create mismatch short-term fund investment capital projects. this point need reactivate dormant bond market attract household institutional savings. in addition, borrow money must prudently utilize execution productive project order enhance capacity repayment principal

insurance bank - financial stability issue speech sir andrew large, deputy governor bank england, conference mandarin oriental hotel, london, 12 june 2003. * * * introduction in get together remarks, i find wonder ask me, central banker former investment banker, address illustrious gather insurance industry. what make central bank interest insurance? central bank typically two major preoccupations. monetary stability financial stability. clearly u eye macro economic driver impact monetary stability cannot fail take interest volatility equity markets. and volatility real implication life assurance world. secondly, way catastrophe cover extend world terrorism fact life significance work real economy. but it(cid:146)s point view financial stability i(cid:146)d particularly like develop think morning. after financial stability identify counter risk threat could ultimately impact confidence bank wide financial system. and get nature interaction insurance bank one hand environment operate - area accounting, regulation, payment settlement law, broad infrastructure - other. in simple days, hadn(cid:146)t occur people world insurance could relevant issue overall financial stability. the world insurance bank relatively distant world security banking. separate silos, will. but today insurance company important factor mitigate risk early would contain within bank world. i(cid:146)m talk risk like debtor default. and now, increase overlap interaction bank capital markets. a personal anecdote might help make point; also highlight view break silo pretty recent phenomenon. i well remember time 1970s. a investment banker, i use handle capital market deal early day eurobond market. i begin observe that, even though i couldn(cid:146)t articulate go precision, area insurance industry seem take similar type risk banks, charge wholly different price. i remember talk friend insurance broking industry it. one two audience! first all, true? secondly, was, why? and thirdly, indeed arbitrage opportunity could unlock value? i remember feel frustration. somehow couldn(cid:146)t quite see reconcile essential differences, include regulatory account distinctions. to say nothing language jargon use two sectors. well, rapid growth derivative industry late 1980s change that! all sort new instrument exploit arbitrage opportunity like one i describe come being. the different aspect risk unpick recombined. those development depend partly new information technology. and, together securitisation functional divide crossed. that evolution provide colossal commercial opportunity enhance general economic value. i recall it(cid:146)s good example technical advances, rocket science market force change fortune capability two great industries. and today, even though don(cid:146)t full integration certainly greatly increase interdependence linkages. just take involvement insurance industry credit risk transfer example. and lot interdependency get network effect undoubted economic benefit one hand, potential vulnerability other. maybe i start make observation vulnerability - increase risk firm overall financial system - le significant interconnection appeared. the start point try understand nature vulnerability better, potential impact financial system. 2 bi review 29/2003 vulnerabilities: compare bank insurance my first observation relate different (cid:147)customs practice(cid:148) two industries. in bank world, obligation historically tend amount clearly specify - either money term accord agree formula - advance. the event trigger delivery obligation unambiguous. often it(cid:146)s simply expiry set time period; timetable payment obligation become due fix (and typically short). in non-life part insurance world, hand amount pay often matter interpretation contract. there might great scope debate whether trigger event actually occur whether associate condition meet - even whether payment due. and payment due may made, least full negotiation point completed. the fact well-established channel may exist resolve dispute - include necessary court - doesn(cid:146)t get around fact uncertainty regard time quantum payment inject process. banker find hard reconcile reality insurance world way manage risk undertake business. clearly, fundamental difference approach raise issue u eye financial stability. specifically, different characteristic give rise cash flow liquidity implication which, banker others financial markets, potentially highly disruptive. it(cid:146)s fair say confidence bank world, enable system function rely obligation meet fall due. a volume complexity inter-linked contract system increase need certainty point also increases. high volume great complexity also increase interest financial authority responsibility stability financial system. to specific, potential problem arise if, point chain expect payment materialise. despite progress make still caution part bank regulator towards recognise risk mitigation provide insurance contracts. a recent example debate recognition insurance cover operational risk new basel ii capital adequacy regime. that general point illustrate post-enron case involve jp morgan chase various insurance companies. whatever right wrong case fact become necessary illustrate potential uncertainty relation contract boundary bank insurance. furthermore jp morgan chase case ultimately settle court. so might take u much forward term clear guidance great legal certainty. i(cid:146)m sure revisit issue tomorrow afternoon, session cover legal systems. so, i won(cid:146)t labour point much further. but vulnerability i think would well try understand better. we(cid:146)ve get enhance confidence contract straddle two sector rely upon produce expect outcome timely way even adverse conditions. risk transfer my second observation relate risk transfer specifically. alan greenspan make observation success bank system diversify risk increase ability withstand significant shock recent years, include asia crisis, russia, ltcm, 9/11 say nothing enron, it boom bust, telecom write offs. a lot people agree him. so development market transfer credit risk real value. it allow institution best place originate loan so, without necessarily require continue bear risk. have market transfer risk allow institution diversify exposure across different sector regions. and course generate price information would otherwise available. that mean credit exposure mark market way previously possible. but raise questions. the transferor may proper insight nature risks. but risk transferred? be transferee actually aware risk take on? and best position monitor risk evolve? how acquire day day knowledge quality risks? go further, might find out? bi review 29/2003 3 some concern express private public sector commentator area are, view, important worthy examination. those concern i(cid:146)m talk include: lack aggregate data derivative positions; lack transparency account them; potential unexpected concentration risk build up. although principle redistribution risk benign simply information present judge actual impact been. but relevant insurance? it(cid:146)s certainly true lot case originate bank lay risk banks. there many possible reason this: diversification avoid concentration; opportunity earn fees; regulatory arbitrage; different view price spreads. but also well know risk transfer bank various area insurance world. that include reinsurance, degree risk concentrate difficult assess. moreover, transfer take place, otc contracts, also securitised debt instruments, various credit quality. in view, opacity conducive long-term confidence strength industry. and, certainly doesn(cid:146)t contribute overall systemic robustness. so second area gain good understand potential vulnerability face adverse outcome could real value. supervision regulation obviously, it(cid:146)s pretty easy make list risk potential vulnerabilities. central banker mean especially good it! but i(cid:146)ve already refer significant benefit risk transfer. they include wide distribution risk, potentially low cost buyer protection risks. that(cid:146)s get real value. the question is: gain achieve efficiently whilst time mitigate risks? my suggestion relate environment industry operate: general infrastructure i talk earlier. if want get full benefit risk transfer, vulnerability contain acceptable level it(cid:146)s worth reflect value coordinate major element environment: supervision, regulation accounting, relate world bank insurance. i can(cid:146)t help feel genuine effort real engagement area help develop good understand risk really resides. in turn, would mean great predictability, enhance confidence good business opportunities. i(cid:146)d like give examples. for long time, functional area bank insurance silos. so regulation indeed regulators! after all, mirror different business reality i described. here uk, creation fsa oversee area - part financial system well - huge step forward. it help develop regulatory framework meet business reality one hand public policy requirement other. whatever complexity may generate, i believe already see great benefit. and similar development take place country well. now although integrate structure regulatory authority make significant progress countries, nature regulation converge slowly. there yet real equivalent basel accord insurance area: common prudential template insurance supervisor exist yet internationally. that said, i fully recognise applaud work international association insurance supervisor set best practice promote co-operation supervisors. that(cid:146)s helpful base work future. we wish well. but, current position approach insurance regulation vary widely country country. on top that, sometimes fragmentation market regulatory responsibilities, notably us. unfortunately complicate progress towards international agreement. maybe even brave soul bank supervision negotiate basel ii experienced! of course, progress made. in uk, work concentrate development risk-based solvency regime counterpart capital adequacy bank arena. this part fsa(cid:146)s tiner project overhaul regulatory environment insurers. at eu level first stage review solvency requirement insurer completed. designer next stage look approach take bank basel accord, focus three pillar develop eu solvency standards. 4 bi review 29/2003 it(cid:146)s worth look bite three pillar approach itself. for unfamiliar bank jargon approach involve combine requirement minimum capital (the first pillar) supervisory review institution(cid:146)s profile internal process (the second pillar). the third

2003. * * * introduction it give great pleasure address distinguish audience today; even first time i speak international frankfurt bank evening. on 1 june year, ecb celebrate fifth anniversary. hence, in speech today, i focus two topics. first, i discus lesson experience monetary policy euro area first five year ecb. second, i look ahead elaborate ongoing development context convention future europe, aim lay foundation constitutional treaty european union. ecb monetary policy-making perspective start experience monetary policy, and, course, speak impartial observer, i say i satisfy govern council ecb function last five year fairly difficult circumstances. indeed, lot happen must say first lustrum ecb fair (cid:147)baptism fire(cid:148). i go bore recap monetary policy decision taken, reason behind them, instead concentrate seven feature which, mind, consider main issue review monetary policy experience. let begin make remark focus price stability. this focus enshrine treaty european union mandate. it good reason. long go day monetary policy think face long-term trade-off inflation economic growth. it globally acknowledge maintain low stable rate inflation best contribution monetary policy make economic welfare. the ecb pursue mandate maintain price stability vigour determination. the public understand this. inflation expectations, measure survey data financial market indicators, always remain consistent definition price stability. this remarkable ecb track record begin face euro area economy hit repeat upward price shocks. a result shocks, hicp inflation - sometimes significantly - 2% quite time. but inflation always bounce back follow shock today outlook price stability favourable. a second relate point i would like mention medium-term orientation policy. a central bank, affect price long lag cannot steer trend price high precision. our focus medium term help avoid overly ambitious attempt fine-tune inflation developments. you might ask (cid:147)medium term(cid:148) mean exactly. it certainly fix time horizon, argued. experience recent year teach u flexibility respect important. from point view, ecb(cid:146)s monetary policy strategy different pure form inflation targeting. this lead third issue, one cannot simply rely single inflation forecast conduct monetary policy successfully. experience suggest mislead summarise assessment medium-term inflationary pressure one single figure, even measure statistical error attach it. unfortunately, monetary policy simple repeat significant forecast error major institution last year provide evidence this. indeed, i agree alan greenspan say central banker le reluctant admit sometimes know. instead rely single forecast, monetary policy strategy emphasis fundamental uncertainty. our strategy build several forecast indicator include cross-check information economic analysis, relevant short medium-term perspective 2 bi review 29/2003 inflation, monetary analysis, important medium long-term outlook. in respect, fourth point i would like discus today last year see monetary analysis important, also complex business. i doubt inflation monetary phenomenon long term right attribute prominent role monitor monetary development monetary policy strategy. a fifth point i would like make difficult gauge effect global interdependency begin conduct single monetary policy. what learnt, particular, global linkage go well beyond international trade channel, traditionally consider main, channel economic shock transmitted. moreover, shock - associate introduction new technology political nature - increasingly become global nature. relate - sixth point - learn sharp asset price fluctuation may important shape economic trends. in recent year witness extraordinary development capital markets. initially, exceptional optimism potential output growth talk (cid:147)new economy(cid:148) drive stock price sky-high levels. the (cid:147)new economy(cid:148) euphoria sow seed le positive development even actually burst. it seem accompany rise short-termism corporate managers, turn accompany corporate malpractice also push firm over-invest, especially it telecommunication sector. the subsequent large fall equity price revelation corporate malpractice series negative consequences, include increase leverage ratio non-financial corporations, decline value collateral, increase risk premia, certain firm experience difficulty obtain external finance. all may still part reason weak consumption investment activity, thus slow pace economic growth euro area observing. to cut long story short: monetary policy obviously take account public financial market sentiment assess risk price stability medium term. central bank must monitor financial market development closely order figure consequence outlook price stability medium term, must target asset prices. finally, last point monetary policy, i would like stress effective communication all-important requirement successful monetary policy. however, learn last five years, easy business. i sure appreciate communication particularly difficult context euro area, many different tradition languages. over time, see significant improvement public understand communication monetary policy strategy monetary policy decisions. evidence monetary policy decision predictable, reflect money market indicators, i rate highly positive development. indeed, want be, be, well understand order effective policy. and, able see recent clarification ecb(cid:146)s strategy, continue strive even effective communication. the future ecb let turn convention future europe future institutional status ecb. celebrate fifth anniversary is, course, good opportunity u look ahead. where ecb five year time? what kind challenge face? what kind environment confront with? today much aware constitutional construction european union process evolution. the convention le wrap deliberation president, valøry giscard d(cid:146)estaing, present draft new (cid:147)treaty establish constitution(cid:148) leader member state day time. a central bank european union, ecb follow work convention great interest past one half years. the ecb welcome effort construction unite europe. a european union effective, function transparent structure processes, capable meet expectation citizens, equip assume international responsibility commensurate size importance, would complement bi review 29/2003 3 bolster success economic monetary union (emu). throughout five year existence, ecb state strong euro good strong europe. i would like add strong europe good strong euro. if european union re-writing rulebook give constitution, mean profound change provision relate ecb monetary union general? throughout process draft constitution, ecb consistently advocate economic constitution eu - basic set rule provision emu lay maastricht treaty - sound term objective set allocation responsibility different actor level government. the convention appear follow similar reasoning, appear future constitution take provision relate emu essentially unchanged form. the single monetary policy is, nature, indivisible thus centralised; hence remain exclusive competence union. the task conduct monetary policy, well central bank tasks, assign independent central bank clear primary objective maintain price stability. in addition ecb, escb also mention first part constitution, thus acknowledge federal nature monetary authority european union sui generis character. finally, specific provision concern monetary policy current treaty well statute ecb escb remain unchanged form part constitutional text union. by contrast, budgetary economic policy remain national competence future constitution, recognition fact vast majority (cid:147)public goods(cid:148), defence, revenue raise subsequently dispensed, still provide national level. that said, draft constitution also prescribe close co-ordination economic policy within union. i much welcome fact fundamental feature current set-up emu preserved. after all, stability institutional architecture crucial element credibility single monetary policy public(cid:146)s confidence currency. conclude remark clearly government member state move forward forthcoming intergovernmental conference give final form text prepare convention. if i, central banker, allow present assessment, i would argue convention do good job incorporate substance emu chapter new constitution, also introduce clarifications, addition update current text necessary appropriate. what i miss convention take suggestion incorporate somewhere text notion eurosystem, stand core concept central bank system, i.e. ecb national central bank member state adopt euro. the eurosystem mention treaty stands, draft-constitution. conclusion: still work do....!!! thank attention. bi review 29/2003 1 toshihiko fukui: europe’s single currency japan’s contribution asian development speech mr toshihiko fukui, governor bank japan, occasion dinner french embassy, tokyo, 11 june 2003. * * * i. fight deflation i happy invite speak euro 50 banquet. my relationship europe date back thirty year ago. at time, i work bank japan(cid:146)s paris office. i vividly remember days, especially i take walk street paris, paint much history, culture esprit, i take rest read book relax atmosphere æ la place de vosges. actually, i ask ambassador montferrant look photograph i take visit recently office. i appoint governor bank japan three month ago. on day assume office, war iraq started. a i explain detail later, i think globalization could really fruitful, if, process, able overcome conflict different value jointly create new values. the outbreak war, however, seem expose flip side process. moreover, increase uncertainty world economy, therefore i prepare rocky start take new duties. good news see, iraqi war come end quickly accompany uncertainty waning, situation remain difficult. the government central bank world far reassure economy return rapidly sustain economic growth. we bank japan wag tough war deflation. indeed, top policy agenda. i spend total 40 year work central bank virtually period emphasis place prevent inflation. however, globalization advance it intensify global trend towards disinflation create new awareness among central bank must deal symmetrically inflation deflation. we bank japan stand front line war deflation. however, use great weapon central bank(cid:146)s arsenal, interest rates, decline virtually zero short-term markets. thus, spring 2001 step new territory, central bank ever ventured, namely (cid:147)quantitative easing(cid:148). here, two important points. the first set quantitative target form outstanding balance current account deposit bank aggressively supply abundant liquidity financial markets. the second make commitment maintain accommodative policy stance consumer price index register year year increase zero percent sustainable basis. the fundamental aim point low long-term interest rate across board borrow future monetary ease commitment. furthermore, explore way improve transmission mechanism monetary policy beneficial effect quantitative ease smoothly penetrate every corner economy. obviously, war deflation monetary policy alone. all economic agent must review legacy past high growth period make every effort enlarge capacity create value added. it become clear u find way deflation effort private sector, government, bank japan generate synergy endeavor. ii. interest europe i fear introductory remark might get long, i move on. in october 1970, shortly i arrive paris, werner report come out, officially advocate economic monetary union europe. frankly speaking, outsider, i consider grand idea economic monetary union, however grand would be, (cid:147)adventurous experiment(cid:148). no one could tell would go. therefore, i profoundly move witness introduction euro january 1999 2 bi review 29/2003 conversion cash euro last year. the emu another (cid:147)experiment(cid:148). the people europe gather wisdom courageously march forward turn dream reality. in regard, must remember particular effort make overcome (cid:147)euro pessimism(cid:148) late seventy early eighties. to me, single currency symbolize many things. the first great potentiality europe term (cid:147)creating history(cid:148). i nothing respect strong leadership persistent effort exert complete job, job require 50 100 year accomplish. second strong desire peace underlie spirit solidarity ever since european coal steel community. have suffer repeated, terrible wars, people europe strong resolution never go war again. third emphasis (cid:147)social discipline(cid:148) underpin solidarity europe. i think particularly well embody stability growth pact effort ensure independence ecb. i also much interest future enlarge eu. recently, (cid:147)convention future europe(cid:148) chair former french president valery giscard d(cid:146)estaing, advocate draft (cid:147)european constitution,(cid:148) creation (cid:147)european presidency,(cid:148) reduction number seat european commission. although recommendation add weight towards political union, i also find extremely significant light awareness age must (cid:147)overcome conflict values(cid:148). and economic front, i look forward see people europe lead eu(cid:146)s integrate market ever large entity form always open outside harmony globalization. iii. japanese contribution development asia compare europe(cid:146)s long history work towards regional integration, cooperation coordination asia still early stage, clear vision future yet emerge. in different americas, too, set course towards achievement free trade area americas. asia characterize diversity. we large number ethnic groups, languages, religions, cultures, considerable difference stage economic development. asia long way go could ever consider (cid:147)optimum currency area(cid:148). but diversity also asia(cid:146)s strength. economy comparative advantage create layer linkage trade direct investment, produce dynamism growth. and enable asia emerge one world(cid:146)s growth centers. china achieve remarkable economic growth past several years, give new momentum dynamic international division labor global economic growth. china enormous production capacity country sometimes perceive (cid:147)threat,(cid:148) but, time, note chinese big domestic market increasingly provide demand business opportunity neighbor countries. from point view, sustainability chinese economic growth become indispensable factor autonomous expansion asian economy whole, particularly east asian economy. at present, exception worry sars, condition asia look relatively good. economy east asian region grow increasingly rapid pace. for example, ratio intra-regional trade nominal gdp nine east asian economy double 8% late eighty 17% today. this ratio roughly eu. at begin remark i say globalization process overcome conflict value jointly create new values. the dynamism asia seem embody this. that is, asia place different value come contact create new knowledge process. against background, japan make progress steadily structural reforms, aim reach final goal become home high value added, hub gathering, create transmit information contribute development asia whole. here, let discus central bank job. in 1991, asian central bank establish emeap (executives(cid:146) meet east asia-pacific central banks), serf forum regular exchange information view among them. over weekend, i attend first emeap bi review 29/2003 3 governors(cid:146) meeting, i take away meet increase complexity challenge face central bank east asia, challenge cannot solve domestic remedy alone. along this, i also perceive grow momentum central bank pool wisdom act together solve challenges. these effort begin bear fruit. at begin month, emeap announce project asian bond fund invest part foreign reserve hold east asian central bank asian bonds, thereby serve catalyst great activity fix income market region. the bank japan support initiative actively participate fund. both dialogue cooperation among east asian central bank begun. it early tell whether dialogue cooperation eventually lead regional integration. even does, orientation integration unlikely europe(cid:146)s view historical economic difference two regions. however, take optimistic look future, steady effort may result formation open, flexible surprisingly well-organized regional economic zone within context (cid:147)future globalization complexity(cid:148). bi review 29/2003 1 the rt hon sir edward george: a broadbrush review uk economy speech the rt hon sir edward george, governor bank england, lord mayor(cid:146)s banquet banker merchant city london, mansion house, london, 18 june 2003. * * * my lord mayor, mr chancellor, my lords, aldermen, mr recorder, sheriffs, lady gentleman - dear friend colleagues. how many even ever run london marathon - perhaps could show hands? well course i (cid:133)(cid:133). never, ever contemplate moment. but someone complete describe surge adrenaline experience mile go, follow shortly afterwards near-exhaustion, finally collapse finish line! i think i(cid:146)m begin understand meant. if i arithmetic right - that(cid:146)s big (cid:147)if(cid:148) - i recently beat end math game group primary school child tower hamlet - i(cid:146)m right, 41 year bank, 27th successive attendance great annual banker merchant dinner and, you(cid:146)ll relieve hear, 10th last time i honour address capacity governor. and i like take opportunity thank - various organisation represent - tremendous support give bank many years. i must begin, gordon, thank you. in fact i(cid:146)ve immensely fortunate first ken clarke you, gordon, charge treasury time governor. you share conviction overall macro-economic stability - reflect consistently low inflation - necessary condition sustainable growth. that(cid:146)s conviction deeply embed soul lifelong central banker - indeed central banker i(cid:146)m allow admit soul! you inherit ken inflation target form cap degree transparency - public accountability - we(cid:146)d never before. and, own, first - inspire - decision chancellor, advance approach radically further. you - rightly - keep political responsibility set inflation target - opt crucially symmetrical point target. but devolve technical responsibility meet target new creation - mpc - appoint independent, external, expert field relevant monetary policy work team bank. and reinforce procedure transparency accountability. in term overall macro-economy framework serve u well. annual inflation - present rpix target measure - perhaps fortuitously - i don(cid:146)t really mind - average exactly 2.5% past 10 years. but consistently low inflation, also enjoy continuous quarter quarter gdp growth, 10 year first quarter, average four-quarterly rate 2.9% - well early trend. and rate employment recently around all-time high, number people claim unemployment benefit around 25 year low - that(cid:146)s true uk whole almost every region. of course hasn(cid:146)t plain sailing. we(cid:146)ve cope painful imbalance within economy past year result successive storm emanate overseas. and truly painful externally-exposed sector economy. to stay course storm persist we(cid:146)ve compensate external weakness accept - indeed positively encourage monetary policy - domestic consumer demand growth rate know could sustain indefinitely. we help recently - it(cid:146)s often you(cid:146)ll hear central banker say - timely increase public spending, consistent rule design ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability. without we(cid:146)d even dependent upon consumer. a year ago grind hop external storm begin abate, hope defer - after-effects corporate governance account failure u uncertainty associate war iraq. there nevertheless remain reasonable grind 2 bi review 29/2003 think external environment gradually improve move second half year next, help offset gradual moderation begin see growth consumer spending. that would open way continue relatively steady good balance growth - trend, inflation remain close target. but certainly short-term risk either side, give risk - include risk slow growth eurozone, particularly germany - i agree assessment economic case euro-entry yet made. more generally subject, i much welcome treasury(cid:146)s exhaust - i mean exhaustive - broad assessment longer-term pro con i hope, people time digest properly, result good balance - le polarise - debate economics euro question. i confess i hop would along narrow channel i describe past occasion charybdis external weakness scylla unsustainable consumer demand. and i(cid:146)m sorry respect jump ship particular point. but i(cid:146)m convince calm water lie far ahead. and i(cid:146)ve every confidence mervyn king - effect chief navigate officer much past decade, take skipper end month, outstanding mpc bank crew support - find way through. i certainly wish safe passage! my lord mayor, harsh international climate make life difficult u macro-economic front, associated, sustained, fall, global equity market particular, make unusually tough time many financial institution city. happily, too, recent sign improvement. perhaps truly remarkable thing financial system whole withstand pressure well did. but long time horizon city(cid:146)s financial institution respond remarkably well sustain market pressure change, outstandingly successful fulfil city(cid:146)s vital economic, social, function promote growth employment country across globe. one think lot reason success - i pick two particular. first, manage time maintain reasonable balance creative market dynamic one hand official intervention regulation other. it well understand market must (cid:147)fair(cid:148) well (cid:147)free(cid:148) job effectively - rule reflect public policy concerns. but equally understand that, carry far, prescriptive intervention stifle competition market appetite risk. in get balance right, market participant lot themselves. my impression certainly grow recognition high standard professional competence integrity vital firm(cid:146)s reputation commercial success, even survival - help limit recourse intervention. but it(cid:146)s also true critically important, longstanding, tradition country that, perceive need intervention, relevant authority consult extensively market help avoid unintended consequence ensure measure properly target approach. it(cid:146)s tradition others would well adopt. my second explanation city(cid:146)s success financial service non-discrimination. provide meet standard professional competence integrity expect london, make sense - fact would self-inflicted injury - distinguish firm individual work here, grind nationality ethnic religious background - or, case individuals, grind gender, point, lord mayor, i know make forcefully begin term

bankers(cid:146) association establish guild international bankers, follow open up, non-nationals, city freedom. it economic activity - nationality - generate employment income - even, chancellor, tax revenue - that(cid:146)s something, too, good understand many jurisdictions. it crucial approach continue - i doubt - future - whatever might hold. i also impressed, lord mayor, increase commitment among city firm - include many firm overseas - professional, also social responsibility. and context i greatly encourage widespread positive response bi review 29/2003 3 heart city campaign launch nearly three year ago encourage extend city corporate community involvement. i hope that, too, continue. so i take opportunity even express thank represent work u bank year many different ways, good

review 28/2003 1 thirachai phuvanatnaranubala: asian bond fund speech mr thirachai phuvanatnaranubala, deputy governor bank thailand, euro 50 group roundtable, tokyo, 12 june 2003. * * * mr. chairman, on issue asian monetary cooperation, thailand certainly le importance japan; therefore i apologize speak director-general watanabe. since late day time short, i try make interest go directly question answer session. however, i one ask questions, give answers. but i restrict five. the first question: there lot initiative financial matter go asia. doe mean aim monetary union sort asia soon, something lead single asian currency? i cannot speak asian countries, i know whether something plan advance countries, like japan korea, not. however, look eye someone thailand, part asean, final goal monetary union, exist, still around many corners. in opinion, level economic integration asia still much loose europe early stage integration. you may point rapidly expand inter-regional trade asia. but one look closely, one find good portion raw materials, parts, component produce one country sell another process assembly sale third country within outside asia. the production good final consumption asia still low, exception japanese korean brands. and china’s import asean increase substantially past years, consumption still mainly food products, raw material low value add products. for luxury goods, brand-conscious, asean product able compete well. this change time asian product gain differentiation sophistication. for example, moment, thai palm oil different malaysian. there mutual trade. but become part national cuisines, trade exchange could occur. the value added, asia trade eventual consumption. but moment, emphasis cooperation integration. so second question: if so, various monetary initiative go asia? the way i see even though level economic integration presently still fully advanced, financial linkage contagion affect high. part may fact asian country lend good deal money other. should disturbance occur creditor country, bank may tend rein reach preserve liquidity thus worsen affect borrower country. another reason may lender outside asia tend look asia block, differentiate one country another much. therefore, order lessen risk crisis contagion, find way asian country prevent crisis deal good imbalances. this mean deal good capital flows, rather sudden reversal capital flows. now come third question: which initiative effective deal capital flows? the asian government cooperate certain schemes. the chiang mai initiative whereby asian country sign swap agreement provide temporary finance emergencies. even though combine amount exceed $31.5 billion, still small compare volume foreign exchange trade world. we also system mutual surveillance, asian culture sometimes go direct confrontation particular issues. the best safeguard, opinion, therefore strong structure asian country deal financial shocks. this i attach much hope asian bond market initiative proposed. 2 bi review 28/2003 this lead fourth question: what asian bond market initiative? what involve? the asian bond market initiative view 2 levels. the first international level. the asian name issue bond international market quite time, major currency – mostly u dollar. this market already well developed. some people may say nothing need do asian government level. the market it. however, effort make ministry finance official introduce new product – perhaps securitization, combine asian name asian currencies, hop come attractive product. they hope bring new benefit bond investors, market determine whether idea bear fruit. the second level is, however, important. this local level – local bond market asian country – local currencies. the importance market see clearly event 1997 asian crisis. the first problem capital outflow. even though foreign borrow many industrial company thailand long term. but lot loan contract default clause imbed within. this allow foreign creditor recall loan early certain event occur. one example clause require borrower maintain debt equity ratio certain thresholds. if borrower make loss, eat debt equity ratio. when happens, borrower increase capital, face default. however, country face nationwide economic crisis, lot company would tend suffer loss time. and cannot together tap additional equity environment. this push defaults. a lot seemed, crisis, long-term foreign borrowings, therefore, suddenly become callable almost overnight. the second problem currency mismatch. unlike major countries, emerge market asia cannot borrow international market currencies. in case thailand, currency float 1997, depreciate 65 per cent back 40’s. many company u dollar debt force convert thai baht along way, suffer massive exchange loss result. it important factor, among others, cause npl ratio go high, peak 45 per cent. in future, local bond market could developed, make attractive foreign investors, could option foreign investor take foreign exchange risk instead borrowers. liquidity risk also less. if foreign investor want out, sell bonds. price fall. but borrower already money would affect sale secondary market. the third risk interbank market breakdown. at height crisis, foreign bank stop lend local banks. large local banks, turn, stop lend small banks. bank stop lend finance companies. the interbank market simply cease function fear default. in situation, central bank way act lender last resort. it could buy government bonds, bank bond sell one liquidity need. money go round. in situation, instead market corporate bond existed, financial institution would corporate bond hand - instead box loan contracts. they could sell bonds. they might incur losses. but least look midst crisis - regardless perception credit. the local bond market emerge asia, therefore, important safeguard help prevent crisis. and since want asian country become closely linked, lack crisis certainly good news. the bond market much good channel capital flow bank channel. if capital come banks, foreign lender may lend much. they may bet eventual government bail out. on hand, come bond market transparent well-managed, resource allocation could improved. however, local bond market attractive foreign investors, one accomplish many things. harmonization standard code international best practice must done. hedge market must available currency risk interest rate risk, may mean rethink capital controls. perhaps gradual step-by-step relaxation needed. bi review 28/2003 3 transparency also require price discovery management macroeconomy individual corporates. the legal system must respect creditors’ rights, investment product available sale across asian countries, uniform single passport consumer production sec’s must made. now come final question. what purpose asian bond fund? you may recall asian bond fund announce 2 june 2003 u $1 billion 11 central bank east asia pacific countries. initially invest sovereign quasi-sovereign bond issue asian government international markets. this already spark keen interest asian bonds. i know least one asian central bank invest asian bond before, jgb’s, start buy directly addition investment asian bond fund. thailand look also. i sure central bank asia outside look asian bond international level initiative. but nest step, asian bond fund extend investment various local bond market local currencies. the fund call asian countries. it ready invest, market build right conditions, remove impediments. and know last impediment removed, market attractive foreign investors. and since impediment often extend across many government department functions, well judicial system, strong political commitment remove them. so political commitment come forward? with money wait door, peer pressure available assistance within asia, i think good chance will. someone ask early much asian international reserve go asian bond funds. well, i hope lot. it job authority replace market. what authority try simply act catalyst. in long run, private money asia find way invest asia, whether save insurance company japan, mutual fund hong kong pension fund singapore invest corporate bond asia. will enough opportunity invest asia? certainly! many asian country still young populations. half thai age 30. demand construction, household product infrastructure strong many decades. there ample opportunity asian save find asian investments. bi review 28/2003 1 susan s bies: manage business risk speech m susan s bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, oregon banker association, independent community bank oregon, idaho banker association; sunriver, oregon, 16 june 2003. * * * thank invite participate joint annual convention oregon banker association, independent community bank oregon idaho banker association. one responsibility governor federal reserve board chair board's committee supervisory regulatory affairs. in role i apply knowledge bank continue task adapt federal reserve's supervision process meet need evolve financial service industry. today i want explore issue joint interest us, banker supervisors, think good manage risk inherent banks. first i'll focus issue arise event public company bank past eighteen month show weakness risk management practices. and i'll talk operational risk management evolve discipline strengthen corporate governance process banks. bank earn performance bank unite state experience two consecutive year record earnings, despite recession slow recovery, loss due exposure bankruptcy arise corporate fraud, record low interest rates. in 2002, return asset rise 16 basis points, 1.33 percent, high level three decades. the improvement earn roa even remarkable occur bank strengthen capital ratios. thus, banks' performance drive increase net interest margins, low relative cost comparatively constant loan loss provisions. the ability banker achieve record earn recession early part recovery reflect improvement risk management occur 1990s. this especially true relation credit asset/liability risks. operational risk different matter: bank deal loss arise operational issues, well-publicized event shown. operational risk "operational risk" relatively new term unique definition. in mid-1990s concept begin receive attention bank nonfinancial firm enterprise-risk management begin evolve. for purpose talk today, i go refer operational risk risk arise inadequate fail internal processes, people, system external events. example operational risk include employee fraud, customer lawsuits, fail information system conversions, mis-sent wires. operational risk always part banking. but great variety product service bank provide, evolution business processes, change ethical environment live contribute observable exposure type risk. an example grow use automate loan underwrite systems. when individual loan officer responsible make lend decision within establish credit guidelines, unexpected loss tend concentrated. that is, particular loan officer weak underwriter, portion loan portfolio generate individual show high delinquency charge-offs. management could address risk many ways, include provide additional train loan officer increase loan-review activities. today, many lend decision make automate systems. if model use underwrite weakness, systemic asset-quality problem arise. that is, high delinquency 2 bi review 28/2003 long isolate small portion portfolio manage one loan officer. instead, significant loss occur simultaneously across bank's loan portfolio. avoid problem "model risk" require more-rigorous oversight internal controls. the model back-tested verify factor us deliver level loss assume loan make priced. avoid model risk also require great data integrity loan application underwrite systems, data error also contribute unintended results. many bank today use credit-scoring model help mortgage consumer credit originations. although model show effective past year use, test serious consumer-led recession. in last recession, weakness asset quality - since - commercial loan side rather consumer side. during period, consumer disposable income continue grow. the test model come hit period significantly high unemployment fall incomes. then we'll able see credit model reliably predict credit losses. reputational risk another area risk receive attention recent event reputational risk. banker know critical element success customer investor perception organization's integrity. when customer select organization manage wealth financial transactions, essential expectation - privacy protected, transaction conduct timely manner, advice give reliable, asset invest appropriately consistently financial goal appetite risk. event past eighteen month show customer investor react quickly reputation tainted. many event reflect operational risk breakdowns. the case arthur andersen several lesson bankers, i want focus reputational risk aspects. a key component many banks' strategy use relationship managers. banker believe single point contact help customer identify range bank's services, provide consistent level service quality, increase cross-selling services. a result, customer retention increase profitability improve. arthur andersen similar relationship-management strategy. the

light result event debate surround sarbanes-oxley act. i want talk couple area - internal control assessment role outside auditors. since 1991, federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act (fdicia) require chief executive officer (ceo) chief financial officer (cfo) security exchange commission (sec) registrant report quality internal controls. one observation regulator make past year bank break internal controls, process report internal control become "paper pushing" exercise rather robust part corporate governance process. the relate lesson compliance similar requirement sarbanes-oxley require monitor bank regulator make certain goal strengthen accountability governance achieved. recently, federal reserve bank regulator make know expectation application sarbanes-oxley small, non-sec registrant banks. although require bank report internal control either fdicia sarbanes-oxley purposes, recent loss bank notable corporate scandal demonstrate sound governance internal control practice important banks. depend size, riskiness, complexity bank's business mix, element internal control framework develop committee sponsor organization treadway commission (coso) provide process help identify monitor area control strengthened. i describe way aspect process assist corporate governance community banks. fdicia come save loan failure series corporate governance scandal 1980s. in late 1980s, coso issue guidance best practice area internal controls, fdicia adopt framework. the management report internal control bank issue prepare manner similar coso framework. fdicia require year, manager step back look risk inherent business process manage, determine level risk exposure appropriate give profit strategic goal organization. once risk limit set, manager evaluate mitigate control monitor process see effective achieve designate level risk. manager also look organization's business plan see risk exposure expect change determine whether new controls, change exist controls, need manage level risk. finally, manager prepare action plan build modify exist control effectively manage risk. a manager complete report internal controls, report go chain command boss, repeat process manage areas. when report 4 bi review 28/2003 get top organization, ceo cfo issue final management report internal control bank regulators. further, external auditor review report attest validity. at fed, look report produce bank internal control breakdown lead significant losses. we find instance failure internal control know management mention management report. these failure include basic type internal control breakdowns, failure reconcile account timely fashion failure segregate duty critical transaction-processing account functions. in cases, external auditor identify

board governor u federal reserve system, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u.s. senate, 18 june 2003. * * * chairman shelby, senator sarbanes, member committee, pleasure appear morning behalf board governor discus basel ii, evolve new capital accord internationally active bank organizations. after five year discussion, proposal enter final stage public comment review, although still remain additional step process. why new capital standard necessary? the bank supervisor country believe basel i, current capital regime adopt 1988, must replace largest, complex bank three major reasons: (1) basel i serious shortcoming apply large entities, (2) art risk management evolve large banks, (3) bank system become increasingly concentrated. shortcoming basel i basel i major step forward capital regulation. indeed, bank country basel i, unite state augment it, - foreseeable future - adequate capital framework. however, small number large, complex, internationally active bank organizations, basel i serious shortcoming become evident time. develop replacement apply bank organization imperative. basel i simplistic address activity complex bank institutions. the framework four risk categories, loan receive regulatory capital charge even though loan make bank encompass whole spectrum credit quality. the limit differentiation among degree risk mean calculate capital ratio often uninformative might well provide mislead information bank risky problem credit or, matter, portfolio dominate safe loans. moreover, limit number risk category create incentive bank game system capital arbitrage. capital arbitrage avoidance certain minimum capital charge sale securitization bank asset capital requirement market would impose le current regulatory capital charge. for example, credit card loan residential mortgage securitized volume, rather hold banks' balance sheets, market require le capital, form bank credit enhancements, basel i require capital charges. this behavior bank perfectly understandable, even desirable term economic efficiency. but mean bank engage arbitrage retain higher-risk asset regulatory capital charge - calibrate asset average quality - average low. to sure, examination process supervisor still able evaluate true risk position bank, regulatory minimum capital ratio large bank become le le meaningful, trend accelerate. not creditors, counterparties, investor le able evaluate capital strength individual bank suppose risk-based capital ratios, regulation statutory requirement tie capital ratio le mean well. basel i capital ratio neither adequately reflect risk measure bank strength large banks. the evolve state art risk measurement management improve significantly beyond state art fifteen year ago, basel i developed. bank create new technique improve risk management internal economic capital measure order 2 bi review 28/2003 effective competitor control manage credit losses. but clearly bank go considerably further. one objective basel ii speed adoption new technique promote evolution risk measurement management harness regulatory process. increase heterogeneity concentration bank market pressure lead consolidation bank around world. our bank system immune; it, too, become increasingly concentrate small number large bank operate across wide range product geographic markets. the operation large bank tremendously complex sophisticated, markedly different product mixes. at time, significant weakness one entity potential severely adverse macroeconomic consequences. although insure liability decline time share total funding, organizations, scale role payment settlement system derivative markets, present authority increase moral hazard. it imperative regulatory framework encourage bank adopt best possible risk-measurement management technique allow considerable difference business strategies. basel ii present opportunity supervisor encourage large bank push management frontier forward. basel ii the propose substitute current capital accord, basel ii, complex predecessor good reasons. first, assessment risk environment grow number instrument strategy subtle difference risk-reward characteristic inevitably complicated. second, basel ii reform several objectives: u.s. supervisor try improve risk measurement management domestically internationally; link extent amount require capital amount risk taken; focus supervisor-bank dialogue measurement management risk risk-capital nexus; make transparent counterparties ultimately fund - hence share - risk positions. to achieve objectives, framework basel ii contain three elements, call pillar 1, 2, 3. the important pillar, pillar 1, consist minimum capital requirement - is, rule bank calculate capital ratio supervisor ass whether compliance minimum capital threshold. a basel i, bank's risk-based capital ratio basel ii would numerator represent capital available bank denominator would measure risk face bank, refer "risk-weighted assets". the definition regulatory capital form equity, reserves, subordinate debt minimum require ratio, eight percent, changing. what would different definition risk-weighted assets, is, method use measure "riskiness" loan investment hold bank. it modify definition risk-weighted assets, great risk-sensitivity, hallmark basel ii. the modify definition risk-weighted asset would also include explicit, rather implicit, treatment "operational risk." pillar 2 address supervisory oversight; encompass concept well-managed bank seek go beyond simple compliance minimum capital requirement perform comprehensive assessment whether sufficient capital support risks. in addition, basis knowledge industry practice range institutions, supervisor provide constructive feedback bank management internal assessments. finally, pillar 3 seek complement activity strong market discipline require bank publicly disclose key measure relate risk capital positions. the concept three mutually reinforce pillar central basel ii effort. scope application unite state the u.s. supervisory agency propose bank organization country remain exist basel i-type capital rule would continue explicit capital charge operational risk. early i emphasize basel i outlive usefulness large bank bi review 28/2003 3 organizations. how conclude bank remain rule base old accord? bank remain current capital rule to begin with, bank relatively straightforward balance sheet yet need full panoply sophisticate risk-management technique require advance version basel ii. in addition, various reasons, bank hold considerable capital excess regulatory minimums: more 93 percent risk-weighted capital ratio excess 10 percent - attain ratio 25 percent current regulatory minimum. no additional capital would likely hold institution require adopt basel ii. moreover, u.s. bank long subject comprehensive thorough supervision much le common country plan implement basel ii. indeed, u.s. supervisor continue interest review understand risk-measurement management process banks. our bank also disclose considerable information regulatory report account rule requirement security exchange commission; already provide significant disclosure - consistent pillar 3 basel ii. thus, balance cost impose new capital regime thousand bank benefit - slightly risk sensitivity capital requirement under, say, standardize version basel ii credit risk, somewhat disclosure - seem worthwhile require bank take step. country institutional structure different might clearly find universal application basel ii benefit bank system, think impose basel ii bank either necessary practical. bank move basel ii we entirely different view large complicate bank organizations, especially significant operation abroad. among important objective basel i propose basel ii promote competitive consistency capital requirement bank compete directly global markets. another important objective encourage large bank organization world continue incorporate operation sophisticate technique measurement management risk. a i noted, entity use financial instrument procedure adequately capture basel i paradigm. they already begin use - capability adopt - technique modern finance measure manage exposures; substantial difficulty one large bank organization could significant effect global financial markets, large bank use procedures. in view, prudential supervisor central banker would remiss address evolve complexity large bank ensure modern technique use manage risks. the u.s. supervisor conclude advance version basel ii - advance internal rat base (a-irb) approach measure credit risk advance measurement approach (ama) measure operational risk - best suit achieve last objective. under a-irb approach, bank organization would estimate, credit exposure, probability borrower default, likely size loss incur event default: - lender undrawn line credit loan commitment borrower - estimate amount borrow likely time default occurs. these three key input - probability default (pd), loss give default (lgd), exposure default (ead) - input would use formula provide supervisor determine minimum require capital give portfolio exposure. while organization would estimate key inputs, estimate would rigorously base empirical information, use procedure control validate supervisor, result would accurately measure risk. those bank required, choose, adopt a-irb approach measure credit risk, would also require hold capital operational risk, use procedure know advance management approach (ama) establish size charge. under ama, bank would bear primary responsibility develop methodology assess operational risk capital requirement. to sure, supervisor would require procedure use comprehensive, systematic, consistent certain broad outlines, must review validate bank's process. in way, bank's "op risk" capital charge would reflect 4 bi review 28/2003 environment controls. importantly, size charge could reduce action bank take mitigate operational risk. this provide important incentive bank take action limit potential loss operational problems. determine basel ii bank to promote level global play field, bank agency unite state propose forthcoming advance notice propose rulemaking (anpr) u.s. bank organization foreign exposure specify amount would core set bank would require adopt advance version basel ii. to improve risk management organization whose disruption would large effect global economy, would also require bank whose scale exceed specify amount. that is, bank meet either foreign exposure criterion asset size criterion would require adopt advance version basel ii, although bank meet one criterion also meet other. ten u.s. bank meet propose criterion core bank thus would required, proposal, adopt a-irb ama measure credit operational risks, respectively. a grow, bank could well meet criterion thus shift core group year ahead. we would also permit bank meet infrastructure requirement a-irb ama - ability quantify develop necessary risk parameter credit exposure develop measurement system operational risk exposure - choose basel ii. bank choose use a-irb ama would need consider several factors, include benefit basel ii relative costs, nature operations, capital impact, message want send counterparties risk-management techniques. we anticipate conduct review, ten large bank outside core group would choose adopt basel ii near term. thus expect twenty bank adopt advance version basel ii shortly initial implementation date. over time, large banks, perhaps respond market pressure face decline cost wide understand technology, may also choose capital regime, think cost-benefit assessment would induce small bank long time. our discussion rat agency confirm expect regional bank would find adoption basel ii cost effective initial implementation period. preliminary survey view bank equity security analyst indicate focus disclosure aspect basel ii rather scope application. to clear, supervisor intention pressure bank outside core group adopt basel ii. the ten core bank would require adopt basel ii, together approximately ten self-selecting bank anticipate would adopt shortly initial implementation date, today account 99 percent foreign asset two-thirds asset domestic u.s. bank organizations, rate coverage demonstrate importance entity u.s. global bank financial markets. these data also underscore commitment international competitive equity adoption best-practice policy organization critical financial stability minimize cost disruption purely domestic, less-complicated organizations. issue banker identify three key area concern: cost, competitive equity, pillar 1 treatment operational risk. cost implement a-irb ama country go expensive small number bank required, bank choose it, supervisors. for banks, great expense would establish mechanism necessary bank evaluate control risk exposure formally. the a-irb approach would eliminate losses: bank business take risk, risks, losses. but believe good risk-management require a-irb ama would good align risk return thereby provide benefit bank stakeholder economy. and, risk-sensitive capital requirement would assist ensure bank would sufficient capital absorb loss occur. the cost-benefit ratio look right supervisors. bi review 28/2003 5 this ratio enhance attribute basel ii cost associate adoption modern, formal risk-management system logical fallacy. the large bank would required, would choose, adopt a-irb ama must compete fund global marketplace thus already adopt many process would continue develop even without basel ii. the new accord may well appropriately speed adoption process, overall, cost adopt process force bank basel ii requirement business increasingly complex financial environment. in event, anpr include question design quantify cost implement basel ii. competitive equity a second key concern competitive equity. some concern u.s. supervisor would stringent application basel ii rule country would thereby place u.s. bank competitive disadvantage. to address concern, basel agreement establish accord implementation group (aig), make senior supervisor basel member country, already begin meet. it aig's task work common standard procedure act forum conflict addressed. no doubt difference application would unavoidable across bank system different institutional supervisory structures, supervisors, certainly federal reserve, would remain alert issue work minimize it. i also emphasize that, case today, u.s. bank subsidiary foreign bank would operate u.s. rules, foreign bank subsidiary u.s. bank would operate host-country rules. another issue relate concern among u. s. basel ii bank potential competitive edge might give bank would capital requirement low another basel ii bank. the essence basel ii design link capital requirement risk exposure individual bank. a bank hold mainly lower-risk assets, high-quality residential mortgages, would advantage rival hold mainly lower-quality, therefore riskier, commercial loan former low require capital charges. the capital requirement function risk taken, and, basel ii, two bank similar loans, similar require capital charge. for reason, competitive equity among basel ii bank country genuine issue capital reflect risk taken. under current capital regime, bank different risk profile capital requirements, create competitive inequity bank choose low risk profiles. the frequently voice concern possible competitive imbalance reflect "bifurcated" rule implicit u.s. supervisors' propose scope application: is, require basel ii a-irb ama small number large bank require current capital rule u.s. banks. the state concern observer bank remain current capital rules, capital charge risk sensitive, would competitive disadvantage compare basel ii bank would get low capital charge less-risky assets. the credit exposure might low regulatory minimum capital charge basel ii bank basel i bank. of course, basel ii bank would high capital charge higher-risk asset cost adopt new infrastructure, neither basel i bank would have. and bank might feel threaten could adopt basel ii would make investment require reach qualify criteria. but concern remain competitive equity propose scope application, one could present difficult trade-off competitive issue real significant. on one hand press need reform capital system large bank practical argument retain present system u.s. banks. against concern might unintended consequence disadvantage bank would remain current capital regime. we take latter concern seriously explore anpr. but, without prejudge issue, reason believe little competitive disadvantage would bring bank remain current capital regime. the basic question role minimum regulatory capital requirement determination price availability credit. economic analysis suggest regulatory capital considerably le important capital allocation bank make internally within organization, so-called economic capital. our understand bank price start 6 bi review 28/2003 economic capital explicit recognition riskiness credit adjust basis market condition local competition bank nonbank sources. in markets, bank relatively passive price takers. in either case, regulatory capital mostly irrelevant price decision, therefore unlikely cause competitive disparities. moreover, banks, especially small ones, hold capital far excess regulatory minimum various reasons. thus, change rivals' minimum regulatory capital generally would much effect level capital choose hold would therefore necessarily affect internal capital allocation price purposes. in addition, bank frequently express fear disadvantage bifurcate regulatory regime year face capital arbitrage large rival able reduce capital charge securitizing loan regulatory charge high relative market economic capital charge. the risk-sensitive a-irb fact would reduce regulatory capital charge area capital requirement high current regime. in areas, capital arbitrage already reduce regulatory capital charge. the a-irb would provide, effect, risk-sensitive capital charge lower-risk asset similar large bank year already obtain capital arbitrage. in short, competitive reality bank might change many market minimum regulatory capital charge would become explicitly risk sensitive. concern also raise effect basel ii capital requirement competitive relationship depository institution nondepository rivals. of course, argument economic capital drive force price apply case, too. it role reinforce fact cost capital fund le insure depository nondepository rival safety net. insure deposit access federal reserve discount window (and federal home loan bank advances) let insure depository operate far le capital collateralization market would otherwise require far le require nondepository rivals. again, basel ii would change market realities. let repeat i mean dismiss competitive equity concerns. indeed, i hope comment anpr bring forth insight analysis respond directly issues, particularly observation i made. but, i must say, need see reason analysis assertions. operational risk the third key area concern propose pillar 1 treatment operational risk. operational risk refer loss failure systems, controls, people will, first time, explicitly subject capital charge basel ii proposal. neither operational risk capital offset new concepts. supervisor expect bank manage operational risk time, bank hold capital it. under basel i operational credit risk implicitly cover one measure risk one capital charge. but basel ii, design risk-based system credit operational risk, separate two risk would require capital hold separately. operational disruption cause bank suffer huge loss and, cases, failure abroad. at time dominate business news even front pages. appendix 1 statement list ten large event recent years. in increasingly technology-driven bank system, operational risk become even large share total risk; bank dominant risk. to avoid address would imprudent would leave considerable gap regulatory system. a capital charge cover operational risk would eliminate operational risk capital charge credit risk eliminate credit risk. for risks, capital measure bank's ability absorb loss survive without endanger bank financial system. the ama determine capital charge operational risk principles-based approach would obligate bank evaluate operational risk structure flexible way. importantly, bank could reduce operational-risk charge adopt procedures, systems, control reduce risk shift risk others measure insurance. this approach parallel credit risk, capital charge reduce shift less-risky exposure make use risk-mitigation technique collateral guarantees. bi review 28/2003 7 some bank operational risk dominant risk oppose explicit capital charge operational risk. some organization tend little credit exposure hence small require capital current regime, would significant require capital charge operational risk explicitly treat pillar 1 basel ii. such banks, also whose principal risk credit-related, would prefer operational risk handle case case supervisory review buff capital pillar 2 basel proposal rather subject explicit regulatory capital charge pillar 1. the federal reserve belief would mistake would greatly reduce transparency risk capital important part basel ii would make difficult treat risk comparably across bank pillar 2 judgmentally based. most bank basel ii would apply unite state well along develop ama-based capital charge believe process already induce adopt risk-reducing innovations. presentation conference hold late last month illustrate significant advance operational-risk quantification make internationally active banks. the presentation make representative major bank europe, asia, north america, many presenter enthusiastically support use ama-type technique incorporate operational risk formal model economic capital. many bank also acknowledge important role play basel process encourage develop improve operational risk management.1 overall capital evolve basel ii before i move issues, i would like address concern combination credit operational risk capital charge u.s. bank basel ii would decline much prudent supervisory purposes. speak federal reserve board, let underline could support final basel ii felt cause capital decline unsafe unsound level large banks. that anticipate u.s. authority would conduct quantitative impact study (qis) 2004 supplement one conduct late last year; i anticipate least one two final implementation. it also cp3 call one year parallel (basel i ii) capital calculation two-year phase-in capital floor set 90 80 percent, respectively, basel i level full basel ii implementation. at stages, evidence suggest capital decline much federal reserve board would insist basel ii adjust recalibrated, regardless difficulty banker abroad supervisor countries. this state position board supervisor change process. of course, capital ratio sole consideration. the improve risk measurement management, integration supervisory system, basel ii, also critical ensure safety soundness bank system. when couple special u.s. features, prompt corrective action, minimum leverage ratios, statutory provision make capital prerequisite exercise additional powers, market demand buff capital, modest reduction minimum regulatory capital sound, well manage bank could tolerable. and, i note bank low risk profiles, matter sound public policy, low capital bank high risk profiles. great dispersion require capital ratios, reflective underlie risk, objective, problem overcome. i also underline basel ii design adapt change technology procedures. i fully expect year ahead bank supervisor develop good way estimate risk parameter well good function convert parameter capital requirements. when do, change could substitute directly basel ii framework, portfolio portfolio necessary. basel ii would lock risk management particular structure; rather basel ii could evolve best practice evolve and, were, evergreen. 1 paper conference available http://www.newyorkfed.org/pihome/news/speeches/2003/con052903.html 8 bi review 28/2003 the schedule transparency i would like say word schedule. in weeks, agency publish joint anpr ninety-day comment period, also issue early draft relate supervisory guidance bank full understand supervisory expectation carefully begin plan process. the comment domestic rulemaking well cp3 critical develop negotiate position u.s. agencies, highlight need potential modification proposal. the u.s. agency commit careful consider review comment received. when comment cp3 anpr received, agency review meet discus whether change require basel ii proposal. in november, schedule meet basel negotiate remain differences. i fear part schedule may tight may provide u.s. negotiator sufficient time digest comment anpr develop national position present negotiate partners. there may well slippage november target, slippage schedule unlikely great. in event, implementation country final agreement basel ii would require notice propose rulemaking (npr) 2004 review comment follow final rule end 2004. on parallel track, core bank potential opt-in bank unite state preliminary discussion relevant supervisor 2003 2004 develop work plan schedule. a i noted, intend conduct quantitative impact studies, start 2004, certain impact propose change individual bank bank system. a stand now, core opt-in bank ask fall 2004 develop action plan lead final implementation. implementation end 2006 would desirable, bank's plan base joint assessment individual bank relevant supervisor realistic schedule; bank adoption date may beyond end 2006 complexity require change systems. it preference institution "do right" rather "do quickly". we plan force bank regime ready, supervisor expect formal plan reasonable implementation date. at time period, slow schedule revise rule good reason so. the development basel ii highly transparent begin remain so. all consultative paper past five year support large number public paper document provide background concepts, framework, options. after previous consultative paper, extensive public comment follow significant refinement improvement proposal. during past five years, number meet banker hold basel nations, include unite states. over past eighteen months, i chair series meet bankers, often jointly comptroller hawke. more 20 u.s. bank late last year join 365 others around world third quantitative impact survey (qis3), intend estimate effect basel ii operations. the bank agency last month hold three regional meet banker would require adopt basel ii might interest choose adopt a-irb approach ama. our purpose ensure bank understand proposal option provide them.2 a i noted, one month bank agency country hope release anpr outline seek comment specific proposal application basel ii country. in past week also release two white paper help commenters frame view commercial real estate capital implication recognize certain guarantees. these, too, available web site. this dialogue banker substantive impact basel ii proposal. i attach statement comparison major provision basel ii propose three consultative document publish basel committee bank supervision (appendix 2). a see, commenters significantly influence shape detail proposal. for example, comment early propose crude formula address operational risk lead change way capital operational risk may calculated; banks' may use method assess form risk, long method sufficiently comprehensive 2 the document use presentation available board's web site, http://www.federalreserve.gov/banknreg.htm ("documents relate u implementation basel ii"). bi review 28/2003 9 systematic meet set principles-based qualify criteria. that ama. the mechanism establish capital credit risk also evolve significantly since first consultative paper basis industry comment suggestions; result, large number exposure type treat separately. similarly, disclosure rule simplify streamline response industry concerns. at stage proposal, comment base evidence analysis likely effective. perhaps example importance support evidence cause change position might useful. a member committee may know, federal reserve conclude earlier, basis supervisory judgment available evidence, risk associate commercial real estate loan certain exist complete property require capital charge high capital charge commercial real estate commercial industrial loans. in recent weeks, however, analysis additional data suggest evidence contradictory. with inconsistent empirical evidence, conclude that, despite supervisory judgment potential risk exposures, could support require high minimum capital charge commercial real estate loan exist complete property, so. in vein, also remain open mind proposal simplify proposal attain objective. both modification proposal cp3 change u.s. supervisory views, evidence commercial real estate proposal, testify willingness agencies, even late stage process, entertain new idea change previous view warranted. summary the exist capital regime must replace large, internationally active bank whose operation outgrow simple paradigm basel i whose scale require improve risk-management supervisory technique minimize risk disruption world financial markets. fortunately, state art risk measurement risk management improve dramatically since first capital accord adopted, new technique basis propose new accord. in judgment, alternative adopt, soon practical, approach supervision large banks. the basel ii framework product extensive multiyear dialogue bank industry regard evolve best practice risk-management technique every significant area bank activity. accordingly, align supervision regulation techniques, provide great step forward protect financial system nation benefit citizens. basel ii provide strong incentive bank continue improve internal risk-management capability well tool supervisor focus emerge problem issue rapidly ever before. i please appear today report effort near completion. open discussion complex issue heart basel ii development process outset continue characterize basel ii evolve further. appendix 1 (14

think importance financial system modernisation, specific reference africa particular sadc region. be central banker, i confront reach macroeconomic objective price stability, economic growth, balance payment equilibrium financial stability. a mammoth task indeed, live africa, one prof extremely challenge best times. most country africa confront press socio-economic problem poverty, unemployment, lack education, lack housing, famine, name few. one constantly tempt try address symptoms, face reality that, long run, problem solve address cause thereof. it widely acknowledge sound financial infrastructure prerequisite sound financial system, turn key factor increase economic growth potential country, region. give rapid rate globalisation dynamic nature thereof, tremendous pressure country modernise financial system compliance global trends, standard best practices, avoid leave behind dynamic drive faster, good safe financial transactions. today i hope affirm causal link sound modern financial system macroeconomic objectives, country, also whole sadc region. i go focus role central bank regard, payment service provider overseer financial system whole. finally, i would like use opportunity take stock country sadc stand whole modernisation process share view possible way forward here. from outset, however, i wish clarify i understand term (cid:145)financial system(cid:146). it often interpret physical infrastructure clear settlement systems, fact much wide concept encompass different financial markets, legal regulatory framework, role players, business processes, system technology require provide, support manage financial system country. why important build financial infrastructure? a sound robust financial system key contribute factor financial stability country. although definite causal link exist real economic stability financial stability, sound robust financial system play important role reduce risk distortion real economy develop financial crisis could even minimise adverse effect crisis event occurring. a sound robust financial system essential mobilise capital necessary sustainable economic growth. the major objective macroeconomic policy country level employment, price stability, gdp-growth measure economic growth equilibrium balance payments, especially open economy sadc region. domestic financial system weakness potential repercussion exchange rate stability balance payments. an unsound domestic bank system le capable provide efficient foreign exchange market complicate monetary policy decision make distort link interest rates, economic activity inflation. this implication make monetary target vulnerable policy errors. underdevelop develop economy dependant investment uncertainty soundness national payment system country may 2 bi review 27/2003 trigger capital flight deter foreign investors, thereby put pressure balance payment deepen economic recessions. this likely to, turn, adverse knock-on effect level employment general inflation level. furthermore, country conform international standard best practice regard financial system, risk isolation international economic community. globalisation global trend toward free flow trade investment across borders, result integration international economy. in globalise world, country afford isolated, room globalise world economy isolate world trade foreign investment. globalisation also bring many benefit access foreign capital, global export market advance technology much need underdevelop develop countries. these benefit positive social economic consequence fast economic growth, which, turn, alleviate poverty, lead high labour environmental standard facilitate democratisation. country resist globalisation, risk marginalized. in order become role player regional international trade, country ensure financial system stable, measure international standards. from regional perspective, problem domestic financial system often spill neighbour countries, especially country region involve close economic co-operation, one primary objective southern african development community. it therefore important region whole ensure financial system comply international best standards, would play large role facilitate regional integration. regional integration, know, hold number advantage participate countries. firstly, region benefit resultant expansion trade member state support simultaneous integration financial sector. close trade link country region also strengthen capacity participate world trade, allow country become competitive outside trade block. cross-border payment settlement facilitate removal unnecessary financial obstruction constraints. secondly, elimination geographic constraint facilitate extension service movement people across border finally, optimum use make scarce resources. the co-ordination share limit resource skills, technological infrastructure financial system contribute high rate economic development region whole. it also important international perspective, increase emphasis place financial sector global economy, sadc economy meet international expectation far possible area payment, clear settlement systems, bank supervision monetary policy. the role central bank the central bank(cid:146)s core responsibility economy maintenance monetary stability, ensure financial

see observed. regulatory/supervisory authority promote reliability, effectiveness integrity market infrastructure, particular payment transaction systems. the malawian experience payment system reform at juncture let briefly share experience malawi effort modernise payment system. the transformation payment system malawi influence great extent structural reform implement financial sector since early 1980s. these reform initiate malawi government part overall structural adjustment programme (saps) country implement since 1981 assistance international monetary fund world bank. the reform specifically aim make whole financial system responsive efficient adequately support development requirement country provide require financial resources. there also factor influence payment system reform malawi. these include: need attract foreign investor country, effect liberalise economic policy adopt 1990s introduction southern african development cooperation (sadc) regional payment system modernisation project committee sadc central bank governors. the introduction sadc payment system regional modernisation project add impetus reform process initiate saps. bi review 27/2003 5 the financial system malawi, like many develop countries, relatively small, underdevelop dominate financial player offer limit range services. the economy predominantly rural-based cash dominant mode payment. against backgroung effort gear towards promote use cash-less payment instrument line vision strategy. in order effectively coordinate reform process form mother body - national payment council (npc) chair reserve bank malawi. membership council include financial institution service provider like telecommunication company power supply company. thus major stakeholder actively involve payment system reform initiative malawi. we find critical importance view consider task forge country(cid:146)s payment system vision strategy share responsibility. through collaborative effort today make tremendous progress modernise payment system. the reserve bank malawi spearhead fully finance establishment proprietary wide area network (wan) infrastructure transaction switch - call malawi switch centre (malswitch). the switch centre, dream three year ago, reality major achievement. under malswitch model, malawi manage link commercial bank major player financial system single network infrastructure provide number product include following: smart card the smart card intend reduce cash usage. some commercial bank operate malawi enter agreement malswitch become issuer smart card. in addition, private company government department start pay salary employee smart card scheme. retailer merchant also actively use smart card. virtual private network (vpn) this part malswitch system

central real time inter-bank settlement processor (crisp) software. the crisp system malawi become live 19th march 2002. we initially start nine participant include reserve bank malawi, within one year period number participant increase eleven. the system work well meet requirements. government credit ceiling authority system (ccas) project the project automate government fund arrangement aim

electronically. electronic cheque clear house (ecch) project the ecch expect operational end year run malswitch infrastructure. the project spearhead commercial banks. 6 bi review 27/2003 since rtgs gather i think i also briefly share benefit derive crisp system one year period operational. the crisp system provide reserve bank malawi minute liquidity position financial market essential proper decision make far risk management concerned. in addition commercial bank able determine treasury position make inform investment decisions. the fast transmission fund crisp system also enable economic agent outside bank system make cost effective investment plan since fund long unnecessarily tie payment system case before. the crisp system also enable u retrieve timely manner statistic liquidity money market players. the statistic invaluable formulation conduct monetary policy. you agree absence rtgs system comprehensive statistic module, data liquidity might difficult well time consume acquire. this obviously lead misdiagnosis resultant wrong monetary policy prescription. before i conclude malawian experience i would like request participant discus share experience follow rtgs relate issues. (cid:1)(cid:2)provision intra-day liquidity one important aspect efficient rtgs system. in malawi reserve bank provide intra-day liquidity cost. some participants, especially discount houses, suggest intra-day liquidity free. these player hold liquidity reserve requirement (lrr) balance central bank. the question is, participant give preferential treatment? (cid:1)(cid:2)after establish rtgs system, appropriate cost recovery policy central bank adopt sustain operation system time ensure system affordable. malawi, particular would like learn others approach issue within countries. (cid:1)(cid:2)through use rtgs float bank use enjoy totally reduced. this use one source profit banks. after introduction rtgs alternative source revenue bank rely on? lady gentlemen, i also wish urge seriously debate issue relate role crisp user group often member meet. the issue tackle user group also discuss agreed. this particularly important stage avoid group simply social club. we need derive benefit assist ensure system efficiently managed. what status financial system modernisation sadc next steps? various step take help strengthen financial systems. on macro-economic level, sound, market-orientated bank financial system promote undertake structural reform necessary remove distortion economy weaken financial system undermine effective supervision. strong supervisory regime institutional strengthen supervisory agency country undertaken. country acquire high-quality payment settlement system market infrastructure effective clear book-entry systems, ensure reform support necessary legal reforms. more generally, country ensure general financial business practice process line international best practices. in take step modernise strengthen financial system country, help international institution international monetary fund, world bank bank international settlements, company specialise financial sector reform also employed. most country sadc region already take important first step develop sound robust domestic payment system, define payment system strategy development plan. many country already legal framework require support payment system place, five country sadc go already acquire real-time gross settlement system. seven others set move direction within foreseeable future. regular consultation country market participant important, especially regional level, ensure coordination policy strategies, also share view possibly learn one another. in order share view get input wide audience, bi review 27/2003 7 communicate achievement rest world, country may consider publish experience payment system reform by, example, publish so-called (cid:145)red book(cid:146) consultation bank international settlement objective provide clear reasonably comprehensive description country(cid:146)s payment systems. i would like challenge sadc country already undertake comprehensive payment system reform program since completion (cid:145)green book(cid:146) sadc payment systems, update outdated description publish (cid:145)red book(cid:146) reflect current status payment system country. and course, conference perago user group conference

european community. a prerequisite participate regional infrastructure country ensure domestic payment system sound robust, main focus sadc payment system project. perhaps need start think link rtgs-systems way take first step towards regional settlement interbank clear systems. conclusion in conclusion, i wish stress importance financial sector regional economic strategy. there need throughout sadc improve exist financial system order encourage domestic foreign savings, channel productive investments. sadc payment system initiative play role process promote co-operation role player financial sector. financial co-operation expect result great economy scale, pool expertise, enhance credibility reform process. it also lay groundwork financial integration initiative line. these initiative undertake part holistic integration process, also take account political economic reality face country southern africa. central bank work together establish sound basis full economic integration region. attention 8 bi review 27/2003 focus build compatible financial infrastructure region. the challenge mighty one, time sadc, well every country region, meet it. lastly, i would like commend perago take initiative form user group crisp system. i believe group prove valuable u member since able share view experience ensure efficient utilisation crisp system. i hope forum continue

seminar. i like urge management institution sustain and, improve legacy hallmark centre continue attract top management future programmes. judge antecedents, i doubt mind fitc assemble formidable team expert present seminar paper would explore different dimension seminar theme. distinguish participants, let caution one single factor contribute institutional problem lack effective governance. the issue good governance is, therefore, imperative ensure successful corporate performance. build good corporate governance share responsibility among stakeholders, may exert pressure move institution slightly different direction. in regard, although motivation various player different, mutually supportive. in establishment, good governance start owners, extend board management employees. no matter ownership is, need transparency accountability relationship stakeholders. in context, rule define governance responsibilities, incentive sanction face board, management staff must well articulated. board member hold accountable liable actions, impact interest stakeholders. the first major step create good governance player mutually agree common corporate goals, must specific, explicit consistent. in process trade-off delicate balance various interest groups. but goal determine respective role various player explicitly defined, incentive structure sanctions, must effectively monitor enforced. the recent widespread corporate scandal failure root dishonest management decision and, cases, outright cover-up illicit activity and, bring fore role, pursuit narrow group interest play wreck corporation and, consequently, life million innocent citizen stake them. in particular, development raise question responsibility board director ensure appropriate balance maintain

take moment outline challenge face director financial service sector regard meet expectation numerous stakeholders, include regulatory agencies. a regulator supervisor financial service industry nigeria, central bank come across unwholesome practice top management and, sometimes active collusion connivance board detrimental interest stakeholder organization. a good example large scale insider loan management staff, directors, major shareholder relation companies, eventually become non-performing and, thereby, impair operation institutions. i hasten add that, perfect world, director company serve check excess management, director collude involved, become difficult protect stakeholders(cid:146) interests. the situation compound management stronghold non-executive directors. give observe lapse system, cbn take position director would hold responsible/accountable misdemeanor part management institutions. director must live responsibility protect interest stakeholder alike. the norm now, world over, entire board remove failure/lapses perform role. the challenge you, directors, redress lapse financial service industry. when shareholder (or investors), whether major minority shareholders, invest, expectation company run accord sound business principle minimize possibility corrupt practice mismanagement. this expectation legitimate must protected. similarly, creditors, particularly depositors, decide part save expectation entrust fund trust honest management and, therefore, expect safety return forego consumption. when trust undermined, public confidence financial system erode entire economy become loser bad it. a i observe previous address bankers, valuable asset public trust confidence. therefore, always whatever take jealously guard it. we need learn recent encounter financial sector crises, recurrence utmost prevent. we also need draw lesson global events, particularly asian latin american financial crisis 1990s recent wave corporate financial scandal

bank, polish-swiss chamber industry commerce, warsaw, 16 june 2003. * * * 1. introduction last weekend polish people give green light poland(cid:146)s membership european union. this mean may next year country see crown political effort last 10 years: accession, alongside nine states, european union. i congratulate share happiness. the integration within eu country former eastern bloc certainly represent decisive milestone way create peaceful, secure prosperous europe. of accession countries, poland switzerland(cid:146)s important economic partner. trade two country double since 1995. poland switzerland also look back ten year continue fruitful cooperation within constituency international monetary fund. your eu membership integration help reinforce economic tie two countries. the polish poet nobel prize-winner czeslaw milosz say eastern europe generally know much west west east. i doubt especially true case, member polish-swiss chamber industry commerce. nonetheless, i hope able give fresh insight switzerland(cid:146)s position european framework. i shall first give brief overview present economic situation switzerland talk specifically relationship neighbour countries. a know, switzerland member european union. but mean island isolate place alps. second, i like focus switzerland financial centre locate heart continent challenge currently faces. finally, i shall outline swiss national bank(cid:146)s monetary policy degree freedom country fully surround euro zone. this question particularly relevant, since progressive globalisation switzerland(cid:146)s close economic link europe regularly raise question whether pursue autonomous monetary policy still appropriate. let begin current economic situation switzerland. 2. the economic situation brief in switzerland, elsewhere, boom late ninety follow prolong period stagnation accompany rise unemployment. not last year disappointing, 2003 also begin badly. give sluggish economic development, especially europe, force gradually downgrade forecasts. on exchange market, strength swiss franc additional factor create difficulty export sector. investment decline sharply international comparison, suggest excess capacity create late ninety particularly pronounced. the burst equity market bubble severe impact financial sector business flourish investment bank asset management sector slumped, result need radical structural reform consolidation. the swiss national bank respond difficult economic situation rapid massive ease monetary policy. in course last two year cut reference interest rate - three-month libor - 325 basis point practically zero. with mark slowdown economic activity appreciation swiss franc, inflationary pressure also easing. indeed, since spring 2001 inflation forecast indicate risk inflation limit year come, enable u bring significant reduction short-term interest rates. our expansive policy aim support demand limit upward pressure franc. 2 bi review 27/2003 so far see sign concrete recovery. we expect gdp stagnate 2003. growth accelerate end year follow strengthen world economy. basically, business cycle closely follow economic development neighbours: germany, france italy, absorb bulk foreign trade. let turn switzerland partner eu. 3. switzerland partner eu switzerland deeply integrate european economy. although member european union, close tie it. the eu account 60% export much 80 % imports. in 2001, one-third 30 billion swiss franc transfer abroad form swiss direct investment go eu, 80% foreign direct investment switzerland come eu. it therefore surprise swiss business cycle highly correlate activity eu, exchange rate swiss franc euro crucial importance us. close economic tie also mean close institutional co-operation. an initial step direction take 1972 free trade agreement conclude european economic community (eec). full membership never serious option. in 1992, swiss people even reject option become member european economic area. further progress make implementation, one year ago, bilateral agreement switzerland eu. the purpose set agreement secure switzerland sectoral access european single market. they cover seven issues, among agreement labour mobility agreement transportation. since middle last year new negotiation way switzerland eu ten issues. some (cid:147)left-overs(cid:148) first bilateral agreements, new issue raise either eu switzerland. the eu want adoption anti-fraud measure creation tax system switzerland would allow eu adopt regime exchange information tax authorities. on side, swiss seek improve cooperation area internal security asylum policy. the negotiation seven ten issue substantially completed. we hope second round negotiation conclude year, provide right balance strike overall package. you may well ask yourselves: doesn(cid:146)t switzerland simply join eu instead follow bumpy path bilateral agreement ? the reason still consensus switzerland question eu membership. winston churchill use say chauffeur: (cid:147)drive slowly. we hurry(cid:148). these word could apply switzerland(cid:146)s policy europe. eleven year ago swiss people vote (cid:147)no(cid:148) entry european economic area, many saw first step towards eu membership. two year ago referendum aim speed process towards eu membership likewise roundly rejected. since move would clearly lack political support within country, eu membership swiss agenda present time. there many reason switzerland(cid:146)s scepticism. many people see eu membership pose threat swiss federalism direct democracy. a full membership would also major impact monetary exchange rate policy. indeed, switzerland join eu, would abandon independent monetary policy currency. this would deprive u essential component flexibility set economic policy. we could long pursue interest rate policy gear need swiss economy. membership would also spell end interest rate advantage respect euro area, still stand one half two percentage points. this would entail loss swiss economy important competitive advantage. if grind hop enlarge eu lead great stability prosperity european continent, also conceivable large market open new opportunity switzerland. once bilateral agreement extend cover new member countries, economic relation enlarge eu regulate network bilateral treaties, case current eu. the swiss economy thus enjoy easy access greatly expand market total 450 million people. bi review 27/2003 3 however, eu enlargement also represent challenge switzerland. a large union need work joint position lengthy internal consultation decision-making procedures. it could thus become increasingly difficult u defend interests. enlargement therefore likely influence relationship eu. let move one key feature economy: financial sector, currently also face major challenges. 4. switzerland european financial centre since begin last century swiss financial sector mainstay economy. it account 6% total employment, currently generate 10% country(cid:146)s gdp. relatively speaking, therefore, twice big german french financial sectors, example. switzerland(cid:146)s globally active big bank insurance group also major international competitor market segments. the two big bank among world(cid:146)s ten large banks. in term value add financial sector, switzerland occupy fourth place behind new york, london paris, ahead frankfurt. switzerland play lead role banking, all, asset management. almost four trillion franc worth asset manage switzerland. this account around one-third world(cid:146)s portfolio cross-border investments. over last 10 years, financial institution also greatly expand activity abroad global basis. in 2000 value foreign investment amount 54 billion swiss francs, equivalent around 14% total swiss investment abroad. switzerland also magnet foreign banks. nearly one every two bank switzerland foreign-owned. foreign bank contribute around 2% switzerland(cid:146)s gross domestic product, make important swiss insurance industry even important than, example, watchmaking food industries. what reason switzerland(cid:146)s success financial centre? for century switzerland enjoy peace. this enable develop condition favourable economy whole, especially financial sector. among benefit political economic stability, relatively moderate taxation, reasonable regulatory environment, well-developed infrastructure and, least, independent monetary policy. the positive interaction various factor turn produce strong currency, low inflation, large current account surplus and, international terms, low interest rate level. these crucial factor maintain switzerland(cid:146)s attractiveness market invest. in addition positive macroeconomic environment, efficiency technical know-how equally crucial success. this apply particularly company expose intense global competition like bank industry. over many year swiss financial sector nurture quality efficiency, diversify globally orient range service highly educate workforce. technological innovation area electronic payments, electronic stock market automate settlement system give swiss bank comparative advantage term international competition. close cross-border cooperation establish european centres. our stock exchange blue-chips locate london, future exchange associate german exchange. while technical professional know-how important, integrity, reputation trustworthiness essence. swiss bank secrecy sometimes prove source misunderstand even tension relation partners. the objective bank secrecy protect private sphere enhance depositors(cid:146) confidence bank system. it aim encourage tax evasion protect fund dubious origin. a i mention early on, agreement taxation save recently negotiate eu. eu deposit swiss bank subject withhold tax whose proceed transfer country origin funds. within new tax regime harmful tax competition switzerland eu take place despite presence bank secrecy. 4 bi review 27/2003 the importance give integrity bank system also highlight effort make combat money launder terrorist financing. switzerland do much area protect good name financial centre. six year ago place commitment fight money launder statutory footing. our anti-money launder law serve today reference many countries. let move national bank(cid:146)s monetary policy significance euro. 5. switzerland independent monetary zone a case country today, swiss national bank pursue monetary policy independent political authorities. we regard independence key prerequisite successful policy. our main goal maintain price stability. thereby create basis rational investment expenditure decisions, contribute balance economic growth. price stability traditional objective policy decades, monetary strategy adapt change circumstances. follow transition float exchange rate 30 year ago, monetary policy base control monetary aggregates. we fight inflation far exceed today(cid:146)s levels. inflation could sustainably reduce second half 1990s, although monetary aggregate become increasingly unreliable monetary indicators. monetary policy need re-designed. in 1999, adopt new strategy base three elements: (cid:1)(cid:2)the first element explicit definition price stability: price stability achieve inflation, measure consumer price index, le 2%. we want achieve objective medium term since control inflation short-term basis would translate high cost national economy. a monetary policy gear medium-term price stability also help smooth cyclical fluctuations. in boom phase policy tend restrictive effect cyclical downturn tend expansionary impact. (cid:1)(cid:2)the second element inflation forecast. we publish quarterly forecast medium-term inflation. not forecast provide extremely valuable information future effect monetary policy; also play key role explain central bank action public. (cid:1)(cid:2)the third element publication target range three-month interest rate. the target range set parameter day-to-day implementation monetary policy. our experience new approach positive. we able enhance transparency monetary policy simplify line communication market. how take account fact switzerland fully surround euro zone? indeed, introduction single european currency start 1999 profoundly change environment monetary policy. but fear express euro introduce four year ago fail materialise. in particular, swiss franc volatile euro previously d-mark. immediately follow introduction euro remain remarkably stable year. this due part fact economy switzerland euro area strongly converge central bank pursue similar monetary policy. the franc really begin appreciate event 11 september. within short space time appreciate 5% euro. late on, way swiss franc move cause u concern numerous occasions. this lead u ease monetary policy last year well. it recently franc correct euro. the stabilisation geopolitical situation likely play major role this. all all, swiss franc appreciate 4% euro since introduction - much le originally feared. if one also take account inflation differential switzerland euro area, appreciation even modest. bi review 27/2003 5 our monetary policy concept enable u take great account development foreign exchange market communicate intention openly. we not, however, actually seek manage exchange rate. only rare exceptional occasion - extreme appreciation franc late 1970s - explicit exchange rate target make sense switzerland. the frequently express concern introduction euro would mean disappearance interest rate differential swiss franc euro investment also prove groundless. it fear that, order keep exchange rate stable, national bank would force shadow policy ecb, and, low exchange rate risk, interest rate differential swiss franc euro investment would gradually narrow. this occur : short-term long-term interest rate switzerland still around 2 1.5 percentage point respectively apply euro area. we continue pursue independent monetary course. conclusion against background persistent weakness international economy, switzerland stick rut well. in past month revise forecast downwards number occasions, recently last week(cid:146)s quarterly monetary policy situation assessment. for year whole forecast real gdp stagnate. even modest projection presuppose economy pick second half-year. there still considerable risk regard. the exchange rate remain also significant downside risk. although geopolitical situation ease since end war iraq, cannot rule franc come renew upward pressure safe currency. in present context business stagnation, recent correction exchange rate franc euro bring currency back realistic level, good news export industry. the current weakness dollar, although expect time, cause concern u especially come unfavourable time. we watch therefore exchange rate development closely. in present economic situation easy identify positive factors. one definitely environment price stability strong competition keep inflationary expectation historical low level. a result, monetary policy remain expansionary. this clearly case switzerland. a second positive element structural adjustments. in switzerland, private sector adjust courageously new low-growth environment price/quality ratio become key factor success. i think economy well position benefit fully upturn international trade. last least - join poland - main source hope lie europe. since switzerland heavily dependent exports, sluggish economic performance europe, especially germany, major cause concern. but sign hope : german government consider reform programme increase potential growth, manufacture order improving; france gdp growth positive; uk industrial production accelerate again. we expect gradual improvement overall economic picture progressive strengthen consumer investor confidence. only renew confidence future lead u delicate phase economic stagnation. in respect, decision take country important poland join eu 2004 trigger factor. no doubt join eu next year give polish economy additional boost. but accession also contribute create dynamic competitive europe. and common interest. bi review 26/2003 1 susan s bies: strengthen compliance effective corporate governance remark m susan s bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, american banker association, annual regulatory compliance conference washington dc, 11 june 2003. * * * good morning. i thank invitation speak american banker association regulatory compliance conference. since come federal reserve board, i spend much time deal corporate governance, internal control, risk management issues. today, i would like talk important role compliance function play bank organizations, current emphasis improve corporate governance opportunity strengthen compliance function organization. introduction over past two years, shock headline announce corporate governance account problem variety companies, enron, worldcom, healthsouth. a read headlines, question come mind is, "what underlie deficiency internal control process company render governance practice ineffective?" a detail scandal make public, become clear exemplify breakdown fundamental system internal control. why, then, see many headline highlight corporate governance account problems? because company lose track basic effective corporate governance - internal control strong ethical compass. while company effective governance process place, event remind u importance basic well. internal control framework after early series corporate frauds, national commission fraudulent financial reporting, also know treadway commission, create 1985 make recommendation reduce incidence type frauds. the committee sponsor organization (coso) treadway commission issue report title internal control - integrate framework become most-referenced standard internal control. if one re-reads report, need return focus basic become clear. the report define internal control as: process, effect entity's board directors, management personnel, design

canada, german-canadian business club berlin-brandenburg berlin, germany, 5 june 2003. * * * it honour privilege address german-canadian business club berlin-brandenburg inaugural meeting. group one serve many important purposes, least development trade link help strengthen economy countries. create strengthen international trade link one key success canadian economy recent years. but much story. so i propose today talk economic policy canada put place recent year and, so, touch challenge still face. canada's monetary policy framework let start policy area bank canada responsible - monetary policy. the preamble bank canada act call u conduct monetary policy "in best interest economic life nation," "to promote economic financial welfare canada." we know much demand lead inflationary pressures, little demand mean resource wasted. so aim conduct monetary policy, insofar monetary policy influence demand, economy operate close level potential output. over time, find best contribution monetary policy make try keep inflation low, stable, predictable, order provide best set strong sustain economic growth. the question becomes, what central bank target try bring about? follow canada's return float exchange rate system 1970, bank canada try achieve low-inflation environment target growth money 1975 1982. but relationship money growth rate inflation prove unstable. so, 1991, bank adopt explicit inflation-targeting approach. under joint agreement federal government, aim keep consumer-price inflation 2 per cent midpoint 1 3 per cent range. if trend inflation move away target, bank take action return inflation target within 18 24 months. our framework symmetrical. this mean worry much inflation fall target rise target. through last decade, succeed keep inflation close target. and so, canadians' expectation inflation become anchor around 2 per cent. all help smooth up down economy create best possible environment longer-term economic growth. this framework may sound simple theory. but quite complex practice. our monetary policy decision base economic projections, always throw unforeseen events. because monetary policy action take time full impact economy, must aim action see economy sit 18 24 month future. in so, always look call output gap - difference actual level production economy level potential output. if economy operate potential capacity inflation appear likely target future, would tighten monetary policy. this would cool demand bring inflation back target. on hand, economy operate potential capacity inflation appear likely target future, would ease monetary policy order stimulate demand, close output gap, bring inflation back target. this mean always look demand supply economy try bring balance. so, carry policy, large part analysis concern many factor influence demand supply. the important factor is, course, strength domestic demand. but canada trade nation, strength world demand also important us. in particular, unite state major customer canadian goods, closely monitor health u.s. economy. 2 bi review 26/2003 economic activity also affect movement exchange rates. a well know, recently significant adjustment value u.s. dollar major currencies, include canadian dollar. a always, need understand cause movement, well effect canadian economy. furthermore, movement exchange rate direct effect price trade good service and, therefore, inflation. however, research show that, economy canada's, effect exchange rate movement consumer price le pronounce recent years, inflation relatively low, case early years, inflation high. many consideration go monetary policy decisions. we hear bank's regional office across canada, constant contact canadian businesses. we look economic clue data credit conditions, monetary aggregates, asset price - though i make clear target aggregate asset prices. finally, look expectation financial markets. all information go decisions, always goal aim inflation 2 per cent target medium term. and i say earlier, convince keep inflation low, stable, predictable best way monetary policy contribute healthy economy strong endure economic growth. the case flexibility but need ensure economic health. a doctor tell that, besides strength endurance, healthy body need flexible. the true economy. financial policy-makers need encourage strong sustainable economic growth, also need work improve economic flexibility. at outset, i speak briefly trade. remove barrier trade one important way make economy flexible. we know free international trade help country fully exploit gain come increase competition specialization. it true adjust free international trade always easy. canada's economy make difficult adjustment canada-u.s. free trade agreement come effect 1989 north american free trade agreement add mexico group 1994. both agreement spark great deal domestic political controversy. many canadian company understandably concern ability compete. but despite initial misgivings, canadian company rise challenge. some sector use protect - furniture, clothing, wine - since establish strong presence international markets. overall, canadian export flourished. the success strengthen resolve see free trade extend beyond regional trade blocs. canada hop see meaningful progress world trade organization's doha round multilateral talks. clearly, agriculture go major hurdle. the develop countries, include u g-7, considerable way go term liberalize agricultural trade. and sector major effort required. this effort must make global economy benefit. it easy, but, long run, worth it. improve economic flexibility also require structural reform. improve structure economy help u adjust change world economic conditions, also ensure longer-run viability social- income-security arrangements. clearly, structural reform easy accomplish. adjustment difficult reform often affect different group painful ways. further, economic benefit increase flexibility may take fairly long time emerge, make hard muster political carry need reforms. but difficulty sway u task reduce rigidity increase efficiency. in canada, make progress number front past decade so. in early 1990s, canada begin reform system unemployment insurance, reduce restructure benefit view strengthen incentive work. in mid-1990s, industrial subsidy slash roughly two-thirds. in 1996, canada's federal provincial government agree change would put canada quebec pension plan sustainable footing. this mean restructure benefit sharp increase contribution - move popular, necessary. in 2000, federal government implement five-year, $100-billion tax-reduction bi review 26/2003 3 plan low personal corporate tax rates. and last federal budget, government announce canada's tax capital phase out. i would remiss i also mention canada clean public sector balance sheet 1990s. many difficult unpopular decision taken, federal provincial governments. but canada turn vicious circle rise deficit debt virtuous circle balance budget fall debt. reducing, ultimately eliminating, deficit 1990s help canada's international credibility lead reduction risk premium demand investors. the fiscal improvement give bank canada flexibility low interest rate easily economic circumstance warranted. not low interest rate reduce debt-servicing costs, also stimulate economic growth, bring revenue government. the extra revenue low debt-servicing costs, turn, lead even good fiscal position. early year, canadian finance minister john manley announce sixth consecutive surplus federal budget project budget continue balance year next, despite slower-than-expected growth. the federal government commit follow prudent path budget planning. canada expect one low debt burden g-7 year. not reduce debt-to-gdp ratio, pay almost $50 billion federal debt. this free $3 billion resource every year federal government. the main point that, initial work fiscal consolidation certainly difficult, necessary order enjoy dividend late on. conclude remark these policy i've mention - fiscal consolidation; monetary policy focus low, stable, predictable inflation; improve flexibility trade liberalization structural reform - difficult implement. put canada's strong economic policy framework place involve short-term pain. but economic performance recent year compel evidence, opinion, policy right one follow. i want suggest we've achieve perfection canada. far it. there much done, particularly regard microeconomic policy. nor i want suggest precise way we've implement policy follow every country. instead, message i want leave are: economic principle important, implement difficult, economic payoff ultimately worth effort. in time global economic uncertainty, natural tendency put difficult reform backtrack hard-won policy gains. but precisely difficult time important stay course. canada commit stay course build strong, vibrant, flexible economy. bi review 25/2003 1 howard davies: be global regulatory system fit purpose

singapore: many lse alumnus mas, singapore generally, i continue sound excuse visit. you kind enough give freedom choose subject today. in i pose question. be global regulatory system fit purpose 21st century? we could save time i answer ‘yes’ ‘no’ sit down. but i indulge reflections, base eight year regulator, i give consider response. the asian crisis aftermath in immediate aftermath asian financial crisis 1997-98, widespread call fundamental reform international financial architecture. it argue trauma korea, indonesia thailand, point fundamental weakness international financial system. these country relatively sound fiscal positions, enjoy rapid economic growth, yet crisis confidence hit, financial system collapse alarm speed. this experience, take international financial institution surprise, appear demonstrate imf’s financial surveillance inadequate, crisis management tool similarly lacking. though also appropriate point market see crisis come either. there like jeffrey sachs and, different perspective, joe stiglitz, use failure mount major assault policy practice fund many years. these dispute rumble on, stigiltz’s ill-tempered ad hominem attack stanley fischer (in globalization it discontents) demonstrated. personality-driven dispute entertain press. but important question remain whether institutional framework oversee financial markets, seek prevent crisis and, prevention fails, manage them, adequate. open financial market always prone bout irrational exuberance, enough contain collateral damage excessive volatility cause? some academics, notably john eatwell cambridge, argue need fundamental recast international financial institutions. he favour creation world financial authority charge set regulatory framework financial market across globe, endow power intervention crisis threatens. his argument persuasive, seem unlikely country prepare cede sovereignty authority scale would necessary make work effectively. there many le ambitious proposals, within imf world bank, individual countries. for time seem though creative department every 2 bi review 25/2003 finance ministry world – oxymoron – engage kind architectural competition draw new set relationship international financial institutions, member countries, key regulatory organisation financial sector. on face it, change make result frenzy creativity modest. no major new institution set up. but one potentially significant development establishment financial stability forum, response report commission g7 finance minister han tietmeyer, retire president bundesbank. the forum include finance ministries, central bank main financial regulator g7 countries, together representative various “trade unions” regulator basel committee bank supervisors, international organisation security commission (iosco) international association insurance supervisor (iais). singapore, along hong kong, australia netherlands, also present representative major financial centre chair iosco’s emerge market committee currently participate ensure emerge market input, though security perspective. with establishment fsf, first time financial regulator bring surveillance game, reflect lesson 97-98. the forum, name suggests, charge monitor financial stability, act venue exchange information common assessment vulnerability international financial system. it not, however, hold authority member countries, indeed regulators. it would therefore hard describe even one step direction world financial authority. the forum also role management crisis may still occur. in addition fsf, tinker committee memberships. for example, group 22, fact grow 33 members, scale back become group 20 – though actually include 19 country european union, make 34! that momentous change, 1999, obviously make world safe place. the found g20 did, however, represent recognition international community solution global financial pressure reach well beyond g7. singapore represent g20. nor regulator like fsa. nonetheless, group, compose finance minister central banker develop emerge markets, useful obtain emerge market high-level political buy-in initiative arise elsewhere financial system. the g20 agreed, principle, undergo imf financial sector assessment program (fsap) evaluation and, current chairmanship mexico, look economic growth role institution - build financial sector along crisis management, transparency, combat terrorist finance development issue broadly. these institutional adjustment look fundamental. but change surface might suggest. perhaps importantly, broad, albeit universal, international consensus develop soft currency pegs, fix exchange rate regimes, are, combination adverse policy mix, highly likely contribute financial crises, highly unlikely protect country financial market implication poor economic fundamentals, unstable financial systems. the second important development, le widely discussed, yet may equal significance, radical change focus imf’s surveillance work. in institutional term change focus highlight creation new capital market division fund, prepare regular global financial stability report. that document, attract little international attention far, brave attempt fund’s staff, reinforce new recruit financial market gerd hausler, late dresdner bank, focus attention potential source financial instability institution markets. that means, times, draw attention weakness bank insurance system even g7 countries, hitherto difficult territory imf. yet important so, wholly potential benefit g7 country themselves, also show develop country take medicine impose others. this second major change imf rapid expansion work financial regulation. the fund commit prepare financial sector assessment (fsaps) member countries, indeed non-members too, significant offshore financial centres. these assessment review effectiveness regulatory structures, financial regulation adherence internationally accept financial sector core standard codes. bi review 25/2003 3 what rationale activity, consume significant proportion fund’s resources? the asian crisis demonstrate poorly regulate financial systems, particularly bank systems, could cause crisis, even macro-economic position might look relatively stable. in case country like indonesia, korea thailand become clear event bank heavily expose currency risk unhedged dollar borrowings. furthermore, regulator country pay little attention mismatch, indeed little attention credit quality. in many case bank far close company lent. there rapid expansion connect lend little police large exposures, bank highly vulnerable individual corporate collapses. that, turn, precipitate crisis bank system turn economic adjustment full blow systemic collapse. certainly, take time imf assessment programme bear fruit crucial turn initial assessment effective long-term mitigation implementation strategies. this require political commitment and, appropriate, technical assistance. but sign develop country appreciate importance independent system financial regulation, finance minister’s best friend may necessarily right choice head bank supervision, particularly family own large slice bank system. a new agenda change so architecture may remain fundamentally same, plumb financial system undoubtedly improved. this unromantic work, crisis hit middle night, unpleasant odour emerge system, plumber call, architect. however, reasonable ask whether change sufficient reduce incidence financial crisis future enhance ability manage crisis will, inevitably, occur. i propose today try cover issue might raise general question. i certainly plan talk fiscal monetary policies, long area expertise. i also leave one side important development bankruptcy insolvency procedures. the imf’s sovereign debt restructure mechanism (sdrm) proposal seem shelve time but, judge recent successful bond issue mexico brazil, solid progress clearly make collective action clause allow timely orderly restructure sovereign debt case problems. however, subject are, say, pay grade. i concentrate instead regulatory dimension. i propose radical agenda. regulator normally revolutionaries. but i believe area change could beneficially made, would effect strengthen international financial architecture, benefit u all. there four area i would like see improvements. first, need comprehensive set international account standard attract broad support, high quality independent audit help enforce them. second, role financial stability forum could develop strengthened. third, link change, gap global regulatory system could plugged. fourth, need find way bring develop economy closely process set standards. i say word two suggestions. (i) account audit account standard foundation stone financial system, financial regulation. without account number investor confidence regulation, cannot hope effective. and account must audit objectively independently. since reformation international account standard board three year ago determine effort way, lead paul volcker david tweedie, complete standard set 4 bi review 25/2003 secure broad agreement acceptance around world. they close success, difficult obstacle still overcome, notably question treatment financial instrument (ias 39). i much hope acceptable solution soon found. it would great pity opportunity missed, without satisfactory account financial instrument ia unlikely accept us. the relate subject audit also need attention. we know recent year auditor allow public interest role forgotten, u elsewhere. there need strong oversight profession, nationally internationally, great public interest involvement process. at present, regulation discussion international federation accountant explore way involvement might structured, financial stability forum take close interest, follow debate march meeting. i confident progress made, profession appreciate urgent need rebuild confidence integrity. ideally, too, need diverse audit industry. i nervous lack competition choice result consolidation four firms. we cannot afford mergers, indeed failures, vulnerability itself. (ii) develop role financial stability forum the financial stability forum develop original idea gordon brown, i mention early articulate report g7 finance minister han tietmeyer. it one forum regulator come together finance ministries, central bank international financial institutions, specifically look financial stability issues, resolved. in first four years, fsf make progress. it work offshore centre certainly lead improvement regulatory standard number centres. and stimulate security insurance regulator work quickly, determine way previously case. i first hand knowledge impact. but could done. it remain difficult slow agree priority forum’s membership. i also think could usefully take somewhat broad view responsibilities. the forum could coordinate activity sectoral international regulator contribute priority-setting. it could use privilege link g7 finance minister bring political impetus work body represent it. iosco iais, example, structural link ministers, central bankers. the forum well place identify weakness regulation, whether member state internationally. this would involve duplication effort, fear, rather addition urgency focus work already way. it could usefully play role follow imf’s financial sector assessment programmes, perhaps individual countries, draw general conclusion strength weakness reveal assessment round, overall effectiveness national follow-up. there sign forum’s membership begin favour pro-active approach, progress slow. but recommendation rather beg question weakness are, bring third point. (iii) plug gap i believe identify gap defence financial instability, could plugged, there. there time today comprehensive overview, let identify small number issue i believe need resolved. one important lacuna absence global regulatory regime reinsurance companies. in countries, uk, reinsurance firm directly regulated. in others, regulate indirectly, insurers. in yet country subject meaningful regulatory regime all. it may argue live uneven coverage time. but evidence suggest reinsurers take credit risk before, often transfer bank system derivative credit default swaps. so bi review 25/2003 5 cannot gain full picture financial risk transfer around global system, without clear view balance sheets, risk management large reinsurance firms. progress make international association insurance supervisors, european union consider directive regularise position europe. but yet. a second, relate area issue credit risk transfer role derivatives. this subject entertain exchange warren buffett alan greenspan, last couple weeks. to simplify grotesquely, warren buffett belief credit derivative generate new risk financial system; alan greenspan belief one reason financial instability period market highly volatile. this difficult debate take sides. my view neither proposition rigorously prove stage. so cautious recommendation regulator need know derivative used, credit risk end result. in particular, need know whether regulatory arbitrage one cause – whether risk migrate sector inadequate capital requirement type risk. that subject many fsf member agree knowledge base inadequate. so far international regulatory community successful get grip extent possible systemic problem. it gap need fill quickly. similarly, i sure know enough hedge fund market. i chair work group highly-leveraged institution financial stability forum, report couple year ago. our conclusion need good risk management hedge fund counterparties, good risk management highly-leveraged institution themselves, enhance public disclosure institutions, relate changes. i one belief hedge fund inherently dangerous beast financial jungle. indeed many case hedge fund useful prepare take positions, sometimes counter-cyclical positions, help stabilise markets. but sector grow dramatically, long-term capital management problem showed, leverage uncontrolled, even one fund alone destabilise factor. so i believe case direct regulation hedge fund make out, i think need transparency, particularly extent leverage, recommendation effect early report effectively implement yet. it encourage new chairman sec hold series roundtable subject new york. lastly, brief review, i would identify significant gap consolidate supervision large diversify financial groups. bank supervisor learn bitter experience consolidate supervision group essential understand totality risks, interaction different part group. yet still major international firm without consolidate supervisor. in europe, financial group directive (fgd), seek fill gap, european union itself, require firm operate eu supervise consolidate basis globally, construct european entity supervise way. through fgd therefore attempt mitigate risk see non-consolidation, would clearly good risk could mitigate global scale. (iv) expand role develop economy the fourth arena i think could do relate role develop country international financial architecture. if properly involve clearly risk standard may develop inappropriate, complex implement develop countries. how well interest represent present key decision make bodies? i mention fsf, though originally conceive g7 body, quickly choose add representative significant financial markets, include hong kong singapore. i also note creation ministerial level g20 attempt reach beyond narrow locus g7 involve key emerge market global financial sector developments. for part, international financial institution also recognise exclusively beltway, “euro-centric” view long-term interests. the imf establish tokyo office basel-based bank international settlement add outpost hong kong mexico. 6 bi review 25/2003 but level regulatory standard set bodies, picture uneven. in iosco, security regulator trade union, key technical committee include hong kong mexico. it also include australia, british think still develop country, even australian don’t! and include chairman emerge market committee iosco who, i note above, also participate fsf. the executive committee, technical committee report even broad membership including, example, people’s republic china. the iais, insurance supervisor organisation, currently limit participation technical committee, – iosco – overall responsibility standard setting. a number emerge market active participant technical committee addition contribute work separate emerge market committee. however, involvement “nuts bolts” work standard development variety subcommittee clearly limit resource constraints. this issue concern us, bite immediately emerge markets. when come bank supervision, composition basel committee rather different. in theory g10 body, 12 national members, 9 european. and, good measure, two european observers, european commission european central bank. the committee work hard discus emerge conclusion revision capital accord broad range countries, notably core principle liaison group include number emerge markets. but i cannot help think that, future, basel committee’s full membership need change. the original justification member come country home internationally active banks. but country play host bank today, future. i believe that, general point, want put pressure develop country adopt high standard supervision (and i one belief right put pressure sense) need ensure standard-setters broadly representative, see appropriate legitimacy. and question optics. we need guard risk committee selection sophisticate economy devise standard capable easy implementation elsewhere. this matters, issue inclusivity political correctness, common, mutually agree standard key facilitate capital flow internationally. and efficient allocation capital internationally vital develop develop country alike. but recognise, once, committee compose 150 member every

number problem bank remain 120, actual failure remain quite low, ten last year. corporate governance base current condition industry, might ask what's supervisory agenda focus attention? although number supervisory issue require attention, two specific area - corporate governance quality assurance audit process - i believe focus supervisory attention. over past two years, corporate scandal focus attention deficiency corporate governance major companies. the reform sarbanes-oxley act 2002 focus need enhance governance, accounting, disclosure practice public companies, result dialogue focus attention need improve governance practice companies. the security exchange commission launch significant regulatory reform initiative address issues, bank agency actively involve dialogue sec matter mutual interest. the focal point dialogue implement practical step move corporate governance practice public nonpublic company forward, particularly regard adequacy internal control audits. i want focus rest remark step take improve quality assurance process surround internal control audits. internal control the essence corporate governance ensure company operated, times, manner manage risk, achieve company's state operate objectives, protect best interest shareholders. the internal control-integrated framework committee sponsor organization (coso) treadway commission most-often-mentioned standard internal control bank organizations. the coso framework define internal control "a process, effect entity's board directors, management personnel, design provide reasonable assurance regard achievement of: • effectiveness efficiency operations; • reliability financial reporting; • compliance applicable law regulations." base definition, clear board director responsible ensure organizations' internal control adequate nature scope business line management responsible ensure internal control function day-to-day basis. thus, board director management need quality assurance process place internal controls. so, know quality assurance process surround internal control bank organization working? with respect quality assurance process, federal reserve conduct review documentation support management's assessment internal control auditor's relate attestation problem institution subject section 112 federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act. what find evidence notable deficiency creep quality work perform management time business grow new product added. management become le vigilant internal control area increase performance pressures. this behavior actually counterintuitive deal internal controls. a business grow new product added, precisely time management need ensure adequate control place mitigate risks. we talk bank agency concern consider need detail guidance management strengthen banks' internal control practices. internal audit recent corporate governance event clearly demonstrate importance internal audit function. while sarbanes-oxley focus role internal auditor, bank supervisor long bi review 25/2003 3 recognize importance effective internal audit function control environment. with respect quality internal audit, audit committee must pave way quality assurance. a indicate recently amend interagency policy statement internal audit function, committee provide utmost independence, objectivity, professionalism internal audit process. the audit committee set tone, role supervisor reinforce it. the goal internal audit internal control surprises. to support goal, internal audit effective quality assurance process. risk-focused audit program review regularly ensure audit resource focus higher-risk area company grow produce process change. a lower-risk area come review, auditor enough transaction test confident risk rating. audit committee receive report break internal control determine audit process strengthened. before company move new higher-risk areas, board director management receive assurance internal audit tool place ensure basic sound governance adhere to. the audit committee actively engage internal auditor ensure bank's risk assessment control process financial report vigorous. many organization see reputation tarnish past two year simply neglect consider emerge conflict interest add new product line business. it important make sure appropriate firewall place product activity begins. a supervisors, focus attention area watch sign internal audit deficiency institutions. the audit committee also require high possible level independence internal audit process eliminate threat independence, tendency internal auditor act management consultant within organization. many propose revision institute internal auditors' professional standard focus add value meet need management board. internal auditor add value effective independent assessor quality internal control framework processes. auditor lose independence perform management consult role late render opinion. internal audit one corporate function ability responsibility look across management silo within corporation make sure system internal control gap control framework continually review keep corporate strategic initiatives, reorganizations, process changes. when auditor become part management, independent view lost. external audit let's turn topic quality assurance external audit process. a supervisors, must take step encourage high standard professionalism among auditors. in cases, may mean undertake enforcement action accountant. the agency finalize accountant debarment rule, one tool use correct errant behavior. however, that, look lesson learn recent audit failures. the typical fact pattern failure indicate auditor focus form rather substance transaction make critical audit judgments. moreover, look assurance services, fdicia 112 auditor attestations, auditor tendency gloss internal control deficiency simply ignore significant control deficiency "immaterial." it meaningful auditor apply financial statement concept materiality attestation engagement internal controls. from supervisory perspective, would consider existence series immaterial deficiency useful information assess quality internal external audit process. we need change mindset audit community. some do dialogue american institute certify public accountant public company account oversight board, doing. once auditor start routinely report know deficiency internal controls, begin eliminate gap expect audit attestation engagement include actual service provide auditors. however, continue find significant internal control deficiency safety soundness examination auditor know fail disclose, judge immaterial, discus auditor's lack action bank organization's audit 4 bi review 25/2003 committee. furthermore, appropriate circumstances, may need refer auditor pcaob subject auditor sanction agencies' debarment regulation bank subject fdicia 112. a secondary cause audit failure lax professional standards. example bank area professional standard attestation engagements. currently, standard require auditor perform independent test controls. under current standards, auditor simply rely work internal audit basis issue attestation report management's report effectiveness internal controls. there virtually guidance criterion auditor use issue qualify opinion. we long argue professional standard area need robust. in response criticism others, aicpa recently propose revision professional standard address issues. however, aicpa long authority issue standard administer quality assurance (peer review) function audit attestation engagement public companies. the newly create pubic company account oversight board authority begin develop framework quality assurance. so, may take little time correct. however, supervisors, continue work aicpa pcaob ensure high-quality professional standard create public nonpublic company robust process ensure audit quality implemented. conclusion in closing, i would like simply encourage u vigilant sound corporate governance internal control process bank organizations. to accomplish this, need insist effective attestation internal control external auditor encourage banker improve quality assurance process independence internal audit function. finally, supervisor regulatory agency need continually work together ensure consistent, high-quality examination process throughout bank system. bi review 25/2003 1 joseph o sanusi: central bank nigeria's standpoint anti-money launder compliance speech dr joseph o sanusi, governor central bank nigeria, conference “anti-money launder ecowas: bring anti-money launder require compliance international standards”, lagos, 3 june 2003. * * * 1. introduction the nigerian economy witness serious jump level financial crime since 1986, liberalization financial sector accompany implementation structural adjustment program (sap). the sap initially plan two years, project structural problem economy would addressed. this, clearly, short period achieve significant results. the sap run 1990s, variously adjust fit political agenda different military regimes. the extensive liberalization economy undertake since encourage economic crime general financial crime particular, especially ‘white collar’ type. consequently, effort implement 1988 unite nation convention against illicit traffic narcotic drug psychotropic substance (the viena convention) nigeria criminalize white collar crime, follow piece legislation: the fail bank recovery property act 1994; advance fee fraud fraud relate offence act 1995; money launder act, 1995. even though i ask focus paper money laundering, one several financial crime prominent nigeria, embarrassment government patriotic nigerians, i will, process, occasion say something form well, especially often closely related. what money laundering? money launder process criminal criminal organization seek disguise illicit nature proceed introduce stream legitimate commerce finance. money launder wide variety enterprises, bank money transmitter stock brokerage house casinos. the illicit proceed provide fuel drug dealers, terrorists, arm dealers, criminal operate expand enterprises. since 1999, new management cbn work extensively address issue financial crimes, particularly fraud bank system related, financial crimes. publicity campaign mount seminars, workshops, conference press statements. the cbn also improve tremendously supervisory regulatory activities, strong effort enforce anti-money launder compliance financial sector. the cbn has, recent times, equip staff sensitive operational area bank tool facilitate identify track activity money launder financial sector. after september 11, 2001, attack world trade center, unite state america, global effort surveillance increased, financial action task force (fatf) set guideline identification, monitor track anti-money launder activities. the fatf unite state department treasury’s financial crime enforcement network (fincen) come detail strategy address menace. these strategy base belief intensify surveillance stop criminal terrorist use organize bank service fund network, operator vigilant follow guideline establish adequate legislation back up. the fatf extraordinary, plenary meet 29-30 october, 2001, agree develop special guideline financial institution detection technique mechanism use finance terrorism. the fatf since come guideline visit country poor legal frameworks, nigeria. it advise even threaten blacklist non-cooperating countries, include nigeria. the goal provide guideline ensure financial institution unwittingly hide move terrorist criminal funds. 2 bi review 25/2003 this paper address cbn’s standpoint anti-money launder compliance, structure four sections, introduction section 1. in section 2 discus legal framework money laundering, emphasis recent amendment bank other financial institution act (bofia). while section 3 focus area concern cbn. in section four make recommendation conclude remarks. 2. the legal framework money launder specify bofia nigeria take bold initiative 1980s, enact national drug law enforcement agency (ndlea) act, no. 48 1989. this set stage confront menace money launder economic activities, comply vienna convention. again, 1994, government take another bold step address bank failure, check activity money launderers abuse insider bank sector, promulgate fail bank (recovery debt financial malpractice banks) act no 18 1994. until then, number unpleasant development bank industry, threaten undermine confidence integrity financial system, facilitate crime corruption, well allow criminally-minded bank director manager retain savour reward illegal actions. the third bold step promulgation money launder act 1995 advance fee fraud act 1995, latter popularly call “419”, address offence obtain false presentment, financial sum victims. these laws, however, effective anticipate years, due lack serious case successful prosecution. consequently, become necessary strengthen money launder act 1995 address weaknesses, order effective. the follow weakness observed: • ambiguity definition “money laundering”. • the provision forfeiture asset far-reaching. • the act fail take account practice evade mandatory report requirement customer financial institutions. • the provision section 6 act, imply financial institution discretion decide whether report suspicious transaction, loophole non compliance. • the provision section 10 act penalize employee directors, leave financial institution concerned, obvious drawback compliance. • failure provide “safe harbor” financial institution respect mandatory report requirement also impact seriously compliance. 2.1 the amendment bofia anti-money launder act 2002 money launder undermine confidence integrity financial system. the amendment bofia intend address observe gap exist law order aid compliance. the national assembly, collaboration stakeholders, prepare propose bill financial crime house december 2002. these bill were: • act amend bank other financial institution act 1991, amended, matter connect therewith; • act amend money launder act 1995 matter connect therewith; • act provide establishment commission anti terrorism, economic financial crime matter connect therewith. these three bill pass part law land must comply sundry. bi review 25/2003 3 even though several amendment bofia since 1991, amendment 2002 address drawback observe anti-money launder section act. the follow provision amend strengthen anti-money launder compliance: • section 3 (3) bofia substitute new subsection (3) read “upon payment sum refer subsection (2) section, governor may issue licence”. • section 60, insertion immediately section 60a title section 60b, give “power government freeze accounts” follows: notwithstanding anything contain enactment, governor reason believe transaction undertake bank account license bank may involve commission criminal offence law, “he may make exparte application federal high court verify oath reason belief, obtain court order, direct cause direction issued, manager bank account situate believe or, alternative, head office bank, direct bank freeze forthwith transactions. • the manager bank direction issue account subsection (1) section shall, receipt direction, suspend bank transaction whatsoever, relative account, period may specify direction. • where account freeze pursuant section, governor shall refer matter nigeria police force, national drug law enforcement agency appropriate regulatory authority. • where possible nigeria police force, national drug law enforcement agency appropriate authority conclude investigation within period stipulate court order, governor shall apply federal high court order continue freeze account concerned. the amendment anti-money launder act address three major area cbn responsibility provide for: • the enhancement instrument autonomy cbn, give power governor cbn checkmate operation bank system undermine confidence integrity financial system. • the need increase diligence financial institution (financial sector surveillance). • the need customer identification record keep support process court, need arises, compromise encourage unwittingly. the cbn has, past four years, consolidate effort supervision banks, ensure bank examine regularly. the cbn able bring together regulator financial sector, work financial service regulation coordinate committee (frscc), order ensure regulatory efficiency financial service sector. we discus section 3 below, area concern cbn issue compliance. 3. area concern cbn the cbn give expand mandate regulate supervise other financial institutions. in addition expand mandate tremendous growth bank sector new policy introduce cbn universal banking. the number bank operation 89 2003. however, branch network grow considerably, 2,220 1998 2,984 2003. effort sanitize financial institution sub-sector start 1997 lead stipulation new minimum capital requirements’ community bank (cbs) primary mortgage institution (pmis), among things. the area concern cbn discuss along follow three major dimensions: • identify financial crime trend patterns. • strengthen stakeholders’ support. • economic impact money laundering. 4 bi review 25/2003 3.1 identify financial crime trend pattern in attempt identify financial crime trend patterns, effort must gear towards monitor flow fund bank establish efficient customer identification process, adequate record keep rules. the cbn recently issue manual “know your customer” principle practices. the manual emphasize need obtain identification evidence private individuals, pure corporate customer quasi corporate customer establish business relationship banks. the manual indicate vulnerability receive bankers/agents money laundering. the manual intend serve guide bank financial institution nigeria procedure adopt proper identification customer and, therefore, get know customers. additionally, cbn restructure /reengineering initiative (project eagles) establish level information technology capable identify method pattern use commit crimes, particularly advance fee fraud. when cbn fully automated, provide unique capability identify bank sector-wide trend pattern associate money launder financial crimes. currently, cbn work newly-introduced economic financial crime commission law enforcement agents, dissemination information obtain state-of-the-art data process techniques. go forward effort cbn reengineering, possible expand available techniques, use lead edge analytical tool data mine massaging. from little effort make far, cbn establish trend activity advance fee fraud group collate information linkage relate lead information analysis. for example, preliminary find show month july 2002 technology installed, average 150 complaint per day “419” transaction lodge cbn’s web site, follow information activity scam group advice give complainants. the number reduce average 26 complainant “419” per day end march 2003. it also establish crime commit use multilink’s telephone facility gsm providers. there effort police sweep overnight surfer internet cafés, mostly lagos, many find perpetrate 419 crimes. the cbn also establish pattern crime constantly changing, substantial part 419 correspondence move nigeria, use ecowas country telephone fax numbers. the cbn effort joint, sting operation nigeria police, result number arrest scammers. this technique fully develop facilitate identification suspicious transaction bank financial institution involve them. another bold step take cbn inform bank circular bank careless enough allow 419 transaction go system, hold responsible refund amount involve bonafide claimants. the cbn already enforce provision circular one bank, ready prove bank weak systems, fail exercise due care, prevent 419 transaction go through. the cbn strategy follows: • work closely law enforcement agent identify disseminate current trend pattern information obtain system • continue develop analytical methodologies, model technical tool provide additional insight suspicious activity transaction bank system bank real time gross settlement (rtgs) application software installed. • enhance effort assist newly establish economic financial crime commission (efcc) law enforcement agent track financial crime perpetrator information, workshops, seminars, conference bilateral multilateral cooperation. the progress strategy measure monitor volume type crime still operation, know fully well crime mutate rapidly. bi review 25/2003 5 3.2 strengthen stakeholder support the cbn april 1994 undertake facilitate formal framework coordination regulatory supervisory activity nigerian financial sector, lead establishment financial service coordinate committee (fscc). the committee address effectively, consultation regular inter-agency meetings, issue common interest regulatory supervisory bodies. the name committee change financial service regulation coordinate committee (fsrcc). the committee accord legal status 1998 amendment section 38 cbn act 1991 formally inaugurate cbn governor may 1999. the committee comprise central bank nigeria (as chairman), security exchange commission, national insurance commission, corporate affair commission federal ministry finance. in order enhance effectiveness committee, nigeria deposit insurance corporation, nigerian stock exchange national board community bank co-opted observers. the objective reconstitute committee to: • coordinate supervision financial institutions; • cause reduction arbitrage opportunities, usually create differ regulatory supervisory standards, among supervisory authority country; • deliberate problem experience member relationship financial institution; • eliminate information gap encounter regulatory agency relationship group financial institutions; • articulate strategy promotion safe, sound efficient practice financial intermediaries; • deliberate issue may specify time time. the committee work sub-committees. there five sub-committees, financial sector distress sub-committee handle issue financial crime sector. the information share sub-committee moreover, mandate identify type information must share among regulator constraint therein. this sub-committee currently work directly cbn build website fsrcc, facilitate development tool analysis. the cbn effort strengthen support stakeholder recognize fact address compliance issue money launder financial crimes, support must give regulatory supervisory institutions. these institution must work together promote integration financial system, thereby enhance efficiency effectiveness various piece legislation aim fight financial crimes. on large scale, cbn conduct “bankers’ committee” meet every month discus issue concern industry, include prudential matters. this forum facilitate discussion global event development general, impact bank sector, particular. it anticipate cbn’s ongoing it programme fully place, involve robust bank application real time gross settlement (rtgs) system facilitate on-line, real time transactions, straight through process (stp) and, therefore, ease track suspicious transactions. it will, moreover, facilitate interaction bank cbn, track anonymous and/or fictitious account transactions. on international front, cbn also take step enhance cooperation coordination regulators, fsa uk party institution stake international fight financial crime form abuse financial system. a recent example international collaboration mount seminar “know your customer” jointly commerz bank germany lagos explain nigeria bank implication operations, especially correspondent banking, measure recently introduce fsa curb money laundering, terrorist financial crimes. 6 bi review 25/2003 3.3 economic impact money launder money launder affect indigenous entrepreneurship, trade liberalization. proceed drug sale criminal activity use bring “dump” good market, sell price cost price export countries. the reason drug baron import transfer dirty money profit motives. this situation depress domestic production due uncompetitive price import products. because return investment domestic production legitimate business activity almost inevitably low high return make money launderers, domestic production thereby depress activities. this situation affect small medium scale enterprise particular, growth target government addressing. consequent development, foreign investment decline, investor scar economic environment illicit monies allow play significant role allocation resources. 4. conclude remark 4.1 money launder pose danger health existence of, individual bank but, sufficiently widespread, entire bank system well. we hard statistic establish causal relationship money launder economic performance nigeria, draw experience latin american countries, notorious drug trafficking, compare malaysia singapore, two country stringent drug money launder law and, resilient stable financial systems. one safely draw inference stringent anti-money launder laws, couple strict compliance, greatly enhance performance nigerian economy. consequently, therefore, cbn continue ensure compliance fatf guidelines, addition domestic law money launder through: • ensure bank report adequately time recommended; • ensure fsrcc incorporate monitor money launder activity important agenda activity; • secure judiciary’s law enforcement agents’ cooperation commitment ensure compliance; • provide support train stakeholder order upgrade knowledge awareness financial crime order achieve compliance standard set fatf. 4.2 the money launder decree amend 2002 product concert effort cbn regulator national assembly. although threat blacklist country fatf speed amendment process, cbn legislator were, however, commit amendment money launder law, bring country level compliance find jurisdictions. the amendment impose immense disclosure report obligation financial institution deal customers. in addition, power governor cbn deal squarely financial institution harbour encourage money launderers enhance recent amendment money launder act. i thank listening. bi review 25/2003 1 willem f duisenberg: monetary fiscal policy euro area introduction dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, international monetary conference, berlin, 3 june 2003. * * * i would like begin today situate analysis current situation context institutional framework macroeconomic policy euro area. in euro area, fiscal policy remain exclusive responsibility national governments. contrary monetary policy, fiscal policy decentralised. in set-up, multiplicity actors, certain rule indispensable. rule provide clear allocation responsibility thereby set appropriate incentives. if abide by, rule create efficient co-ordination device budgetary policy within euro area. in addition, set numerical limit goal provide clear yardstick policy-makers general public gauge current future course fiscal policies, thus facilitate surveillance peer pressure. the maastricht treaty state country avoid excessive deficits. important reference value assessment government deficit level 3% gdp debt-to-gdp ratio 60%. in addition, stability growth pact, country commit respect objective budgetary position close balance surplus medium term. at current juncture, compliance fiscal rule satisfactory several euro area countries, experience expect fiscal deficit 3%-of-gdp reference value. these country pay price sufficiently consolidate public finance economic growth strong. for countries, need abide pact therefore prevent correct excessive deficits, confidence macroeconomic framework euro area boosted. however, euro area country still face high, even excessive, deficit sufficiently forcefully implement consolidation measure need reach sound budgetary positions. at stage, country focus implementation growth-oriented consolidation policy strengthen productive force economy. such policy would support confidence economic agent therefore economic growth also short term. by contrast, many euro area country already reach medium-term budgetary position close balance surplus. they let automatic stabiliser operate freely, result current economic environment deterioration headline budget balance excessive deficits. the importance function automatic stabiliser euro area underestimated. in euro area, contribution economic stabilisation make stabiliser generally higher, average, industrialise country due high sensitivity revenue expenditure economic fluctuation europe. however, serious doubt efficiency discretionary fiscal policies. activist policy may pro-cyclical effects, give time-lags involved. in addition, risk undermine confidence economic agent fiscal framework stability. a regard monetary policy ecb, let start present principle form foundation macroeconomic institutional framework euro area. this principle sound monetary policy aim maintain price stability. the ecb's govern council take monetary policy decision within framework well-designed monetary policy strategy. le one month ago, confirm definition price stability "year-on-year increase harmonise index consumer price (hicp) euro area 2%". we also confirm medium-term orientation. at time, clarify pursuit price stability aim maintain inflation rate "close 2%" medium term. this clarification underline ecb's general commitment provide sufficient safety margin guard potential risk deflation. it also address issue possible presence measurement bias hicp implication inflation differential within euro area. let turn factor need take consideration monetary policy current juncture. the first month year dominate uncertainty relate 2 bi review 25/2003 escalation geopolitical tension middle east. this environment, also characterise rise oil prices, clearly beneficial investment and, generally, economic activity euro area global level. a result, economic growth relatively weak early 2003 expectation economic growth, least year, scale back. the rapid conclusion military activity accompany normalisation oil price rebound stock markets. both development indicate market fear worst-case scenario prolong phase acute geopolitical tensions, negative implication economic growth, fade away. still, signal come economic indicator – mainly result survey confidence consumer producer – remain mix recent month complicate assessment economic situation. in regard, remain difficult disentangle factor may transitory effect economic activity entrench trends. overall, information gather far point continuation weak economic growth throughout first half 2003. however, expect acceleration economic activity second half year thereafter. this outlook seem line financial market expectations. let review factor shape outlook. first, corporate investment continue hesitant. this may relate process adjustment balance sheet corporations, follow rapid accumulation debt 2000. the effect build-up debt compound significant fall value financial asset peak reach early 2000. there uncertainty size adjustment still need euro area corporate sector order enhance productivity profitability. at time, forget low level interest rate prevail quite long time euro area help firm adjustment process foster recovery investment. in addition, financial position household euro area remain healthy overall. the stability save ratio past year indicate euro area whole need significant adjustment could constrain recovery consumption. the recent fall oil price also support private consumption. a regard external balance, give extent length period appreciation exchange rate euro, restrain effect export euro area felt period ahead. however, keep mind correction occur past 12-14 months, competitive position euro area producers, measure indicator real exchange rates, back line long-term averages. furthermore, effect appreciation exchange rate euro aggregate demand may mitigate significant improvement term trade, low import price conducive pick-up consumption. in addition, effect change exchange rate trade likely compensate come year expect acceleration economic activity world-wide. on latter aspect i however conceal also see downside risk global recovery economic activity. notably, possible correction macroeconomic imbalance major economy remain factor risk. in addition, cannot exclude sars epidemic may negative supply demand effects, although difficult juncture ass possible implications. what mean outlook price stability? obviously, prospective development economic activity contribute restrain inflationary pressure euro area come years. in respect, period rise wage growth, despite context subdue economic growth 2001 early 2002, see sign stabilisation wage growth recently. the effect recent exchange rate development also make significant contribution reduce inflationary pressure, although effect may visible certain time-lag. over last couple months, inflation remain somewhat 2%. we expect that, hover around 2% come months, consumer price inflation fall significantly 2004. partly due high volatility observe financial market past, also due low level interest rates, euro area economy continue accumulate liquid asset significantly amount need sustain non-inflationary growth. the concern situation are, however, limited, least long economic activity remain subdued. the ease geopolitical tension recent stabilisation financial market support unwind portfolio shift bi review 25/2003 3 time. in addition, moderate growth loan private sector indicate growth monetary aggregate reflect internal demand dynamics. thus, overall, least due appreciation euro, inflationary pressure decline significantly recent months. this assessment reflect deliberation monetary policy. a organiser ask also say word "policy mix" euro area, let briefly conclude remark topic. i think macroeconomic policy framework euro area appropriate ensure sustain non-inflationary economic growth. fiscal policy contribute maintain environment macroeconomic stability. at time, monetary policy ecb take account fiscal policy stance, one factor contribute outlook price stability medium term. in respect, efficient assignment objective instruments, together clear division responsibilities, place euro area. the policy objective policy execution framework know policy actors. an open exchange view information individual policy actor assist overall outcome enhance understand objective strategy pursue them. however, cannot scope active co-ordination fiscal monetary policies. such active co-ordination bind ineffective, give inability fiscal monetary policy-makers fine tune economic developments. commitment ex ante co-ordination fiscal monetary policy may blur responsibility monetary fiscal authority ultimately reduce incentive pursue objectives. the economic outcome co-ordination likely bad conduct policy within exist institutional set-up latter ensure genuine accountability. bi

(cid:147)fiscal policy management nigeria(cid:148), lagos, 22 may 2003. * * * his excellency, the executive governor lagos state, asiwaju bola ahmed tinubu, the president, nigerian economic society (nes), council member nes, mr. chairman, distinguish speaker guests, lady gentlemen: i feel highly honour invite guest honour year(cid:146)s seminar nigerian economic society (cid:147)fiscal policy management nigeria(cid:148) opportunity present keynote address. the theme seminar could come opportune time, outcome expect assist government policy fine-tune implementation context economic agenda next dispensation. this recognition fact fiscal policy major dimension adjustment programme ensure stable macroeconomic environment improve growth performance. suffice say sound fiscal policy management, predict consistency, sustainability, efficiency, accountability transparency, essential accelerate pace economic recovery. since 1970s, government overly dependent oil sector important source revenue account four-fifths total. consequently, fiscal operation influence uncertainty international oil market. to minimize destabilise influence volatility price crude oil government budgetary operations, effort intensify since 1980s broaden government revenue base enhance contribution non-oil sources. federal government expenditure closely follow development revenue flow, give rise boom/bust pattern. the rapid acceleration government spend 1973 1976 strong increase revenue earn oil period absorbed, result substantial deficits. it difficult scale expenditure whenever significant deterioration oil market. the result government resort borrow bank system, especially central bank, finance deficits, adverse implication domestic price exchange rate. like oil export countries, nigeria experience sharp bust inflation mid-1970s public expenditure rose. it noteworthy fiscal dominance one sore point monetary management nigeria, tend undermine effectiveness monetary policy. for 1990s, instance, major source general macroeconomic instability rise fiscal deficit federal government, finance mainly central bank. in recent times, bank system characterize problem excess liquidity arise expansionary fiscal operation three tier government, rapid monetisation crude oil receipts. the large injection liquidity system induce rapid monetary expansion substantially line prescribe targets. a major problem fiscal adjustment recent time difficulty low large component recurrent expenditure wage salaries, attempt raise level capital formation. a keen observer notice past decade, recurrent expenditure dominant total federal government expenditure. it 67.4 per cent 2002, compare 56.9 per cent 65.9 per cent 2001 2000, respectively. to generate growth, sizeable proportion government expenditure allocate capital socio-economic sectors. beyond issue allocation, quality expenditure remain critical ensure efficiency optimal utilization resources. in regard, federal government institute due process compliance principle, implemented. 2 bi review 24/2003 i wish add that, able measure effect policy, availability timely reliable statistic government revenue expenditure cannot over-emphasized. this also consistent principle transparency accountability. there need increase information-sharing regular basis, information assymetry undermine policy design analysis. it noteworthy dispensation witness return public account committee national assembly oversight function auditor-general federation. these welcome development sustained. before i conclude, permit highlight practical way address problem fiscal dominance order enhance effectiveness monetary policy. first ensure overall budget deficit reduce finance non-inflationary way. in regard, current effort federal government access capital market restructure outstanding debt stock welcome development. secondly, debt management office (dmo) encourage assume full responsibility government debt

enactment fiscal responsibility act rigorously pursued. your excellency, distinguish lady gentlemen, doubt mind issue fiscal policy management critical successful implementation economic programmes. in connection, i hope seminar find time ponder follow issues: (i) need establish stabilization fund address problem revenue/expenditure volatility; (ii) formulate viable fiscal rule consistent fiscal

ninth annual harvard international development conference, boston, 4 april 2003 * * * i. introduction it great privilege participate year(cid:146)s harvard international development conference. the theme conference quite relevant develop countries. i, therefore, thank organizer opportunity offer share think experience on: central bank authority, economic stability, rule law. the world over, development process anchor pursuit sound macroeconomic policy promote sustainable economic growth, create jobs, ensure equitable distribution income raise live standard populace. the successful pursuit goal require policy promote openness trade, efficient financial system, increase capital flows, development information communication technology enhance technical capability. the implementation policy would enable country integrate world economy derive gain and, sometimes, risk globalization. the centrality central bank forge necessary macroeconomic environment sustainable economic growth development generally incontrovertible. the theme panel discussion appropriate regard. the key issue i seek explore forum are: (cid:1)(cid:2)what role central bank monetary policy development process? (cid:1)(cid:2)what experience central bank nigeria development process? (cid:1)(cid:2)what challenge constraint face bank process? in discuss issues, focus experience central bank nigeria, context international best practices. ii. the role central bank monetary policy development process the pursuit price stability come regard raison d(cid:146)etre central bank recent times. the near universal acceptance price stability override goal monetary policy derive recognition that, long run, monetary policy impact price level dynamics. consequently, policy instrument disposal central bank capable influence price level expectation desire direction, toward achievement non-inflationary economic growth. the issue arise juncture whether central bank(cid:146)s pursuit price stability financial sector soundness requirement sustain development process. while maintenance price stability increasingly become main mandate central banks, develop country charge responsibility promote economic development, addition pursuit macroeconomic stabilization objective. central banks(cid:146) direct role development process, especially le develop economies, stem absence efficient financial market institutional structures, pre-requisite effective transmission monetary policy real economy. in addition, pursuit overall economic goal nation, stabilization objective central banker often conflict sectoral pursuit political authority. one thing central banks, world over, common maintenance financial stability key factor influence macroeconomic performance efficient payment system. the legal framework institutional arrangement vary widely country country context act establish central bank. a aware, central bank usually establish act parliament clearly state mandate. 2 bi review 24/2003 iii. the experience central bank nigeria (cbn) the critical role cbn management nigerian economy make obvious provision law establish bank. the core mandate cbn spell cbn act 1958 include: issuance legal tender currency, banker financial adviser federal government, lender last resort banks, maintenance external reserve safeguard international value currency, promotion monetary stability sound efficient financial system. in order discharge responsibility efficiently effectively, bank must credibility within outside country. towards end, act, subsequent amendments, go establish governance structure independent board responsibility policy formulation administration bank, subject periodic report executive legislative arm government. although original act mandate cbn promote monetary stability, 1999 amendment act actually confer discretionary power governor, board management bank, formulation implementation monetary policy, especially determination appropriate interest rate regime exchange rate policy. in words, bank grant instrument autonomy amendment act. in view destabilize effect monetary finance government deficits, act specify limit cbn lend government term way mean advance federal government event temporary deficiency budget revenue, exceed 12.5 per cent estimate recurrent budget revenue. such advance repay fully end government(cid:146)s financial year. moreover, total amount government security two year tenor hold cbn exceed 75 per cent total demand liabilitiies bank. cognizant importance central bank autonomy significance fiscal prudence effective conduct monetary policy, cbn actively involve fiscal responsibility bill, currently consideration national assembly federal republic nigeria. the law, passed, would establish limit government borrow cbn. under current dispensation, effectiveness monetary policy often constrain fiscal surprises. in particular, monetary finance large fiscal deficits, average 7.5 5.6 per cent gdp annually 1980s 1990s, respectively, result over-burdening monetary policy effectiveness. this course moderate current democratic government reduce annual average 4.0 per cent 2001 2002. in keep principle transparency accountability conduct monetary financial policies, cbn publish monetary policy objectives, target measure two-year period. the exercise involve review development economy precede year, identification prospect problem year ahead outline policy goal performance target period. the monetary policy committee (mpc) meet every fortnight appraise performance economy condition money foreign exchange market view review current policy measures, either term adopt new policy initiative fine-tune exist one need arises. the committee make governor chairman, four deputy governor head relevant department members. others two member board governors, include permanent secretary, federal ministry finance. in spirit transparency, summary discussion decision mpc communicate general public newspaper publication every month. similarly, another committee, financial sector surveillance committee (fssc) also meet every fortnight review development financial sector view take appropriate regulatory/supervisory action ensure stability soundness system. moreover, order enhance regulatory effectiveness stability financial sector, financial service regulation coordinate committee (fsrcc), meet coordinate activity various regulatory institution sector. the cbn governor act chairman, member include chief executive security exchange commission, insurance commission, corporate affair commission federal ministry finance. the committee work towards minimize arbitrage opportunity usually create differ regulatory supervisory standard among various agencies; deliberate problem experience every member relationship financial institution, bridge information gap encounter regulatory agency relationship type financial institutions. bi review 24/2003 3 the cbn take obligation enlighten stakeholder economy monetary financial policy seriously. in regard, need communicate obtain feedback public instrumental establishment monetary policy forum, medium dialogue public enlightenment among monetary authorities, banks, academia, organize private sector stakeholder economy. the forum created, bear mind monetary policy work best environment view key stakeholder take consideration formulation implementation. this initiative consistent global move towards great transparency openness conduct monetary financial policies. the forum also serf medium educate public cbn’s monetary policy operate framework, target outcomes. it meet quarterly, wide forum, annual monetary policy conference, hold every november. finally, consistent section 9, (a) (b) act, bank, time time report president make formal report national assembly federal republic nigeria bi-annually. clearly, process structure contribute small measure positive profile cbn recent times. the cbn, like central bank develop economies, undertake non-traditional central bank function promotion economic development, especially formative year 1960s 1970s. the contribution cbn regard, focus creation financial environment institutional framework conducive mobilization channel financial resource productive investment. thus, first decade establishment, bank concentrate task promote transformation rudimentary financial structure economy. these include issuance money capital market security nigerian treasury bill federal government development stocks. moreover, provide technical assistance relevant institutions, start-up capital development money capital market institutions. the cbn nurture cradle institution like nigerian stock exchange, security exchange commission nigeria export-import bank. the specialize finance institution establish cbn, collaboration federal government, include nigerian industrial development bank (nidb), nigerian bank commerce industry (nbci) (cid:150) merge form bank industry (boi) provide long-term capital development. the cbn initiative encourage long-term bank lend economy include establishment various refinance guarantee schemes, focus priority sector economy. two scheme agricultural credit guarantee scheme fund (acgsf), export refinance scheme. iv. challenge constraint a central bankers, beneficial evolve culture regular critical appraisal performance view improve effectiveness adapt change economic environment. clearly, every central bank face constraint conduct economic policies, create problem policy credibility. while constraint attributable external factors, induce within domestic economy. our experience nigeria exception. trade price stability mandate one major problem policy conflict pursuit overall economic objective government, particularly trade-off pursuit stabilization growth objectives. sometimes central bank confront problem inflation stagnation, otherwise know stagflation. if central bank stick rigidly mandate price stability, might address problem inflation way fall aggregate output might exacerbated. if, hand, problem weak growth performance addressed, policy design stimulate high level economic activity might result acceleration inflation rate. the need maintain delicate balance two conflict objective is, therefore, obvious. whatever policy mix adopted, bind influence way central bank(cid:146)s policy perceive public confidence engender financial system. one way address dilemma nigeria ensure that, pursuit primary objective price stability, due consideration give developmental objectives. a much possible, cbn avoid direct intervention development financing, particularly lend interest rate market rate involved. the bank has, regard, embark scheme establish quasi-government institution encourage government fund budget. there 4 bi review 24/2003 also relevance provision refinance credit guarantee schemes, early outlined, particularly agricultural industrial sectors. the risk scheme could discourage growth efficiency financial intermediation, particularly mobilization domestic savings. macroeconomic policy environment economic policy succeed infrastructural impediment supply response substantially minimized. because macroeconomic policy (especially monetary policy) work best effect aggregate demand supply conditions, structural problem could make economy le responsive policies. when policy fail achieve intend objectives, create credibility gap central bank outright pessimism process. our approach deal problem enhance public understand monetary policy cannot do, collaborate organ government ensure complementarity various economic policies. financial market infrastructure institution the absence efficient sound financial institution necessary market infrastructure, critical effective conduct monetary policy transmission mechanism, constitute major constraint achievement policy goal develop countries. institutional reforms, enforceable tax policy, simplify account framework fair efficient judicial system, important effective policy implementation coherent, credible consistent manner. credible information poor unreliable data another major constraint credible policies. the lack timely reliable data render monitor evaluation policy implementation difficult analysis arise data, le reliable. this undermine set accurate target cause delay policy response change economic conditions. fiscal dominance the essence complementarity monetary policies, particularly fiscal policy, always emphasize critical effectiveness monetary policy. in country characterize fiscal expansion, result large deficit finance bank system, particularly central bank, achievement monetary policy objective become difficult. indeed, outcome central bank policy become uncertain. this problem addressed, effectively, many country particularly among experience intractable problem inflation, prohibition central bank lend government. effort limit finance government deficit cbn successful, despite operational autonomy. the problem fiscal surprise country compound lack control expansionary fiscal operation state local governments. corporate governance for credibility central bank subsist, widely accept corporate governance arrangement must put place. in regard, good governance must begin internal consistency bank(cid:146)s operational framework administrative structure attainment primary objective monetary financial sector stability ensured, high quality service government, financial institution stakeholder economy maintained. besides, robust contingency plan promote soundness stability financial institution must strictly implemented. in recognition fundamental role effective conduct monetary policy economy central bank accord special attention enhance efficiency. towards end, central bank must mindful quality staff term technical skill, competence knowledge. cognizant need capacity build ensure enhance efficiency meet mandate, cbn past three year embark comprehensive reform agenda work process procedure upgrade re-engineered. bi review 24/2003 5 v. conclusion in conclusion, i would like make suggestion good governance enthrone measured, draw international best practices. in consonance principle good governance, central bank autonomous government discharge statutory mandates. such independence often associate power limit credit government, give destabilize effect central bank lend finance public sector deficits. government force balance budget borrow market rate finance deficits. although might problem country under-developed financial markets, effect promote fiscal discipline facilitate achievement growth objective deem profound. an independent central bank ensure policy intervention well coordinate context overall government economic policy objectives. policy credibility also enhance central bank submit third party assessments, e.g. imf, world bank, subscribe acceptable international convention code central banking. such convention 1988 basel accord, establish guideline international minimum capital standard limit banks(cid:146) capital requirement credit exposure. adopt standard would encourage central bank reform procedure process line international best practices. moreover, accountability transparency best enhance effective information dissemination. central bank periodically subject public scrutiny operation frameworks. another best practice come mind example reserve bank new zealand, every year, outstanding economist appoint mandate review monetary policy previous year. these think strategy enhance effectiveness monetary policy achieve economic stability. i sincerely thank kind attention. bi review 42/2003 1 r basant roi: treasury risk management address mr r basant roi, governor bank mauritius, financial market

caruana, governor bank spain chairman basel committee bank supervision, institute international finance annual meeting, dubai, 21 september 2003. * * * lady gentlemen, it honour pleasure address member iif. in kind invitation participate meeting, two topic propose me, first economic situation spain(cid:146)s experience euro area, second new basel ii capital accord. i think basel ii would appropriate, give crucial stage reached. but two topics, economic situation new accord, suggest two preliminary comments. first, policymakers long understand importance price stability health economy, recent year learn much concurrent need promote broad financial stability well. a number different episode economic crisis financial disturbance plainly illustrate threat weak financial system poorly manage bank pose macroeconomy. this i always stress bank regulation analyze micro viewpoint also macro perspective. create right incentives, consistent good market practice sound risk management, appear important way promote safety soundness financial system therefore good way sustain stability growth economy. this relevant prudential regulation; area account also consistent broad perspective. this consideration underline importance take seriously certain concern procyclicality. in view basel ii go right direction. i convince bank system adequately capitalised, well-managed risk correctly assess within appropriate time horizon financial system become stable, le procyclical, good able promote sustainable growth, resilient period distress. my second reflection one significant conclusion analysis recent economic financial evolution world economy resilience bank system countries. in view, resilience result presence sufficient capital system, also improvement banks(cid:146) risk management systems. i think owe industry special vote congratulation respect latter, also owe commitment part supervisor continue support developments. this exactly try proposal new capital accord, i would like address now. a aware, comment period third consultative paper (cp3) close end july. if see (cid:147)comments cp3(cid:148) page bi website, surprise hear receive 200 responses. i must admit expected, even 250 response receive second consultative document two year ago. obviously, comment mutually compatible, would feasible incorporate all. however, substantive issue raised, i mention briefly moment. but let say first committee take comment seriously work extremely hard resolve issue raised. what important committee quality consistency new accord, clear cannot unnecessarily constrain deadline timetables. michelangelo say that, see angel block marble, carve set free. from letter comment receive committee summer, seem industry see angel proposal want carve away text it(cid:146)s set free. indeed, even among critical respondent support committee(cid:146)s three pillar intent align capital closely risk; introduce great consistency supervisory review capital adequacy; promote effective market discipline enhance transparency. it 2 bi review 42/2003 was, moreover, satisfy u commentator acknowledge substantial improvement proposal since release second consultative paper early 2001. respondent raise large number issue consideration, include several address fundamental concept many debate throughout entire process. in addition, member jurisdiction continue receive response national rule-making process late autumn year, time expect hear additional view proposals. for yet manage make response post bi website, i would like mention common issue raised. first all, complexity proposals. this also raise past, is, i think, valid concern. at time, mustn(cid:146)t forget many area new accord expand size complexity precisely response call industry different type business finely reflected. another key issue, mention many comments, need maintain level play field. the committee conscious matter, i say something effort respect little later. finally relation general issue raise comments, i would mention fear over-conservatism proposal take whole. i would like also pick technical comment cp3. for example, one issue, high-level issue, also receive lot attention, calibration capital requirement expect unexpected losses. we also receive many comment securitisation proposals, issue (cid:147)double default(cid:148), incentive structure recognition insurance within operational risk proposals. after five year work, process reach critical stage. lead market participant supervisor alike long understand sophisticate bank (cid:147)outgrown(cid:148) 1988 accord need refine regulatory capital regime, work extremely hard achieve this. so important finalise new accord, open way effective implementation. to end, i already said, appreciate candour think member iif institution share committee work group years. we study late letter suggestion carefully. a gather early summary, many comment focused, past, minimum requirement lay pillar 1, get close finalisation, comment implementation become important. i would like take minute talk aspect new accord deserve equal consideration. let address four specific issues: (cid:1)(cid:2)pillar 2 consistency (cid:1)(cid:2)home / host implementation issue world-wide basis (cid:1)(cid:2)accounting standard basel ii (cid:1)(cid:2)the recognition diversification pillar 2 consistency on first subjects, well know, innovation new accord rest solely refinement quantitative measure risk. another innovation, one beneficial, incorporation supervisory review international framework. this represent real breakthrough us, since supervisor jurisdiction find way evaluate adequacy bank(cid:146)s capital base. that unsatisfactory solution since lead inconsistency way global bank organisation(cid:146)s operation supervise local level. by incorporate new basel accord requirement supervisor evaluate internal process behind bank(cid:146)s view need capital, committee expect banker supervisor engage focus discussion risk management. pillar 2 recognise national supervisor may different way enter discussion provide flexibility accommodate differences. at time, pillar 2 ensure supervisor share insight bi review 42/2003 3 approach others foster good understand among supervisor banker difference national regulatory practices. over time, discussion among supervisor undoubtedly improve understand other(cid:146)s process promote information share cooperation among regulatory agencies. consequently, pillar 2 help u reduce supervisory burden globally active bank organisation foster consistent supervisory approach practice across national borders. this correspond directly mandate committee(cid:146)s accord implementation group, (cid:147)aig(cid:148). the aig set end 2001 chairmanship nick le pan canadian office superintendent financial institutions, vice-chair committee. the group comprise high-level supervisor member countries, share plan approach implementation. the intention exchange information enhance consistent application new accord thereby promote level play field - agree important objective. in sense, aig practical focus, policy issue remain responsibility committee itself. home / host implementation issue world-wide basis. this bring second topic list, home/host implementation issues. a part committee(cid:146)s general effort recent year enhance relationship supervisory agency outside member countries, aig begin dialogue supervisory agencies. in fact, base aig(cid:146)s early discussions, committee publish paper august (cid:147)high level principle cross-border implementation new accord(cid:148). in document, reiterate view home host supervisor retain traditional responsibility regulate internationally active bank new accord. nonetheless, revise capital framework require even high level cooperation among supervisors. let mention area initial approval validation (cid:147)advanced(cid:148) approach credit operational risk pillar 1; supervisory review process pillar 2; ongoing assessment compliance requirement use (cid:147)advanced(cid:148) approaches. although supervisor must make practical arrangement carry responsibilities, committee wish implement new accord manner strengthen quality supervision across countries. moreover, recognise special role play help ensure host supervisors, especially emerge market countries, able supervise local operation foreign bank effectively. we continue work emerge market supervisor world bank imf, well financial stability institute others exchange idea way strengthen regulation domestic internationally active banks. a key question many supervisors, particularly colleague emerge market jurisdictions, whether new accord represent next step take. the committee(cid:146)s view always fundamental come first. it solid foundation sound bank regulatory system place anyone contemplate sophisticate requirement new accord. over time, hope country adopt new framework, ready. the good capitalise good manage bank system worldwide, resistant global financial system become period distress. for reason, committee develop (cid:147)simplest standardise approach(cid:148) consultation lead cp3. this approach develop assistance non-g10 colleagues. more recently, develop guidance assist non-g10 supervisor make decision adoption basel ii help achieve transition way best suit national circumstances. emerge market supervisor welcome simple standardise approach transition guidance. and regard. we currently consider might best enhance upgrade structure co-operation non-g10 country committee level. 4 bi review 42/2003 account standard basel ii i would like turn third topic list. one trend market environment must track concern increase harmonisation account rule practice internationally. the iif quite correctly note need align supervisory framework closely emerge framework harmonise account guidelines. a great (cid:147)meeting minds(cid:148) warrant especially new basel accord include explicit disclosure requirement intend promote great insight bank(cid:146)s risk profile. yet institute(cid:146)s comment letter remind us, also area new accord, treatment provision valuation financial instruments, supervisor account professional continue work toward convergence. we think in order contribute financial stability, account standard consistent sound risk management control practice bank facilitate market discipline. the committee has, therefore, attach great importance take active role international debate account promote supervisory perspective key account issues. the committee consult extensively representative account profession dialogue continue. i add interest pursue new opportunity discussion issue mutual concern accounting-standard-setting body private sector account professionals. in respect, much welcome initiative enhance important dialogue. recognition diversification an area change capital rule must mirror constantly evolve state art risk management. the 1988 accord become outdated large extent relatively simple static document: one-size-fits-all approach capital regulation represent important advance universally accept standard, provide mean recognise advance risk measurement techniques. it quickly fell behind pace innovation technology, financial products, market accelerated. in response, committee design new accord flexible document one would welcome improvement risk management techniques. it evolutionary approach credit risk operational risk, example, give bank range option choose create explicit incentive bank strive adopt advance approaches. the new accord still limits, however. member iif others cite example failure recognise use full credit risk models, would adjust bank(cid:146)s capital requirement accordance benefit diversification balance sheet. a know, committee evaluate proposal would allow advance bank estimate degree asset might behave similarly default together. for time being, decide instead establish standard estimate diversification bank would apply. i know many member iif accept choice prudent now, also caution u decision incompatible exist treatment market risk emerge practice operational risk management. we know bank make commendable progress think way estimate value diversification. nonetheless, remain concern degree confidence one might estimates, give relative lack data available base them. furthermore, concern would difficult third party validate estimate time. finally, convince consistency application diversification effects. for example certain lead bank today consistently adjust value asset base asset(cid:146)s contribution diversification. portfolio theory suggest obvious next step enhance risk-sensitivity capital framework would incorporate calculation diversification benefit framework. in come years, start soon, look forward work banks, bank association iif, academic researcher find way move basel direction full credit risk models, harness improvement risk measurement management practices. bi review 42/2003 5 a consider long-term view, lose sight fact beginning. the new accord represent another important milestone adoption advance risk measurement management practices. but remain robust relevant demand twenty-first century banking, capital regulation must keep pace change market environment state art risk management. on note, i would like emphasise importance research debate promote safety soundness financial system. the basel committee owe debt gratitude study effort undertake economists, risk management professionals, researcher public private sector seek way refine proposals. we know work help inform ours. the future evolution accord dependent input contribution industry, i look forward continue healthy fruitful exchange views. in close remark today, i would like stress committee(cid:146)s commitment balance accord high quality. although encourage general support proposal show cp3 process, recognise high-level issue still address work hard find best way resolve them. i also stress formal decision yet take respect. a probably know, committee meet next month first time since comment period closed. i assure continue utmost ensure - industry - take advantage benefit new accord early possible opportunity. thank attention. bi review 40/2003 1 bank

stevens: economic condition prospect address mr glenn stevens, deputy governor reserve bank australia, australian business economist economic society australia (nsw branch), sydney, 17 september 2003. * * * thank australian business economist economic society invitation speak today. it pleasure renew association groups, go back many years. a title address indicates, i intend offer update think recent economic performance prospect period ahead. i(cid:146)ll begin take stock international scene, move australian economy. i then, set context, make comment recent monetary policy issues. the global economy the world economy, particularly group large industrial countries, perform weakly past three year so. much attention has, always, focus us. the characteristic particular episode u well known: large share price boom bust; capital investment boom, break sharply, view likely return investment change dramatically; stabilise role play u household sector, prepare borrow spend; periodic shock confidence result terrorist acts, war on. the outcome might much worse, exceptionally large monetary fiscal policy stimulus apply u authorities, fact hold asset whose price decline highly leveraged. in fact, give magnitude events, u economy do well perform way has. outcome world economy might better, hand, global demand dependent us. unfortunately, japan europe also relapse weakness 2001. in case euro area, performance le convince u past couple years. mainland europe share business cycle problem u neither degree supply-side dynamism, scope expansionary policy action, aid recovery. japan, know, struggle year deal financial imbalances, deflationary pressure, supply-side inflexibility, political stalemate regard remedial measures. china, hand, increasingly important force world economy. it probably reach point equality japan, now, term size international trade. china(cid:146)s grow economic importance evident data, also way renminbi exchange rate become important political issue - like yen. against general backdrop, assessment near-term outlook global economy undergo important change past eighteen months. through first half 2002, indication strengthen growth saw hope rise good times, disappoint second half year. activity remain sluggish confidence take hit aftershock bubble, form of, inter alia, account governance scandal (that is, sort thing emerge every period excess). during first half 2003, growth confidence still rather low ebb. thing help confidence anticipation war iraq, associate rise oil prices. the outbreak severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) also damage part international business scene still struggle effect early shocks. then spectre deflation. it(cid:146)s understandable would concern, since inflation rate already zero countries, low low others. a period below-par growth likely, anything, push inflation further. my view way think deflation give nearly year ago. i think possible country could experience deflation briefly, likelihood widespread, protract corrosive deflation low, least absent significant policy error. nonetheless, since prudent central bank operate logic least regret, give attention issue, 2 bi review 40/2003 case, past nine months. the u federal reserve, particular, make clear want err side ease, since even low probability inflation fall (cid:145)too far(cid:146) something resisted, openly discuss measure could employ interest rate reach zero low bound. the iraq war quickly direct economic effect expansionary u economy recent months. but accumulate worry affect perception outlook mid year.1 the clear indication bond market push yield level see decades. there special factor operation but, even allow those, tone bond market may june describe particularly pessimistic. there also seem uncertainty, even briefly, u administration(cid:146)s intention u dollar. give rapid rise u dollar australian dollar period, catch attention. there period, words, hard imagine rather nasty international outcome - one fear deflation u elsewhere, regardless well base was, could affect behaviour, u dollar could move rapidly downwards, export deflation pressure countries, include australia. while probability scenario still high, seem increasing, point cause u discomfort. reader governor(cid:146)s 6 june remark house economics committee could see quite clearly degree concern time. we feel genuine relief thing look good since. after weak early part year, u economy much good second half. sars big, temporary, impact east asia, relatively little impact elsewhere. east asia recover quickly that. china continue grow rapidly. the u economy, experience low inflation, slip deflation, country experience deflation seem experience bite le (e.g. china). japan has, i think fair say, surprise people solid growth recent quarters. the euro area remain weak major regions, although tentative sign improve condition recent survey data. for first time while, consensus forecast world growth edge higher, lower. financial market price also clearly retreat pessimism may june: exceptionally low bond rate rise simply quite low. share market already turn somewhat optimistic earlier, remain so. while could argue extent future profit growth u require validate current pricing, seem little doubt actual profit u recover quite strongly date. that testimony capacity u corporate sector respond aggressively problems, ultimately source dynamism u economy. finally, strong upward trend early year, australian dollar trade fairly steadily recent times. none say world economy completely danger. thing could still go wrong ongoing adjustment continue. there could new shocks. or u expansion might wane growth demand output find reflection high employment, thus starve system fuel expansion demand. even thing proceed well, inevitably see odd patch weak data. once danger excessive near-term weakness past, moreover, issue address - like long-term trend government finance number countries. but sort caveat apply every cycle, degree. the fact remain thing look good three four month ago, noticeably good feared, time, might look now. that talk whether pick-up extend 2004, rather whether occur all, welcome progress. 1 the big issue always been, remains, nature peace. this probably cost war presumably add uncertainty medium-term economic outlook, seem affect short-run perception way actual conflict. bi review 40/2003 3 the australian economy the australian economy significantly affect weakness world scene past years. this evident trend exports. in june quarter 2003, aggregate export volume 2 per cent low middle 2000 (just olympics spike). this series 1990s grow average rate 7‰ per cent per year. if crude gauge (cid:145)normal(cid:146) performance, export volume shortfall 20 per cent middle year. that(cid:146)s 5 per cent gdp, much substantial effect see asian crisis. why effect big occasion, even though asian crisis big impact growth rate particular trading-partner group? the answer mainly, i think, asian crisis regional problem occur backdrop strength elsewhere (as know, didn(cid:146)t time). so many australia(cid:146)s exporter could find markets. that obviously hard problem lie global economy. in addition, course, effect drought rural exports, event 11 september 2001 sars export tourism services, normal effect global weakness. how economy handle loss income? in world open capital markets, one would expect temporary reduction income would part reflect slow growth spending, part also temporary change save behaviour - save le income, draw save others. that is, smooth live standard face swing income. this behaviour mean slow gdp growth, much le would case, spend behaviour confine follow much closely reduction income. at time, know, long-term adjustment way structure households(cid:146) balance sheets, tend elevate spend relative income time. it happen direction effect has, past couple years, suit need adapt international conjunctural circumstances. we can(cid:146)t distinguish data result structural change due cyclical response particular income shock. but broad effect combine force fairly clear national income accounts. we see domestic final demand rise 4‰ per cent past year - sure, moderate 6-7 per cent pace record back, still fast average. real net export fell 3‰ per cent gdp late year, influence world economy drought. between them, two factor work peg gdp growth back below-average 2 per cent year. over period, current account deficit increase 3 per cent gdp. this small decline real net trade volume australia(cid:146)s term trade continue improve past year - nearly 3 per cent, worth ‰ per cent gdp additional income. so australian community, access capital markets, face macroeconomic policy set remain expansionary side, able continue increase spend strong pace, even though income growth impair international events. this involve decline rate save current income, extraction accumulate equity dwell stock. generally speaking, flexibility good thing - proviso that, good things, don(cid:146)t want over-indulge. we anticipate that, come year, two factor weaken overall performance past year recur, indeed reversal effect likely. it widely acknowledge strong recovery farm production. the prospect continue improvement international condition mean downward trend non-farm export bottom out, recovery begin. at time, domestic demand growth moderate little. capital spend firm probably continue rise, quickly, current indications, past year. some decline dwell construction activity occurred, although look small early thought. consumption spend look likely near term continue benefit steady growth incomes, high level confidence high accessible wealth available households. if outlook correct, growth economy probably already slow much likely to. the year-ended growth rate non-farm gdp decline another quarter early strong quarter drop out. but pace expansion second half 2003 probably go 4 bi review 40/2003 least good first. if global economy continue present track, australian growth clearly pick first half next year. inflation push bite early exchange rate appreciation while, still think likely 2‰ per cent medium term, base usual assumption oil prices, exchange rate interest rates, growth outlook. this picture much describe statement monetary policy 11 august. since document published, fair say downside risk global economy retreat further. most recent data australian economy also seem consistent moderation non-farm growth first half year, suggest neither particularly pronounced, show sign long-lived. risk policy consideration it become much good understand recent year coherent framework monetary policy place, regular policy decision essentially matter respond change balance risk outlook. the rba(cid:146)s board certainly busy time past year evaluate decide respond evolve balance international domestic risks. it take lot work might think leave rate unchanged fifteen consecutive months! in middle last year, look though international economy return strong conditions, australian domestic demand grow strongly indeed. to foster inflation outcome consistent medium-term target, believe would prudent condition return interest rate normal, (cid:145)neutral(cid:146), relatively expansionary setting. two initial step taken, likelihood step clearly signalled. but event, process continue, world economy begin turn differently assumed. by end 2002, clear think near-term tighten could go agenda while. the world economy clearly lose momentum, time being, mean steady interest rate structure would probably associate achieve policy objectives. that remain story middle 2003, iraq war come went, international data look soft side, drought continued,

address dr alan bollard, governor reserve bank new zealand, property council new zealand, 9 september 2003. * * * i(cid:146)d like consider detail new zealand house market, one factor behind strong domestic economy, time many exporter see income retreat recent months. new zealand(cid:146)s house sector experience strong cyclical upswing past 18 months. it(cid:146)s auckland. sale growth rise house price prevalent many part new zealand. build consent cyclically high levels. that(cid:146)s include exclude apartments. residential investment expand nation(cid:146)s house stock rapidly, yet demand continue outstrip supply. we see rise price shortage property list sale. the median time take sell house currently sit unprecedented low 26 days. a consequence, recently house price rise rapidly. what(cid:146)s drive this? the answer demand exceed supply. demographic part story. new zealand rapid population growth recent years, drive net immigration. this include people come people choose leave. the longstanding drift new zealander north town also factor. in addition, social change see average number person per home reduce. life-style change increase demand new kind accommodation, inner-city apartment coastal lakeside properties. some factor work long time. even late 1990s, population growth relatively weak, substantial construction activity. however, recently population growth marked. the natural increase population currently slow decade ago, recent immigration strong. in term permanent long-term migration net outflow 10,000 person per year early 2001 net inflow 40,000 per year mid-2003. that undersell story. in addition short-term stays, student work permits, apply residency here. total migration run 60,000 person per annum past two years. this well excess mid-1990s. of course, people mean demand accommodation. be story? yes, think so. in part demand house reflect fact people save invest become disenchant share market financial instruments. saver still remember 1987 share market crash recent tumble u europe. a well, saver see global interest rate fall historic low headline pension fund lose money. at time property market stay

assets, oppose investments.1 property investment rise past year. of course isn(cid:146)t bad. if lifestyle change house need change aggregate demand people live here, want house construction. if supply meet demand without bottleneck that(cid:146)s good. there are, however, initial sign house market activity expectation future activity start exceed demand indicate demographic fundamentals. credit demand accelerate last year. borrow begin accelerate. debt-to-income ratios, begin level late 1990s, start rise again. people work real estate financial plan indicate mark increase number would-be investors. the newspaper run advertisement seminar offer coach people invest property, often promise significant returns. 1 census household expenditure survey. 2 bi review 40/2003 i concerned, i say release reserve bank(cid:146)s monetary policy statement last week, could end disappointment, especially unsophisticated investor rush get housing-investment bandwagon. my worry thing reverse supply exceed demand? what recent buyers, heavily debt, find rent fallen, make outgo incomings? what decide exit property can(cid:146)t sell price pay month earlier? how could supply exceed demand? we think net immigration likely ease little next two years. partly reflect government policy. also number new zealander want begin oe may go again, economy advance country good relative ours. a investment like equity regain gloss person buy house sell another buyer may find next prospective buyer put money elsewhere. when pension fund prosper again, effect. to say (cid:147)hold on, nothing safe houses,(cid:148) i would say separate nominal real house prices. real house price matters. in recent past extend period real house price dropped, illustrated. in past price fall often conceal high inflation. also, graph confirms, property price really skyrocket real property-price deflation often follow soon after. rise house price and, inference, increase rental mean certainty. a new zealander find 1970s, late 1980s less degree late 1990s house price fall real terms. other countries, uk, experience even pronounce weakness house market stage last 20 years. prudent property investor need ensure ability withstand fall price rent time future. people think borrow buy rental property also factor monetary policy calculations. if inflation start gain momentum new zealand, interest rates, nominal real, high keep inflation check. prospective buyer ask (cid:147)could gear face - would i stay water come high interest rates?(cid:148) to conclude, central banker i care this? the narrow answer stretch house market contribute inflation. however, wide answer stability new zealand economy security new zealand household link term risk concentration. for wide economic interest new

mr zdeněk tůma, governor czech national bank, ifex train course: fraud, terrorist finance and money launder prevention, prague, 15 september 2003. * * * lady gentlemen, dear colleagues, it great pleasure honour give open address high-level train course. for introductory remark today i choose topic relate question go discus seminar. i would like focus issue stem free international mobility capital international standard broaden deepen recent year address underlie challenges. i also come anti-money-laundering standard form important part new financial architecture. the last decade see substantial growth global capital flows. in emerge market economy alone, net inflow foreign capital reach usd 150 billion year, despite contraction follow wave emerge market crisis 1997-1998. the financial flow advance market economy even high order, course. moreover, turnover international market substantially high net flows, exceed global real economic activity many time over. another strike feature fact international flow currently dominate private capital, sharp contrast two three decade ago official capital flow use play key role. this trend greatly support liberalisation capital flows, advance country emerge markets. the belief prevail long run, free movement capital welfare enhancing, lead efficient allocation capital, fast economic convergence le develop countries, good consumption smoothing, diversification financial portfolios. even though benefit undisputed, free capital mobility also create many challenges. on macroeconomic level, example, observe many currency crisis follow painful stabilisation periods. these crisis often precede period fast capital inflows, aggravate vulnerability domestic financial sector emerge market economies. these financial weakness function important transmission channel macroeconomic shocks, lead (cid:147)twin crises(cid:148), i.e. vicious circle currency depreciation failure financial institutions. the asian crisis 1997-1998 recent experience argentina example modern twin crises. another challenge relate massive liberalise capital flow lie area international fraud money laundering. the detection activity crucial preventive policy objective. money launder enable criminal activity grow cause damage, serious case terrorist financing. it also lead potentially high moral reputational cost financial system society large. finally, generate inefficiency volatility allocation resources, launderers move fund response economic rationale, effort disguise origin money. in end, run counter desire benefit financial liberalisation. however, environment private capital move quickly one country another without permission required, seek best short-term returns, naturally difficult detect fraudulent money-laundering transactions. the environment also make challenge grow sophistication financial product liberalise globalise market frequent use off-shore centre tax-optimisation purposes. the ongoing financial innovation recent negative experience lead widespread conviction international policy financial architecture need strengthened. moreover, become widely understand regulation must coordinate internationally, tighten market and/or country might merely shift negative phenomenon places, without reduce overall severity. there numerous suggestion point direction, ambitious include proposal establish global lender last resort and/or supervisor. so far, however, actual solution creation comprehensive set international standard recommendation international organisations. i consider approach 2 bi review 40/2003 appropriate, foster desire degree international standardisation rules, yet leaf enough room take account specific feature country legal system. in macroeconomic policy sphere, key set international standard monetary, financial fiscal policy embody code good practice transparency monetary financial policy code good practice fiscal transparency, approve 1999 2001 respectively. among things, principle deal independence central bank financial regulators, restriction monetary finance state budgets, great transparency policy-making, data provision. these idea indeed mark effect practice, first tentative conclusion help mitigate international contagion adverse shocks. in financial regulatory supervisory area work strengthen international standard also intense. the key pillar basel core principle effective bank supervision, release 1997. the ongoing work basel capital accord, know basel ii, well-known initiative future. transpose standard national legal regulatory system become key part newly found fsap, joint programme imf world bank. in anti-money-laundering (aml) area, too, response recent challenge take form rigorous international standards. the key standard 40 recommendation financial action task force (fatf), first issue 1990 revise twice 1996 also year. after event september 2001, eight recommendation added, focus combat terrorism financing. these recommendation accept international financial organisation basis anti-money-laundering criterion financial sector. the basel committee publish document entitle (cid:147)customer due diligence banks(cid:148) october 2001 specify detail (cid:147)know-your-customer(cid:148) principle banks. the imf add recommendation surveillance work within fsap mission offshore financial centre assessments, develop methodology assess general principle practice. these aml standard thus par international code best practice form integral part strengthen global financial architecture. i also note increase awareness crucial role play aml regulation today(cid:146)s world also apparent among private financial institution themselves. this demonstrated, example, adoption (cid:147)wolfsberg principles(cid:148) involvement bank association many country aml issues. the aml regulation require financial institution identify customer certain transactions, either suspicious ones, standard one open bank accounts, safety boxes, etc. the grow use modern communication channels, e.g. telephone bank e-finance, make necessary ensure identification requirement observe equally strictly transactions, too. financial institution also oblige store data use detect money launder evidence subsequent legal action. special unit establish either exist regulatory authority new public institutions, financial intermediary oblige report either suspicious transaction transaction exceed pre-specified volume. private financial institution must create internal procedures, include clear division responsibility staff training, order implement aforementioned duty practice. a field financial regulation, supervisor pay increase attention examine whether comprehensive procedure control mechanism put place, function appropriately respond new money-laundering practice innovations. the aml system czech republic start build 1996 adoption act (no 61/1996 coll.) concern certain measure legalisation proceed criminal activity (the (cid:147)aml act(cid:148)), subsequently amend 2000. a draft amendment aml act, implement eu(cid:146)s 2nd aml directive also relevant special recommendation fatf combat finance terrorism, recently prepared. the government approve amendment currently debate czech parliament. a special financial analytical unit (fau) establish autonomous part czech finance ministry, suspicious transaction must reported. the regulator individual financial market segments, importantly czech national bank czech security commission, examine regulate financial institutions(cid:146) compliance aml act mean off-site on-site supervision. the home regulator co-operate fau, also among base mutual co-operation agreement. co-operation foreign supervisor establish sign memoranda understanding. in respect, aml activity bi review 40/2003 3 thus follow trend financial supervision general. a crucial role is, course, play aml system law-enforcement authorities, i.e. police, prosecutor judges. in previous years, one sensitive measure aml system cancellation remain anonymous saving-book accounts, tradition one hundred year czech republic. this issue, however, resolved, contribute strict compliance international standard czech republic. i also please tell recent progress area approval regulation issue czech national bank august 2003 specify requirement

czech banks, fau, financial regulator party concerned, transpose international standard czech practice optimal way. the cnb regulation cover standard element aml measure i already mentioned. one last paragraph - definitely least - concern train bank staff aml issues. give emphasis training, let express delight train course take place prague. give i say necessity coordinate aml activity internationally, i also glad see attend course come numerous different countries. i hope learn much possible opportunity use new knowledge actively anti-fraud aml activity home countries. thank

* * thank colleague around world give comprehensive review vital issue face global economy. one hazard speak last kind session speak may cover interest territory, leave unenviable task try tie everything together. in case, however, go last bad. that(cid:146)s because, order tie together issue discuss far, need take global view economy. and far canada concerned, take global view always important. of course, every country affect extent happen world economy. but canada, open economy, particular need keep eye change fortune international scene. canada(cid:146)s reliance foreign trade require u active internationalist decades. louis rasminsky, go become governor bank canada, one canada(cid:146)s delegate bretton wood conference lead creation international monetary fund (imf) world bank. rasminsky play important role, formal informal, talks. not chair draft committee, also peacemaker british delegation, lead john maynard keynes, u.s. delegation, lead treasury secretary harry dexter white. in month lead bretton woods, rasminsky keep two key delegation talking. without work, skilled drafter go-between, it(cid:146)s entirely possible talk bretton wood could end failure. canada also present 1947 havana conference, push establishment international trade organization. this mean body parallel imf, design establish monitor set global trade rules. we didn(cid:146)t get quite wanted, result still certainly positive: birth general agreement tariff trade (gatt). in 1995, nearly five decade later, successful, push effort turn gatt world trade organization (wto). so canada(cid:146)s credential supporter institution design promote free trade sound international financial system well established. of course, much change global economy half-century since institution founded. of profound significance, transportation communication become much cheap fast today world war ii. because this, potential economic gain increase international trade finance much great ever before. at time, individual country vulnerable economic financial shock originate outside borders. so need coherent international financial system also much great today. and international institution must evolve take account. to help u maximize potential gain increase trade, minimize risk stem great interdependence, need encourage trust, domestically internationally. let explain i mean. when i use word trust, i talk understand develop people recognize everyone benefit everyone play rules. in atmosphere, rule govern behaviour reinforce people(cid:146)s action help choose (cid:147)do right thing.(cid:148) this kind trust allow game theorist call (cid:147)positive-sum outcomes,(cid:148) progress come (cid:147)win-win(cid:148) situations. it also allow national economies, well global economy, strengthened. this kind trust begin home. what u national public policy-makers must do, must see doing, work maintain increase trust. we need put place right incentive that, general, people right thing. to sure, need enforce sanction people wrong thing critical. but people operate atmosphere trust, spend le energy keep tab others, concentrate productive activities. we see past decade trust important well-functioning financial system. and well-functioning financial system necessary appropriate allocation savings, fundamental element solid economic growth. 2 bi review 40/2003 i would argue five lesson draw experience since time bretton wood havana agreements. all underscore importance trust. the first lesson learn critical importance robust legal framework. when country appropriate legal structures, create sense certainty. citizens, investors, corporation security know contract honoured, break rule catch punished. the protection property right tradition contract law prime example structures. certainly, recent years, recognize importance robust legal framework watch country eastern europe, latin america, asia struggle make transition market economy. but north america also learn past two years, rather painful way, issue corporate governance extremely important well. so think legal structures, also think high standard accounting, transparency corporate reporting, adequate enforcement rules. the second lesson learn fiscal policy must always base prudence. when public debt allow mount unabated, trust investor citizen vanish quickly. in place come fear debt either inflate away, future government may default. since late 1990s, canada see benefit come fiscal prudence. put fiscal house order help establish credibility macroeconomic framework. and fiscal credibility establish country low public debt-to-gdp ratio, (cid:147)automatic stabilizers(cid:148) - kick increase government spend cushion impact difficult economic time - operate without undermine trust citizen investors. the third lesson learn importance open trade. when country open industry market international trade, may force painful short-term adjustment sectors. but time, country gain ongoing competitive pressure act spur productivity improvement raise live standards. in end, country whole good off. but equally important country open international trade play rules. otherwise, run risk fall destructive (cid:147)lose-lose(cid:148) situations, country don(cid:146)t trust resort unilateral action escalate trade disputes. fourth, learn importance central bank promote trust value money, free political interference. when central bank deliver environment low, stable, predictable inflation, public, especially middle- lower-income groups, feel confident save purchase power erode high inflation. and borrower confident burden debt increase deflation. low inflation also help win public(cid:146)s trust function market economy. a former bank canada governor gerald bouey put it, (cid:147)inflation melt glue hold free society together.(cid:148) in canada, focus inflation symmetric way. in so, aim avoid inflation also minimize risk deflation. such approach bring important economic benefits. but also assure creditor value investment eat away time. and assure debtor burden debt increase future deflation. the fifth lesson capital flow exchange rates. open market free flow capital greatly accelerate development. but, i note before, open market capital flow make individual country vulnerable shock originate elsewhere. so need country mechanism place help economy adjust shocks. recent experience teach u important kind adjustment mechanism place and, particular, float exchange rate play role. i know everyone would agree float exchange rate best adjustment mechanism every country. base canada(cid:146)s long experience float currency, i certainly say serve u well. but i(cid:146)m sure least agree always shocks, shock different effect national economies, flexible exchange rate help facilitate necessary adjustments. this lesson clearly bring home asian crisis 1997-98. many asian countries, also country like canada particularly vulnerable sharp fluctuation commodity prices, make relatively quick adjustment difficult situation float exchange rate mechanism. how relate trust? through need trust market forces, i would say. when exchange rate float capital move freely, investor trust market force allow job. there assurance shock arise, country shield economy bi review 40/2003 3 market force restrictive trade practices, arbitrary control capital flows, fix exchange rates. so key lesson draw experience past decades. in canada, try apply lesson economic situation. and i would argue help u handle economic shock good recently past. now, apply principle trust behind lesson international financial institutions, get idea institution might evolve good work global economy. game theorist tell best result come player see other(cid:146)s behaviour learn it. put simply, action speak loud words. we already see gatt evolve wto, establish grind rule international trade call account country play rules. such institution essential reduce frequency (cid:147)lose-lose(cid:148) trade dispute i mention earlier. but wto go further, should, clear progress need make area great interest poor nations. after all, current round talk suppose (cid:147)development round.(cid:148) so incumbent u develop world (cid:147)do right thing,(cid:148) overcome domestic political difficulty open market area agriculture textiles. recently, see imf take step strengthen surveillance function. these step supported. country strive meet high standard data dissemination welcome assessment economy financial systems. only player complete trust number - whether part nation(cid:146)s economic statistic firm(cid:146)s balance sheet - investment make efficiently effectively. the imf(cid:146)s role, perhaps good known, provider emergency liquidity. by end 1990s, fund increasingly find provide financial assistance many time excess country(cid:146)s quota, situation sustainability, lack liquidity, appear real issue. this problematic, number reasons. perhaps importantly, debtor creditor presume large official bailouts, possibility (cid:147)moral hazard.(cid:148) this case policy-makers provide incentive debtor creditor right thing. in recent years, bank canada bank england work together develop (cid:147)middle-ground(cid:148) approach crisis resolution. this approach, detail joint paper publish 2001, design provide right incentive debtor creditors. it contain three basic elements. first, (cid:147)presumptive limits(cid:148) official assistance, would know advance. secondly, possibility exceptional official lending, unlikely event crisis threaten global financial stability. third, orderly standstill temporary suspension debt-service payment give distress debtor time take steps, include debt rescheduling, address problems. since time, g-7 finance minister central bank governor adopt much approach context action plan crisis prevention resolution. what important support plan enforce rule put place. if ignore rule established, risk lose trust try hard build. to conclude, i hope i able illustrate importance trust. by strengthen trust, make global financial system work better. and so, deal change fortune world economy find efficient mean finance world growth. bi review 39/2003 1 edward m gramlich: economic financial education remark mr edward m gramlich, member board governor u federal reserve system, georgia summit economic financial education, federal reserve bank atlanta, atlanta, 4 september 2003. * * * thank invite speak today’s conference. for many years, federal reserve play active role further economic education among youth. recently, expand involvement promote importance personal financial education demographic social groups. in may, launch national campaign include public service announcement feature chairman greenspan. our goal increase public awareness value effective personal financial management home ownership, high education, retirement security, overall economic

education program come increase interest measure effectiveness programs. performance outcome measurement way justify continue support program. further, data collect program evaluation process identify (cid:147)best practices(cid:148) replicate broad scale increase reach effectiveness successful programs. but unlike readily quantifiable outcome measure business profits, bright-line test success always available financial education programs. there often single outcome convey success, determinant achievement may depend factor vary one individual next. further, program may realize return investment months, even years. give importance evaluate program’s success, leader various economic financial education program explore way measure effectiveness activities. staff federal reserve department defense currently collaborate develop extensive ongoing survey instrument measure value financial education course offer army personnel. organization jump$tart, national endowment financial

logical begin primary objectives. the desire outcome financial education (cid:1)(cid:2)getting message - is, increase consumers’ awareness importance issue well-being. (cid:1)(cid:2)altering consumer behavior improve short- long-term prospects. 2 bi review 39/2003 these goal parallel public awareness educational campaigns, parallel assist program design evaluation. i illustrate offer perspectives. with regard first outcome - get message - ad council sponsor study determine impact public service announcement target audiences. the find suggest certain public service announcement effective increase awareness, reinforce positive beliefs, intensify concern, move people action. one study, conduct advertise research foundation, focus impact public service announcement colon cancer awareness air four major city course year. the research find direct result public service announcement, awareness threat colon cancer increase 3.5 time year, number people discuss colon cancer doctor increase 43 percent. the research also find message particularly strong impact men, awareness among male increase nearly six time number male take action increase 114 percent. a separate study conduct university wisconsin gauge impact national crime prevention council’s anti-crime campaign. this study find awareness trademark mcgruff crime dog reach 80 percent among general public 88 percent among crime prevention practitioners. in addition, nearly one-third respondent indicate learn public service announcements, one-fifth report take specific action result learn campaign. these research find suggest issue-related information campaign increase awareness importance give topic, also motivate positive behavior change. the second objective alter consumer behavior. this key goal unfortunately quite difficult quantify, financial education organization commit resource conduct survey administer test order good estimate programmatic impacts. the u.s. department education one agency conduct assessments. it study literacy program involve teaching-related issues, include provision read skill instruction parent alongside children, effectiveness participatory traditional approach teaching, strategy increase participation ongoing development read skills. while many factor differentiate financial education adult literacy training, certain research result suggestive. in particular, study method engage parent child educational process reveal positive outcomes. one study compare result participant toyota family learning, family literacy-training program, result participant two adult-oriented literacy programs. participant family-focused program gain one grade level read skill one year, much great grade-level increase student two adult-oriented programs. the study attribute increase level success high retention rate family-focused program. it show 19 percent adult remain family-focused program twenty weeks. other research family literacy program indicate benefit also spread child participants, young child show increase interest literacy good prepare school peers. some relevant information educational program design change consumer behavior may find research sponsor u.s. department agriculture’s (usda) food nutrition service. the agency evaluate range nutrition education, health promotion, social market program intend improve consumers’ understand importance good nutrition. the agency review 200 study evaluate education research intervention programs. these study find successful program typically five common characteristics: (cid:1)(cid:2)they set behavior change specific program goal. (cid:1)(cid:2)they incorporate motivate communication program. (cid:1)(cid:2)they teach strategy behavior change. (cid:1)(cid:2)they include active involvement individual community. (cid:1)(cid:2)they attempt build health-enhancing environments. the review also highlight find one evaluation school health education program reach 30,000 students. this study find five fifteen hour instruction result enormous gain students’ knowledge nutritional programs. however, bi review 39/2003 3 twenty-five fifty hour instruction require bring change student behavior attitudes, even amount instruction, effect attitude small. these find demonstrate enormousness challenge influence behavior change education. i would also like comment importance develop effective information-delivery mechanisms. the agency previously mentioned, along others, develop innovative internet-based program provide education information. technology play big role here, increase efficiency financial education program centralize resource information clearinghouses, may help reduce duplicative effort good exploit scarce resources. one example involve agency healthcare research quality (ahrq), engage activity promote inform consumer decision-making. the agency us different strategy provide information consumer various health-related issues, include medical condition procedures, well range choice health care option plans. over last several years, ahrq develop software database program design help consumer others choose among wide variety health care plans. this system, consumer assessment health plans, us computer-driven survey instrument report tool collect data permit good understand consumers’ sentiment health care program experiences. such system could serve model use technology help consumer ass financial needs. let conclude repeat please i see group dedicate professional meet discuss challenge face public educators. i would like thank federal reserve bank atlanta host today’s conference bring together group educators. with expand knowledge new contacts, i encourage continue seek new innovative way work measure outcome programs. success increase economic financial literacy important individual serve, well overall economy. bi review 39/2003 1 lars heikensten: the riksbank euro speech mr lars heikensten, governor sverige riksbank, seb’s emu seminar, cirkus, stockholm, 4 september 2003. * * * let begin thank organiser invite speak event. the past month certainly hectic u work riksbank. we undoubtedly eye storm feature almost daily emu debate. moreover, affect directly tangibly result referendum people. i take diary example; result (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote, i frankfurt day two least every week, result (cid:147)no(cid:148), visit reduce hour four time year. give this, temptation jump debate head first strong times. however, decide participate campaigns. the riksbank institution take stand favour emu membership form submission response 1994 1997. however, executive board decide refrain take stand connection referendum. the personal view various member executive board nevertheless know time. five u favour, one against. a staff riksbank knowledge experience significance field agree contribute factual information. we also agree senior manager wish express view various issue relate emu discussion may so, long do factual manner. our ambition course ensure general public retain confidence riksbank regardless outcome referendum. today i intend briefly discus three issue arise discussion riksbank knowledge experience. the first concern whether difference ecb riksbank large sometimes claimed. the second issue need national stabilisation policy. finally, i shall discuss, basis experiences, condition influence economic policy forum choose remain outside eurosystem. be major difference riksbank ecb? in sweden live long time - rather long core emu country - impression good economic growth low unemployment could achieve merely allow inflation slightly higher. this lead repeat devaluation much poor economic growth. sweden fell behind eu country term gdp per caput purchase power. there break policy begin 1990s, connection crisis period. import stability-oriented policy long conduct emu’s core country help create good condition future growth. the policy model follow come originally germany. during entire post-war period endeavoured, great extent successfully, maintain price stability. the task achieve fall german central bank - bundesbank - operate independently, arm’s length party politics. the bundesbank model copy number industrial nations, give central bank large degree independence task aim price stability. this policy also reflect maastricht treaty riksbank legislation. my colleague major industrial nation also try - long sure inflation deviate desire level - take account economic activity unemployment. there thus considerable similarity apply europe, also comparison with, instance, us, although stipulate target vary, sometimes historical reasons. in sense child bundesbank! within central bank world method work also become similar recent years. although industrial nation float exchange rate say use inflation targeting, actually form. all apply forward-looking perspective; produce forecast try adapt interest rate good time ensure inflation line target 2 bi review 39/2003 formulate vary precision. the ecb say inflation below, close to, 2 per cent, differ greatly symmetrical 2 per cent target, give prevail error margins. in addition, usually say focus inflation 1-2 year ahead, ecb say apply medium-term perspective. there great difference here, either. when come communication accountability, similarity also outweigh difference now. this perhaps surprising. great independence lead natural increase demand central bank clearly explain account actions. it also natural possible ass actions. to end, appoint executive board riksbank ecb opportunity attend important board meetings. both institution also accountable respective parliaments. however, also number differences. for instance, target precise regularly publish inflation report contain forecast show analysis work develop change time. we also publish separate minute monetary policy discussions. neither monetary policy theory, practical implication write stone. change occur time. in spirit ecb review monetary policy operation past year. the enlargement eastward entail new, formative stage. i would gladly work actively achieve increase clarity transparency within ecb result referendum (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote. be national stabilisation policy necessary? the risk sweden could end different situation rest euro area, would cause serious economic policy problems, strongly highlight swedish discussions, much country monetary union discussed. the reason is, course, severe crisis occur begin 1990s, collapse krona 1992, tangible effect life many sweden. in opinion, tendency overestimate risk development sweden differ substantially rest world require unique stabilisation policy measures. when differ country previously - crisis year early 1990s - usually result conduct different economic policy; control inflation focus stability, core emu country did. however, appear consensus economic policy aim long-term stability policy stand firm. at time, i think relatively similar development interest rate sweden euro area recent year sufficient argument need national stabilisation policy. while true instrumental rate develop similarly one another, i believe also case remain outside eurosystem, point national stabilisation policy fine-tune relatively normal level economic activity, experience recent years, manage situation sweden reason deviate course pursue rest europe. such situation cannot completely rule out. the task face result referendum (cid:147)yes(cid:148) vote make use countries’ experience past ten year translate appropriate regulatory framework fiscal policy. the change budget policy, long-term expenditure ceiling budget surplus target, form natural start point. it quite simple. there sufficient reserve central government able bear deficit period economy deviate significantly. this require first foremost central government debt amortised, desirable goal case. if reserve available, one fairly sure use crisis situation. the opposite situation difficult; restraint require situation risk price wage formation could get control. it would necessary find institutional solution help government parliament make necessary long-term decision even situation may politically difficult even risky. here i think possible draw experience riksbank’s action recent years. clear targets, transparent analysis discussions, combine regular assessments, put pressure political system take action time. if remember, doubt begin riksbank would able achieve inflation target. some people say impossible task. that swedish politician never able manage fiscal policy responsible manner. i find rather difficult understand, although negative experience 1970s 1980s. it enough look two three close neighbour - bi review 39/2003 3 denmark finland. both experience equally severe fiscal policy problem sweden, have, far one see, fully-functional fiscal policy regime adapt fix exchange rates. a different, improve budget policy system also establish sweden follow crisis early 1990s, although aim long-term sustainability rather stabilisation, natural float exchange rate. be emu membership important sweden gain influence? finally, i intend discus i personally consider important aspect emu issue - sweden’s opportunity take responsibility exercise influence international economic policy context affect result referendum. here i speak primarily riksbank governor six month basis experience almost 20 years, civil servant ministry finance three finance minister late deputy governor riksbank, represent sweden numerous international forums. my first reflection concern sweden’s influence now, compare before. a i see it, sweden’s influence decline considerably, always make clear general debate. the important reason erosion sweden’s position we, i mention earlier, decline economic strength relation almost industrial nations. in addition, positive aspect here, namely number former develop country make considerable economic progress important player international economic policy game. the result sit few decision-making table point post-war period carry le weight table retain place. one expression ever-declining number swede hold central position economic policy financial contexts. we come long way time first two head imf swedes. it background - weak international position - evaluate importance become full member european cooperation. globalisation strengthen significance european union. of course, i make direct contact conduct dialogue colleague in, instance, south africa argentina, argue particular line international economic policy issue, i actually often do. they listen arguments, really come crunch important sensitive issue, always wonder europe thinks. to increase extent - tangible difference compare ten year ago - country part world regard europe whole unit. thus, strong influence europe, hear far. the discussion influence focus much, opinion, value sit ecb’s govern council determine interest rates. of course, member would could ensure function well, opportunity take account specific swedish interests; rate set good europe whole. more important swedish perspective would discussion development regulation financial system. a bank security market become increasingly integrated, new interest question arise regard best mean exercise international supervision oversight. plan also draft european payment system. the ecb play central role work. whether place decision-making table affect condition financial sector sweden, sector currently employ around 80,000 people, almost twice many as, instance, forestry-based industries. even important broad economic policy decision-making, primarily ecofin council, minister finance meet regularly. the trend clear, although change far tentative gradual. an increase number important issue discuss decide practice small circle country participate eurosystem, know euro group. it difficult point issue recent year could probably exert great influence members. during early years, ecb build up, sit decision-making table. when become clear brit intend remain one side, colleague quite simply decide postpone number important issue strong views, include monetary policy framework inflation targeting, transparency, etc. this also apply various payment system issues, position weak outside. 4 bi review 39/2003 we thus already lose considerable influence, also confirm surveys. if say (cid:147)no(cid:148) membership, good least foreseeable future, situation worsen further. the fact fully engage work prepare emu mid-1990s mean good personal contacts, valuable particular difficult crisis negotiate situations. a new generation decision-makers, relationship, gradually enter system. the allowance make many country colleague expect would soon join long made. the eu enlargement eastward also increase group country involve become le interesting. in addition, miss formative stage connection enlargement. once completed, situation many way fixed. conclusion i discuss talk three question arise emu debate. all three connect way operation riksbank. a brief summary conclusion is: (cid:1)(cid:2)the european central bank sometimes depict institution completely different riksbank. i think wrong. of course difference work methods, although decline recently. however, similarity policy pursue much great differences. we child successful german central bank, bundesbank. we spring intellectual model, target price stability, management appoint political system actual work do arm’s length party politics. (cid:1)(cid:2)in opinion, value conduct national interest rate exchange rate policy exaggerate emu debate. on hand, conceivable situation might arise strongly stabilise fiscal policy measure necessary. it would necessary find institutional solution help government parliament make necessary long-term decision even situation may politically difficult even risky. here i think possible draw experience riksbank’s action recent years. clear targets, transparent analysis discussions, combine regular assessments, put pressure political system take action time. (cid:1)(cid:2)as representative riksbank, i able experience first hand close door meet room europe fact lose influence. during early years, ecb build up, sit decision-making table. when become clear brit intend remain one side, colleague quite simply decide postpone number important issue strong views, include monetary policy framework inflation targeting, transparency, etc. this also apply various payment system issues, position weak outside. if say (cid:147)no(cid:148) membership, good least foreseeable future, situation worsen further, i describe already. i think would unfortunate. bi review 39/2003 1 willem f duisenberg: testimony committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, brussels, 10 september 2003. * * * it pleasure appear committee today. a usual, i shall start testimony ecb’s assessment recent economic monetary developments. i like turn issue relate euro banknote conclude open remark personal observations. 1. economic monetary development start assessment economic environment, data become available recent month confirm real economic activity euro area weak first half 2003, slight quarterly decline real gdp growth second quarter accord eurostat’s first estimate. at time, indication upturn economic activity start second half year strengthened. in fact, survey data financial market development reflect improvement confidence. the expectation gradual economic recovery start year strengthen 2004 line forecast projection recently become available. both external domestic factor continue support expect pick-up economic activity. a regard external factors, economic recovery already way several part world lead increase euro area export demand. this development counteract effect loss price competitiveness bring past appreciation euro. furthermore, real disposable income positively affect term trade effect stem past appreciation euro. moreover, ongoing adjustment effort company enhance competitiveness profitability improve condition economic upswing. in respect, low level interest rate strengthen incentive invest. a consequence recent developments, downside risk main scenario gradual economic recovery declined, although disappeared. macroeconomic imbalance region world still persist. although may affect short-term economic dynamics, constitute risk long term. in addition, oil price development may also pose risk economic activity. a regard prices, eurostat’s flash estimate annual hicp inflation august 2.1%. annual hicp inflation likely hover around, slightly above, 2% remainder 2003, least oil price development imply upward pressure short term. beyond short term, continue expect annual inflation rate fall 2% 2004, stabilise level consistent price stability. this expectation base assumption moderate wage development context gradual economic recovery. moreover, significant past strengthen external value euro continue lag effect limit upward pressure prices, despite recent decline level euro exchange rate. over long time horizons, inflation expectation euro area seem well anchor level close 2%. a regard monetary analysis, monetary growth remain strong recent months. a consequence, significantly liquidity available euro area need finance non-inflationary growth. this high excess liquidity partly due portfolio shift increase precautionary savings. however, low level interest rate contribute high demand liquid assets. the current level interest rate also counterbalance negative impact subdue economic growth credit demand. in fact, growth loan private sector stabilise relatively robust level since begin year. at current juncture, ample liquidity expect translate inflationary pressure. however, monetary growth need closely monitored, significant amount excess liquidity could become source concern persist economic activity strengthen significantly. 2 bi review 39/2003 to sum up, cross-check information two pillars, economic analysis confirm expectation price pressure remain subdue context gradual economic recovery moderate import price wage developments. the strong monetary expansion not, view economic situation, see adversely affect outlook time being. overall, therefore, medium-term outlook price stability remain favourable. against background, key ecb interest rate consider appropriate present. clearly, govern council continue carefully monitor factor might affect assessment. take longer-term view, current level short-term nominal interest rate euro area low record past 50 years. more importantly, low level interest rate present associate inflation expectation compatible price stability. this often case past. in respect, history tell u loose monetary fiscal policy lead entrench inflation processes, end adverse consequence economic growth employment. if learn lesson 1970s 1980s, would high economic cost pay fight inflation become entrenched. i recall realisation lead worldwide conviction monetary economic policy stability-oriented. if i look back early year stage three economic monetary union (emu), i say i satisfy achieve monetary policy ecb. inflation expectation challenge period indicate public confidence fact price stability euro area maintained. this confidence constitute major achievement - variety channel - contribute raise growth potential euro area. however, i must also confess macroeconomic policy live expectations. in area fiscal policy, see process commitment make repeatedly broken. from start stage three, country show sufficient determination meet one key objective stability growth pact, namely achieve budget balance surplus medium term. a time strong economic growth properly use bring fiscal position country onto sustainable basis, surprise country problem last year keep fiscal deficit threshold 3% gdp lay treaty. in light, i view recent fiscal development discussion surround stability growth pact great concern. there grow evidence country miss budgetary target 2003 significant margin. while deterioration budgetary balance mainly reflect thelower anticipate economic growth, worry country severe imbalance far introduce sufficient consolidation measures. the lack fiscal discipline - notably lack clear medium-term-oriented consolidation strategy - factor weigh adversely euro area’s long-term growth prospects. in order strengthen confidence euro area, fundamental maintain credibility institutional economic underpinnings emu abide respect agree rule game. it essential that, budgetary plan currently prepare 2004, correction excessive deficit within agree time-frame country concerned. in country fiscal imbalances, structural consolidation effort least 0.5% gdp per year required. all fiscal plan need part comprehensive credible medium-term strategy, emphasis expenditure restraint growth-oriented restructure expenditure. another area see insufficient progress recent year structural reforms. while initiative way, need do address structural rigidity labour product markets. i like emphasise benefit reform economic growth potential euro area would substantial. such reform essential address perceive euro area’s main economic problem, namely high level structural unemployment. while benefit fully reap medium term, i also convince reform would also support economic growth short term, would strengthen confidence make euro area attractive investors. 2. issue relate euro banknote let turn issue relate euro banknotes. continue practice establish last year, ecb published, july, biannual information counterfeit euro. the data bi review 39/2003 3 confirm expect outset, namely counterfeit figure would increase early year new currency. in addition, status international currency, euro may consider attractive target legacy currency were. however, despite factors, although may early identify reliable trends, euro counterfeit currently settle level far low aggregate level counterfeit legacy currency 2001. this factor clearly emphasised, since much public report regard exaggerate distorted. the euro banknote design among best world come counterfeit resistance. moreover, line normal practice central banks, preparatory work begin develop even good protect banknotes. these may issue towards end decade. however, even sophisticate security device useless banknote user make effort check them. therefore, message public press release counterfeit consistently undue cause alarm counterfeiting, public remain vigilant check banknote use feel-look-tilt test, thereby deny criminal chance succeed attempt counterfeiting. this remain message. in addition, also try identify need provision additional information train general public and, particular, professional cash handlers, i.e. cashier shop banks, normally frontline target counterfeiters. at time, ecb step institutional framework combat counterfeits. in context, i like refer close co-operation anti-counterfeiting issue establish ecb, europol european commission. moreover, co-operation agreement conclude ecb interpol, ecb national central bank accede countries. before concluding, let make final remark. a know, last testimony committee. i privilege preside ecb past five years, guide inception number crucial - successful - stages, introduction euro 1999 and, three year later, euro cash changeover. both event were, view, major step towards europe (cid:147)united ever closely(cid:148), i honour serve european public cause european integration times. madam chairman, honourable committee members, let convey sincere thank fruitful co-operation past years. while may always agree issues, i believe relationship mark mutual confidence truly co-operative spirit. i enjoy work wish you, well successor, much success challenge lie ahead. bi review 38/2003 1 lars nyberg: development property market speech mr lars nyberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, seminar properties, malm(cid:246), 2 september 2003. * * * i would like begin thank opportunity come malm(cid:246) speak riksbank’s view development property market. of course, development interest u present today. they important people, movement property price significance real economy financial development sweden. when property price rise, feel financially secure increase consumption, lead rise employment growth. we might even borrow bite bank can. normally, harm this. but limit, course, burden debt household bear without give rise worrisome risks. should debt commercial property company also swell, could entail risk stability entire bank system, point illustrate well crisis begin 1990s. on account this, riksbank monitor development property market carefully. we usually divide two segments, give rise different question reflections. the first segment house market. since 1997, house price rise 50 per cent, measure current prices. the price boom continue spite generally weak economic activity last two years. this new experience differ previous business cycles, price tend recede period economic decline. similar development occur countries, example us, england holland. the situation could appear worrying, particularly give rise house price accompany increase household indebtedness. the upsurge price raise question healthiness trend. be price rise swedish house market result bubble? be high level household indebtedness sustainable? the riksbank’s view current price development house market reflect speculative expectation future price rise would warrant term (cid:147)bubble(cid:148). nor household indebtedness big problem usual stage business cycle. i explain moment. the segment market commercial property. here, primarily price office premise display different trend see house market. commercial property price adjust economic slowdown. in sweden, price rent fall since 2000 time vacancy rate risen. i believe price decline concern economic perspective, much case property crisis begin 1990s. although similarity exist two, difference nevertheless outweigh them, i come back later. i also look ahead briefly discuss drive force behind price development property market. development house market in principle, two different method explain rapid price changes. the first approach base fundamental drive force govern prices, explain price change change variables. such fundamental factor include interest rate levels, household income production new homes. the second approach assume instead price govern fundamental drive forces, rather base expectation future price rises. such situation usually refer (cid:147)bubble(cid:148). a recent example surge price see it share latter part 1990s. the rate increase observe prove gradually unrelated fundamental drive force rather unrealistic expectation trend never materialised. when eventually become evident, price plummeted. so price rise see bubble mirror fundamental factor simply reflect expectation future price increases. investor become involve process speculation 2 bi review 38/2003 estimate future cash flow long importance price rise instead assume trend. if buy today, always able sell good price tomorrow. where house market concerned, however, reason question whether bubble possible all. this people purchase home primarily investment rather place live. consequently, house buyer neither think behave investor speculate quick persistent rise prices. there hardly many people buy home solely expect gain financially rise house prices! so assume speculation future price increase doesn’t exist, bubble quite simply able occur. some might think convenient academic approach issue. after all, witness rapid price increase even fast decline house market, example tenant-owned apartment metropolitan area crisis begin 1990s. in principle, i would prepare agree, prove impossible explain price rise fundamental factors. in order see fundamental factor could explain recent price increases, make sense look drive force could important house prices, i.e. interest rates, primarily post-tax real interest rate, household disposable income, supply house demand result people move metropolitan area particular. a regard interest rates, real nominal rate fall continuously since mid 1990s. for household entail significantly low mortgage costs. at end 1992 banks’ average nominal lend rate household 15 per cent inflation stand 2 per cent. now, average lend rate around 6 per cent, inflation remain level. so household incur double amount debt today still low debt-servicing costs. the favourable economic climate mid 1990s also contribute drop unemployment, one hand, increase wage other. all all, lead rise household disposable income. moreover, disposable income continue increase period relatively weak economic activity recent years. this mainly due unemployment remain low, spite economic slowdown. so low interest rate high growth household disposable income two fundamental factor could explain rise price house market. furthermore, excess supply house market similar see begin 1990s house construction encourage various kind grant tax subsidies. instead, little construction house today, discussion concern rather step up. in addition low level house construction, demand house rise mainly metropolitan area due great number move region latter part 1990s. it surprise relatively constant, low supply, well high demand, contribute substantial price rises. thus, low interest rates, increase disposable income low supply new housing, together high demand, fundamental factor i believe drive rate price increase mid 1990s. they also suffice show current price rise describe expectations-driven (cid:147)bubble(cid:148). the analysis perform several country experience similar development house market, particular us. so house market bubble crisis year begin 1990s? i don’t really believe did, least sense home buy purpose speculation view sell price rise further. yes, price rise sharply, especially metropolitan regions, due reason fundamental nature. households’ willingness pay increase line income economic upswing, deregulation credit market lead removal finance obstacles, supply house was, short term, highly inflexible. this enough fuel steep rise prices. when demand subsequently wan result deterioration household finances, time real interest rate rise supply house - new old - increased, price fell again. even substantial price movement natural explanation due unrealistic expectation first raise dashed. household continue borrow bank mortgage institution throughout economic decline, normal pattern behaviour, course due low interest rates. their debt burden grow raise question whether head back towards bi review 38/2003 3 imbalance sooner late corrected. however, i believe household debt per se constitute immediate source concern. households’ debt ratio, i.e. debt percentage income, 110 per cent. however, result historically low interest rates, appear households’ debt-servicing cost continue manageable. the interest ratio, i.e. households’ debt-servicing cost relation disposable income, today barely 5 per cent. the situation swedish household therefore considerably favourable end 1980s begin 1990s. at time, credit expansion cause partly deregulation credit market result debt ratio around 130 per cent, interest ratio increase rapidly couple year around 6 per cent almost 10 per cent. however, doubt recent rise indebtedness make household increasingly sensitive change interest rates. household tend focus cash flow unperturbed long debt-servicing cost accommodate monthly budget. but interest rate rise percentage point would much big impact cash flow today level around 15 per cent. an interest rate rise four six per cent would cause monthly cost increase 50 per cent. high mortgage rate could therefore prompt household increase save reduce consumption expect intended. hopefully able avoid sharp, quick interest rate rise conduct monetary policy, although mortgage rate also influence event outside sweden. to extent though, effect increase rate could alleviate fact increase number household recently switch fixed-rate loans. development commercial property market price commercial property market drive somewhat different force house market. the trend also closely correlate level economic activity, price fall last three years. however, price decline malm(cid:246) [9 per cent] considerably gentle stockholm [24 per cent] gothenburg [18 per cent]. these decline mainly cause low rents, essentially result low demand office premise due subdue economic activity. it also make sense malm(cid:246) affect le major city give slowdown severe here. the rapid rise price subsequently rapid decline point trend dissimilar experience property crisis begin 1990s. nevertheless, many difference two situations. there doubt experience bubble begin 1990s, price largely lose relationship fundamental instead underpin expectation future price rises. for period time direct yield property 8 percentage point low yield government bond. so investor must expect price increase good deal 8 per cent order compensate risk invest property rather bonds. in case, really say expectation price rise high! this situation today. speculation construction also le prevalent upswing end 1990s rise activity decade earlier. production property relatively low, project pre-contracted tenant great extent. in addition, property crisis begin 1990s affect significantly structural change occur period. the deregulation credit market together change economic policy require substantial adjustment market. so present situation cause concern way situation begin 1990s. some think future the fact situation source concern mean i predict significant recovery property prices. an increase economic activity course stimulate demand, sooner late apply upward pressure prices. but time i see several factor could restrain rise property prices, especially regard office premises. 4 bi review 38/2003 firstly, risk demand office premise weak general level demand economy. from mid 1990s, gradual improvement economic activity sweden, result high employment general, particularly within office-intensive business it telecommunications. so increase demand office premise partly attributable economic condition general, also especially favourable condition within office-intensive business particular. the subsequent slowdown activity also hit business hardest, affect demand office premises. thus, recovery demand office premise would associate revival general economic activity also activity within office-intensive businesses. irrespective business area, also appear company today, unlike end 1990s expectation growth expansion high, seek reduce area office space per employee. this one way adapt cost new, strain economic conditions. all all, aspect suggest demand office space may recover rate general level activity. secondly, unlike single-family dwell instance, commercial property form investment. consequently, price commercial property affect single-family dwell return investments. in time uncertainty, property often see attractive alternative equity particular, investor tend increase share property portfolios, thus lead upward pressure prices. accord swedish property index, return property sweden past three year exceed equities. moreover, 2000 2001, return property surpass alternative form investment. last year, however, return property exceed bond treasury bills. thus, optimistic economic climate, risk investment property appear le attractive equities, example. in situation, investor reduce share property portfolios, risk price rise much warrant high demand alone. consequently, factor could restrain property price upswing. summary conclusion the market house commercial property differ term development recent year challenge face near future. in house market, price continue rise despite recent economic slowdown. the market commercial property instead undergo period adjustment towards low price rent since 2000. by appearances, price rise house market due change fundamental factor significance house prices. to speak house market bubble therefore constructive. persistently low interest rates, strong growth disposable income low growth supply residential property justify current price levels, spite weak economy. in event increase activity high income, hope believe happen, reason expect broad decline house prices. of course, local difference production new homes, instance, could impact prices. in commercial property market, rent price already adjust different demand climate, price increase naturally follow rise economic activity could take time, particularly appear considerable excess supply office space various locations. moreover, property form investment usually consider le attractive economy turn around earnest. bi review 38/2003 1 t t mboweni: inflation target south africa speech mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, bis/sarb reserve management seminar dinner, south african reserve bank, pretoria, 2 september 2003. * * * it pleasure welcome you, guest reserve bank personnel, dinner i gladly host honour. i know formally welcome reserve bank morning mr plenderleith. but seminar stature, co-hosted good friend bank international settlements, i, governor, felt correct re-iterate warm welcome. i especially delight able co-host reserve management seminar i believe u learn other’s experience regard important central-bank function. i know long day seminar and, i believe, productive one, i shall keep speech brief. i choose focus reserve management south african reserve bank, topic cover degree seminar afternoon, rather talk briefly inflation targeting. a probably know, inflation targeting, initially adopt new zealand 1990, choice grow number central bank industrialise emerge countries. a november 2000, author mishkin schmidt-hebbel count 19 inflation-targeting countries. since then, number increased. precisely many debatable depend precise definition inflation-targeting country i note merit inflation target continue debate us. inflation target south africa formally introduce 23 february 2000 announcement 3 6 per cent target 2002. at time, cpix inflation - rate target - stand 7 per cent. (just information, define cpix cpi exclude interest cost mortgage bonds, historical metropolitan urban areas.) the target range 3 6 per cent set ambitious one. whilst may debate today whether target range set correct level, important note credibility central bank, well management expectation respect inflation problem, target range set level would properly demonstrate commitment low inflation. in spite above-mentioned quite ambitious target, september 2001, twelve-month cpix inflation decelerate 5,8% per cent many analyst think 2002 target would meet fairly easily. to say least, circumstance changed! the exchange rate depreciation 37 per cent 2001 - another interest story! - mostly close stage year, significantly responsible push cpix inflation peak 11,3% per cent november 2002. on 12 september 2002, reserve bank’s monetary policy committee announce fourth final 100 basis point increase year bank’s repurchase rate. a may well imagine, i everyone’s most-favourite governor! fortunately, inflationary pressure abated, partly relate rand’s appreciation since december 2001 reflect year-on-year change cpix fall 6,6 per cent july 2003, mpc see fit low repo rate. on 14 august 2003, follow recent meet mpc, repo rate reduce 100bp 11 per cent effective 15 august 2003. (should anyone amongst interest factor weigh decision, i refer statement monetary policy committee reserve bank website). whilst governor certainly popular decline interest-rate cycle, rest assure critic felt bank bold enough have, least, reduce repo rate 150 basis points! technically, reserve bank could accurately describe inflation-forecast targeting. give roughly 12 24-month lag interest-rate change full impact felt inflation, repurchase rate set level judge consistent bring inflation within target range within 12- 24-month time horizon. i refer intricacy transmission mechanism, clear understand represent single big challenge inflation-targeting central bank. inflation target 3 6 per cent 2004 2005 set government, guide current policy formulation. give lags, 2 bi review 38/2003 current policy change clearly virtually impact 2003 inflation outcome; focus ahead. with cpix approach target range, relatively easily somewhat superficially argue merit inflation-targeting regime. some disadvantage inflation target must, however, acknowledged. whilst easily understand term objective, complicate approach, demand difficult implement monetary framework base target monetary growth discretionary framework. it imply great reliance forward indicator inflation continuous assessment relationship instrument monetary policy inflation target. where forecast turn wrong, even completely unforeseeable reasons, central bank’s credibility could impaired. of course, counter-argument simply make visible uncertainty would remain hide monetary-policy frameworks. inflation targeting, pursue costs, run risk inefficient output stabilisation. significant supply shock economy sharp oil price movements, could require large monetary-policy adjustment bring inflation back inside target range within state time horizon. for exceptional events, discretion patience re-achieving target range allow for. in regard i wish confirm reserve bank generally view inappropriate resort escape clause, would rather provide explanation deviation target range final outcome cpix average year published. this view hold market doubt regard bank’s vigilance commitment achieve targets. indeed, follow cpix average year 2002, could calculate early 2003, average exceed target, explanation provide monetary policy review document april 2003. (the bi-annual monetary policy review also available website). the advantage inflation target also worth highlighting. firstly, transparency - concept easily understandable, ultimate policy objective translate explicit target value. secondly, inflation target provide enhance clarity objective monetary policy, conducive sound plan private public sectors. thirdly, framework provide improve accountability reserve bank. it eliminate need rely stable relationship money stock inflation, become increasingly difficult identify; inflation target enhance economic policy co-ordination government central bank publicly commit inflation target. and lastly inflation target provide anchor inflation expectation price wage setting, thus reduce friction arise widely divergent inflation expectations. may i conclude comment that, whilst inflation target certainly panacea, reserve bank still regard appropriate framework achieve relative price stability. i quote annual economic report 2003, release last week: (cid:147)sound consistent price signal invaluable direct resource towards efficient uses(cid:148); achieve goal is, believe, important contribution make towards optimal economic growth development. finally, i also, governor, thank bi sincerely invaluable role co-hosting seminar. our relationship bi excellent derive much value interaction much-esteemed institution many years. i hope you, delegates, extract maximum value expertise available shared. may safely return home, return fx asset stable gratifying! i thank you. bi review 38/2003 1 joseph yam: financial stability issues, dollarisation price dynamic open remark mr joseph yam, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, hkimr summer workshop 2003, hong kong, 27 august 2003. * * * lady gentlemen, i delight welcome first (cid:147)hkimr summer workshop money finance(cid:148). this event hope take place annually. the organiser put together interest programme three paper deal issue current potential importance hong kong. the first paper, present professor charles goodhart, focus financial stability issues. these issue particular interest international financial centre, success otherwise maintenance financial stability, therefore efficiency financial intermediation, impact upon domestic economy also economy region centre serves. the second paper, present professor genberg, deal subject dollarisation. dollarisation, traditional sense u dollar replace displace hong kong dollar medium transaction respect domestic economic activity, opinion unlikely occur hong kong. this notwithstanding operation currency board system u dollar anchor currency. but, another perspective, see continue economic integration hong kong mainland china. we also notice inevitable trends, one hand, great use hong kong dollar mainland and, hand, continue financial liberalisation mainland: will, fullness time, culminate rmb become freely convertible. the subject dollarisation, whether predominant currency hong kong dollar rmb, fascinate one. on different dimension, attempt enhance status international financial centre, adopt strategy provide financial infrastructure facilitate conduct international financial intermediation activity hong kong. this financial infrastructure characterise platform financial activity transact settle real time time zone major currency without, example, herstatt risk. we real time gross settlement system u dollar euro, course hong kong dollar. and lead-time inclusion another currency, rmb, settlement platform, consider appropriate, could little six months. if strategy successful, difficult envisage increase proportion balance sheet bank system denominate foreign currencies, great use of, say, u dollar equity debt markets. i sure dimension cover professor genberg’s paper endogenous dollarisation, particular relevance hong kong. the third paper, present professor kumhof, deal issue regard price dynamics. professor kumhof’s paper focus price policy inflation inertia, time experience deflation hong kong: i sure, however, insight derive paper discussion. research price formation high agenda hkimr hkma, possibly academic organisation active economic research hong kong. we deflation five year still debate relative importance cyclical structural factor behind deflation. there also debate whether measure could take limit damage effect deflation, notwithstanding fact hong kong highly externally orient economy. view price dynamic contribute debates. a know, hkimr establish hkma. this reflect importance attach thorough analysis monetary financial issue hong kong facing. development local, regional global economy provide many opportunity hong kong, also serve potential source risks. it therefore critical actively seek understand developments. to promote economic research high quality, essential research activity hkimr are, see be, carry freely, without interference interest parties, include hkma. it therefore desirable hkma exercise control 2 bi review 38/2003 hkimr’s day-to-day activities. but, course, professional quality academic integrity activity need monitor ensured. for reason, council advisors, whose member distinguish economist work outside hong kong, established. many fact today. the role council ensure quality hkimr’s activity alert board director shortcoming become apparent. while relationship hkimr hkma remain close, hkimr enjoy independence research matters. one consequence view express different publication necessarily reflect hkma. one distinguish member hkimr’s council advisor first speaker today, charles goodhart, great pleasure introduce him. it much visit hong kong give hkimr idea organise workshop. a know, charles one world’s foremost monetary economist expert central bank issues. but may know long involvement in, influence on, monetary issue hong kong. this begin almost exactly twenty year ago hong kong, suffer crisis confidence political future, without effective form monetary control, brink financial meltdown. the exchange rate depreciate sharply charles bring bank england advise u hong kong could rescued. he give valuable advice proposal return fix exchange rate system currency board arrangement link hong kong dollar u dollar. a know, exchange rate link subsequently established, october 1983, still operation now. it command high degree confidence credibility. it serve hong kong extremely well past twenty years. in advice, charles also cover strategic issue central bank hong kong. a remain person public sector continuously involve area work now, i say authority view charles exert much influence development monetary system hong kong. i know whether remember, charles, piece advice financial secretary, late sir john bremridge, write 6 october 1983. i keep copy it, i often refer inspiration past twenty years. fortunately me, perhaps others, advice highly classify probably never see light day. but right quote cover letter sir john, said: (cid:147)i put point substance i want make, i hope believe stand test time.(cid:148) they certainly did. and suggestion might desirable exchange fund time adopt (cid:147)more feature central bank(cid:148): hence hkma, form ten year advice gave. of course, also privilege involvement period 1990 1997 member board, exchange fund advisory committee, occasional trip hong kong. so, lady gentlemen, great pleasure i invite charles speak first session hkimr first summer workshop. bi review 38/2003 1 toshihiko fukui: economic activity recent financial development japan summary speech mr toshihiko fukui, governor bank japan, meet business people nagoya, 3 september 2003. * * * i. current situation japanese economy policy focus a. current condition economic activity whole flat since february year, describe bank japan’s monthly report recent economic financial developments. recently, however, gradually begin observe sign improvement. for example, machinery order second-quarter gdp turn good anticipated, stock price continue rise. such domestic development understand global context, economic globalization progress japanese economy deepen tie overseas economy even further. a know, first half year, world economy mire adjustment process follow it boom 1990s, come end fall 2000. furthermore, uncertainty economic outlook amplify war iraq severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) east asia. uncertainty financial system problem japan persisted, fall stock prices, include bank shares, become rather marked. fortunately, uncertainty decrease since early summer. the actual operation war iraq conclude relatively early, effect sars le many people feared. we even begin observe sign recovery demand it-related goods, although yet fully confirm extent adjustment. in circumstances, pessimistic view economic outlook receded, increase number people become confident rebound world economic growth second half year. for example, unite state so-called central tendency project real gdp growth 2003 among member federal open market committee (fomc) revise upward, 2.5 2.75 percent. this projection imply real gdp growth would rise 3 percent level second half 2003, around 2 percent first half. for 2004, fomc member predict acceleration real gdp growth 3.75 4.75 percent. in asia, china likely return stable growth path overcome negative impact sars. with high dependence information technologies, ny expand production global demand it-related good recovers, unite state particular. there little likelihood europe drag global economic recovery, although economic outlook still seem rather unclear. give overseas developments, japanese economy expect gradually increase export production. in addition possible increase external demand, domestic demand also show favorable signs. plan business fix investment fiscal 2003 moment large since fiscal 2000, backdrop substantial increase corporate profits. moreover, see slightly favorable change direction job income situation household sector, although situation remain severe. b. policy focus such path japan’s economic recovery within standard scenario since spring, appear increasingly likely scenario realized. however, question remain strength breadth economic recovery achieved, well risk standard scenario may realized. in tackle questions, keep three point focus. the first focus outlook overseas economies, u.s. economy particular. in regard, also pay attention global demand it-related goods. 2 bi review 38/2003 although u.s. economy mild recovery path lead private consumption, business fix investment production generally remain weak, labor market condition continue severe. with residual adjustment pressure burst it bubble, firm still rather restrain business expansion. in spite subdue conditions, recently begin see change hope improvement. global demand pcs, semiconductors, it-related good increasing. people strongly hope substantial tax reduction monetary ease work accelerate recovery. we monitor change hope translate improve business activity labor market condition unite states, subsequently whether improvement positive impact world economy. the second focus financial market japan. stock price rebound around may, nikkei 225 stock average regain 10,000 level august 18 view economic outlook turn slightly favorable. long-term interest rate also rose. in view, movement could interpret correction overly pessimistic market expectation first half 2003 amid various uncertainties. fundamentally, stock price long-term interest rate reflect market view economic outlook, strive correctly understand views. have say this, also true market often move irregularly response variety factors. for example, unite states, 10-year long-term interest rate rebound mid-4 percent level fall around 3 percent june. a factor behind gyration, many point deterioration fiscal balance hedge activity investor mortgage securities, addition change view economic outlook. in japan, people already begin talk possibility overshoot long-term interest rates, cannot justify economic fundamentals. we closely monitor financial market developments, include possibility large swing long-term interest rate due factor economic fundamentals. the third focus extent economic recovery spur export production amid persist problem excess debt labor. the problem excess debt differ firm firm, industry industry, broadly speaking, largely problem nonmanufacturing industry. for example, ratio net debt sale decline significantly past ten year manufacture industry, remain high nonmanufacturing industry due delay adjustment. the nonmanufacturing industry tend retain various inefficiency mainly traditionally le expose international competition manufacture industry. the manufacture industry drive force behind economic recovery lead export production. but, achieve sustainable growth, critically important whether initial recovery lead dynamic forward-looking improvement nonmanufacturing industry. the problem excess labor important judge whether recovery corporate sector might lead increase private consumption rise income. the tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) show consistent pattern excess labor manufacture nonmanufacturing industry since burst bubble economy. recent labor statistic also show continue decline regular employment. these data suggest persistent pressure labor market adjustment continue severe condition employment income. look closely late statistics, note begin observe sign favorable change labor market. the level employment cease fall part-time worker included, decline wage bottom bonus payment summer take account. ii. conduct monetary policy in economic conditions, bank conduct quantitative ease policy, maintain financial market stability strengthen momentum recovery flexibly provide ample liquidity. since i become governor, bank raise quantitative target outstanding balance current account hold bank twice, april may. face number uncertainties, include war iraq, sars, stock prices, exchange rates, problem relate resona bank since spring, take preemptive approach monetary policy uncertainty jeopardize robust foundation economic recovery. bi review 38/2003 3 the bank also make strong commitment continue current monetary ease year-on-year increase consumer price index (cpi) become stably zero above. this commitment strengthen policy effect interest rate stability, participant financial market anticipate monetary ease long year-on-year increase cpi remain negative. furthermore, bank strengthen transmission mechanism monetary policy effect monetary ease permeate economy. a part efforts, begin purchase asset-backed security august. underlie asset include receivables also lease loan assets, hope facilitate fund small medium-sized firms. it quite unusual central bank directly assume credit risk private sector, think measure necessary light prevail economic conditions, state financial system markets. the bank take necessary measures, without undue regard precedent, return sustainable growth overcome deflation, continue so. we also emphasize strong global linkage examine problem deflation, way economic activity. inflation decline globally, due mainly appropriate conduct monetary policy increase penetration emerge country market economies. this phenomenon term (cid:147)global disinflation.(cid:148) even world economy recovers, strong possibility inflation stay relatively low level, growth rate increase. in fact, various private-sector forecast show 2004 growth high compare 2003, inflation remain 2 percent unite states, europe, asia. in circumstances, central bank implement monetary policy attention risk deflation. for example, federal reserve board announce fomc statement august (cid:147)policy accommodation maintain considerable period.(cid:148) japan suffer deflation, bad problem disinflation. this make strong case bank continue implement easy monetary policy, compare central banks. iii. revitalization corporate sector strong global linkage bear commonly observe fact business sentiment slow improve fix investment become active anticipate various country monetary condition easy comparable stage past business cycles. this partly reflect residual pressure adjustment. but also reflect intensify competition corporate sector together progress globalization, well increase difficulty firm face sustain price power new condition price determined. we may approach stage corporate profit increase create new value-added good services, investment opportunity creation become difficult find. for example, japan, corporate management economic framework establish high-growth period firmly embed difficult challenge task transform them. in regard, i advocate three direction firm pursue view build new framework japanese economy. the first boost competitiveness generate new consumer demand create new value-added good services. the second increase business activity expand chinese asian markets, deepen economic interdependence them. and third address global challenge development sustainable energy source environmental protection. if firm make positive contribution directions, certainly able expand frontier innovation revitalize japanese economy. i hope effort place japanese economy unique position term sustainable development world economy. 4 bi review 38/2003 iv. current situation financial system challenge the japanese financial system, although still face severe condition whole, steadily move toward restore effective functioning. since last fall, grow recognition among financial institution relate party appropriate evaluation economic value nonperforming loan (npls), high provision aggressive write-off loan base evaluation, important accelerate disposal npls. further effort make direction. in fiscal 2002, japanese bank record large net loss second consecutive year. this result clearly reflect severe condition face japanese financial system. at time, signify aggressive disposal npls show substantial decrease npls outstanding major banks. the time come move final stage restore effective function financial system, keep mind complete removal blanket deposit protection schedule april 2005. this removal, view, perceive simply change type coverage deposit insurance protection. instead, recognize turn point financial institution reform management. protection provide temporary buff avoid potential confusion. follow complete removal, financial institution must pursue dynamic management strategy base judgment. to end, financial institution themselves, regulatory authorities, take initiative deal npls. moreover, redouble effort strengthen earn power besides accelerate disposal npls. v. disposal npls corporate revitalization in addition appropriate evaluation, high provisioning, aggressive write-off disposal npls, increase attention pay importance corporate revitalization viewpoint promote reform industrial structure. the industrial revitalization corporation japan (ircj), begin operation may year, recently decide support four firms. the ircj subsequently purchase loan asset four firm lender main bank, decide restructure plan implement it. individual financial institutions, major bank particular, establish subsidiary specialize corporate revitalization. moreover, observe increase number case financial institution set internal section specifically devote corporate revitalization, form alliance outside expert like lawyer certify accountants. the success corporate revitalization require speedy decisive response part firm financial institutions. some firm useful technology expertise find difficult improve business performance large financial legacy past. often firms, collaboration financial institutions, solve problem boldly eliminate unprofitable business concentrate managerial resource core businesses. in regard, mutually beneficial firm financial institution promote sufficient dialogue reach share recognition present future firms’ management. to smoothly promote corporate revitalization, need improve expand market loan asset liquidation, include npls. the expansion would help bank take npls balance sheets, would also invite variety investor diversify risk preference expertise corporate revitalization business. if market expand price loan asset form efficiently, price indicate market’s evaluation corporate revitalization. vi. earn power financial institution strong capital position when effective function financial system finally restored, major bank enjoy strong international competitiveness, local bank able provide new financial service regional development. these benefit possible strengthen earn power. to strengthen earn power, individual financial institution must form judgment number issues. for example, change traditional practice transactions? bi review 38/2003 5 what kind new business develop? how reorganize business model? the bank would like support effort financial institution toward end provide appropriate advice on-site examination daily monitoring. in process, financial institution must ask whether capital position sufficient pursue new business model, not, course need boost capital position. needle say, financial institution raise capital markets. in limit time complete removal blanket deposit protection, however, may able sufficiently. in case, fundamentally two options: either reduce business scope line exist capital position accept public injection capital. i think latter option desirable current condition japan. in words, facilitate process restore effective function financial system new system capital injection, differ exist system seek preempt crises. conclusion a number development indicate japanese economy move desirable direction, even though continue face severe conditions. i believe competitiveness private sector, firm financial institution progressive technology expertise, bring reemergence truly strong japanese economy. the bank stand ready provide full support private sector’s effort toward end maintain easy monetary policy. bi review 37/2003 1 eva srejber: growth competition - lesson past speech m eva srejber, first deputy governor sverige riksbank, sparbanken gripen, b(cid:229)stad, 25 august 2003. * * * thank invitation come speak occasion sparbanken gripen(cid:146)s 150th anniversary. in speech today, i intend attempt draw conclusion experience economic history period. one conclusion swedish growth stimulate period allow market economy operate clear fix game rules, include stable framework fiscal policy monetary policy. if condition existed, pay price form weak economic growth. this speech contain signal regard current monetary policy. the past 150 year excite time, particular first part period. this sweden change remote, develop country high infant mortality rate, widespread poverty starvation, prominent industrial nation. around 1850 sweden enter dynamic period rapid development change. a wave liberalisation sweep across country open important markets. gdp growth amount 2 per cent year, twice high growth rate first half 19th century. a double gdp growth rate might sound particularly exciting, time major effects. an increase gdp growth rate one two per cent entail standard live double within 35 year instead 70 years. for sweden strong growth rate second half 19th century mean emerge develop country stage. a number factor contribute development. free trade important element. our export abroad central process, course facilitate development railway system. during first decade 1850, three main export product contribute rapid export upturn; oats, iron timber. the importance export oat southern part sweden something curiosity. oat fuel time. all horse provide transport industrial city like london require oat much come g(cid:246)taland. the construction railway, well investment industry, house construction agriculture naturally require capital. this mainly obtain abroad. sweden typical example country expansionary economy make use save part europe. this borrow abroad large scale and, prior outbreak first world war, sweden probably indebted nation time. high level international mobility if one look period diagram form, quite strike much growth varied, even five-year slide average used. the fluctuation economic activity considerable course put household vulnerable position, broadly speak social welfare system time. although live condition improve rapidly, still insufficient many people. there extensive emigration. however, large number emigrant return sweden widespread interchange countries. there limitation international mobility people, capital, product ideas. if instead look price developments, observe average low rate price increase around 2 per cent year time, period whole. however, also substantial variations. there general price fall - deflation - number occasions. deflation normally associate large shock 1930s depression usa germany, end 19th century, also price fall sweden otherwise favourable economic climate. one important explanation deflation necessarily cause weak demand economy. rapid productivity growth also generate price fall occur periodically second half 19th century. in situation deflation need bugbear economic development often make be. on hand, move forward year period first world war, see large shock - fall gdp combine high inflation, follow severe deflation 2 bi review 37/2003 begin 1920s. this sweden experience severe economic crisis, rather 1930s case usa germany, instance. if move forward post-war period, unique time high constant growth. during period follow second world war 1970s, standard live rise record rate throughout world. an interest fact although growth sweden period high time, nevertheless rather low international comparison. many european countries, include scandinavian neighbours, grow even rapid rate. however, 1970s problem increased. growth wan inflation rose. we manage temporarily stimulate growth mean substantial devaluations, proper follow-up economy overheated, turn around entirely begin 1990s, result extensive problem financial sector. since decade good growth balance developments. the average growth rate year 3 per cent. this different average growth previous ten years. during transition phase period number important change implement regard allocation resource society. here i refer deregulation financial markets, reform pension, tax social insurance system reduction burden taxation. in addition, wage formation improved, probably facilitate monetary policy focus price stability. it seem probable return macroeconomic stability particular structural reform actively contribute favourable development past decade. on hand, i believe changeover float exchange rate crucial itself. over past century sweden mostly fix exchange rate usually show good growth. at time, past ten-year period special one term euphoric expectation (cid:147)new economy(cid:148) connect telecommunication it. this contribute soar stock market prices, follow fall historic proportions. history demonstrate similar episodes. the railway construction 19th century give rise similar over-optimism, introduction electric internal combustion engine begin 20th century. sometimes, period over-optimism put considerable strain financial system. the strain cause development recent year appear comparatively limited. when invention broad potential application introduced, generally take long time learn best way use them. we tend fix current system solution find difficult see new opportunities. the sober process occur since exorbitant expectation end 1990s regard telecommunication it therefore rule possibility technology stimulate future productivity growth. follow electricity euphoria begin 20th century, various application gradually change everyday life industry households. sweden fully electric decade later. essentially, therefore, i optimistic regard future application telecommunication it achieve economic growth. the financial sector - lubricant economy the financial sector play central role development economy past 150 years. it still does, although general public sometimes critical financial sector - often without consider service sector offer daily life would look without sector. the fundamental function financial sector - financing, risk management intermediation payment - indispensable society. finance entail bring together different wish saver investors. saver want money available directly, investor often require long-term loans. these oppose wish reconcile via banks, also directly via financial markets. the latter assume well-developed secondary market large turnover in, instance, equity. this enable company borrow long-term saver quickly sell share desire. risk manage spread borrowing, also transfer them, payment, others financial market. the spread redistribution financial risk enable investment make would otherwise possible. the third final main task intermediation payments, enable payment smoothly make receive good service sell either conventional manner via, instance, internet. bi review 37/2003 3 in country like sweden tend take grant function work. however, try imagine exist, realise extremely central function economy welfare. if imagine country saver investor access function reliable bank financial markets, easy see would hamper development. the effect would tendency save move abroad, profitable investment project get grind country undeveloped financial sector. if look back 1950s, see intermediation payment function much smoothly today. then, use stand line receive pay packet, life assurance employee bicycle round customers(cid:146) home collect premium almost everyone stand line post office pay rent, electricity bill, etc. from freedom regulation return freedom the condition sparbanken gripen financial sector certainly vary past 150 years. during first part period, financial sector able operate considerable freedom. bank deposit develop basis banks(cid:146) lending. this mean bank create money expand credit extent dare reduce reserves. the bank also play important role foreign borrow occurred, mainly form bond issue germany france. the bank system particularly expansionary around year 1900, many new bank established. some last long. in 1907 financial sector suffer widespread crisis many bank go liquidation, refinance take banks. the next financial crisis coincide deflation begin 1920s. this crisis particularly severe rural sweden, partly severe fall agricultural product prices. deflation make situation difficult farmer encumber debt thereby bank active rural areas. a reaction crisis 1920s, difficulty 1930s kreuger crash particular outbreak second world war, central government tighten grip financial sector. many regulation introduce time still remain towards end 1980s. during period regulation, financial sector look different. it probable regulation curb development economic activity. the regulation covered, instance, central government guarantee finance house construction central government borrow requirement. interest rate keep low equilibrium level hope would stimulate investment growth. this course result large demand loans, manage mean rationing. a necessary condition regulatory system country screen aid currency regulation prevent saver take advantage high interest abroad. one might think self-evident individual able decide world invest savings, long time lack freedom. in words, one financial markets(cid:146) fundamental task eliminate - allocate capital profitable investments. during long period regulation country forget experience 19th century value free movement capital importance price mechanism efficient allocation resources. deregulation since mean currently great similarity late 19th century/early 20th century intervene period regulation. i use word deregulation here. on general level appropriate description, one also describe development term change regulation. this because, time considerable deregulation occurred, regulation remain new one introduced. one important difference, however, today(cid:146)s regulation aim allow price mechanism function, i.e. market-conforming. these regulation usually aim protect saver investor risk abuse. in sense case re-regulation. the financial sector thus fulfil central role lubricant economy. an efficient financial sector increase country(cid:146)s potential growth rate. today approximately 80,000 people employ financial sector, although number bank employee sweden relative term low oecd country. this indicator show relatively efficient financial sector. 4 bi review 37/2003 growth base productivity labour i emphasised, roughly sketch outline, important role growth development standard living. however also play central role monetary policy discussions, demand economy relation production capacity decisive whether inflationary bottleneck arise whether underutilise production potential. it potential growth rate set limits. we riksbank must take account rate change development, even though monetary policy directly affect potential growth. similarly, must take account change competitive conditions, change direct indirect effect development inflation. possible measure strengthen potential growth issue form economic policy, involving, instance, stimulation competition improve allocation resources. the high growth rate past decade primarily generate fact use available resource efficiently. on hand, supply many resource either form hour work capital/investment. from mid-1980s 1993 opposite applied. the limit increase productivity arise due investment, i.e. capital intensity increased. over past ten year impressive annual increase factor productivity, capital intensity increase slow rate. it worry increase labour supply been, still is, limited. in aspect differ country aid increase labour supply raise growth rate. an important explanation poor development sweden amount long-term sickness leave early retirement. worry tendency increase one take account fact future retirement may limit labour supply. however, let u leave discussion labour supply concentrate instead productivity aspect. the combination price stability budget stability important explanation development productivity.1 price budget stability increase households(cid:146) companies(cid:146) willingness make long-term decisions. stable price also entail good information value relative prices, improve allocation resources. if consider factor stimulate upturn productivity recent years, several central changes. one generally seek explanation factor technological developments, education, competence incentive among work force, well allocation resource society. at time, pressure company use resource efficiently increase 1990s. great competitive pressure result increase internationalisation deregulation various sector increase need company economise scant resources. le extravagant use resource mean labour force capital employ area contribute good national economy. although changeover difficult lose jobs, good allocation resource necessary condition improve welfare. openness important productivity also affect country(cid:146)s capacity utilise technological progress countries. this capacity turn dependent open country impulse outside, determine obstacle ideas, products, service production factor move freely across borders. the capacity reconsider regulation institution change adopt important part openness. the negative experience close economy interwar period lead trade barrier successively low second world war. a gradual increase free trade stimulate global economy particularly important small country like sweden. freedom saver choose country save also introduce many countries. the obstacle ideas, products, service production factor move freely across border decline 1 the importance price budget stability productivity growth demonstrated, instance, william easterley (cid:147)when stabilisation expansionary(cid:148), world bank, dec 1995. bi review 37/2003 5 1990s, partly due eu membership ought positive effect factor productivity. internationalisation thus contribute increasingly large part corporate sector become expose competition. increase competition mean company must become efficient cost-conscious, turn positive effect productivity. in addition, new competition act introduce sweden 1993, contain express ban anti-competitive cooperation company ban abuse dominant position. there also deregulation. for instance, state monopoly abolish freedom establish new company regard to, instance, transport, communication energy introduced. change competitive condition thus affect productivity growth, also affect price development directly. despite fact gain much stiff legislation competition 1993, development field appear move slowly. swedish price remain high country several area without explanation form difference vat rate wage levels. increase competition contribute price level converging, assume relative price change accept entail, 1990s electricity telecommunication deregulated, large price reduction sector inflation rate low countries. special interest consumer interest limit competition clear example special interest dominate general consumer interests. there many example various area swedish economy, particular construction sector. this mean allow inefficiency remain, reduce growth development people(cid:146)s standard living. one interest recent example special interest decline concern pharmaceutical prices. a change field introduce october last year, principle mean pharmacy oblige exchange drug prescription cheap equivalent (generic) unless customer will pay difference. the effect new regulation, combine patent expiring, lead significant price competition. pharmaceutical company gradually low price 3,500 reductions, benefit u individual purchase prescription drug tax-payers cost county councils(cid:146) subsidy prescription drug declines. pharmaceuticals(cid:146) cost include cpi one many sub-indices intend reflect average household(cid:146)s cost prescription drugs. over past ten year index rise average rate 12 per cent year. now increase turn around small decrease. the difference historical rate increase current price fall correspond save approximately sek 1 billion year2 swedish households. correspondingly, county councils(cid:146) cost reduce approximately sek 2 billion. there large sum involve deserve attention. nevertheless, difficult find article deal large save increase competition. the main aspect appear lose media. instead, one find article difficulty monopoly company apoteket adapt, exist margin approximately 20 per cent. it would beneficial discussion of, attention pay to, question stimulate competition. in particular case beneficial change appear strongly stimulate competition. if achieve increase competition areas, too, necessary constantly emphasise consumer interest allocation resource become efficient possible protect sector allow operate inefficiently detriment potential growth. 2 statistic sweden calculate households(cid:146) consumption pharmaceutical approximately sek 10 billion year. 6 bi review 37/2003 what learn 150 year history? to summarise, many change swedish economy recent times. the external framework currently characterise considerable fiscal policy monetary policy stability, facilitate plan decision-making household companies. both history country show clearly stable external framework important basis economic growth. we also go back open towards outside world. during war not, obvious reasons. after open long period accord rhetoric, le practice. today regain freedom ideas, products, service production factor reminiscent late 19th century early 20th century. in aspect appear do homework. at time, remember many market sweden still show clear sign lack competition. this entail considerable cost field appear learn history. the significance underline fact various part economy interlinked, often mean strengthen weak part important whole particular industry sector. the complementarity economy3 make particularly important remedy weak link listen humility proposal of, instance, oecd imf. it often easy identify problem one look thing little perspective. i believe swedish economy considerable unused potential strong growth concentrate this, say, make joint share cake grow. 3 the significance complementarity economic policy demonstrate by, instance, aziz wescott 1997 (cid:147)policy complementarity washington consensus(cid:148). t t mboweni: overview south african economy address mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, 83rd ordinary general meet shareholders, pretroria, 26 august 2003. * * * introduction the south african reserve bank achieve considerable success many front difficult economic condition past year. in monetary field, prompt action 2002 help restrain inflationary expectation well maintain international confidence country(cid:146)s commitment responsible macroeconomic policies. the strength international confidence reflect recovery rand(cid:146)s international value, major factor rein back inflationary pressures. in process, oversold net open foreign reserve position (nofp) finally expunge may 2003. against background, possible low interest rate recent months. price stability, basis permanent low inflation, essential precondition economy able achieve sustainable potential growth rate thereby deliver last improvement live standard sector society. the bank therefore remain dedicate task keep inflation within target range, continue ready take prompt action whenever necessary end. in bank sector, financial stability restore serious liquidity problem experience first half 2002. the bank sector remain soundly capitalise well managed, significant progress make application international best practice bank supervision. the highly-developed structure international competitiveness country(cid:146)s financial system whole remain significant national strength. in administration bank, cost reduce significantly number instance department restructured, streamline staff number reduced. the international economic environment

country fiscal deficit widened. however, measure unable prevent major corporate defaults. although exert pressure world financial system, institution generally able cope situation. japanese bank affect bad debt low profit bank europe also encounter problems. insurance company pension fund fare bad banks. of concern volatility experience exchange rate effect financial sector, also real economic activity. in particular, u dollar weaken substantially, could major repercussion world economy. domestic economic development the weakness u dollar major factor significant recovery external value rand. have decline 34 per cent trade-weighted basis 2001, nominal effective exchange rate rand recover 24 per cent 2002 12 per cent end july 2003. the performance rand also relate south africa(cid:146)s inherent economic strength sound consistent macroeconomic policy pursue authorities. improve international perception strong fundamental reflect significant narrow spread internationally-traded south african bonds, recognise high rat country two major international rat agencies, underpin rand(cid:146)s recovery. the positive sentiment market support attractive domestic interest rate increase country(cid:146)s term trade. similarly, real effective exchange rate rand recover markedly since begin 2002. this index, reflect trade-weighted exchange rate rand deflate production price differential south africa main trade partner competitor countries, rise estimate 16 per cent eighteen-month period end june 2003. even increase level real effective exchange rate rand still index value early 2000, i.e. currency market turbulence. this indicate south african producer fairly price competitive, profitability international transaction has, course, fluctuate considerably past three years. domestic output could escape impact still subdue global economy. growth real gross domestic product slow 3‰ per cent first half 2002 3 per cent second half 1‰ per cent first half 2003. this deceleration economic growth spread across sectors, agriculture output actually contract first half 2003. the slow growth accompany increase aggregate employment formal non-agricultural sector economy 2002. an employment gain 54 000 worker recorded. however, preliminary indicator point loss employment opportunity first half 2003. over period, productivity growth recede average remuneration per worker rise estimate annualised rate 10 per cent. a result, nominal unit labour cost continue increase rate upper limit inflation target band 6 per cent. the decline rate economic growth due fall volume exports, whereas domestic demand continue increase strongly. the level short-term interest rate seem little effect domestic demand. the rate increase domestic final demand decline marginally 4 per cent 2002 3‰ per cent first half 2003. the annualised growth real gross domestic expenditure nevertheless remain 4‰ per cent second half 2002 first half 2003. growth real household consumption expenditure slow slightly annualised rate 3 per cent second half 2002 2‰ per cent first half 2003. the sustain high growth consumption expenditure make possible relatively strong increase personal disposable income well rise household debt. household disposable income benefit high salary wages, improve social transfer government income tax reductions. at time, low level debt-to-income ratio household expectation imminent reduction interest rate encourage household incur debt. real household consumption expenditure accordingly retain large part early buoyancy cost significant increase debt. the ratio household debt disposable income nevertheless still relatively low 53 per cent end june 2003. the steadfast growth household consumption expenditure accompany annualised increase real government consumption expenditure vary quarter quarter 3‰ 4 per cent throughout past year. these growth level maintain since begin 2001 signify great emphasis service delivery government(cid:146)s fiscal strategy. the rate increase real fix capital formation pick 2002 reach annualised level 9 per cent second half year. this rate recede still high 8 per cent first half 2003, bring decline fix investment agricultural sector associate low profit farmer mark drop price key agricultural products. other sector continue spend large amount replacement obsolete capital equipment development new ventures. this demonstrate positive expectation sound fundamental sometimes carry weight fix investment decision level short-term interest rates. in contrast continue strong growth domestic demand, export perform le well. in fact, volume export good non-factor service decline 1‰ per cent 2002 2‰ per cent first half 2003. with exception receipt tourist visit south africa, export good service negatively affect decline global economic activity. in 2002 decline volume export coincide increase volume imports. despite decrease crude oil imports, volume total import continue increase first half 2003. the term trade strengthen 2002 first half 2003, net dividend interest payment declined. these development could nevertheless prevent balance current account revert surplus 2002 deficit 1 per cent gross domestic product first half 2003. this deficit neutralise financial inflow rest world consist mainly foreign direct investment, borrow south african government international capital market net inflow portfolio capital. a result, gold foreign reserve country rise us$12,6 billion end 2001 us$18,5 billion end june 2003. on monetary financial fronts, main development past eighteen month summarise follows: 1. the rate increase monetary aggregate slow significantly. for instance, growth broadly define money supply (m3) measure period twelve month decline around 19 per cent early part 2002 le 13 per cent december 2002 single-digit rate first six month 2003. the weak demand money reflect slowdown inflation weak growth real income. 2. the public(cid:146)s demand bank credit remain resilient. have decline 12,5 per cent june 2002 7,8 per cent december, twelve-month growth rate banks(cid:146) total loan advance domestic private sector pick 12,7 per cent june 2003. the continue buoyancy demand bank credit private sector support relatively low debt levels, expectation decline interest rate ongoing increase price houses, flat townhouses. 3. the money market continue relatively liquid. the reserve bank mainly use foreign exchange swaps, reserve bank debenture reverse-repurchase agreement drain surplus liquidity, phase banks(cid:146) vault cash hold form part require cash reserve also contribute towards end. the daily liquidity requirement bank maintain around r11 billion measures. 4. short-term interest rate begin move downwards april 2003. have increase 400 basis point conjunction repo rate first nine month 2002 stabilise high level next six months, short-term rate decline approximately 200 basis point end july 2003. 5. private-sector company make increase use primary bond market finance activities. with subdue share price cost fund money market high bond market, several company issue bonds. the outstanding value private-sector loan stock list bond exchange south africa therefore increase r29 billion june 2002 r42 billion june 2003. 6. long-term bond yield trend downward late march 2002, reflect market(cid:146)s favourable view long-term prospect inflation impact small public-sector borrow requirement. in combination high level short-term interest rates, lead sharply invert yield curve. however, reduction repo rate june 2003, shape yield curve begin normalise. 7. the recovery external value rand mirror considerable extent movement share price jse security exchange south africa. expectation impact exchange rate rand corporate profitability, together gloomy international sentiment among equity investors, lead mark decline domestic share prices. from high point 22 may 2002, all-share price index decline 37 per cent recent low point 25 april 2003. subsequently, share price recover 20 per cent end july. public finance a expansionary fiscal policy stance adopt government since 2001 budget, policy remain supportive low inflation promote stability. this cautious expansionary fiscal stance set maintain medium term increase long-term growth capacity economy. government(cid:146)s main goal reduce unemployment ensure economic growth development benefit communities. in accordance policy stance, government(cid:146)s deficit well-contained fiscal year 2002/03. the non-financial public-sector borrow requirement amount 1 per cent gross domestic product year. this make possible continue strong growth revenue collection considerable discipline apply government expenditure. on account low deficit downward revaluation foreign-currency denominate loans, ratio government(cid:146)s outstanding debt gross domestic product decline 46 per cent end march 2002 41 per cent end march 2003. monetary policy monetary policy dominate past year respond inflationary pressure arise exogenous shock form substantial depreciation external value rand late 2001 sharp rise international oil prices. these shock mainly responsible surge twelve-month rate increase consumer price index metropolitan urban area exclude interest mortgage (cpix) low 5,8 per cent september 2001 peak 11,3 per cent october november 2002. the twelve-month rate increase all-goods production price index also rise 7,8 per cent september 2001 level 15,4 per cent august september 2002. a result, monetary policy committee oblige increase repo rate 400 basis point total first nine month 2002. these increase prompt fact inflationary pressures, first mainly confine rise food energy prices, become broadly base end influence price good also price service directly affect exchange rate developments. the increase repo rate base factor rise inflation expectations, increase nominal unit labour cost high growth money supply bank credit extension. the monetary policy committee conclude meet november 2002 level interest rate appropriate avert inflation spiral. although still unclear time whether inflation peaked, repo rate keep unchanged number development indicate inflationary pressure could begin abate. these include decline quarter-to-quarter production price index 26,0 per cent first quarter 2002 11,2 per cent third quarter; strengthen external value rand; decline international oil prices; slow growth bank credit extension; deceleration pace growth broadly define money supply aggregates. give time lag change monetary policy ultimate impact inflation, increase repo rate unable prevent breach inflation target 3 6 per cent 2002. in south africa estimate take 18 24 month change short-term interest rate fully impact rate increase consumer prices. in 2002 rate increase cpix average 9,3 per cent, 330 basis point upper limit target. apart direct monetary policy step take 2002, minister finance announce october inflation target 3 5 per cent 2004 2005 would adjust target 2004 would set 3 6 per cent. subsequently, announce target 2005 would remain level target 2006 would make public october 2003. these announcement make recognition fact exogenous shock throw downward path inflation course excessively tight monetary policy high short-term cost term output loss avoid far possible. by time march 2003 meet monetary policy committee clear rise inflation contained. the twelve-month rate increase cpix fall 9,3 per cent production price index 6,2 per cent. in addition, growth money supply bank credit extension come single-digit level rand recover remarkably second half 2002. despite positive picture, development cause monetary policy committee remain cautious change policy stance prematurely. in particular, committee influence fact meet take place day war iraq started. at stage uncertain impact war would global economy, specifically oil prices. other consideration lead decision keep repo rate unchanged include concern level wage settlements, rise unit labour costs, large increase administer price forecast cpix inflation would close upper limit inflation target 2004. at june 2003 meet monetary policy committee confront revision inflation figure statistic south africa. although turn point pattern change previous revise monthly series coincide fairly closely, revision bring almost 2 percentage point low originally estimate year-on-year increase cpix early month 2003. the revision affect inflation outlook well reserve bank(cid:146)s forecast. take revision recent economic development consideration, bank(cid:146)s forecast indicate inflation rate would move within target range second half 2003 would come close mid-point target range 2004. a number factor also influence decision reduce repo rate 150 basis point meeting. first, end war iraq bring great stability oil market. second, clear exchange rate rand maintain recover level spite continue volatility. third, clear sign inflation pressure emanate abroad would remain weak. finally, inflation expectation decline south africa domestic condition generally favour disinflation. another development meet decision increase number meet monetary policy committee four six per year. the previous decision limit number schedule meet four prompt argument meet coincide availability quarterly data. however, lead long interval meetings. it therefore decide even late quarterly data available meeting, enough high-frequency statistic take inform decisions. more frequent meet add advantage reduce fear sudden unexpected interest rate adjustments, way promote monetary policy transparency further. on 14 august 2003, monetary policy committee announce reduction 100 basis point repo rate level 11 per cent. this decision take decline inflation rate continue line reserve bank(cid:146)s projection inflation outlook generally remain favourable. however, committee express concern high rate increase administer prices, level wage settlements, continue strong performance domestic demand acceleration money supply growth second quarter 2003. exchange rate policy exchange rate policy leave unchanged past year. a precede year, determination external value rand leave market bank intervene foreign-exchange market affect exchange rate. although bank would prefer strong rather weak rand inflation perspective, target exchange rate. a emphasise numerous occasions, bank(cid:146)s policy intervene market affect level direction change exchange rate rand. the exchange rate rand quite volatile past year. unfortunately, seem fact life emerging-market economy even advance economy irrespective monetary policy framework adopted. although bank would, course, prefer great exchange rate stability, fluctuation external value rand unavoidable current international monetary system generally float exchange rates. we know experience even rand peg another currency basket currencies, would still float currency fluctuate widely times. the authority aim create underlie economic condition conducive exchange rate stability. one factor contribute large fluctuation rand past large oversold nofp bank. the bank(cid:146)s state objective eliminate open position, stand us$ 23,2 billion end september 1998. during past year bank purchase fairly modest amount foreign currency market appropriate times, also deliver proceed government(cid:146)s global eurobond issue us$ 1,25 billion may 2003 oversold forward exchange book bank. these transaction convert oversold nofp us$ 1,8 billion mid-2002 overbought position us$ 0,9 billion end july 2003. have remove perceive vulnerability, price discovery process foreign-exchange market display good two-way trade pattern. with oversold nofp expunged, bank shift focus reduce oversold forward book seek time strengthen official foreign exchange reserve position. the balance oversold forward book stand us$ 4,1 billion end july 2003, compare us$ 7 billion time previous annual meet bank. in accordance policy phase gradual dismantle exchange controls, minister finance announce exchange control relaxation budget speech 26 february 2003. these include new dispensation offshore portfolio investments, mechanism unwind pool emigrants(cid:146) block fund exchange control amnesty. stability bank sector the liquidity problem experience small bank eventual erosion deposit base big bank first half 2002, resolve satisfactory manner past year. in process, however, certain consequence bank industry could avoided. the activity two large banks, saambou bank limit boe bank limited, merge big domestic banks. in addition, reluctance depositor place fund small bank cause bank cancel bank registrations, others redesign ownership structure downsize balance sheets. the turbulence experience bank sector therefore result consolidation activity return stability achieved. at end june 2003, approximately 83 per cent total deposit public land vault big four banks. these change also make difficult start new bank small bank remain business. this could affect availability operational capital new entrepreneurs, highly essential economic development. small bank often will big bank finance high-risk venture versatile easily target niche markets. despite developments, south africa(cid:146)s bank system remain sound. bank operate country well capitalised, average risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio 12,4 per cent end june 2003. moreover, 35 bank hold 98 per cent total bank asset capital adequacy ratio exceed statutory minimum 10 per cent. the liquidity bank sector also generally adequate. the average daily amount liquid asset hold june 2003 exceed minimum requirement 20 per cent. growth total asset bank moderate appreciably 2002, grow rapidly first six month 2003 change regulatory account practice require many off-balance sheet item include balance sheets. however, quality asset remain high. non-performing loan amount nearly r25 billion end june 2003, represent 2,6 per cent total loan advances. the provision make bank non-performing loan also adequate. although household debt disposable income rise first half 2003, ratio still well average precede five years. the ratio corporate debt profits, indication debt-servicing capacity businesses, increase 5,4 per cent second quarter 2002 6,4 per cent second quarter 2003. this ratio average past five years, probably decline corporate profit well increase corporate debt. bank continue manage well. the average efficiency ratio improve past year, return equity assets. a special independent investigation concern corporate governance confirm south africa(cid:146)s lead bank commit high standard management. the bank adhere broadly international best practice. certain suggestion nevertheless make improve function banks. the major deficiency investigation encounter board bank big operate cohesively. it therefore suggest size board preferably restrict 16 member number executive director ideally exceed four. although continue vigilance require ensure bank comply evolve standards, major concern regard. bank well course bring risk-management system data model line could require compliance basel ii 2007. this new capital accord radical reform previous one impact bank area regulatory capital, credit operational risk management, data disclosure requirements. bank positive comply new accord regard strategic challenge. the application new framework require re-engineering supervision process organisational structures. in collaboration supervisors, bank develop implementation strategy basel ii. follow international corporate failures, account audit standard revise overhauled. a part ongoing endeavour ensure quality transparency financial reporting, shift make past year away historical cost fair value account financial instruments, i.e. application account statement ac 133. a indicate earlier, lead substantial increase report total asset banks. a ministerial panel review account professions(cid:146) bill revise regulation applicable auditor accountants. although standard aim promote integrity financial market institution ensure stability, concern management transition ultimate cost comply increase legislation affect banks. prepare basel ii considerable task. combine onerous requirement new anti-money launder anti-terrorist fund legislation, corporate governance standard impend community reinvestment legislation, increase risk bank could lose sight main business objectives. non-bank financial institution may also escape burden. south africa(cid:146)s recent accession financial action task force (fatf) money launder affect operation almost financial firms. another challenge face bank sector provide broad access affordable financial services. a large portion population still access bank facilities. the challenge broaden access finance address deference regulatory objective achieve high degree economic efficiency consumer protection economy. this require balance introduction change achieve objective great participation maintenance financial stability. the financial sector process develop financial sector black economic empowerment charter promote increase black ownership access financial firms. a case mine charter, key element financial sector charter likely include ownership, career procurement opportunities, human resource development. we support process. moreover, ever since attack world trade centre 11 september 2001, need multilateral co-ordination ensure continuity financial system high agenda bank sector. the bank assist establishment financial sector contingency forum contingency planning. a key objective forum identify crisis event may threaten stability south african financial sector develop appropriate plans, mechanism structure mitigate potential threat manage crisis events. regional economic co-operation the promotion regional economic co-operation africa generally southern african development community (sadc) specifically continue form part major activity south african reserve bank. the bank fully support new partnership africa(cid:146)s development (nepad) goal accelerate growth sustainable development, poverty eradication reverse marginalisation africa globalisation process. we continue play active role towards realisation ideals. the bank also participate actively committee central bank governor sadc region past year. the major initiative undertake include establishment common monetary area cross-border payment oversight committee; implementation cross-border foreign exchange record system namibia, swaziland zimbabwe; significant progress harmonisation national payment systems, information communication technology capacity, bank supervision exchange control; agreement promotion focus price stability appropriate realisable target macroeconomic convergence prerequisite monetary integration. internal administration in order achieve objective price financial stability ensure activity conduct efficiently, number change make internal administration reserve bank past year. in particular, reduction cost without loss productivity receive high priority. staff operational cost thoroughly scrutinise minimise expenses. a moratorium place appointment effect 1 august 2002 reduce staff numbers. moreover, voluntary early retirement package also offer april 2003 282 staff member age 50 old curtail costs. a total 173 response receive date, 114 staff member indicate accept offer. a number initiative launch area information communication technology focus cost reduction improve efficiency. the renewal mainframe improve management network infrastructure result significant cost save time, address future capacity requirement improve availability reliability bank(cid:146)s infrastructure. in review implementation bank(cid:146)s cash handle strategy, average overnight notes-held-to-order limit commercial bank increased, service arrangement mpumalanga limpopo province terminated, levy introduce banknote deposit withdraw banks. the bank(cid:146)s seven branch meet distribution circulation requirement bank cash industry. the overall productivity branch keep track establish requirement process banknote average 95 per cent instal capacity. strategy combat counterfeit banknote coin developed. in line international best practice, bank enhance security feature banknote near future deter counterfeiting. a decision also make introduce new r5 coin response counterfeit coins. significant progress make strengthen bank(cid:146)s ability oversee safety soundness payment system strengthen regulatory framework. in align south africa(cid:146)s payment system practice arrangement international developments, discussion take place domestic bank continuous link settlement bank london. the aim reduce foreign exchange settlement risk synchronisation settlement two leg foreign exchange transaction single time zone. the bank also enter negotiation banker service company (bankserv) determine feasability transfer ownership operation sarb-link network bankserv reduce costs. in effort avoid duplication save costs, former money capital market department international bank department merge one new department, financial market department. the merger reflect increase integration south africa global financial markets, make distinction domestic international financial market le relevant. the merger add benefit facilitate improve co-ordination monetary policy implementation, allow efficient allocation human resources. cost save also important objective operation bank(cid:146)s subsidiaries. a result current project low domestic international demand coin, staff sa mint company (pty) limit reduce 40 per cent combination natural attrition, early retirement retrenchment programme. in addition, management sa mint restructure improve efficiency. in sa bank note company (pty) limit market intensify increase capacity utilisation. the market initiative pay award two banknote print contract african countries. the train development staff continue important objective bank. in regard south african reserve bank college play major role offer variety learn programmes. the various department also put considerable effort on-the-job train staff members. the bank commit achieve objective staff transformation 2005, report annually progress department labour term employment equity act, no 55 1998. in keep decision shareholder 25 april 2002 terminate list bank jse security exchange south africa, over-the-counter share transfer facility trade reserve bank share established. this facility deliver desire result 87 registration respect 240 237 share effect 31 march 2003. finally, extension head office building, start 2001, completed. the build meet bank(cid:146)s requirement respect office space, park conference facilities. staff member work build relocate premise duration build alterations, move back head office building. acknowledgement all improvement function reserve bank could achieve help person institutions. in conclusion, i therefore want thank everyone assist bank accomplish objectives. in regard i name presidency, government parliament support work. i also wish express appreciation board director reserve bank, include deputy governors, commitment bank. in particular, i want thank dr m t de waal, retire board, contribution past years. last least, i want thank management staff bank outstanding way perform duties. they respond vigour challenge encounter demonstrate commitment high professionalism perform work. this truly remarkable institution associate with. thank you. bi review 36/2003 1 toshiro muto: what learn (cid:147)unconventional(cid:148) market operations? speech mr toshiro muto, deputy governor bank japan, occasion meet participant market operations, tokyo, 23 july 2003. * * * i. monetary policy uncharted territory a japanese economy face severe adjustment recent years, bank japan effect various measure unprecedented central bank, include zero interest rate policy, quantitative easing, commitment continue current policy consumer price index stably reach zero above. moreover, bank able purchase asset-backed security end july, thus expand scope asset purchases. people often talk so-called (cid:147)unconventional monetary policy(cid:148) deflation. all measure consider unconventional light traditional central banking. until recently, appear zero interest rate policy quantitative ease consider special case japan, country suffer deflation. however, several country whose policy interest rate approach zero. for example, short-term policy rate 1 percent unite state zero 0.75 percent switzerland. a result, zero interest rate policy quantitative ease increasingly attract attention countries. since bank begin conduct monetary policy uncharted territory, constantly make new find area financial market money market operations. a pioneer central bank uncharted territory, bank unique position explain audience home abroad experience zero interest rate policy quantitative easing. a expert market operation financial market transactions, i feel may stimulate focus talk issue mutual interest relate market operation financial markets, rather talk development economy monetary policy general. it often say devil details. therefore, i believe useful fruitful discussion monetary policy share find market operation quantitative easing, even though find may appear rather technical. ii. find area market operation there important pillar current quantitative ease framework. among them, important use outstanding balance current account deposit bank main operate target provide ample fund market operations. a. increase demand current account deposit obviously, provide ample fund market, short-term interest rate fall zero. if short-term interest rate significantly zero, financial institution limit amount fund current account deposits, pay interest, roughly require reserves. such behavior familiar many central bank many years. but would happen short-term interest rate decline zero? a little two year ago target market operation change overnight call rate outstanding balance current account deposits, market participant bank doubt whether really possible bank provide current account deposit fund far excess around 4 trillion yen, require reserve time. in fact, month may 2001, two month new target 5 trillion yen current account deposit introduced, frequently observe undersubscription market operation bid fell short bank(cid:146)s offers. you may recall undersubscription occur repeatedly also subsequent market operations. however, since autumn 2002 target current account deposit raise (cid:147)around 10 15 trillion yen(cid:148) (cid:147)around 15 20 trillion yen,(cid:148) undersubscription rarely occurred. the target raise since then, stand (cid:147)around 27 30 trillion yen.(cid:148) indeed, high level target unthinkable quantitative ease first introduced. with caveat 2 bi review 36/2003 probably limit increase target since inconceivable financial institution hold asset current account deposit bank, first find experience two year quantitative ease central bank provide fairly large amount fund even zero interest rates. among factor enable provision large amount funds, initially consider almost impossible, follow two factor stand significantly increase financial institutions(cid:146) demand current account deposit bank. one factor grow conviction many financial institution would problem hold current account deposit substantially exceed require reserves, result virtual disappearance opportunity cost hold current account deposits. at present, major bank also regional bank foreign banks(cid:146) branch japan hold sizable current account deposit bank. the interest income earn money market small financial institution keep daily excess fund current account deposit bank rather invest money market view administrative cost possible losses, however unlikely, due default counterparties. another factor relate periodic rise concern financial system stability trigger event fall stock prices. when availability fund tend tight end financial year, include mid-year book closing, calendar-year end, financial institution try smooth funding. this increase demand hold current account deposit bank. in fact, financial crisis 1997-98, money market shrank, liquidity shortage force number financial institution rapidly deteriorate creditworthiness bankruptcy. it may quite natural renew memory period prompt extremely strong demand current account deposit bank. b. factor lead undersubscription such increase demand current account deposit market participant must somehow meet supply. otherwise, interest rate rise. a know, supply make form bank(cid:146)s funds-supplying operations, market participant place bid bank(cid:146)s offers. thus, second find quantitative ease bank need devise variety measure provide ample funds. for example, even market operation result undersubscription, others successful. also, extent undersubscription vary depend time year. it easy deduce situation theoretical analysis aggregate supply demand current account deposits. have say this, one main reason undersubscription grow sense surfeit fund market. this case may 2001, soon target current account deposit introduced, sentiment additional supply fund redundant seem grow strong day day. the undersubscription february march 2002 summer 2002 cause part sentiment, factor also work. undersubscription likely occur increase market participants(cid:146) demand financial asset bank offer purchase market operations. funds-supplying operation transaction central bank provide fund current account deposit financial institution purchase specific financial asset. for example, february march 2002, uncertainty financial system stability heighten full protection time deposit lift april. moreover, demand risk-free asset treasury bill (tbs) finance bill (fbs) economic agents, include financial institutions, increase significantly market. in circumstances, bank(cid:146)s offer purchase tb fbs fail attract sufficient number bids, undersubscription ensued. a change long-standing skew distribution fund across financial institution also contribute undersubscription. in past, major bank balance-sheet structure deposit receive fell short loans. at present, deposit major bank excess loan reflect inflow deposits. a result, fund need market reduced. it certain whether undersubscription recur future. but certain success central bank provide massive amount fund zero interest rate depend micro-level factors, include fund position individual financial institution demand specific asset use bank(cid:146)s market operations, addition overall supply bi review 36/2003 3 demand current account deposit central bank. in regard, closely monitor change financial market, bank carefully select mean carry market operation smooth provision funds. for example, bank recently expand scope acceptable bill lengthen maturity period 12 month well range eligible counterparties bill purchase operations. it also conduct combination longer-term funds-providing operation shorter-term funds-absorbing operations. iii. challenge quantitative ease a. criterion assess financial market stability the first challenge quantitative ease select criterion bank ass state financial market conduct market operations. some economist may argue quantitative ease framework require bank mechanically maintain target balance current account deposit every day. unfortunately, necessarily case. even bank maintain target balance, case financial market remain unstable. in cases, ensure financial market stability become important. then, question ass subtle change financial market light maintain stability. in money market, tighten market necessarily translate change overnight interest rates, rate around zero. for example, even concern financial system stability intensify autumn 2002, unsecured overnight call rate stay 0.001 percent. however, repo rate forward transactions, yield tb long maturity, offer rate bank(cid:146)s funds-supplying operation increased. thus, conduct market operation circumstances, become important judge extent target balance current account deposit achieve various interest rate stabilize ensure financial market stability. moreover, criterion judgment differ depend economic financial conditions. therefore, become challenge judge whether financial market stability maintained. b. how evaluate function financial market the second challenge maintain function financial markets. the word (cid:147)call(cid:148) money market derive phrase (cid:147)money call,(cid:148) refer money available demand. the amount outstanding call market decrease substantially financial institution felt would problem hold reserve far excess require reserves. since call market market participant lend borrow short-term funds, shrink market imply possibility financial institution may able appropriately perform bank activity. therefore, bank inevitably serious concern maintain function market. lender money market reluctant lend market rate fall virtually zero. some regional bank close tokyo branches. it also point that, liquidity call market decline result le market participation, market may function effectively fund procurement time emergency. let elaborate illustrate point examples. the amount outstanding call market stand 26.5 trillion yen end february 2001 introduction quantitative easing. this amount fell roughly 10 trillion yen two year 16.5 trillion yen end february 2003. in addition introduction quantitative easing, two factor among others consider contribute reduction: one progress consolidation among large financial institutions, shift deposit large banks, usually fund side call market, result partial removal blanket deposit insurance. let u look contrast call transaction involve overnight instrument involve term instruments. the amount outstanding overnight transaction fell 20 percent, 15.3 trillion yen end february 2001 12.3 trillion yen end february 2003. during period, amount outstanding transaction involve term instrument decrease 11.2 trillion yen 4.2 trillion yen, one-third level end february 2001. look money market term secure transactions, total amount bond gensaki repo transaction hardly changed, remain around 18 trillion yen per business day 4 bi review 36/2003 period. in fact, amount outstanding secure call market even large introduction quantitative easing. these fact suggest deterioration function money market phenomenon relate zero interest rates, also extremely cautious attitude market participant take credit risks. i mention japan, short-term market rate decline virtually zero, lender become reluctant lend, regional bank close tokyo branches. similarly, unite states, decline federal fund rates, heat discussion far interest rate money management fund could decline relative return trust funds, whether decline interest rate would interfere effective function major channel fund intermediation. in essence, discussion unite state japan something common. the transaction settlement fund security well assessment credit risk always entail fix costs. and short-term market rate approach zero, interest revenue may fall short costs. this tend hind smooth implementation various financial transactions. the relationship zero interest rate policy quantitative ease market function require multifaceted examination. thus, would like examine issue broad perspective, focus narrowly decline amount outstanding call market. iv. outright purchase long-term japanese government bond (jgbs) i comment early one find quantitative ease need bank devise variety measure provide ample funds. i also mention financial market stability deterioration market function context concern challenge quantitative easing. a application discussions, i would like turn outright purchase long-term jgbs bank. many central bank major industrialize country conduct monetary policy mainly money market operations. it unite state japan also conduct outright purchase long-term government bond large scale. even bank begin quantitative easing, effect outright purchase long-term jgbs provide liquidity sustainable growth line long-term trend increase banknotes. when introduce quantitative easing, bank adopt new framework market operation accord would increase amount outright purchase long-term jgbs consider increase necessary smooth provision liquidity, subject limitation outstanding amount long-term jgbs effectively hold bank keep outstanding balance banknote issued. base thinking, bank increase amount outright purchase long-term jgbs four times, initial 400 billion yen per month current 1.2 trillion yen per month. a result, bank hold 60 trillion yen long-term jgbs, account 60 percent monetary base. from viewpoint conduct market operations, outright purchase long-term jgbs, adoption quantitative easing, greatly contribute achieve smoothly target outstanding balance current account deposit bank. undersubscription yet repeat bank(cid:146)s market operations. however, case arise again, would highly reassure practical standpoint bank mean secure fix amount increase outstanding balance every month. let share observation relation significant increase outright purchase long-term jgbs. the first observation regard outright purchase long-term jgbs market operation result undersubscription. the question market participant take trouble bid bank(cid:146)s offer outright purchase long-term jgbs sell bond market. if asked, market participant give follow explanation question. first, bank require market participant bid actively offers, one bank(cid:146)s requirement participation market operations. second, sell large amount long-term jgbs bank(cid:146)s outright purchase small effect market price sell market. and third, unlike short-term interest rates, interest rate long-term jgbs yet reach zero. all explanation appear plausible, cannot conclusive. the first explanation also apply bi review 36/2003 5 bank(cid:146)s market operation provide short-term funds, operation actually experience undersubscription. the second one may hold true extent. the third explanation interest rate long-term jgbs yet reach zero seem convincing. whatever explanations, viewpoint provide ample fund analyze effect market price jgbs, pay attention motivation market participant bid bank(cid:146)s offers. the second observation provision fund dependent largely outright purchase long-term jgbs create concern bank(cid:146)s market operations. the bank currently conduct outright purchase long-term jgbs high rate 1.2 trillion yen per month. it balance sheet end march 2003 reveal total banknote current account deposit increase 6.5 trillion yen year early liability side. on asset side, outright purchase long-term jgbs increase substantially, money market operation decreased. in fact, amount outstanding long-term jgbs hold bank end march 2003 increase roughly 9 trillion yen year earlier, amount fund provide money market operation decrease 7 trillion yen. the difference 3 trillion yen increase total banknote current account deposit amount fund provide bank explain decrease government excess funds, pay private sector. if decrease volume transaction money market cause difficulty financial institution smoothly raise short-term funds, bank(cid:146)s money market operation may provide alternative mean secure smooth funding. in context, decrease bank(cid:146)s money market operation could destabilize factor financial markets. even surplus fund money market whole, money market rate could rise slightly due decrease supply short-term fund bank. if money market rate sufficiently positive concern financial system stability, bank would free use asset operations, surplus shortage fund would ultimately adjust market. however, currently case japan. the outright purchase long-term jgbs mean smoothly increase outstanding balance current account deposits, play significant role secure financial market stability. at time, purchase engender unexpected side effects, few opportunity bank conduct money market operations, case lead slight rise money market rates. let briefly touch upon relationship long-term interest rate outright purchase long-term jgbs. market participant often point decline long-term interest rate mid-june partly due bank(cid:146)s outright purchase long-term jgbs. the outright purchase long-term jgbs 1.2 trillion yen per month could facilitate adjustment dealers(cid:146) position market. and appear easy understand long-term interest rate fall reason, existence purchase would make dealer bullish otherwise. but, base observation yield ten-year jgbs fluctuate 0.4 percent 1.4 percent past month so, relationship long-term interest rate outright purchase long-term jgbs may simple appears. v. relationship bank counterparties market operation a. find area supply demand fund the number counterparties bank(cid:146)s market operation close 150 present. when financial institution become eligible counterparty bank(cid:146)s market operations, request bid actively bank(cid:146)s offer market operations, process transaction accurately swiftly, provide bank market information analysis useful conduct monetary policy. in addition, bank recently begin consider amount successful bid previous year criterion selection counterparties market operation follow year. these request make central bank need effect monetary operation smooth provision funds. also, eligibility criterion counterparties must transparent possible since impossible conduct transaction market participants. 6 bi review 36/2003 have say this, let note bank counterparties market operation important trade party financial markets. in opinion, term (cid:147)trading party(cid:148) two significant implications. the first implication bank counterparties aim achieve respective goal transaction fund jgbs. the bank control amount money market level interest rates, bank(cid:146)s counterparties adjust position fund jgb hold improve profitability. let take example undersubscription. undersubscription bank(cid:146)s funds-supplying operation occur follow cases: financial institution already secure enough fund satisfy reserve requirement period; manage raise sufficient fund market cover interim fiscal year-end book closings; and, sell tb fbs cp hold end-investors without difficulties. thus, undersubscription occur counterparties need bank(cid:146)s market operations. this imply that, order smoothly conduct market operations, bank must understand satisfy counterparties(cid:146) need market operations. it also mean bank must devise market operation create need. this rather obvious point clearly recognize past framework interest rate target. in framework, bank rather passive. it provide fund interest rate rise high target, absorb fund interest rate fell target. in contrast, present framework fund amply provide achieve target balance current account deposits, bank pressure increase fund hold current account deposit line target. this increase ever awareness significance transaction financial markets. for example, reason observe tighten condition certain market money markets, financial market department bank consider provide fund market. give responsibility ensure market stability, provision fund circumstance would clearly appropriate decision. look differently, tighten market condition suggest demand fund particular market. a bank try maintain balance current account deposit unprecedentedly high levels, take advantage demand smooth provision funds. b. exchange information market operation the second implication trade party bank counterparties exchange information. a suggest term (cid:147)market intelligence,(cid:148) may able obtain variety information knowledge carefully monitor market movements. this reason request counterparties provide u market information analysis useful conduct monetary policy. we conduct market operation daily, result operation important source information u gain insight counterparties(cid:146) assessment offers. of course, one-way flow information. presumably result market operation offer counterparties valuable information overall market conditions, include insight action participate players. it may perhaps seem counterintuitive, result market operation come play increasingly important role, give reduce number transaction take place money market. i would like add that, player market, bank counterparties market operation exchange information idea improve market infrastructure make market function smoothly. conclude remark my talk today focus technical aspect market operation conduct quantitative easing. it include number issue fundamental importance think conduct monetary policy. market functioning, i touch upon, one important issues. we bank continue exert every effort enhance transmission mechanism monetary policy, ensure smooth provision fund within framework quantitative easing. bi review 36/2003 7 we closely monitor market even slight change various channels, include daily market operations. however, believe major market player like posse reliable information insight market condition direct deal variety customers. a uncharted territory monetary policy, appreciate share u insight together navigate water safely. bi review 36/2003 1 r basant roi: regulatory supervisory infrastructure mauritius address

policy korea contribution mr seung park, governor bank korea, korea times, 24 september 2003. * * * 1. the korean economic situation outlook from early year, korea experience difficult economic situation since overcome 1997 currency crisis. last year(cid:146)s strong gdp growth 6.3 percent achieve backdrop depress world economy. this year, though, korean gdp grow 3.7 percent first quarter compare period previous year slide 1.9 percent second quarter. although economic activity appear worsen trough second quarter, clearly mark recovery trend yet become evident. this lackluster economic performance come primarily unfavorable external factors. the recovery major economy worldwide significantly u.s. prove delayed. uncertainty also mount response war iraq, north korean nuclear issue widespread outbreak sars within east southeast asia. unsurprisingly, domestic demand contract greatly, particularly form consumption facility investment. lately, external condition show gradual improvement. after early end war iraq, economy u.s. japan show clear sign recovery. euroland yet shake recession, indicator consumer business confidence pick up. china see strong economic growth sars contained. all all, general outlook global economy brightening. in addition, hope grow north korean nuclear issue peacefully resolve as, prompt hold multilateral talks, country involve step effort

challenges. there already sign social consensus reach need overcome problem i mention good korean economy. the government also direct attention toward cure evil spiral social costs. 2. monetary policy in light shift economic environment, bank korea conduct monetary policy support economic recovery smooth internal external disequilibria. 2 bi review 42/2003 early year, current account move red upward price pressure bring steep run-up international oil prices, difficulty make use interest rate policy lever deal downturn economic activities. we therefore leave target rate, overnight call

stable within target range 3 percent level current account maintain underlie surplus trend since 1997 currency crisis. under circumstances, bank korea move revive business consumer confidence. in may july, reduce overnight call rate 50 basis point all, bring present historically low level 3.75 percent. a number action also take bank korea stabilize financial markets. it ensure adequate supply

continue structural adjustment hong kong arise economic integration mainland, grow rapidly, bring challenge well opportunities: interest time see hong kong. it may surprise hkimr decide follow splendid precedent set reserve bank new zealand 2002 host year(cid:146)s workshop. but much surprise. rather give traditional lecture morning, let explain why, chairman board hkimr, i feel conference important. but i first say this: hkimr establish hkma, council advisors, i member, determine programme activities. it therefore enjoy professional independence. thus, i party council(cid:146)s deliberation of, decision support, professor crosby(cid:146)s proposal hold workshop here. but i please council advisor decide so. i start observation hong kong(cid:146)s economy - like many asian economy - small ship big ocean. while weather today may placid, wind pick without warn wave forbidding. you know series massive speculative capital flow asian economies, even australia new zealand, expose asian financial crisis, hong kong finally ride storm. in time those, policymakers naturally ask right course steer, right policy follow. one policy clear - ensure boat seaworthy possible. this, course, seek do. follow asian financial crisis take large number measure improve function currency board, efficiency financial infrastructure hong kong broadly. we also continue monitor improve system bank supervision, recognition fact one reason ride asian financial crisis undoubtedly bank strong. some observer suggest throw sand wheel international finance. by limit capital flows, argument goes, become easy central bank maintain monetary financial stability turbulent time cope potency international finance come globalisation. indeed, control one form another become quite popular region. but, international financial centre hong kong, whose main source income stem ever-growing economic financial integration rest world economy, policy is, us, clearly undesirable. moreover, basic law hong kong also bar foreign exchange control policy restriction free flow capital within, hong kong. others suggest hong kong economy would good able withstand economic shock disturbance currency board adjust give way something else: different observer different pet idea seem agreement alternative would be. i speak great many time topic i propose today. let say i remain convince currency board remain fundamental source stability hong kong 239 month existence since come october 1983. what else do ensure monetary financial stability hong kong, also rather fragment diverse region, term geography, size markets, culture stage economic development? to mind, much great regional co-operation monetary financial arena policy agenda. such co-operation take many forms, range increase open

host country region. i sure imf world bank make excellent choice select dubai venue. i thank unite arab emirate warm hospitality splendid organizational performance. ii. the economic situation many part world improved. the imf(cid:146)s late forecast indicate upswing way. while broadly share view, see, however, still number risks. in context, i wish mention three problems: first, widespread concern large current account deficit surplus sustainable. reduce trade restriction internal imbalance would mitigate risk disorderly exchange rate adjustments. however, measure distort exchange rates, trade, capital movement counterproductive. global economic problem require multilateral resolutions. second, despite progress consolidate government budgets, risk associate large budget deficit mean averted: this least reflect recent rise long-term interest rates. therefore, fiscal consolidation must continued. this particular challenge period insufficient growth. a medium-term fiscal framework could help overcome problems. third, monetary policy maker currently face unfamiliar situation: for several year now, inflation rate nominal interest rate low level decades. at time, ample liquidity still growing. new bubble must avoided. therefore, central bank must remain vigilant. a central bank governor, i particularly keen make point. iii. lady gentlemen, despite risks, economic upswing broaden gain strength. this provide opportunity must seize fully implement ongoing reforms. we know reform may painful short run. however, provide basis high growth long term benefit all. iv. we make sure economic upswing stabilize broaden sound financial environment. the imf world bank important role play regard crisis prevention crisis resolution. i welcome progress make area:

40/2003 1 j(cid:252)rgen stark: emu - recent development open address dr j(cid:252)rgen stark, vice president deutsche bundesbank, cepr/esi conference (cid:147)the euro area economic entity(cid:148), host deutsche bundesbank eltville, 12 september 2003. * * * i please welcome bundesbank(cid:146)s train centre occasion seventh cepr/esi conference. it important academic meet central bank staff. on one hand, meet help convey new idea monetary policymakers. on hand, idea also scrutinise practice-oriented economists. such meet also serve mutual understand one another help clear misunderstandings. i consider meet especially valuable academic increasingly confront practical question day-to-day policy making. in turn, central banker closely watch allow fall behind curve academic thinking. only year ago, title conference would question mark end. this long necessary. the euro area, high possible degree monetary policy integration, indeed economic entity, obviously political entity. the political regime consist centralise monetary policy decentralised, coordinated, economic budgetary policies. this institutional set challenging. it unique appropriate concept tailor european needs. we know, euro area become economic entity overnight. this fascinate development root much broad process initiate europe almost half century ago. the convergence take place run-up monetary union beyond impressive. however, process european integration far complete still evolving. let turn recent developments. naturally, conference touch upon crucial issue arise first five year third stage european monetary union (emu). in order stimulate discussion, allow make comment vantage point someone involve practical sphere monetary union: i comment: (cid:1)(cid:2)firstly way perception monetary policy within euro area evolved; (cid:1)(cid:2)secondly converge diverge growth inflation rates; (cid:1)(cid:2)finally learn regard policy coordination stability growth pact. 1. monetary policy in past rather critical statement make academic belong centre economic policy research regard monitor ecb. at time one actually impression ecb come much bad central banks. these criticism range individual measure take ecb - refrain take - question communication strategy. concerns, example, voice role monetary growth ecb(cid:146)s strategy. there also many call precise definition term price stability. another favourite pastime seem hunt dismantle last unpopular stability growth pact. since review strategy year, ecb make effort clarify misunderstand emerge communication public. it make clear regard price stability, ecb strive maintain medium-term inflation rate close 2%. furthermore, stress money evaluate respect long-term relationship monetary growth price dynamics. the (cid:147)monetary analysis(cid:148) complement (cid:147)economic analysis(cid:148), relevant short medium term. 2 bi review 40/2003 i impression that, general, clarification well received. i hope conference today tomorrow help shed light important issue within euro area well. 2. business cycle inflation differential the introduction euro link expectation business cycle member state would converge closely. furthermore, decouple u business cycle expect since euro area marginally high degree openness unite states. the diversion growth rate among member state decline recently. unfortunately represent convergence towards germany(cid:146)s stagnate growth figure - towards fast expand euro area countries, would actually desirable. contrary expectation outset monetary union, business cycle euro area u seem still closely correlated. economic globalisation increase international linkage various channel trade, foreign direct investment flows, globalise financial market interlink business expectations. but significant point shock confidence burst high-tech equity bubble terrorist attack hit capital market similar extent world. a lack convergence reveal sustain differential inflation among euro area(cid:146)s member states. it true differential fairly small comparison first half 1990s. however, follow substantial convergence run-up emu, inflation differential widen again. divergent economic development apparent currency areas, too, usa, without monetary policymakers able address issue. monetary policy gear towards data currency area whole. it cannot address regional policy problems. otmar issing coin quite succinctly - (cid:147)one size must fit all!(cid:148) the member state accept fact join third stage european economic monetary union. if persistent diverge trend emerge, either accepted, or, detrimental economic consequence result, measure need take national level. however, interest rate differential also reflect adjustment real exchange rate. but i want elaborate much inflation differentials. this issue cover depth tomorrow(cid:146)s policy lecture colleague, hermann remsperger. 3. policy coordination stability growth pact the asymmetry political responsibility emu make comprehensive system coordination procedure indispensable. i believe undisputed. the rationale arise need take account spill-over effect national economic policies. consequently, ec-treaty oblige member state consider national economic policy (cid:147)as matter common concern(cid:148) subject multilateral procedures. of coordination mechanisms, name recognition high stability growth pact. the pact may popular places, least well known, albeit well understand everywhere. i late try illustrate i remain ardent advocate pact. however, core coordination instrument broad economic policy guideline (bepg). they contain principal policy objective measures. they build overarch structure specialise coordination consultation procedures. the guideline make specific recommendation member state community endorse head state government. however, politically legally bind really effective instrument enforce implementation. due medium long-term nature many recommendations, measure progress concern implementation become main focus commission(cid:146)s work. bi review 40/2003 3 the specific coordination process are: (cid:1)(cid:2)the luxembourg process (1997), aim create employment. it consist employment guideline implement (cid:147)national action plans(cid:148) employment monitor commission. (cid:1)(cid:2)the cardiff process (1998), intend enhance structural reform member state multilateral monitor create (cid:147)peer pressure(cid:148) among them. (cid:1)(cid:2)the cologne process (1999), establish (cid:147)macroeconomic dialogue(cid:148) community level representative governments, ecb trade union involved. this dialogue aim achieve ex-ante coordination economic policies, exchange information view economic developments. these process enhance 2000 (cid:147)lisbon-strategy(cid:148) (cid:147)new strategic goal(cid:148) next decade, (cid:147)to become competitive dynamic knowledge-based economy world, capable sustainable economic growth good job great social cohesion(cid:148). a important conclusion lisbon coordination process need exist process simplified. it also reasonable bepgs focus increasingly structural policies. that vantage point coordination process accomplish better-then-expected result future. up now, difficult detect noticeable impact various coordination process convergence among member states. within framework luxembourg process, government meet commitment enhance employment. unemployment increase significantly low 1997. in keep wage autonomy, government simply cannot impose guideline regulate negotiation management trade unions. up now, cardiff process lead limit progress, all, structural reform large economies. the cologne process seem unnecessary me. in judgement, process little bureaucratic exercises. what reasons? (cid:1)(cid:2)after convergence effort run third stage emu: adjustment fatigue; (cid:1)(cid:2)the willingness progress integration lose steam; (cid:1)(cid:2)political behaviour adapt new environment. the integration europe link readiness curb national sovereignty. the last success euro cannot achieve solely monetary policy. the success rely well support fiscal, labour structural policy member states. however, coordination understand substitute responsibility policymakers national level. the decentralise approach offer scope healthy policy competition. (cid:147)best practice(cid:148) prevail. furthermore, political-economy viewpoint, coordination extremely helpful instrument implement unpopular necessary policy measure national level. the stability growth pact part foundation economic monetary union. but government act bore overall responsibility political project european integration. the ongoing debate call (cid:147)reform(cid:148) relax term pact already damage foundation jeopardise function monetary union medium term. however, fact, great achievement adopt self-imposed budgetary rule order support monetary policy prevent repetition problem 1970s. furthermore, stability growth pact deal challenge age populations. a critical assessment made, i feel, concern initiative - already implement - aim refine rule pact. a result, rules, originally straightforward transparent, become increasingly complex opaque. even so, debate continue road. the proposal contain sapir report june 2003, would allow overshoot 3% criterion (cid:147)severe recessions(cid:148), also give almost decline economic performance, would dilute stability growth pact point fiscal policy rule long recognisable. i agree otmar issing: real problem suppose lack flexibility pact, failure large economy euro area make use growth phase towards sound sustainable fiscal positions, like others did. the current difficulty therefore tempt 4 bi review 40/2003 politician relax rule stability growth pact apply rule strictly. the pact is, all, end itself. it interest member state people. the consolidation public finance indispensable, least view expect strain burden future generation demographic changes. the stability growth pact see part comprehensive strategy avoid pro-cyclical behaviour, create sufficient budgetary safety margin attain sustainable public finance. i know difficult achieve, i would much welcome support convince public politician principle procedure budgetary policy treaty stability growth pact vital success economic monetary union. i believe i common grind state theoretical perspective, impact fiscal policy economy rather uncertain. empirical evidence generally point positive low impact expansionary policy output. therefore, power fiscal policy reduce cyclical volatility stimulate economy overestimated. discretionary fiscal measure prove ill-suited fine-tune economy past. due time-lags often lead pro-cyclical impact economy. moreover, asymmetric behaviour recession boom contribute deteriorate public finance last decades. instead, structural reform direct improve price wage flexibility mobility labour could strengthen channel stabilisation. to sum up, ensure sound fiscal position emphasise role automatic fiscal stabiliser dampen cyclical fluctuations, ec-treaty stability growth pact form adequate framework fiscal policy monetary union. the pact curse blessing. and personal note, i would like add constitute principle democracy rule law. it mean government action bind rule fix announce beforehand. the rule law lay primacy law policy. government uphold principle offend fundamental modern society risk substantial loss confidence. this hold true argentina(cid:146)s arrears imf attempt eu-countries comply spirit letter ec-treaty stability growth pact. the latter especially disturbing, rule law modern society seem french invention. it base principle separation power formulate early 1748 great french political philosopher, montesquieu. moreover, french people first realise concept continental europe. a government breach law lead slippery slope escape extremely difficult find. i would also like draw attention paper hermann remsperger i write importance budgetary rule criticism stability growth pact. up german version english translation already preparation available day website. my experience tell central banker academic alike will listen learn. the ability willingness comprehend decisive success conference. my important task today award cepr/esi prize best central

renew acquaintance board trade. i(cid:146)m go spend time today discuss bank canada(cid:146)s outlook canadian economy inflation, responding. but order understand current economic situation, need look extraordinary event past year event affect economy. my last public speech almost exactly year ago. you recall that, time, market still turmoil wake enron, worldcom, corporate governance account scandal late 2001 early 2002. in unite state canada - well many country - corporations, regulators, government begin respond measure aim restore maintain investor confidence. then come 2003 - could well name (cid:147)the year shocks.(cid:148) there war iraq, still play out. the worldwide outbreak severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) blow canada asia. the human toll sars toronto accompany severe drop canada(cid:146)s tourism travel industry. we also isolate case mad-cow disease block export beef cattle. many export restriction remain. and forest fire british columbia cause extensive financial emotional pain. meanwhile, softwood lumber dispute unite state resolved. and recently, ontario suffer north america(cid:146)s biggest-ever power outage. however, good news canadian consumer business remarkably resilient past year two face shocks. but kind shock significant impact consumer business confidence, especially happen quick succession. today, i want talk role confidence play economy measure take strengthen it. trust confidence essential market operate efficiently, business finance good time bad. and canadian need maintain confidence macroeconomic framework reap benefit smoothly function economy. the role confidence monetary policy at bank canada, spend lot time think confidence, important conduct monetary policy, focus inflation targeting. we aim keep trend inflation 2 per cent target midpoint 1 3 per cent range. when trend stray away midpoint, either upwards downwards, take action return 2 per cent medium term. we adjust target overnight interest rate. over past decade so, successfully keep inflation around 2 per cent, average. here(cid:146)s confidence factor enter equation: canadian expect inflation stay near target - near term, future. they believe value earn save won(cid:146)t erode inflation real burden debt won(cid:146)t increase deflation. that confidence pay real dividend term monetary policy effectiveness. inflation target work best canadian believe work - words, confidence keep inflation near 2 per cent target. with confidence, inflation inflation expectations, well interest rates, become stable - benefit whole economy. how achieve confidence dividend? by establish track record credible, consistent monetary policy, together great accountability transparency. like many major central banks, embrace notion monetary policy effective people 2 bi review 40/2003 understand central bank why. that motivation behind semi-annual monetary policy report updates, eight interest rate announcement every year, many public appearance speeches. of course, monetary policy function isolation. it work best complement fiscal policy aim avoid deficit lighten government debt burdens. reducing, ultimately eliminating, federal deficit 1990s help canada(cid:146)s international credibility, low risk premium demand investors, give canada flexibility adjust change economic circumstances. and continue fiscal prudence give u flexibility weather recent economic turmoil rather well. canadian see benefit low, stable, predictable inflation, balance budgets. and expect central bank government continue deliver benefit responsible monetary policy prudent fiscal management. confidence market so, good monetary fiscal policy deliver confidence dividend. but, course, trust transparency crucial factor across economy financial system. we know business last long squander confidence customers, suppliers, investors. the corporate finance account scandal 2001 2002 hurt profit portfolio gains. they also sideswipe confidence financial market participants. the problem bring enron, worldcom, others limit companies. in fact, international task force appoint international federation accountant - chair john crow, former bank canada governor - correctly note enron event which, sheer size, awake many issue significant time. what(cid:146)s encourage awaken happen quickly considerable effort make address issue reinforce trust financial system. the sarbanes-oxley act unite states, example, aim restore trust corporate financial reporting. other international effort underway improve report monitor public companies. in canada, federal provincial government work private sector review improve framework govern public company capital markets. these initiative summarize document entitle foster investor confidence canadian capital markets, find department finance(cid:146)s web site. effort focus four areas: (cid:1)(cid:2)improving financial report disclosure; (cid:1)(cid:2)enhancing quality audit process; (cid:1)(cid:2)strengthening corporate governance management accountability; (cid:1)(cid:2)toughening enforcement. all effort aim build confidence need allow market protect interest investor creditor operate efficiently business finance operation low cost. step foster confidence let(cid:146)s look first what(cid:146)s do date improve financial report disclosure. our system, already work quite well canadians, strengthened. the propose new change aim build confidence keep compliance cost relatively low. new guideline continuous disclosure obligation public company draft canadian security administrators. the goal implement january 2004. there also new guideline canadian institute charter accountant (cica) stock options, financial guarantees, off-balance-sheet arrangements. and

make canada companies, regulators, government build investor confidence financial markets. of course, effort also promote good corporate decision-making, great efficiency, strong corporations. that it(cid:146)s interest u make progress. what bear mind continue make improvements? first, must lull think problem behind us. unless remain vigilant rigorous efforts, risk squander good work do far. second, must apply principle companies, must apply way impose undue compliance costs, especially small businesses. third, standard don(cid:146)t identical countries, must see effective. canadian u.s.

method corporate finance improve allocation capital. this type framework best support provide efficient operation continue growth financial markets. but won(cid:146)t whole job. a sound legal regulatory framework must combine strong widespread ethical standards. ceo corporate officer must take upon communicate investor clearly, openly, fairly. investors, part, responsibility take account available information. and regulators, politicians, public servant must perform function way reinforce trust. we benefit everyone play rules. only reaffirm integrity individuals, corporations, public institution restore maintain confidence dividend. indeed, i say outset, resiliency canadian consumers, investors, business help u weather recent economic shocks. confidence critical strengthen economy month ahead sustain expansion medium term. so let briefly discus bank(cid:146)s view economy inflation. the current economic situation since monetary policy report update july, inflation pressure canada continue ease. part recent decline inflation come increase amount slack economy. the pace growth second quarter year interrupt number near-term factors, especially sars trade restriction canadian export cattle beef isolate case bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse). growth third quarter also likely remain economy(cid:146)s potential remain trade restriction beef cattle, well effect power blackout ontario forest fire western canada. the price service temporarily depress sars. in addition, greater-than-anticipated reduction price number goods, motor vehicles, clothing, household furniture appliances. we expect core rate inflation - strip eight volatile component consumer price index, well effect change indirect tax remain component - decline 2 per cent target. in fact, happen early bank anticipated. our core inflation measure likely decline somewhat next months. and see trend inflation remain 2 per cent target time. a i(cid:146)ve said, part low trend inflation result slack economy open 2003. in addition, price many trade good fall worldwide excess supply. the rise canadian dollar early year pull price import goods, retailer pass save consumers. a well, vendor low

notwithstanding temporary factor affect economy second third quarter year, see indication condition place strong economic growth. here(cid:146)s why. growth final domestic demand remain robust, adverse effect shock i mention begin dissipate. the economic rebound unite state begin earlier, stronger, previously expected. more robust consumer demand strengthen business investment unite state augur well canadian exports. we also see strengthen trend asia. a well, tone capital market remain favourable. so, despite current weakness, accumulation economic evidence date reinforce

survey. yet, mauritius categorise last group. worse, mauritius never give hear categorisation last group. in spite statement good intention make press release, damage already inflict image mauritius financial service centre. voice approach raise various international meet governor central banks. subsequently, imf urge and, rightly so, financial stability forum take lead role assessment jurisdictions(cid:146) adherence international standards. the imf hold consultative meet hear view outside expert onshore offshore centre international agencies. this initiative formally fully back mauritius. the world bank join imf. the assessment mauritius joint imf/world bank mission fair just. the fsap mission give authority mauritius fair hearing. the assessment thorough carry manner help u strengthen soundness safety financial sector. a careful read recommendation make report allow u spotlight certain area really vulnerable risks. with financial system like fully integrate world(cid:146)s financial system cannot afford take lightly vulnerability highlight therein. despite certain disagreement fsap mission(cid:146)s views, i must say quality recommendation much appreciated. i seize opportunity commend fsap team, particular mr abdessatar ouanes mr ann rennie, give well-balanced assessment financial sector. the report merely refer weakness vulnerability financial sector. it also underline strength financial sector progress make recent year regard supervisory framework. i particularly please note, among find fsap mission, following: 1. overall, mauritian financial sector currently good health, short-term stability risk modest. 2. mauritius relatively large well-developed domestic financial system grow offshore sector. 3. the authority embark ambitious program transform economy, government, partnership private sector, take decisive measure build knowledge economy base high value-added services, notably information communication

mauritius enforce guideline improve development knowledge skill within supervision department. we expect that, basis fsap report, financial stability forum issue another press release announce removal mauritius third category. our commitment proceed various recommendation already evidence action already take authority mauritius. we thankful imf world bank prompt response give request technical

recommendation expression view regard need do immediate future. but need constantly review supervisory legal framework light change take place domestic economy dynamic international financial system well. we panoply rules, guideline law proper conduct bank business mauritius. a regulator supervisor need exercise discretion fail purpose rules, guideline law could defeated. let share brief paragraph sammuel brittan(cid:146)s economics ethics: (cid:147)most real-world situation complicate simple prisoner(cid:146)s dilemma, possibility choose inappropriate strategy real one. bi review

bernanke, member board governor u federal reserve system, bloomberg panel outlook u.s. economy, new york, 4 september 2003. the reference speech find board governor federal reserve system(cid:146)s website. * * * i please opportunity participate bloomberg panel outlook u.s. economy. when i boy south carolina, parent always advise never discus religion politics public, subject everyone strong opinion one ever prove wrong. i always follow advice particular topics, i afraid economic forecast may bad counts. everyone strong view economy heading, time finally come compare forecast data, world change eleven unpredictable way one blame fail foresee - is, remember forecast first place. unfortunately, help make monetary policy part current job, i cannot avoid form opinion outlook u.s. world economies. today i give impression seem likely unfold next year eighteen months, well i see important risk forecast. i talk first output growth unemployment, inflation, i conclude discuss implication monetary policy. both prepare remark comment i may make discussion late clearly understand reflect view colleague federal open market committee (fomc) board governor federal reserve system. the forecast 2004: growth unemployment to provide context talk, i consult prognostication (in august releases) prominent private - sector forecaster survey forecasters, namely global insight (formerly dri-wefa), blue chip survey, macroeconomic advisers, survey professional forecaster (see table 1). a see, i agree several aspect well-regarded forecast (perhaps peril) disagree with, least reservation about, others. begin real side economy, see table 1 substantial agreement among private-sector forecaster prospect real gdp growth unemployment rate end 2004. all forecaster expect output growth second half year strong, general range 3.7 4.2 percent. despite projection high growth rates, private forecaster expect unemployment rate remain current rate 6.2 percent end year. the private-sector forecaster also see strong economic growth continuing, although generally accelerating, 2004. measure growth 2004:q4 2003:q4, global insight forecast 4.1 percent growth real gdp 2004, blue chip call 3.7 percent growth, macroeconomic adviser see 4.0 percent growth, survey professional forecaster look 3.8 percent growth. notably, accord professionals, even performance expect decrease unemployment rate much. only macroeconomic adviser see unemployment fourth quarter 2004 fall low 5.4 percent; rest foresee unemployment rate remain 5.8 5.9 percent last quarter next year. these projection path growth unemployment broadly consistent forecast make member fomc prior june 24-25 meet release shortly thereafter part federal reserve’s semiannual monetary policy report congress. the fomc members’ forecast real gdp 2003 growth entire year; break quarter. however, give information first half available time committee’s forecast made, central-tendency fomc forecast real gdp growth year whole almost certainly imply noticeable pickup pace expansion second half 2003. for 2004, central-tendency fomc projection real gdp growth end june cover range 3-3/4 percent 4-3/4 percent, forecast optimistic even current private-sector forecast growth next year suggestive acceleration real activity second half 2003 2004. 2 bi review 39/2003 the central tendency fomc forecast unemployment rate, end past june, call rate fall 6 6-1/4 percent fourth quarter year decline 5-1/2 6 percent fourth quarter 2004. again, value broadly consistent recent private-sector forecasts. in particular, private-sector forecaster fomc member evidently agree strong gdp growth gradually erode accumulate slack job market. simple arithmetic tell u forecaster expect much project increase output meet ongoing increase labor productivity, rather substantial new hiring. this point crucial one, i return late discuss inflation projections. i tip hand point say i personally find real growth unemployment forecast describe broadly reasonable, though important risks. in particular, i view quite acceleration growth 4 percent good 2004 plausible; i agree also decline unemployment rate, though steady, likely slow. why i believe grind optimism economic growth, even caution warrant regard unemployment? the consumer play central role always, recent news retail sale (including automobile sales) house start sales, among data, suggest household spend continue hold well, throughout past three years. tax cuts, sign stabilization job market, rise stock price among factor keep consumer game recovery proceeds. what make situation today feel particularly encouraging, however, may finally see sign revival business investment. because i see strength sustainability revival key forecast, i would like discus bite detail. in speech i give forecasters’ club last april (bernanke, 2003a), entitle (cid:147)will business investment bounce back?,(cid:148) i point recession begin march 2001 distinctive one business-led-as oppose household-led-recessions post-world war ii period. in particular, sharp decline business investment spend begin second half 2000 proximate cause recession. by token, i argue early speech - make point many others make well - balance recovery would impossible without sustain revival capital expenditures. my early speech survey prospect various type investment spend emphasize importance strength investment recovery ceos’ view prospective return capital expenditure future economy - animal spirits, will. with little four additional months’ worth data, say today recovery investment spending? a i note april, best prospect investment rebound corporate sector lie equipment software sector, particularly high-tech equipment. over summer see indication least moderate pickup sector. notably, accord preliminary gdp estimates, real investment equipment software rise annual rate 8 percent second quarter. real expenditure high-tech equipment advance 34 percent (at annual rate) second quarter, significant step first quarter, real spend software rise 9 percent rate. perhaps manager finally decide can’t put it upgrade longer. even spend communication equipment strong second quarter. investment non-high-tech equipment, include transportation general machinery, also improved. in recent months, indicator order data index base survey managers’ plan capital expenditure strengthened, balance, suggest investment equipment software likely continue rise near term. by contrast, i note early speech others observed, investment nonresidential structure promise source growth. the strength category second quarter due importantly increase spend drill mine sector, tie primarily high natural gas prices. the outlook buildings, particularly office industrial buildings, remain weak, high vacancy rate low utilization rate persist. however, good worse, investment nonresidential structure become small part aggregate spend average recovery sector make-or-break factor overall economy. look beyond near term, i see grind optimism revival business investment persist, lay foundation continue rapid expansion 2004. first, strong growth demand already train provide incentive corporate manager expand productive capacity, particularly give effort already make reduce cost bi review 39/2003 3 increase efficiency production within exist plants. in regard, i think worth point firm meet demand recently get great productivity exist capital labor resource also run inventory stock relative sales. if past guide, may soon see quarter two inventory build provide powerful boost growth rate output. second, financial condition remain favorable business investment. profit rise smartly, corporation considerably improve balance sheets. although corporate bond rate rise past months, remain low historical standards, spread continue come down. bank well capitalized, profitable, eager lend business borrowers. in short, internal fund external finance investment available. third, tax provision pass 2001 2003 low effective cost invest new equipment. finally, best tell, expectation attitude business community - reflect surveys, information business contacts, analysts’ expectation long-term earn growth, like - brighten somewhat. when factor take together, seem reasonable bet revival capital expenditure continue strengthen sufficiently support optimistic growth forecast i discuss earlier. a prospective investment revival central optimistic growth forecast, however, also locus critical risk forecast. for time now, ceo display great reluctance invest hire standard econometric model predict. commentator give negative residual many names: workout post-bubble excesses, geopolitical uncertainty, reaction account scandal 2002, self-fulfilling pessimism. personally, i admit i don’t fully understand source conservative behavior part company management, reason, i cannot entirely confident caution continue predominate executive suite. a weak investment trajectory reflect continue ceo caution would probably derail current recovery, would certainly put more-optimistic growth projection 2004 reach would substantially slow absorption unemployed resources. i mention trade sector. net export drag u.s. growth; indeed, second quarter, net export deduct (in arithmetic sense) hefty 1-1/2 percentage point u.s. real gdp growth. my sense optimistic growth forecast unite state next year rely anything modest increase growth rest world. of course, extent unanticipated strength abroad materialize raise demand u.s. exports, outlook improve further. finally, word long-term interest rates, know rising. at current levels, bond yield pose major risk continue strength house recovery corporate investment, view, though may well end boom mortgage refinance activity. since consumer gain refinance mostly already do so, slowdown refinance unlikely significant effect household spending. the forecast 2004: inflation i turn forecast real activity outlook inflation. a before, i compare various publish projection talk risk forecast. inflation quite low, course, private-sector forecaster expect inflation remain low rest year next. a table 1 shows, forecast cpi inflation second half 2003 (the average third- fourth-quarter inflation forecasts, annual rate) global insight, blue chip, macroeconomic advisers, survey professional forecaster tightly cluster range approximately 1-1/4 percent 1-1/2 percent. (i comment forecast inflation measure gdp price index, also show table 1, say, see yourselves, also quite low.) the four source report cpi inflation forecast 2004, fourth quarter fourth quarter, 1-1/4 2 percent. for monetary policy purposes, one often interest measure underlie inflation. one measure so-called core cpi inflation, define rate change consumer price index exclude food energy prices, tend relatively volatile. i able find core cpi inflation forecast macroeconomic advisers. macroeconomic adviser expect core cpi inflation 2004 1.5 percent, compare expectation 1.3 percent overall cpi inflation. if macroeconomic adviser representative, distinction core overall cpi inflation first-order importance next year’s inflation forecast. a best i tell, 4 bi review 39/2003 roughly true inflation forecast second half 2003, though 2003 whole (the third column table) sharp increase energy price first quarter year. for comparison private-sector forecasts, fomc’s central-tendency forecast end june inflation 2004 range 1 1-1/2 percent, measure personal consumption expenditure (pce) chain-type price index. because difference construction index cpi, upward adjustment 0.2 0.4 percentage point probably necessary make pce inflation comparable cpi inflation. hence fomc central-tendency forecast inflation 2004 also broadly consistent private-sector estimates. one try ass validity forecast two ways. for short run, couple quarters, look detail component price indexes, try isolate trend special factors, useful. for long run, substitute think hard underlie economic factor influence inflation. consideration detail price index suggest rather mark deceleration recently saw core inflation measure come halt now, indeed, core inflation may tick tenth remainder 2003. the reason largely technical. probably important factor, quantitatively speaking, way bureau labor statistic (bls) calculate owners’ equivalent rent (oer), estimate cost live one’s home. data market rental rate home apartment important input calculation oer. because rental lease often include landlord-provided utilities, bls subtract estimate cost utility market quote gross rent obtain estimate rent net utilities. however, extent that, short run, landlord fully pas change utility cost renters, bls adjustment over-correction. in particular, period energy price hence utility cost rising, first half 2003, bls procedure may overstate deceleration rent net utility hence owners’ equivalent rent. a result, particular count, slowdown cpi inflation may slightly overstate first half 2003. if so, stabilization residential energy cost second half 2003 unwind effect likely add bite measure inflation go forward. another example special factor affect measure inflation arise fiscal problem state local governments: to cover rise budget deficits, number public university system announce large tuition price hike upcoming academic year. these tuition hike naturally affect measure cost living. a one-time event fiscal monetary nature, however, i consider particularly important monetary policy point view. a similar effect see increase july cpi number, partly attributable rise tobacco excise tax impose number states. other example arise lag data collection: for example, telephone rate incorporate cpi lag, rate increase occur early year reflect index month yet. i alert special case illustrate federal reserve react month-to-month change inflation data, series matter. for assess inflation forecast long run, case year 2004, one turn underlie economics. i disagree general tenor private-sector forecast fomc projections. it seem plausible combination strengthen recovery, well-anchored inflation expectations, monetary authority strongly commit stabilize inflation serve keep inflation project range. however, view, likely outcome low part range, i believe risk remain downside. the reason ongoing productivity growth, together stepped-up capital investment, may enable producer meet expand demand without substantially increase hire near term, result labor market remain soft. indeed, i noted, several private-sector forecaster project unemployment rate still near 6 percent fourth quarter 2004, despite real growth approach 4 percent second half 2003 2004. by standard textbook calculation (bernanke, 2003b), amount slack lead additional disinflation tenth percentage point end 2004. so reckoning, inflation 2004 might well bite low second half 2003, high majority private-sector forecaster projected. of course, real growth disappoint -

finance world growth speech dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, 2003 spruce meadow round table, calgary, 5 september 2003. * * * it great pleasure part round table discussion today i would like thank organiser invite share think topic finance world growth. since 2000, witness terrorism, war decline world equity markets, contribute increase already ongoing deterioration confidence countries. now end major hostility iraq, reduction geopolitical uncertainty low oil prices, gradual upturn world economic activity expect important policy-makers support it. give breadth topic therefore strong temptation overrun time allocation, i focus two points. first, i would like say general word role and, may i add, limitation monetary fiscal policy revive global demand, importance microeconomic policy respect, particular role structural reform increase potential growth. second, help regional-specific examples, i would like present future challenge respect microeconomic policy structural reform world. monetary fiscal policy, structural reform the achievement maintenance strong growth imply perspective extend beyond shorter-term cyclical developments. indeed, medium term, economic growth tend negatively affect considerable cost associate inflation, prospect stable price therefore key factor growth. by strictly gear towards maintain price stability credible last manner, monetary policy make important contribution achieve high level output employment, sustain growth. confidence last price stability remove inflation risk premium interest rates, ensure low real interest rates, turn foster investment, growth employment. theoretical empirical evidence clearly confirm long-term trade price stability economic growth. try use monetary policy fine-tune economic activity gear sustainable level will, long run, simply lead rise inflation - fast economic growth. fiscal policy also play key role contribute macroeconomic stability. stable, sustainable efficient fiscal policy exert favourable effect long-term growth performance. they stimulate savings, capital formation, employment innovation. and facilitate task monetary policy-maker maintain price stability. sound public finance rely automatic stabilisers, rather discretionary fine-tuning, dampen cyclical fluctuation aggregate demand. theory suggest delay risk associate latter - get time wrong may result pro-cyclical police make monetary policy orientate towards price stability difficult. in medium term, fiscal policy best contribute sustain non-inflationary growth press ahead fiscal consolidation. ultimately, economic cycles, growth reflect condition supply side economy. it therefore microeconomic, macroeconomic, policy promote supply labour capital efficient allocation, innovation diffusion new technologies, result, mitigate problem structural unemployment. structural reform labour good market key element long-term strategy improve investment, growth employment prospects. first, flexible market increase speed country adapt economic shocks, thereby speed economic recovery. second, increase competition labour product market conducive high level innovation rapid spread technological progress. this turn support long-term growth, without contribute inflationary tendencies. third, structural reform may facilitate transmission monetary policy. in rigid economies, interest rate change transmit price long delay, structural barrier prevent economic efficiency gain primary objective monetary policy - price stability - fully realised. 2 bi review 39/2003 it important mention close interplay rigidity capital, labour product markets, strengthen one another. these interdependency mean structural reform one market impact function others. it must emphasise therefore comprehensive reform programme create necessary condition strong economic dynamism. the need structural reform tend become urgent evident policy-makers economic downturns. but don’t forget structural reform provide short-term solution economic problems. although positive short-term confidence effects, normally take time benefit unfold. hence i cannot emphasise enough need speed pace structural reform capital, labour product markets. structural reform various region world let turn issue future challenge respect microeconomic policy structural reform particular economic areas. i shall start structural reform euro area, move say word structural reform eu neighbour regions, unite states, latin america and, finally, east asia. euro area economic activity euro area remain subdue first half 2003. however, increase reason expect recover gradually second half 2003 strengthen 2004. although outlook price stability favourable, allow interest rate fall historically low levels, monetary policy cannot generate last sustainable growth employment euro area. part weakness economic growth euro area may link lack ambition recent year fiscal structural reform improve condition investment employment euro area. the euro area need structural reform increase flexibility labour, financial product market effectively increase potential output growth, job creation investment. although extent implementation labour market reform uneven across countries, effort make 1990s result positive progress two areas: first, foster employment growth across sectors, rise 1.5% per year average 1997 2001, second, help groups, women, young old least educated, enter labour market. labour market reform focus reduce high structural unemployment increase participation employment rates. indeed, important that, alongside social considerations, country euro area give weight economic efficiency within labour markets. capital market reform also play major role make euro area economy flexible. much achieved, least due introduction euro, bulk financial service action plan implemented. however, integration national capital market towards truly european financial market would important step towards safeguard market country-specific shocks. finally, great effort must make remove exist barrier product markets. since early 1990s state enterprise undergo extensive privatisation, use state aid fall market entry barrier lowered, although evenly across country sectors. in addition, still significant barrier removal price pressures, need phase out. eu neighbour region the ten country join european union make considerable economic progress recent year term macroeconomic stabilisation structural reforms. a group individually, country achieve significant sustain improvement economic fundamentals. in regard, perspective eu accession important anchor policies. however, process catching-up real income significantly slow expect start transition, today, prepare join eu, still significant gdp per caput gap current member states. improve growth performance accede bi review 39/2003 3 country remain issue vital importance. while eu membership lag effect early reform foster catching-up process, sustain policy action need improve growth environment accede countries. reform should, particular, conducive capital accumulation bring tangible increase total factor productivity. in eu neighbour regions, effort structural reform vary considerably. follow severe financial crisis 2001, turkey witness strong rebound 2002 begin ambitious process reduce inflation, still struggle long-standing problems. this achievement support structural -

central bank conduct monetary policy emerge market economy differ face colleague develop countries. be evident differences, example economic social structure, pace change exposure shift global

effect vanguard (mainly) develop country early-1990s, deliver similar beneficial result large phalanx emerge market economy follow suit late-1990s? the purpose contribution add burgeon theoretical literature, offer observation practical experience worlds. that experience need disclaimer outset. thirty year wrestle british monetary policy bank england certainly entitle one claim extend track record success, though last ten year go lot good previous 20. equally, six month (so far) contribute conduct monetary policy south africa far narrow span allow one claim first hand expertise distinctive circumstance emerge market economies. but privilege serve successively monetary policy committee two different country give relatively central banker fascinate try ass whether monetary policy really different africa. what strike one initially, move develop emerge market economy, remarkable similarity monetary policy process. this, reflection, perhaps ought surprising, give effort international community invest recent year promulgate standard international good practice conduct macro-economic policy. in term structure policy framework, one obvious common feature critical importance government establish discipline coherent framework fiscal monetary policy work mutual support, weakness public finance undermine monetary discipline commitment low inflation see embed key feature government’s overall economic strategy. another common feature need central bank able act independently pursue low inflation, technical expertise professional competence job command public confidence. yet another common feature need country reasonably develop competently-regulated financial system. in respect south africa score highly, indeed international scrutiny visit imf/world bank mission confirmed. in process, too, procedure monetary policy conduct remarkably similar. there differences, essentially one form, rather substance. thus, inflation-targeting countries, inflation target set key government economic objective. a structure monetary policy committee central bank meet regular, pre-announced interval take consider decision interest rates, enable policy-makers step aside day job 36 hour concentrate communal review monetary outlook. the emphasis, elsewhere, forward-looking assessment, weigh uncertainty risk unknown future. also, elsewhere, process surround lively public debate monetary action taken, market commentator show commendable lack reticence argue views. key value contribution add high degree transparency process. in south africa, elsewhere, communication explanation key element monetary policy achieve behavioural effects, also critical feature process central bank is, quite properly, hold accountable actions. 2 bi review 38/2003 all elements, then, look feel remarkably similar central banker migrate advance develop country emerge market economy. what is, course, fundamentally different economic, social cultural environment policy process operated. this difference environment could simply regard feature raise level uncertainty face policy-makers go economy - difference degree, make challenge different kind fundamental way. a high level uncertainty fact matter lot itself, make policy-makers le confident judgement incline wait see. but grind argue distinctly different environment emerge market economy go implication way monetary policy operated. four possible effect identified. first, undergo significant structural change, many emerge market economy may vulnerable shock fully-developed economies. of course, economy experience shocks, frequency scale may great emerge market economies. these shock origin domestic economy (a poor crop) arrive unexpectedly overseas (higher oil prices). either way, difficult enough handle impact demand side, often emerge market central banker grapple sharp movement cost pressure supply side. the orthodox response shift supply condition accept first-round effect price concentrate monetary action head second-round impact otherwise generate inflationary cycle. this may conceptually clear, practice hideously difficult distinction translate monetary decisions. it good discipline circumstance remind oneself regularly high interest rate help make maize crop grow higher. south africa’s experience 2001-02 good case point. a precipitate largely inexplicable fall exchange rate latter part 2001 combine high fuel cost increase domestic food price deliver severe inflationary shock. the central bank’s response, raise interest rate progressive step 2002, exemplary appear work well, inflation fall steadily back towards target range shock recedes. but consequence make central bank’s task embed low inflation fabric economy much challenging, inevitable question experience raise whether, face shocks, monetary policy really could achieve permanently low inflation. that can, so, gain wide acceptance, reflect continue evidence fall inflationary expectations. but required, alongside carefully-timed monetary tightening, strong effort central bank communicate determination. the prevalence supply-side shock would thus seem one area emerge market economy may face particular challenge operate monetary policy. another may arise impact exchange rate. movement exchange rate may relatively large impact emerge market economies, currency may expose underlie volatility. certainly, recent experience south africa suggest recovery rand past year important factor contain inflation. in part recovery reflect general weaken dollar, factor high commodity price also influence. but currency’s recovery also important channel monetary tighten work way economy. if relationship interest rate exchange rate movement predictable, effectiveness exchange rate transmission channel would helpful monetary policy. but practice relationship remain rather inscrutable. moreover, fact emerge market currency subject volatility result shift unconnected country itself, recent substantial adjustment dollar euro, mean movement exchange rate impact domestic monetary condition large effect impossible anticipate. of course, always argue circumstance central bank try moderate movement exchange rate great le degree. but instrument available, example capital control official intervention, maintain period, encourage track record may counter-productive side-effects impede desirable structural adjustment actually increase exchange rate volatility. the appropriate remedy stick fundamentals, focus monetary action determinedly low inflation take account impact exchange rate one bi review 38/2003 3 amongst range relevant influences. but need recognise impact may particularly significant emerge market economies. a distinctive feature straightforward, easily overlook - policy-makers emerge market economy tend le information available development economy. this essentially form resource constraint. it apply statistics, relevant series may available le frequently, le comprehensive disaggregated form, simply le reliable. in south africa, origin relatively minor distortion compilation cpi produce downward revision, discovered, nearly 2 percentage point 12-month rate inflation. this least merit rare example good news shock. such event unique emerge market economies: uk others experience problem important statistical series time time. but divert scarce resource statistical compilation inevitably problem economy relevant skill often key constraint economic development whole. the applies, too, generally knowledge transmission mechanism: understand functional relationship across economy bind le secure structure economy undergo rapid change. the existence large informal economy complicate task. this lead fourth implication monetary policy emerge market economy. this critical role play confidence in, credibility of, policy framework. this domestic international dimension. domestically, critical need win public acceptance value low inflation public confidence determination ability central bank achieve it. internationally, confidence policy framework adhere powerful influence investment inflow exchange rate. these factor are, course, crucial monetary policy country. but task buttress challenge emerge market economy track record commitment relatively much shorter. these argue distinctive challenge face monetary policy-makers emerge market economies. be they, however, sufficiently distinctive require fundamentally different approach conduct monetary policy? the answer, quote evelyn waugh, be, (cid:147)up point, lord copper.(cid:148) they different kind factor central bank country face. but perhaps play predominant part monetary policy judgement emerge market economy elsewhere. this suggest two final observations. first, uncertainties, central bank emerge market economy may understandably tend relatively cautious adjust policy stance, sense space adjustment relatively small step extend periods. no central banker need ever apologise regard cautious. but mean that, even circumstance may case contemplate bold action, balance risk may argue approach. secondly, give challenges, inflation target framework realistically expect deliver desire result emerge market context? if various distinctive feature identify - periodic unexpected shocks, exchange rate volatility, imperfect information source public confidence yet fully robust - occur whatever combination, result central bank miss target extend period, course danger credibility, even feasibility, process could call question. but arguably, precisely circumstance clarity inflation target helpful, powerful, communicate central bank’s policy intentions. that challenge formidable reason step back clarity. it is, instead, powerful reason favour clarity inflation target deliver, reinforce effective communication central bank, consistency conduct policy transparency explain actions. in broad perspective, fundamental monetary policy not, meaningful way, different africa. bi review 38/2003 1 zeti akhtar aziz: challenge financial education malaysia open remark dr zeti akhtar aziz, governor central bank malaysia, launch insurance consumer education

insurance takaful industry today part on-going effort enhance ability consumer understand draw meaningful comparison alternative financial product make better-informed decision financial planning. in formulate consumer education strategy, distinct feature insurance industry take consideration meet information need insurance consumers. insurance contract essentially form basis disclosure make prospective policyholder risk insured. such disclosure determine insurer assume risk price assumed. the ability enforce claim insurer depend accuracy completeness disclosures. this underwrite claim assessment process distinguish insurance financial products. there also wide range intermediary insurance industry compare financial service industries. the entire spectrum include insurance agents, insurance broke adviser distribution process, loss adjusters, manage care organizations, lawyer auto repair workshop claim process. the unique feature insurance significant implication disclosure liability directly affect insure public. the implication become even significant competitive pressure give rise rapid introduction new product require good understand entail part average consumer. the

norwegian university science technology, trondheim, 2 september 2003. the text may differ slightly actual presentation. the speech base assessment present norge bank(cid:146)s press conference follow executive board(cid:146)s monetary policy meet 13 august previous speeches. the chart pdf find norge bank(cid:146)s website. * * * the operational target monetary policy define government inflation close 2.5 per cent time. the inflation target provide economic agent anchor decision concern saving, investment, budget wages. the inflation target vehicle monetary policy(cid:146)s contribution stabilise output employment. this intention also express regulation monetary policy. high demand good service labour shortage normally point high inflation. when interest rate increased, demand fall inflation keep bay. when demand low unemployment rises, inflation tend slow. interest rate reduced. norge bank set interest rate future inflation equal inflation target 2‰ per cent. the interest rate reduce since december last year response change inflation outlook. this result weak cyclical development world economy sharp drop interest rate internationally. in addition, norwegian business sector felt effect high norwegian cost level. the weak prospect home abroad turn impact norwegian labour market outlook wage growth inflation year ahead. the mandate imply interest rate must adapt outlook norwegian economy. if appear inflation high 2‰ per cent unchanged interest rates, interest rate increased. if appear inflation low 2‰ per cent unchanged interest rates, interest rate reduced. this orientation monetary policy normally also contribute stabilise output employment. the impact monetary policy occur lag. the current inflation rate provide sufficient information determine level interest rate set now. our analysis indicate substantial share effect interest rate change occur within two years. thus, two year normally reasonable time horizon reach inflation target. the interest rate influence inflation indirectly via domestic demand good service via effect exchange rate. when interest rate rise, become profitable household save, therefore postpone consumption. borrow also become costly, associate decline investment. low demand turn curb rise price wages. high interest rate make attractive invest nok borrow foreign currency. therefore, high interest rate normally lead appreciation krone. this make import good cheaper. in addition, strong krone reduce activity, profitability ability pay internationally expose sector. expectation u far interest rate fall adjust downwards considerably since summer 2002. last summer, market participant expect key rate u increase 5 per cent towards end 2004. now interest rate believe reach low level expect remain 1 per cent end 2003, gradual rise 2.5 per cent 2005. clear sign expect upswing emerge recently, however. gdp grow 3.1 per cent (seasonally adjusted, annual rate) second quarter. optimism among participant financial market increasing; equity price long-term interest rate risen. despite improvement u economy, aspect still give rise uncertainty whether expect upswing sustained. capacity utilisation manufacture still low. the household save ratio low household debt high. the current account show large deficit. 2 bi review 38/2003 at monetary policy meet august, federal open market committee decide keep target federal fund rate unchanged 1 per cent. the committee perceive upside downside risk attainment sustainable growth next quarter roughly equal. the committee judge that, balance, risk inflation become undesirably low likely predominant concern foreseeable future. in circumstances, committee believe policy accommodation maintain considerable period. asia show sign recovery. china lead field economic growth approach 10 per cent thailand show strong growth. but picture positive. south korea experience slow growth year. south korea one country particularly affect competition china. in japan, growth low long period, indication growth pick up, although still early say whether sustainable. the key rate euro area reduce 2 per cent. forward rate imply interest rate expect remain 2 per cent end 2003, rise slightly next year. gdp growth major european country low negative. in netherlands, gdp drop three consecutive quarters, germany record decline past two quarters. france(cid:146)s gdp show growth first quarter decline second quarter year. for euro area whole, preliminary figure indicate zero growth second quarter. some consumer business confidence indicator recently show sign improvement, eu commission(cid:146)s estimate point moderate growth next quarters. there are, however, clear sign imminent rapid recovery. among trade partner whole, economic development past year far weak norge bank others, analyst international organisations, expected. growth projection 2003 revise downwards substantially past year, reflect effect world economy number negative shock war iraq sars. global growth still expect pick gradually towards normal level, upswing may come late stage previously assumed. however, cannot rule possibility global economy face relatively long period stagnation low possibly fall inflation. this risk reflect low short-term interest rate us, europe japan. long-term interest rate edge recently. this may indication financial market participant somewhat optimistic expect economic policy stimulus desire effect. in spite weak economic developments, oil price remain high. low level production iraq contribute hold oil prices. strike production problem venezuela nigeria also play role. these development may keep oil price high growth global economy return normal. the oil industry come period sluggish growth global economy since 2000 without fall revenues. this has, isolation, curb effect international downturn norway. however, situation, whole regard oil prices, still highly uncertain. weak external development particular negative spillover effect norwegian economy appreciation krone, fall equity price last year low demand norwegian exports. the krone exchange rate price currency measure term foreign currency. development country important krone development norwegian economy. the krone strong. a result, price import good fallen. this contribute low inflation despite strong wage growth period several years. our analysis indicate important reason appreciation krone may 2000 end 2002 positive widen interest rate differential. combine interest rate differential, fall equity price reduce fluctuations, volatility, foreign exchange market contribute appreciation krone last year. the effect interest rate differential krone amplify development international capital markets. part appreciation 2002 may also due high oil prices. in highly uncertain situation fear war iraq, norwegian krone, buoy relatively high interest rate oil wealth, may regard attractive alternative. investment nok may consider good hedge downturn world economy result fear war high oil prices. since december last year, interest rate differential norway country narrow bi review 38/2003 3 3 percentage points. since begin 2003, krone measure term trade-weighted exchange rate index (twi) depreciate 11 per cent. at begin 1990s, norwegian economy deep recession. production far capacity. when growth economy pick up, capacity utilisation increased. the output gap show difference actual gdp level indicate trend growth - estimate close 2‰ per cent norway. around 1996, full capacity utilisation, output gap, normally measure it, closed. subsequently, cost increase price good service produce norwegian market accelerated. the upturn peak 1997, gdp growth approach 5 per cent. in 1997 1998 economy shift upturn high growth rate expansion low growth low unemployment, labour shortage many sector strong growth labour costs. unemployment increase since 2001. capacity utilisation mainland economy fall high level par level year 1995-1997, cost inflation accelerated. the output gap closed. at time, wage growth drop sustainable level. however, growth economy stall last winter. it therefore appropriate reduce interest rate markedly. even though krone depreciate year, competitiveness still fairly weak. in period 1996-2003, competitiveness norwegian manufacture deteriorate 13 per cent. the deterioration solely ascribable high growth labour cost norway among trade partners. the krone measure term trade-weighted exchange rate index (twi) currently level 1996. compare average last 30 year (1970-2003), wage growth contribute deterioration competitiveness 15 per cent. in year around turn millennium, depreciation krone veil underlie deterioration competitiveness. in may 2000, krone exchange rate reach low level six years. in follow period end 2002, krone appreciated, effect high wage growth gradually come evidence overall corporate results. result last year affect particularly strong krone second half year. the krone exchange rate, measure term twi, return level mid-1990s, business sector still grapple high level cost build since 1998. change krone exchange rate prove reversible, loss competitiveness job cause relatively high level domestic wage growth difficult recoup. in recent years, labour cost account increase share corporate earnings. in 2002, labour cost account 90 per cent total factor income manufacturing. the increase wage share affect corporate behaviour. the demand labour declining. credit demand investment enterprise sector low. at time, commercial property market weak. vacancy rate commercial premise high rent fallen. this impact investment period ahead. low interest rate normally result high inflation, partly krone depreciates, partly rise demand. enterprise thus able increase earnings. business sector activity stimulate effectively low interest rate weak krone. due past years(cid:146) wage settlements, household strengthen financial position expense private public enterprises. house price edge stagnate early year. household borrow moderate somewhat, still high. against background, growth private consumption expect fairly high period ahead. consumer spend good rising, point towards growth private consumption year par projection june inflation report. mainland gdp project rise le trend growth year reach trend level 2004.1 in 2005, gdp growth project high trend growth. investment activity mainland norway low. investment petroleum sector rising, large share increase demand meet imports. public consumption increase sharply 2002, little stimulus economy public sector year. growth mainly fuel private 1 projection inflation report 2/03 base assumption concern forward rate gradually decline krone exchange rate. 4 bi review 38/2003 consumption second half year 2004. we expect investment mainland enterprise gradually pick low level. in order set appropriate interest rate, important able form reasonably accurate picture economic situation. economic statistic important source information, publish lag figure revise frequently. in autumn 2002, norge bank establish regional network tool gauge level activity norwegian economy. the network consist companies, organisation municipality throughout norway. in two round talk connection inflation report 2/03, 450 contact interviewed. we six round talk year business community leader concern financial development enterprise industries, 200 visit round. the selection contact represent production side economy, industry-wise geographically. in course 2003, number contact network rise 1000 persons, contact twice year. the department economics norwegian university science technology responsible network trłndelag county conduct contact meetings. official statistic current market information continue main basis assessments, due time lag revision statistics, supplementary information useful. the regional network provide up-to-date information state norwegian economy. regular communication local contact norway’s business community life provide u information supplement available official statistics. it also provide u additional information area cover official statistical sources, learn issue particular interest enterprises. information receive regional network support picture present june inflation report: enterprise reduce cost households(cid:146) financial position strong. we wait see result current round talk point increase optimism business sector public entity prospect future continue regard somewhat negative. inflation low norway. the rise consumer price adjust tax exclude energy product (cpi-ate) slow primarily due development price import consumer goods. low inflation due appreciation krone throughout last year low inflation abroad. the rise price domestically produce good service also slowed. this particularly case domestically produce good influence world market prices. domestic price inflation nevertheless remain close 3 per cent, due high wage growth several years. in july, year-on-year rise cpi-ate 0.7 per cent, low project june inflation report substantially low inflation target. there also prospect inflation low time ahead. the analysis june inflation report show reduction sight deposit rate towards 3 per cent, combine depreciation krone, could bring inflation towards target two year ahead.2 more moderate wage settlement future would provide basis even monetary policy ease weak krone.3 without considerable monetary policy easing, inflation might remain low extensive period. the short-term nominal interest rate norway reach historically low level. interest rate low since first nine ten year follow second world war. the real interest rate also low, although mean low inflation plague norwegian saver 1970s 1980s. the low interest rate must view risk persistently low inflation norway countries. so far, indicator inflation expectation point substantial deviation inflation target 2‰ per cent. however, inflation remain low extensive period, risk expectation continue low inflation generated. it may prove difficult fuel economic activity stimulate demand. a mark ease monetary policy therefore appropriate. the inflation target symmetrical. it equally important avoid inflation rate low avoid inflation rate high. 2 base assumption concern forward rate gradually decline krone exchange rate. 3 base assumption concern forward rate gradually decline krone exchange rate, assumption monetary policy ease translate strong wage growth. bi review 38/2003 5 capacity utilisation norwegian economy neither abnormally high abnormally low. however, available statistic indicate economic growth come halt winter. a global upswing contribute strong growth norway. growth sluggish already, however, stagnation many business sectors. since inflation also low, low interest rate appropriate now. but always question weigh one consideration another. since december last year, monetary policy ease great extent rapidly customary. follow phase substantial easing, uncertainty regard economic development period ahead somewhat great normal. with ease implemented, must particularly alert change private consumption, wage growth krone exchange rate. if household expect interest rate remain low, private consumption may increase assumed. house price household borrow may accelerate. however, increase slack labour market decline migration large town reduce effects. the risk strong growth household demand must weigh sluggish development business sector. even though krone depreciate strong level begin year, competitiveness still relatively weak many year high wage growth. in addition, vacancy rate commercial premise high rent fallen. another risk wage growth may accelerate again, follow interest rate reduction 1999. this risk also reduce slacken labour market. unemployment 2004 probably par level 1996 1997. annual wage growth year little le 4‰ per cent. the low pay increase year(cid:146)s wage settlement also indicate social partner place weight effect pay increase future development interest rates, krone exchange rate employment. in addition, activity public particularly shelter industry probably still feel impact expensive pay increase last year early years. we expect light experience gain 2002, public entity exercise caution future wage settlements. development krone exchange rate represent another source uncertainty. the relationship krone exchange rate interest rate differential country necessarily stable time. theme international financial market shift. however, depreciation krone year contribute stabilise inflation activity economy. we may yet see full effect krone exchange rate interest rate reduction implemented. at time, krone influence fiscal policy outlook wage growth. norge bank(cid:146)s executive board set interest rate view achieve inflation target 2‰ per cent. the inflation target also vehicle monetary policy(cid:146)s contribution stabilise output employment. when set interest rate, executive board seek achieve balance. the objective stimulate growth norwegian economy achieve inflation target weigh risk new pressure build economy long term. since december 2002, judge achieve balance appropriate reduce interest rate low level. at last monetary policy meet 13 august, decide reduce interest rate 3.0 per cent. with interest rate 3.0 per cent, executive board(cid:146)s assessment remain unchanged, i.e. probability inflation two year ahead low 2‰ per cent great probability higher. thank attention. bi review 37/2003 1 glenn stevens: structural change conduct monetary policy speech mr glenn stevens, deputy governor reserve bank australia, federal reserve bank kansa city economic symposium, jackson hole, 30 august 2003. * * * thank organiser invitation take part symposium. i(cid:146)d like arrange remark around three type structural change. the first change underlie structure real economy. the second change inflation process. the third change financial structure. i argue last probably difficult central bank deal with. structural change real economy change industries(cid:146) relative share production employment, change extent foreign competitor penetrate national markets, always feature market economies. this kind structural change reflect shift tastes, open new markets, advent new competitor introduction new technology on, periodically disrupt establish pattern production, distribution consumption. what(cid:146)s monetary policy(cid:146)s job face changes? generally speaking, simply let occur, resist temptation use monetary policy address adjustment issues. monetary policy cannot, example, cure unemployment problem result collision change industrial pattern rigid labour market practices. nor address inter-regional difference economy cause concentration decline sector one area grow sector another. other policy must come fore deal sort problems. (that said, improvement structural policy enhance economy(cid:146)s supply side ideally complement accommodate demand management, thing equal.) that say sort structural change may raise technical issue monetary policy. they may well affect judgement set instrument contribute long run goal policy, invariant change structure. if structural change are, example, affect relationship conventional measure economic slack prices, economy(cid:146)s medium-term potential output path, relevance particular economic indicators, take account set instrument. how one go that? there simple device available purpose. it essentially matter try quick learner - continually look thing different past, wed particular empirical representation economy. we develop notion economy(cid:146)s behaviour - it(cid:146)s good enough say know nothing. but (cid:145)models(cid:146) economy - whether formal informal kind - need view work hypotheses, continually open amendment light new experience.1 this hold well analytical construct commonly use, like output gaps, nairus, natural real interest rate on. it(cid:146)s important keep device realm useful way organise thinking, take care elevate numerical estimate central status, l shift relationship take policy-makers course. the rba(cid:146)s approach best various piece empirical research areas, allow inform judgement outlook policy, sense substitute judgment. i(cid:146)m sure occur central banks. provide mindful broad principles, i think central bank are, able cope shift economic structure acceptably well. and little suggest sort 1 it could add take board sort change may involve prepare occasion give weight judgement empirical evidence crystal clear - recognise might wrong try weigh cost wrong. a case point would way u policy maker back judgement high trend productivity growth clear official data. 2 bi review 37/2003 ongoing evolution economic structure pose great problem policy maker today past. a different type structural change time series property economy - particular, degree variation quarter quarter. a hear conference, seem reasonably clear evidence that, many major countries, variation diminish 1990s. this also true australia(cid:146)s case, standard deviation quarterly gdp growth 1990s one third low 1980s, two third low 1970s. good policies, flexible economies, small shock - is, good luck - (complementary) explanation phenomenon. that favourable environment central bankers. to extent, we(cid:146)ve give easy hand play predecessors. i one would much like see continue! of course, may continue. shock could big future. or structural policy improvement might partly reverse (e.g. increase protectionism). perhaps relatively stable geopolitical environment must help growth 1990s present decade ahead. in world, monetary policy maker would face tough time. even optimal policy adjustment would likely associate volatile overall performance. whether financial market price currently embody significant probability outcome interest question ponder - guess not. in scenario like this, expectation monetary policy might able deliver term smooth business cycle year year inflation rate could turn disappointed, would difficult time explain respective citizens. but apart sharpen communication skills, much possibility wait see occur. structural change inflation process the second type structural change i want talk change inflation process. in post-world war ii era, witness two structural change property aggregate price level. first, tendency persistent inflation, extent see before, become quite noticeable late 1960s. (cid:145)the great inflation(cid:146) accelerate 1970s, industrial countries, peak inflation rate reach time 1974 1982. since then, see second phase, continual rise price level slow down, many place today see, less, price stability. a factor make contribution swings, include adverse supply shock 1970s, favourable one much 1990s. these sort thing make monetary policy(cid:146)s job hard easier, though course monetary policy ultimately take responsibility price level outcome long run. one central lesson draw experience importance expectation inflation process. the ambitious expansionary policy could deliver intend gain expectation remain stable. once expectation start move up, policy le effective boost output, people behave differently inflation think part economic furniture. moreover expectation continue inflation, developed, prove fairly stubborn, tend constrain ability monetary policy support economy demand weak. but token, something observe today expectation anchor appropriately low levels, monetary policy flexibility. policy maker room little tolerant, example, decline exchange rate. our experience aftermath asian financial crisis 1997 face pronounce weaken exchange rate, inflation expectation remain quite well anchored. while inflation increase temporarily result fall exchange rate, likelihood persistent problem inflation low. hence monetary policy able follow fairly accommodative stance, face weak international environment, rather need tighten safe-guard medium-term price stability. this would possible early times, extra flexibility make considerable bi review 37/2003 3 difference economic performance.2 so expectation matter, unreasonable think effort policy maker clear goal control inflation, act consistently goal, make difference characteristic inflation process. that turn allow policy additional short-run flexibility. the question many recently debate whether another sea change occur inflation process every bite profound take place 1960s, direction. that is, prevail problem future go inflation, deflation? for country answer clearly (cid:145)no(cid:146), foreseeable future. others qualify answer countries. but either way, expectation important. while strongly hold zero, easy monetary policy help get economy incipient deflation. be expectation deflation become entrenched, hand, policy would face much difficult task remedy situation. this highlight importance articulate goal policy clearly possible, give expectation anchor. for inflation target country australia, stress symmetry target quite important context. country u without formal target also indicate inflation rate low undesirable. mere announcement enough, course, back credible policy actions, country chronically weak demand already accompany flat fall prices, action necessarily realm monetary policy. but clear policy seek maintain, return to, low zero inflation probably necessary, even sufficient, condition adequate outcomes. experience previous period deflation country (admittedly first hand u here) observation japan(cid:146)s travail past decade, also point importance financial structure. this lead naturally third topic. change financial structure there rightly much emphasis corporate sector finances, government finances, industrial country many years. one area create big problem every country one time another, number country struggle get public finance order set continue time ahead. but one strike area financial change recent time increase opportunity household adjust financial positions, certainly english speak countries. access credit expand remarkably past couple decades. the structural decline inflation produce much low nominal interest rates, nominal rate matter household look borrow finance house investment. at time, lender find household le risky borrower companies. both factor encourage household take leverage. financial innovation also mean much great opportunity collateralise assets. with big run house price occurred, large pool potential collateral yet tapped. and fairly long period relative economic stability - australia(cid:146)s case, quite long expansion, thirteenth year - mean people feel comfortable leverage. in australia(cid:146)s case, household gross asset 8‰ time current income, compare 5 time 1980, 6 time recently mid 1990s. financial asset grown, much increase wealth form dwellings. since 1997, australia-wide median price establish house doubled. at time australian household indebted. the ratio debt income risen, point well see comparable country mid 1990s towards top range see like country today. leverage - ratio debt asset - increase fast ratio debt income (which imply net worth increase substantially) remain low comparable countries, even increase noticeably. these trend show signs, present, imminent change. 2 it(cid:146)s true generally low pas exchange rate change inflation also help instance like one i mention - though i can(cid:146)t help feel low inflation environment generally, associate set expectations, important drive result. 4 bi review 37/2003 we yet see full ramification structural change household behaviour balance sheets. the fact balance sheet much big presumably mean change wealth likely matter more, relative change thing like current income, use determine course household spend business cycle. secondly, high leverage mean negative shock income likely amplify work way economic system. moreover, leverage may yet increase good deal further, since as-yet-untapped equity house stock still large, capacity access growing. and thirdly, course, high leverage mean monetary policy(cid:146)s impact via effect behaviour borrower big past - especially country like australia majority household debt float rates. the asset price channel policy might also end bigger. we watch development rather mix feelings. for years, plausible explanation trend i describe good fundamental reason change households(cid:146) balance sheets. household various reason constrain position relatively low borrowing, various constraint lifted, inevitable, perhaps even desirable, would period strong growth lend household move towards new balance sheet equilibrium. from mid 1990s 2001, seem best story. but past year two, become le confident sensible one-time balance sheet adjustment still continuing, concern increase number household may put position vulnerability. this is, course, particular experience thorny question monetary policy, debt asset prices. like central bank grapple question what, any, response monetary policy ought make situation and, like others, find question amenable straightforward answer. on one hand, development exert expansionary impetus economy time global demand condition weak. to extent, helpful avoid undue weakness australian economy. on hand, household sector(cid:146)s ability cope future contractionary shock probably impaired, margin, leverage continue increase. while think would significant financial sector fragility direct result increase debt even house price fall near term, fear could still significant general economic fall economy subject shock, mainly household consumption could retreat quite quickly. deal still much work progress, i reflect experience date others, observation come mind. first, helpful couch discussion term whether monetary policy try prick (cid:145)bubbles(cid:146). this tend side-track discussion question like whether confidently identify, indeed even define, (cid:145)bubbles(cid:146), whether aggressive policy action appropriate can. a helpful way set think balance risk face economy: something occur increasingly likely misalignment, subsequent reversal could prove disruptive? and so, monetary policy course which, possibly involve short-run cost economic activity, would reduce risk big loss economic activity later? can we, use popular metaphor, buy insurance price? second, response monetary policy bind relatively moderate, uncertainty effect policy dynamic asset price considerable. that mean asset price still likely move quite bite episodes. policy(cid:146)s ability smooth thing limit (which something already know general proposition anyway). third, i incline agree recent work bank england suggest possible, least principle, embed discussion within medium-term inflation target framework. for inflation target countries, would certainly retrograde step view perceive walk away framework decade deliver good results, favour explicit pursuit asset price per se. fourthly, even bring asset price debt within exist framework, difficult problem practice. our approach monetary policy, presentation objective monetary policy, usually gear horizon year two. this hold explicit inflation targeters also, i think, implicit goals. but asset price event balance sheet change accompany usually occur neatly frequency. the really big one once-in-a-generation developments. bi review 37/2003 5 if decide monetary policy responsive asset price events, approach would motivate broad rather long-term notion financial monetary stability common use today. for u use explicit inflation targets, example, would need focus long time horizon perhaps somewhat great toleration short run deviation medium-term target. the presentational difficulty this, necessarily insurmountable, certainly trivial. if need move direction give asset price debt development weight conduct monetary policy hitherto, need educate respective community issues. that education process probably good thing anyway, regardless policy intentions. conclusion discussion matter doubtless set continue. it pretty certain structural change always us. central bank routinely look sort change which, leave ultimate objective unchanged, might alter short term tactic policy settings. but i think financial structure changes, often occur longish periods, probably central bank difficult one handle. zdeněk tůma: the role rule public finance introductory

desirable way. in term actual institutional design, monetary policy play lead role, shift great central bank independence clear anti-inflationary mandate mark trend. nonetheless, three serious question emerge result. first, whether independence reliance strict policy rule high cost term macroeconomic instability. second, coordinate monetary policy governmental action make consistent policy mix. and third, compensate democratic deficit technocratic monetary policy decision-making. concern first issue, empirical research find great central bank independence average associate low inflation, high volatility. this (cid:147)free lunch(cid:148) bite surprise light (cid:147)conservative central banker theory(cid:148). it reflect fact actual institutional policy design evolve time guarantee mandate achieve low inflation interpret rigidly. in fact, central banker pay attention real economic development policies. in last decade, fact formally institutionally reflect (cid:147)flexible(cid:148) inflation-targeting regime. this regime often describe (cid:147)constrained discretion(cid:148), mean aim make monetary policy-making constrain understandable procedure time flexible respond unforeseen shocks. a far democratic deficit concerned, issue address move great transparency accountability central banks. the burden proof central banks(cid:146) communication shift last two decades. at present, necessary give convince argument one think central bank give information, rather argue something revealed. this significant shift central banks(cid:146) mentality. regard issue communication co-operation central bank government, universal solution find far. there many institutional arrangements, range formal contract government central bank non-formalised consultation two bodies. the efficiency arrangements, however, depend case actual implementation. now i come fiscal sphere. a trend towards rule-based policy observe well, albeit time lag different form compare monetary policy. the difference originate mainly fact fiscal policy definition political issue strong redistribution aspects, cannot easily mandate direct democratic control. the independence solution thus readily available here, even though suggestion economic literature. this contribute fact single elegant model yet find practice. the exist rule usually take form self-imposed constraints, legal constraint (balanced-budget act countries) international treaty (s&g pact). apart difference, though, aim implement rule stem reason face similar challenge monetary policy. the idea policy design way put short-term political gain longer-term interest society, take account impact private expectations, transparent public, common monetary fiscal spheres. similarly, rule must also address issue cost term macroeconomic stabilisation find proper policy mix. the teethe problem stability growth pact example challenges. one key motivation pact effort avoid free rid national government multinational currency area. in words, desire achieve proper policy mix present birth rule. in spite that, pact criticise rigid, allow proper policy response time distress, thus ultimately lead poor real economic performance. this naturally undermine credibility support call various (cid:147)escape clauses(cid:148), use inflation-targeting terminology. the pact thus fight battle conservative central banker time ago. it evolve towards (cid:147)constrained discretion(cid:148) system fulfil major goal - sustainability, credibility co-ordination stabilisation policy - yet time sufficiently flexible allow proper response adverse periods. it yet convince policy-makers public deliver lunch without pay high price term cyclical stabilisation. so far, pact seem lose battle. this somewhat unfair, adverse period come eu country achieve target balance structural budgets, reduce manoeuvre space considerably. in sense, pact thus pay price lax previous period, i.e. define bind convergence path target, rather price rigid. on hand, i also agree many critique propose adjustment pact. define convergence path, look structural rather headline budgets, take account public debt level sustainability public finance, etc., certainly step towards achieve (cid:147)constrained discretion(cid:148) fiscal policy i talk about. the adverse period thus take opportunity modify rule favourable way, rather reason scrap completely. i believe pursue opportunity secure future s&g pact. i convince rule kind always place eurozone, multinational nature, also due general advantage rules. let also mention briefly importance s&g pact czech republic eu accession countries. the czech republic, like many cecs, face problem rise budget deficits. this partly reflection previous transition costs, gradually fade away. the root problem structural, similar challenge face advance eu country well - population ageing, overgenerous social system, etc. at present, country prepare consolidation programme aim reverse negative trends. usually, ambition bring public deficit close to, below, 3% maastricht level. for example, target czech republic exceed 4% gdp 2006. nonetheless, yet fully appreciate upon eu accession, stability growth pact become relevant new member states. admittedly, application sanction postpone country become member eurozone. but even country subject sanctions, member eu club place least credible programme towards achieve objectives. moreover, country target relatively early eurozone entry, first create sufficient safety margin 3% deficit limit insure distress - i.e. avoid mistake make current eurozone member concern s&g pact. i hope uncertainty surround pact(cid:146)s future would view excuse delay necessary fiscal structural adjustments. even redefine flexible way, quite clear structural deficit currently observe many cecs tolerable pact, pas sustainability policy mix tests. therefore, existence s&g pact make case fiscal consolidation even appeal might look first sight. to conclude, let wish fruitful discussion conference, well pleasant stay prague. thank attention. bi review 37/2003 1 alan greenspan: monetary policy uncertainty remark mr alan greenspan,

a well-known proposition that, restrictive set assumptions, uncertainty bear action policymakers might choose, proceed know precise structure economy.2 these assumptions--linearity structure economy, perfect knowledge interest-sensitivity aggregate spend so-called slope parameters, specific attitude policymakers toward risk--are never meet real world. indeed, give inevitably incomplete knowledge key structural aspect ever-changing economy sometimes asymmetric cost benefit particular outcomes, central bank seek maximize probability achieve goal driven, i believe, risk-management approach policy. by i mean policymakers need consider likely future path economy also distribution possible outcome path. they need reach judgment probabilities, costs, benefit various possible outcome alternative choice policy. a policy action calculate optimal base simulation one particular model may not, fact, optimal full extent uncertainty policymaking environment take account. in general, entirely possible different policy exhibit different degree robustness respect true underlie structure economy. for example, policy a might judge best advance policymakers(cid:146) objectives, conditional particular model economy, might also see relatively severe adverse consequence true structure economy turn one assumed. on hand, policy b might somewhat le effective advance policy objective assume baseline model might relatively benign event structure economy turn differ baseline. these consideration incline federal reserve policymakers toward policy limit risk deflation even though baseline forecast conventional model would project event. * * * at times, policy practitioner operate risk-management paradigm may lead undertake action intend provide insurance emergence especially adverse outcomes. for example, follow russian debt default fall 1998, federal open market committee (fomc) ease policy despite perception economy expand satisfactory pace that, even without policy initiative, likely continue so.3 we ease policy concern low-probability risk default might severely disrupt domestic international financial markets, outsized adverse feedback performance u.s. economy. the product low-probability event severe outcome, occur, judge large threat possible adverse consequence insurance might prove unnecessary. the cost--or premium--of financial-contagion insurance associate increase risk high inflation future date. this cost view relatively low time, largely increase competition, drive globalization, thwart employers(cid:146) ability pas high labor cost prices. give russian default, benefit unusual policy action deem outweigh costs. such cost-benefit analysis ongoing part monetary policy decisionmaking, tip toward monetary ease fallout contractionary event russian default seem increasingly likely occurrence seem especially costly. conversely, 1979, inflation threaten get control, cost economy major withdrawal liquidity judge far le potential long-term consequence leave accelerate price unaddressed. 2 william brainard, (cid:147)uncertainty effectiveness monetary policy,(cid:148) american economic review, may 1967, pp. 411-25. 3 see minute fomc meet september 29, 1998. bi review 37/2003 3 * * * in implement risk-management approach policy, must confront fact limit number risk quantify confidence. and even risk generally quantifiable accept assumption future replicate past. other risk essentially unquantifiable--representing knightian uncertainty, will--because may fully appreciate even full range possibilities, let alone possibility(cid:146)s likelihood. a result, risk management often involve significant judgment part policymakers, evaluate risk different event probability action alter risks. for judgment, policymakers, rather rely solely specific linkage express formal models, tend draw broader, though le mathematically precise, hypothesis world works. for example, inference market participant might respond monetary policy initiative may need reference past behavior period roughly comparable current situation. some critic argue approach policy undisciplined--judgmental, seemingly discretionary, difficult explain. the federal reserve should, conclude, attempt formal operation tie action solely prescription formal policy rule. that approach along line would lead improvement economic performance, however, highly doubtful. our problem complexity model far great complexity world economy whose underlie linkage appear continual state flux. rule nature simple, significant shift uncertainty exist economic environment, cannot substitute risk-management paradigms, far good suit policymaking. be introduce interest rate rule, would judge mean rule posit rate far current rate?

nearly 2‰ year ago - occasion 21st asia pacific forex congress. that meet take place background asian crisis 1997-98. the asian region come forex crisis destabilise kind. i use occasion review on-going debate management external sector, particularly appropriate exchange rate systems, appropriate intervention policy, foreign exchange reserve policy. soon asian crisis, subject figure prominently discussion international financial architecture various fora, imf, world bank, g20, financial stability forum bank international settlements. at time, review state debate, i mention worldwide consensus several issue still evolving. today, (cid:147)consensus(cid:148) may strong word, i believe fair degree convergence dominant international opinion among expert various specialise institution many issues. let summarise main conclusion emerge last 2 3 year management external sector. once again, i emphasise that, give widely different economy world talk about, global consensus unity views. however, present, i see it, certainly (cid:147)dominant(cid:148) view right appropriate, increasingly command international acceptance. thus, question appropriate exchange rate regime, fix exchange rate regime (even currency board) clearly favour. the brazilian argentinian crisis, asian crisis, come rude shock. even strong currency board type arrangement fix peg vis-(cid:224)-vis dollar find unviable. you recall that, soon asian crisis, widely accept theoretical position country choice either give monetary independence set currency board give stable currency objective let exchange rate float freely monetary policy could direct objective inflation control. there shift paradigm. the possibility viable fix rate mechanism generally discarded, dominant view that, country float flexible rate sustainable way le crisis-prone exchange rate regime. in regard desirable degree flexibility exchange rates, opinion practice vary. but completely (cid:147)free(cid:148) float, without intervention, clearly favour except perhaps respect global reserve currencies. and, respect currency also (say, euro dollar), concern express high level movement sharp either direction - recently, example, euro strengthen fast pace. study imf several expert also show far, common exchange rate regime adopt countries, include industrial countries, 2 bi review 36/2003 free float. most country adopt intermediate regime various types, as, manage float pre-announced path, independent float foreign exchange intervention moderate rate change prevent undue fluctuations. by large, bar few, country (cid:147)managed(cid:148) float central bank intervene periodically. this also true industrial countries. in past, u.s., eu u.k. also intervene one time another. thus, irrespective pure theoretical position favour free float, external value currency continue matter concern countries, central banks. the reason intervention central bank forex market become necessary time time primarily two reasons. a fundamental change take place recent year importance capital flow determine exchange rate movement trade deficit economic growth, important early days. the latter matter, period time. capital flows, hand, become primary determinant exchange rate movement day-to-day basis. secondly, unlike trade flows, capital flow (cid:147)gross(cid:148) term affect exchange rate several time high (cid:147)net(cid:148) flow day. these also much sensitive everybody else say case foreign trade economic growth. therefore, herd become unavoidable. i sure agree dealer prefer wrong everyone else rather wrong alone! a relate issue, corollary prevalent intermediate regime respect exchange rates, concern need, any, foreign exchange reserves. in regime free float, could argue really need reserves. if demand foreign exchange high supply, exchange rate depreciate equilibrate demand supply time. if supply exceed demand, exchange rate appreciate sooner later, two equalise price. however, today light volatility induce capital flow self-fulfilling expectation generate, grow consensus emerge market country should, matter policy, maintain (cid:147)adequate(cid:148) reserves. how adequacy define also become clearer. earlier, rule use define term number month imports. now, increasingly felt reserve least sufficient cover likely variation capital flow (cid:147)liquidity-at-risk(cid:148). (however, yet consensus upper limit reserves. even (cid:147)adequate(cid:148) level reached, reserve may continue increase capital inflow strong central bank decide intervene order moderate degree appreciation.) to sum up, seem debate appropriate policy relate forex market converge around generally accept views. among these, i mention are: (a) exchange rate flexible fix pegged; (b) country able intervene manage exchange rate - least degree - movement believe destablising short run; (c) reserve least sufficient take care fluctuation capital flow (cid:147)liquidity risk(cid:148). let briefly deal issue practical importance management forex market india, figure prominently medium expert commentary. i first take 2 3 matter rather straight-forward policy stance also equally (cid:147)unambiguous(cid:148) clear-cut. then i move to, conclude with, discussion appropriate exchange rate policy india current situation. a frequently discuss question capital account convertibility (cas), i.e. india go move full cac? a aware, already liberalize deregulate whole host capital account transactions. it probably fair say transaction require business personal convenience, rupee is, practical purposes, convertible. in cases, specific permission require transaction high monetary ceiling, permission also generally forthcoming. it also declare policy government rbi continue process liberalization. in sense, capital account convertibility continue desirable objective investment business relate transaction india able achieve objective distant future. there are, however, two area would need extremely cautious - one unlimited access short-term external commercial borrow meet work capital domestic requirements. the area concern question provide unrestricted freedom domestic resident convert domestic bank deposit idle asset (such as, real estate), response market development exchange rate expectations. in respect short-term external commercial borrowings, already strong international consensus emerge market keep borrow relatively small relation total bi review 36/2003 3 external debt reserves. many financial crisis 1990s occur short-term debt excessive. when time good, debt easily accessible. the position, however, change dramatically time external pressure. all creditor could redeem debt within short period, cause extreme domestic financial vulnerability. the occurrence possibility avoided, would well continue policy keep access short-term debt limit conscious policy time - good bad. so far free convertibility domestic asset resident concerned, issue somewhat fundamental. it differential impact (cid:147)stock(cid:148) (cid:147)flows(cid:148) determine external vulnerability. the day-to-day movement exchange rate determine (cid:147)flows(cid:148) funds, i.e. demand supply spot forward transaction market. now, suppose exchange rate depreciate unduly sharply (for whatever reasons) expect continue near future. now, suppose domestic residents, therefore, decide - perfectly rationally reasonably - convert part whole stock domestic asset domestic currency foreign currency. this financially desirable domestic value convert asset expect increase anticipate depreciation. and, large number resident decide simultaneously within short period time, may, expectation would become self-fulfilling. a severe external crisis unavoidable. consider india(cid:146)s case, example. today, reserve high exchange rate movement are, large, orderly. now, suppose event create external uncertainty, example, actually happen time kargil imposition sanction pokhran, oil crisis earlier. domestic stock bank deposit rupee india presently close us$ 290 billion, nearly three half time total reserves. at time kargil pokhran oil crises, multiple domestic deposit reserve fact several time high now. one imagine would happen external situation, within short period, domestic resident decide rush neighbourhood bank convert significant part deposit sterling, euro dollar. no emerge market exchange rate system cope kind contingency. this may unlikely possibility today, must factor decide long term policy free convertibility (cid:147)stock(cid:148) domestic assets. incidentally, kind eventuality le likely occur respect industrial country international currency euro dollar, hold banks, corporates, entity part long-term global asset portfolio (as distinguish emerge market currency bank intermediary normally take daily long short position purpose currency trade). another issue, figure prominently current debate, relate foreign exchange reserves. a well known, india(cid:146)s foreign exchange reserve increase substantially past year among one large world. the fact constituent india(cid:146)s balance payment show positive trend - current well capital account - reflection increase competitiveness indian economy strong confidence international community india(cid:146)s growth potential. for first time independence 56 year ago, fragility balance payment long concern policy makers. this highly positive development regard country large. nevertheless, two concern express expert commentator -

(cid:1)(cid:2)outside nri deposits, investment foreign institutional investor (fiis) debt fund subject overall cap $ 1 billion aggregate. in words, possibility arbitrage fiis respect pure debt fund limit low figure $ 1 billion (excluding investment mix equity debt funds). (cid:1)(cid:2)interest rate yield liquid security highly variable abroad well india, differential two rate change sharply within short time depend market expectations. it interest note yield 10 year treasury bill u.s. rise 4.4 per cent compare 5.6 per cent government bond similar maturity india end july 2003. take account forward premia dollar yield fluctuations, except brief period, likely little incentive send large amount capital india merely take advantage interest differential. on whole, likely external flow india motivate factor pure arbitrage. figure source reserve accretion available upto end last year (2002-03) confirm view. it also pertinent note domestic interest rate among industrial country also vary considerably. for example, japan, close zero. in u.k., 4 per cent, u.s. 1.5 per cent. there evidence capital move u.s. u.k. europe merely account interest differential. within certain low range, capital flow likely influence outlook growth inflation pure arbitrage even among industrial country full cac. another point forcefully put forward several expert context rise reserves, india use reserve increase investment development country rather keep liquid assets. it argue paradoxical develop country current capital account surplus, thereby add reserves, rather use foreign save enhance rate investment economy. in principle, point valid. there doubt present situation, maximum support give increase level investment, particularly infrastructure sector. it reason rbi recent period follow soft interest rate policy environment low inflation. however, time, must emphasize little rbi, (or, matter, government) directly use additional reserve investment. the equivalent rupee resource already release rbi recipient foreign exchange, equivalent rupee liquidity already created. the decision whether invest, consume deposit additional rupee resource lie recipients, rbi. by means, let u urge invest, much case point finger additional reserve (cid:147)cause(cid:148) low desirable level investment activity economy. let come last point, considerable present-day interest india context high rise reserves, easy liquidity, low interest rate weaken dollar, i.e., correct right policy stance management exchange rate india present environment? in rbi(cid:146)s periodic credit policy statements, well public statements, rbi highlight main pillar strategy management exchange rate. these are: rbi fix (cid:147)target(cid:148) exchange rate try defend pursue time; rbi prepare intervene market dampen excessive volatility necessary; rbi(cid:146)s purchase sale foreign currency undertake number bank generally bi review 36/2003 5 discreete smooth; market operation exchange rate movement should, principle, transaction-oriented rather purely speculative nature. it perhaps fair say actual result exchange rate policy follow rbi, since asian crisis particular, highly positive far. in addition sharp increase reserve generally (cid:147)orderly(cid:148) movement exchange rate low volatility, confidence level domestic foreign investor indian external sector policy strong. india(cid:146)s policy also describe imf (cid:147)comparable global best practices(cid:148) recent study 20 select industrial develop countries. interestingly, lead global news agency, international journal, recently describe india(cid:146)s currency model (cid:147)ideal(cid:148) asia. india one develop country set clear house dollar-rupee transaction concurrence federal reserve system, new york. in last months, however, dollar depreciate major currencies, rupee appreciate dollar (albeit slowly), number suggestion make expert others call shift rbi(cid:146)s exchange rate policies. there are, main, three alternative approach suggest consideration: (cid:1)(cid:2)one view advance several distinguish economists, include prof. kenneth rogoff imf recent visit india, rupee allow appreciate freely line market trends. accord view, strong case rbi(cid:146)s intervention reserve already high. rbi(cid:146)s purchase create substantial additional domestic liquidity, may destabilise long run. there also evidence, opinion, unconstrained appreciation volatility would affect growth prospect lead macro-economic problem. (cid:1)(cid:2)an exactly opposite view, which, among others, recently articulate important all-india industry association, rbi intervene aggressively market reduce degree appreciation. the main argument favour view india must maintain global (cid:147)competitiveness(cid:148), particularly relation china fix exchange rate dollar whose currency depreciate along it. (cid:1)(cid:2)a third view, recently put forward lead economic journal, among others, rbi pursue refer policy (cid:147)calculated volatility(cid:148). it argue present policy control volatility provide virtually risk-less gain market participant since rupee expect appreciate substantially continuously past months. accord view, order prevent excessive capital inflow period, rbi allow exchange rate (cid:147)overshoot(cid:148) quickly target exchange rate of, say, rs. 46.20 (or number) to, say, rs. 45.50. thereafter, allow rupee depreciate slowly, necessarily smoothly, target number period next months. in essence, proposal akin policy (announced unannounced) fix exchange rate within wide band. the rbi welcome current debate. reserves, present, certainly level enough meet foreseeable contingency. it also clear that, present period, capital inflow remittance strong, require continuous domestic liquidity management. in principle, therefore, would nice alternative viable exchange rate management system could put place would avoid excessive build-up reserve domestic liquidity and, time, maintain india(cid:146)s external competitiveness low inflation low interest rates. in theory, alternative approach merit. however, entirely clear put practice without cause substantial instability uncertainty possible emergence macro-economic problem bad try solve. an implicit assumption two alternative level which, initial fast appreciation, exchange rate either stabilise turn around. a implicit assumption level (whatever is) either already know become know market approached. rbi(cid:146)s past experience suggest assumption valid. it would recall period rupee exchange rate relatively volatile movement sharper. however, period sharp appreciation, instead inflow decline demand foreign currency rising, notice actual market behaviour 6 bi review 36/2003 opposite. the opposite true period sharp depreciation. exchange rate expectation momentum often self-fulfilling. there must, course, level expectation reverse. however, level, (cid:147)momentum(cid:148) trade imperfect thin market happen significantly line (cid:147)fundamentals(cid:148), considerable instability substantial overvaluation (or valuation) may result. such outcome may harm good continue confidence country(cid:146)s exchange rate system. the third suggestion hold rate current levels, allow appreciate further, even inflow strong, also likely unsustainable length time. it virtually amount adopt (cid:147)fixed(cid:148) near-fixed exchange rate system floor. past experience suggest system work well, east asia prior crisis, economy well inflow strong, come extreme pressure unfavourable domestic external developments. abandonment system (cid:147)fixed(cid:148) exchange rate (or system know floor) become unavoidable. such change, occur pressure, result considerable instability likely spread fairly long period. at end process, country option revert flexible exchange rate system. it mean mere coincidence country affect external crisis 1990s fix near-fixed exchange rate systems. china present exception rule view persistent trade surplus long period combine high level foreign direct investment. it certain long future situation prevail. in case, china(cid:146)s special characteristic difficult replicate emerge market low volume trade foreign investment. the desirability maintain the-overall competitiveness economy hardly questioned. however, long-run competitiveness economy need measure relation multiple currency basket, relation major trade partner reasonably long period time. exchange rate fluctuation among major currency everyday fact life, important entity foreign exchange exposure resort (cid:147)hedging(cid:148) appropriate risk management asset liabilities. on balance, benefit suggest alternative present system clear. the present system mean ideal one. however, like old cliche virtue democracy, probably good long run available alternatives. in view behavioural market complexity area, well multiple economic policy objectives, solution seem (cid:147)ex ante(cid:148) optimal may turn disastrous (cid:147)ex post(cid:148) - event - happen argentina recently east asia mexico year ago. nevertheless, i say ago, rbi welcome present debate. a contribution debate, i try deal relevant issues, indicate present view them. these view are, course, subject change light domestic international experience academic insights. we look forward deliberation hope benefit them. jarle bergo: crisis resolution financial stability norway speech mr jarle bergo, deputy governor norge bank (central bank norway), 50th anniversary bank indonesia, jakarta, 10 december, 2003. the reference chart pdf also find website norge bank. * * * yours excellencies, lady gentlemen. it great pleasure attend important conference conjunction 50th anniversary bank indonesia, opportunity share experience handle bank crisis colleague south east asia. the bank crisis norway early 1990s severe bank crisis asian country face late 1990s one neighbour country sweden finland experienced. in 1991 - peak crisis - bank loan loss amount 2.8 per cent gdp. in year non-performing loan account 9 per cent loan outstanding entire bank industry1. the correspond figure indonesia high 70 per cent, 33 per cent thailand, 18 per cent sweden2. nevertheless, doubt norwegian crisis systemic; 1991 three four large bank number small one fail deep financial trouble. in relatively short presentation, i concentrate main issue crisis resolution. thus, every stage development crisis recapitulated, every step detail resolution. nor i try reflect every nuance public debate, report parliamentary commission research paper subject3. the view i put forward deliberately sharpen promote discussion. the important characteristic resolution norwegian crisis summarize follows: • the banks’ collective guarantee fund handle problem bank sector crisis become systemic. • no blanket guarantee banks’ debt provide government. • no regulatory forebearance. • no liquidity support bank whose solvency doubt. • a clear transparent division responsibility political authorities, supervisory authority central bank establish early on. • government support contingent strict requirement met, e.g. exist shareholder accept write-down cover loss extent possible. • no micro-management banks. • measure take prevent support bank exploit situation vis-à-vis non-supported banks. • no asset management company “bad banks”. i shall comment issues, let briefly mention background crisis: 1 source: sandal (2004). 2 source: kane klingebiel (2002) norge bank. 3 interest reader refer moe, solheim vale (2004), norwegian official report (1992), wilse (1995), stortinget (1998). steigum (2004) set macroeconomic background implication bank crisis. bi review 58/2003 1 during 1984 1985, norwegian bank system deregulated. in new environment, bank start compete market shares. we saw huge increase bank lend which, couple general optimism (oil!) interest rate keep artificially low, create economic boom. however, neither bank manager supervisor much experience bank operate competitive credit market, pay sufficient attention banks’ risk exposure. a sharp fall price main export commodities, oil gas, need consolidate economy boom bring rampant inflation, lead recession late 1980s. in short, deregulation, lend boom, ensue recession set stage increase bank losses. the norwegian bank crisis evolve two stages: in first stage 1988 till 1990, several small medium bank failed. from 1990 - 1991, crisis become systemic. the three large commercial banks, account half market credit domestic non-financial sector, deep trouble. during first stage crisis, problem mostly handle banks’ guarantee funds. membership fund mandatory fund finance ex ante fee member banks. these fund wide mandate pay depositor closure fail bank. if liquidate fail bank pay depositor consider costly alternative recapitalizing bank provide guarantee financial support facilitate take-over, fund free so. however, end 1990, bank-owned fund effectively deplete almost capital become apparent large bank might also face problems. to make sure would still safety net present, government establish government bank insurance fund - gbif - early 1991. at time make clear fund public money might inject fail banks. the central bank might provide liquidity support solvency assured. the gbif give specific grant storting (parliament). the new fund could lend money banks’ guarantee fund enable recapitalize fail banks. later, crisis escalated, gbif permit recapitalize bank directly. in cases, strict condition attached. most often included: • management board director bank replace • exist share capital write cover loss full extent possible • bank’s operate cost reduce activity downsize • measure take restrain growth bank’s total assets. an example condition impose find chart 8. these condition course rather unattractive bank managers, board member shareholders. and part objective; management trouble bank strong incentive try solution approach gbif. for resort gbif, important aim force onto sound track business. curb activity bank receive capital gbif also imply competitive advantage bank rival bank receive kind support. in addition, value exist share capital bank would write accord bank’s losses. in case loss exceed exist share capital, entire capital would write zero. such decision would normally make banks’ general meetings. in order avoid stalemate majority meet object decision, storting one month early make amendment commercial bank act. this amendment entitle government royal decree write share capital bank loss audit interim accounts, shareholders’ general meet so. this authority use two instance shareholder refuse write bank’s share require gbif. shareholder one bank bring case courts, lost. 2 bi review 58/2003 that shareholder way force take bank’s loss tax payers’ money put table, mind imperative order muster necessary political support acceptance among electorate rescue operations. it hard imagine would possible support bank old manager shareholder allow maintain stake fail bank. the condition attach capital injection government bank insurance fund explicitly set write agreement bank gbif. this agreement make public. the bank require report regularly fund fulfilment term agreement. the gbif head decision-making board expert operation carry distance political authorities. however, gbif keep close contact financial supervisor central bank. the central bank also play part lender last resort bank recapitalized. general assurance give central bank would provide liquidity support sound financial institution (including non-banks). however, bank generally manage keep funding, resort central bank extraordinary extent. before gbif inject capital crisis-stricken banks, effort make attract private investors. however, effort succeed. experience show time recession high uncertainty investor extremely reluctant take risk. under circumstances, government source available support financial system. in way, government become “owner last resort”. in light high level uncertainty, fund gbif regard expense fiscal accounts, investment. in retrospect, however, capital supply government problem bank prove yield reasonable positive return. hence, might profitable investment private investors, although huge risk ex ante. to counteract generally low supply equity capital bank crisis, separate government bank investment fund set up. the fund intend take part equity emission (non-problem) bank commercial terms. certain form general support bank industry also provided. at peak, share state ownership bank sector close 60 percent. unlike many country deal bank crisis, norway set separate asset management company - “bad bank” - handle problem loans. there several reason choose this: • in none problem bank norway ratio non-performing loan consider magnitude would require much attention management bank would distract main goal - bring bank back profitability. • the bank know borrower best experience work default loans. handle loan always part large bank’s business, transfer employee expertise separate company might leave bank vulnerable encounter new problem loans. • set asset management company transfer bad loan bank would require complicate account legal work. in particular would difficult find fair price loan transferred. • the responsibility handle problem loan remain gain successful handle - banks. • last least; asset management company would finance government money. thus, taxpayers’ money would put risk. however, nothing prevent bank themselves, alone jointly, establish subsidiary handle bad loans. none choose so. bi review 58/2003 3 nor norwegian authority issue blanket guarantee banks’ liabilities. such guarantee create moral hazard problem actually lead bank problem future4. in addition, consider proper government take open-ended budget liability. nevertheless, crisis emerged, make clear minister finance norge bank measure necessary bolster confidence financial system would taken. no assurance give individual bank would rescued. in respect, probably bless government ownership commercial bank crisis. in end however, two small bank shut depositor pay back banks’ guarantee funds. by late 1993 - one year norway leave peg ecu start low interest rate - crisis effectively bank start earn normal profits. bank general come crisis much lean efficient before. the discount value gross fiscal cost resolution norwegian crisis resolution estimate 2.9 per cent gdp year end 1993. at time, net fiscal cost - adjust value government’s share bank - estimate 0.8 per cent gdp5. a refer above, whole period present positive return achieve capital invested. it might interest compare fiscal cost norway fiscal cost sweden crisis similar size relative size economy. look simple non-discounted sums, gross fiscal cost sweden 3.6 per cent gdp 1997. for norway, comparable figure 2 per cent6. part difference probably trace back sweden’s use government-financed asset management company part crisis resolution. however, bank crisis important cost society addition pure fiscal costs. some attempt make estimate cumulative effect bank crisis norway’s gdp. these estimate vary considerably low 9.8 per cent gdp high 27.1 per cent7. this wide variation illustrate methodological difficulty involve isolate effect bank crisis per se. no doubt economic cost crisis - however measure - would far large problem bank force close. insure depositor might lose much - although questionable - situation borrower might serious force repay loan early. give state norwegian economy time, find new bank will extend sufficient credit would doubt difficult - would probably experience severe credit crunch deepen recession8. the main purpose rescue operation prevent scenario become reality. bank receive capital injection government able continue normal bank lend bank operations. empirical study indicate credit condition firm borrow trouble bank bad borrower non-crisis banks.9 in 1994, government start sell share banks. at present government substantial share one three bank take crisis. the two others subsidiary danish nordic bank group respectively. fear foreign take-over, also large commercial bank, - least far - lead government opt remain important owner. when government part crisis resolution step owner last resort, intention usually get position bank prove profitable again. this probably 4 cf. kane klingebiel (2002). 5 source: st.meld. 39 (1993-94). 6 source: for sweden: jennergren näslund (1998). for norway: norge bank, moen (2003). 7 see hoggarth, real saporta (2002). 8 peek rosengren (2000) look loan supply shock face u.s. firm borrow japanese bank bank crisis japan. they identify substantial impact u.s. real estate activity supply shock. 9 see ongena, smith michalsen (2003) vale (2002). 4 bi review 58/2003 bi review 58/2003 5 good advice, delicate balance restore private ownership quickly try recover much possible government’s fiscal costs. the norwegian bank crisis handle swiftly transparently relatively low cost taxpayers. furthermore, bank come crisis trim operate cost establish much good system evaluate credit risks. in one respect, rather lucky compare others. the crisis build gradually, time ass situation strengthen defence financial system crisis become systemic. the banks’ equity capital provide first line defence banks’ collective guarantee fund second bank loss start soar. the third line defence - government bank insurance fund - establish evident first second line defence hold, nevertheless establish time. by large scholar seem agree resolution crisis norway fairly successful. but even was, right then, guarantee recipe successful future countries. in recognition avoid moral hazard, law establish government bank insurance fund repeal fund cease operations. even government capital injection large problem bank right resolution method early 1990s, far evident rescue operation would right method large bank fail future. however, i think possible identify principle adhere order increase chance success. the focus must save financial system, individual bank. with regard way fail bank handled, division responsibility various part government must clear, ten year ago. a then, owner first line shoulder losses. similarly, board top management responsible failure bank allow continue. hopefully all, banker authority alike, learn crisis. at central bank, strengthen surveillance soundness financial system (macro-prudential supervision). there also extensive exchange information supervisor bank insurance security commission. twice year, norge bank publish financial stability report risk present future solvency financial institution norway assessed. the aim detect first sign bank problem quickly possibly prevent escalate crisis. however, financial system evolve rapidly. tomorrow’s problem could easily different past. today, large part bank industry part nordic bank groups. this raise question whether model crisis resolution base national consideration would work. in light challenge, nordic central bank issue memorandum understand set principle establishment structure crisis management handle information pan-nordic bank problems. nevertheless, emergence multinational bank group raise question whether bank may “too big save”. another difference early 1990s government’s one-third ownership large bank. in term crisis resolution, probably complication. bank crisis occur irregular interval long bank existed. and could happen again. we need vigilant alert macro prudential supervision, will consider new approach crisis resolution lessen impact new financial crisis. thank attention. peter nicholl:

since time average short term lend rate august 2003 10.43% average long term lend rate 9.33%. june year first time interest data shift single digit interest rate since start collect data. i expect downward trend interest rate continue. i briefly list main change bring improvement bh bank sector about: payment system reform the cash payment system unify km become dominant, almost sole, currency use bh. in non-cash payment area, old state-owned centralize system monopoly close early 2001. it replace modern european-type system two clear houses, rtgs one giro one, own operate central bank. payment conduct commercial banks. the supplier use put similar system place nine european countries. but do quickly bh anywhere else show possible implement large, technical project bh successfully. it operate smoothly effectively since 5 january 2001. minimum capital requirement these requirement substantially increase series step initial km 2.5 million km 15 million begin 2003. this force bank merge find strategic partners. this, plus increase competition, lead sharp reduction number bank bh. in 1997, 76 register bank bh 1997 extremely small. at present 38 register bank bh. but consolidation bh bank system already go number indicates. for example, around 65% total deposit already four large bank group large 10 bank around 85% total deposits. the number register bank therefore reduce next year consolidation continues. bi review 58/2003 5 inter-entity bank it become possible 2001 bank register one entity operate branch entity. most large bank already follow. we say bank sector, bh single economic space. deposit insurance a deposit insurance scheme start 2001. it cover deposit approve bank km 5,000. this also help return citizens’ confidence bank qualify. initially, two agency established, one entity. but 2002, merge state deposit insurance agency. at present, 18 bank meet standard require member dia. but bank need meet standard near future face risk lose bank license. foreign bank a number foreign bank commence operation bh, particularly last two years. increase foreign competition already good bh economy. it give depositor choice force local

introductory remark mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 12 december 2003. * * * the national bank decide leave target range three-month libor rate unchanged 0.0%-0.75%. for time being, three-month libor keep around 0.25%. in past two years, react decline economic activity upward trend swiss franc considerably relax monetary policy. now sign economic recovery switzerland intensifying. the upswing yet assured, though. at time, inflation potential small. for reason, adhere expansionary monetary policy keep attractiveness swiss franc investments. we estimate economy grow slightly 1.5% 2004, moderate decline economic activity expect current year. if monetary policy remain unchanged, average annual inflation likely amount 0.4% come year, 1.0% 2005 2.3% 2006. we opinion price stability maintain tighten monetary policy late point time. in following, i shall first focus economic activity switzerland new inflation forecast. this follow discussion monetary policy. finally, i shall elaborate new national bank law. economic activity in switzerland, turnaround economic development emerge third quarter 2003. real gdp exceed previous quarter’s level first time since third quarter 2002. nevertheless, still fell short year-earlier level. the swiss economy recover largely line expectation communicate september assessment situation. the recovery attributable pickup global economic activity, low interest rate generally favourable exchange rate conditions. this benefit primarily exports, rise markedly third quarter. equipment investment, too, pick slightly follow long phase decline. private government consumption continue stabilise effect. the economic situation switzerland improve next months. we expect export continue develop favourably, couple robust increase equipment investment. in way, economic upswing switzerland become increasingly broad-based strengthened. in course 2004, unemployment also fall, lead pickup private consumption. on average, moderate decline economic activity record current year, 2004, already stated, expect economy grow slightly 1.5%. this will, however, yet suffice close production gap. production capacity therefore still fully utilise come year. even though overall prospect clearly improved, situation number industry remain difficult. there still risk economic upswing country may short-lived. a delay global economic recovery next quarters, unfavourable development financial market grow geopolitical tension could jeopardise economic pickup switzerland. overall, however, cyclical risk today significantly balance even month ago. it thus rule recovery set fast expect. inflation forecast i shall turn late development inflation new inflation forecast. annual inflation (inflation rate compare previous year) measure national consumer price index show extremely stable development time. in august, rise 0.2 percentage point 0.5%, remain november. this stability attributable evenly spread price increase domestic goods. inflation import good distinctly volatile wake fluctuate oil prices. the core inflation rate calculate national bank currently amount 0.6%. bi review 58/2003 1 the graph show inflation forecast september 2003 (the dash-dotted green curve graph) well new forecast december 2003 (dashed red curve). the assumption new forecast rest differ various respect september. for one thing, growth unite state markedly high current year anticipate three month ago. with present fiscal stimulus long factor, however, economic growth likely slow distinctly next year remain robust. we still anticipate upswing eu come year. it probable, however, take slightly long close output gap assume recently september. inflationary pressure abroad thus remain moderate although inflation country recede markedly either come year expect three month ago. furthermore, anticipate decline price oil approximately usd 25 per barrel course 2004. on assumption three-month libor rate remain stable 0.25% next three years, inflation average 0.4% 2004, 1.0% 2005 2.3% 2006. the inflation trend accord new forecast exceed september forecast mid-2005. until end 2004, inflation likely remain fairly stable around 0.5% fluctuate slightly due basis effects. the new forecast show threat negative inflation rate diminished. this result improvement global economy le mark decline inflation abroad, also weak swiss franc vis-à-vis euro. a begin 2005, inflation show rise trend due expansionary monetary policy take assumption. in mid-2005, reach 1%, mid-2006 2% near end 2006 rate 3%. this increase little flat forecast september. it rest notion next year output gap narrow somewhat slowly predict september due productivity gain upswing expect bring. from mid-2006 onwards, forecast inflation long lie within range national bank equate price stability. it must, however, note that, always, forecast base unchanged three-month libor rate, i.e. assumption monetary policy remain expansive next three years. it also important understand uncertainty forecast increase length forecast horizon. continuation expansionary monetary policy in past two years, change strongly expansionary monetary policy. in doing, react rapidly unequivocally deterioration economic situation upward pressure swiss franc. the favourable development inflation provide u necessary leeway interest rate cut implemented. between march july, swiss franc weaken considerably vis-à-vis euro, economy gradually begin gain momentum again. the expansionary monetary policy accompany grow monetary aggregates. the strong increase money stocks, not, however, present significant risk price stability present time. for one thing, credit creation bank continue slow-moving. for another, growth money stock considerably influence portfolio shifts, likely reverse economic activity accelerate interest rate begin rise. we shall, however, continue keep careful eye development. a already stated, still certain risk economic development sustained. the upswing switzerland jeopardise premature changeover restrictive monetary policy. we shall therefore continue expansionary monetary policy way bolster economic recovery. we convince shall sufficient time keep inflation within bind price stability tighten monetary policy late point time. should possible mark appreciation swiss franc vis-à-vis euro threaten cause undesirable tighten monetary conditions, would take decisive action. 2 bi review 58/2003 inflation forecast december 2003

conference - 2003, mumbai, 12 december 2003. * * * the promise low transaction costs, increase sale productivity, convenient service lure bank set new delivery channels. earlier, vast brick mortar branch network consider inherent advantage establish bank new entrant huge disadvantage vis-à-vis establish player term customer reach. however, post 1990s new player effectively take branch network advantage establish player optimally leverage technology cost-effective delivery channels. the goal banks’ senior management turn today’s “all thing people” branch network highly differentiate system delivery multiple products. the foundation create delivery channel superior insight customer behaviour. these come many forms, basic entail understand customer need delivery different products, need vary customer type (including small businesses), current customer behaviour (especially relate channel usage), customer profitability. it multifaceted understand customer yield actionable implication distribution strategy. although bank may invest heavily new delivery channels, success sustainability channel critically lie ability convert investment low distribution costs. the step follow make new distribution channel successful: a) understand customers’ current channel/transaction behaviour underlie attitude; b) use sophisticate experimental customer research ass economic impact tactic design change behaviour; c) develop integrate channel migration plan blend economic non-economic incentive ensure right initiative target right customers; d) protect sale effectiveness utilize ability non-branch channel select amongst prospect differentiate market message; e) design non-branch channel emphasize personalize interaction counteract decrease loyalty among remote customers; f) develop track mechanism allow ass revise migration strategy ongoing basis. turn attention delivery channel use bank india, comparison international counterparts, observe bank yet exploit delivery channel maximum extent technology permits. increase off-site delivery channel lead new product development, speed transaction process reduction transaction costs. in india major issue new technology relate delivery channel impact process information, lie core bank business. inspite advantages, reliance technology base delivery channel often exacerbate traditional risks: operational risk (since require change procedures), reputational risk (if bank fail deliver secure, accurate timely service) legal risk (uncertainty legislation apply e-banking transactions), besides emergence risk (business credit risks). atm still remain successful delivery channel follow telephone bank internet banking. with 9000 off-site on-site atm installed, bank effectively reach large customer base substantially low cost. typically, cost close rs.50 per transaction conduct branch do atm cost rs.15. in order reduce cost transaction bank start out-sourcing share atm service trend gather momentum near future. a delivery channel gain mass acceptability user friendly, bank use cross-sell well others’ products. for example, bank already start dispense railway tickets, movie ticket atms. in future bank’s atm would function like kiosk deliver non-cash transactions, thereby simultaneously reduce fix operate cost atm. bi review 57/2003 1 2 bi review 57/2003 internet banking-an emerge delivery channel-offers significant cost advantage banks. a net-based transaction cost bank around rs. 4 cost per transaction even low atm, mainly due save prohibitive real estate costs. internet bank fail take due

impediment adoption internet bank india. with drastic fall cell phone tariff emergence seamless connectivity fix mobile lines, mobile bank set emerge one cost-effective delivery channel near future. toll-free-numbers would also gain popularity important delivery channel. although bank abroad use call centre delivery channel time, bank india begin exploit effective non-branch delivery channel. the banker take comprehensive view delivery channels. till delivery channel view term cost technology. delivery channel devise focus mainly time place advantage customers. however, continue advance wireless technology, flexibility delivery channel device would forte banks. successful adoption wireless technology would help bank offer time, anywhere, also device banking. further, bank build integrate delivery channel vertical horizontal integration. in order bank install enable compatible multi-channel platform support seamlessly integrate exist future delivery channels. in today’s

security stock exchange mauritius address mr r basant roi, governor bank mauritius, official launch ceremony introduction government security stock exchange mauritius, port louis, 12 december 2003. * * * lady gentleman good afternoon it great pleasure address afternoon occasion official launch ceremony introduction government security stock exchange mauritius. it great pleasure still see government security finally find way stock exchange several timid attempt make past. indeed bank mauritius strive decade develop secondary market government papers. in november 1992 bank start weekly auction treasury bill strategy development secondary market devised. it remain paper-strategy find way through. in february 1994, bank make second attempt. a secondary market cell set in-house view kicking-off, determination, development secondary market government papers. this in-house cell initially expect play market-making role. commercial bank respond positively initiative. the market take off. broke eventually invite participant play decisive role endeavour. the strategy bank well received. it appeal brokers. a result miscarriages, in-house secondary market cell labour routine operations. in december 1998, bank mauritius start sale treasury bill over-the-counter individual non-financial corporations. one important objective initiative let individual stratum population familiarize treasury bill investment instrument. this initiative trigger competition deposit resource bank industry. individual investor derive experience treasury bill investment instrument. the sale bill over-the-counter bank success. investment bill reach peak rs4 billion. some 11,000 individual financial corporation invest bills. pursue objective eventually take government paper trade stock exchange mauritius, bank mauritius established, effective 1 february 2002, primary dealer system. at weekly auction treasury bill four banks, mauritius commercial bank ltd., state bank mauritius ltd, hsbc, barclays bank plc., appoint primary dealers. the bank mauritius decide traditional bidder bill weekly auction would gradually crop out. between february 2002 november 2003 transaction primary dealer bank amount rs1.9 billion. their transaction corporate body amount rs10.8 billion. with individual transaction amount rs1.6 billion. these give total amount rs14 billion worth bill transact primary dealers. this value transaction bill reflect potential exist trade government paper stock exchange. so far number eligible bidder weekly auction hold bank mauritius primary dealer reduce around 250 11. over time primary dealer eligible bid weekly auctions. institutional investor like national pension fund, national save fund remain bank financial institution require purchase government paper secondary market. this would definitely require major change investment decision-making process within organizations. they would stand gain medium-term. sometime may last i initiate

bank mauritius glad so. may i wish stakeholder best success. toshihiko fukui: recent economic financial development japan speech mr toshihiko fukui, governor bank japan, meet fukuoka, 8 december 2003. * * * i. the current economic situation route sustainable growth largely line standard scenario outlook risk assessment economy price publish end october, japan’s economy start recover gradually, period generally flat economic activity last around summer. with corporate earn improving, business fix investment continue gradual recovery. against backdrop improvement overseas economies, exports, flat summer, start turn upward. production, whose recovery somewhat delay due unusually cool summer, start increase recently. the fact rise export business fix investment lead recovery production suggest cyclical momentum recovery kick in, japanese economy last settle onto recovery path. from second half fiscal 2003 fiscal 2004, moderate recovery expect continue. export production likely continue increase background high growth unite state asia, particularly china, recovery global demand it-related goods. in europe, become apparent economy bottom out. there great probability increase export production promote business fix investment along improvement corporate earnings. the pace recovery likely contain moderate clip, consider ongoing structural adjustment pressure well favorable prospect employment income. the corporate sector, especially non-manufacturing, still suffer excess debt. with clear sign improvement employment income, personal consumption expect continue follow generally flat trend. it quite time eliminate word “moderate” description current recovery. after decrease constantly five half years, consumer price index exclude fresh food, refer core cpi, increase 0.1 percent year-on-year october. this partly due hike rice price cause unusually cool summer, addition factor rise medical treatment cost tobacco tax. although core cpi may fluctuate due temporary factors, underlie trend expect slight decline rest fiscal 2003 throughout fiscal 2004 since aggregate demand project remain short potential supply capacity. naturally, standard scenario entail various uncertainties, term risk factors. among them, pay particular attention global demand it-related goods, u.s. economy, domestic financial system, financial market developments. these risk factor may cause japanese economy deviate standard scenario lay outlook risk assessment, either upward downward. to overcome deflation return sustainable growth path, cyclical recovery alone sufficient. structural problem must deal with, expectation high growth must formed. we need address excess debt corporate sector weakness financial system. we need raise expectation growth among firm households, seek new value added, may translate brisk spending. in corporate sector, steady effort made, stretch 10 years, solve problem excess debt labor. in fact, large manufacturer largely succeed eradicate excesses. a break-even point lowered, ratio current profit sale firm improve high level since burst bubble. some manufacturer aggressively pursue improvement productivity invest newly grow business construct efficient international division labor. spread movement throughout corporate sector, include non-manufacturers small bi review 57/2003 1 medium-sized firms, one key factor enhance expectation growth generally reinvigorate japan’s economy. ii. conduct monetary policy the bank japan continue provide ample liquidity, target outstanding balance current account deposit bank quantitative ease policy. since begin year, target significantly raise twice, april may, light risk factor war iraq severe acute respiratory syndrome. furthermore, october, bank raise upper limit range target balance current account deposits. this intend reinforce nascent recovery enhance flexibility money market operation provide liquidity market. with economy incipient recovery phase concomitant uncertainties, potential subtle fluctuation expectation market participant change fund needs. the bank seek respond flexibly market operation possible change sorts, reinforce current stir recovery. the outstanding balance current account deposit stand around 30 trillion yen, rise around 20 trillion yen begin year. the bank conduct market operation center balance carefully monitor daily market conditions. in order help effect monetary ease provision ample liquidity permeate whole economy, bank take measure strengthen transmission mechanism monetary policy corporate finance. in august, bank begin purchase asset-backed security collateralize asset mainly relate small medium-sized firms. the bank recently decide accept syndicate loan eligible collateral. in addition immediate monetary policy implications, measure also contribute, long run, establish new shape corporate finance, good compatible japan’s future economy. we hope initiative act trigger, spur private sector explore various new market-based fund channel supplement traditional bank lend channel. iii. enhance transparency conduct monetary policy there two point pivotal importance conduct monetary policy. one implement effective policy timely manner. the provide public lucid explanation promote understand bank’s evaluation economic price development well think upon base policy decisions. the new bank japan law stipulate bank, give independence conduct monetary policy discretion, must make effort accountable decision. we think great public understand think behind monetary policy, effective monetary policy be. bear point mind, bank make two major decision enhance transparency monetary policy monetary policy meet october. first, measure take provide public lucid explanation bank’s evaluation economic price development timely manner. in addition semiannual report outlook risk assessment economy price april october, bank decide carry interim assessment economic price development january july, release result discussion accordingly. these interim assessment design investigate possible deviation economic price development standard scenario present outlook risk assessment three month before. second, bank publish detail description commitment maintain quantitative ease policy. the bank already commit maintain current policy core cpi register stable year-on-year rate increase zero percent above. in october, decide clarify mean phrase “registers stably zero percent increase year-on-year” concrete manner. specifically, quantitative ease continue follow two condition met. 2 bi review 57/2003 first, must recently publish core cpi register year-on-year rate increase zero percent above, tendency must confirm months. second, year-on-year rate increase prospective core cpi must expect register zero percent below. in words, majority policy board member need make forecast core cpi register year-on-year rate increase great zero percent forecast period. this forecast period roughly year start april april outlook risk assessment, roughly year half, second half current financial year start october whole next financial year end march, october outlook risk assessment. the two condition necessary conditions. however, also announce may case bank judge appropriate continue quantitative ease even condition fulfilled. since announcement, receive question detail description commitment. let answer two major questions. the first question bank carry interim assessment economic price development every month. since economy change constantly, perhaps, theoretically speaking, carry interim assessment every month, even every week. against theoretical possibility, judge appropriate outlook risk assessment interim assessment release roughly every three month light objective present basic view economy develop reasonable period time. we cannot revise basic view economy price appropriate manner without sufficient accumulation critical data. also may confuse market release assessment base insufficient data change assessment frequently. actually, many central bank abroad release monetary policy report inflation report every three months. this not, course, imply bank make policy change every three months. although conduct basic evaluation roughly every three months, need closely examine ever-changing state economy price carefully deliberate need policy change every monetary policy meeting. a always case, need arises, bank adjust policy timely appropriate manner, regardless frequency time release outlook risk assessment interim assessments. the second question concern risk detail description commitment maintain quantitative ease policy may affect bank’s ability conduct monetary policy flexible timely manner future. it may natural ask question, extremely unusual central bank link future policy conduct particular economic indicator, core cpi case japan. while pay due attention kind risk, come conclusion that, number obstacle still confront japan’s economy seek overcome deflation settle onto solid recovery path, detail description commitment necessary current time. this detail description manifestation strong determination regard future conduct monetary policy. iv. current state financial system on whole, current state financial system japan remain severe. it noted, however, financial institutions, especially major banks, effort improve financial condition gradually begin bear fruit. for financial year end september, profitability improve significantly major banks, except resona group, receive injection public funds. this mostly thank successful reduction major bank loss nonperforming loan disposals, year-on-year basis end september 2003. these reduction partly due large capital increase high provision previous financial year end march 2003. after register record high end march 2002, amount outstanding nonperforming loan continue decrease progress make removal nonperforming loan balance sheets. bi review 57/2003 3 major bank improve stability profitability reduce shareholdings, blame large fluctuation profits. in fact, banks’ shareholding decrease level well tier 1 capital end september. to strengthen profitability, major bank make effort cut cost increase fee incomes. these effort gradually begin reflect financial results. move condition surround regional financial institutions, let first touch recent case ashikaga bank. last month, ashikaga bank inform government negative net worth end september, risk suspend repayment deposits. consider significant financial role play ashikaga bank region, include tochigi prefecture, government judge serious disruption financial system region might occur measure taken. the prime minister summon financial system management council, i member, decide upon temporary nationalization ashikaga bank, pursuant article 102 deposit insurance law end last month. a temporarily nationalize bank, ashikaga bank continue normal operations, bank’s obligations, include deposit interbank borrowings, meet smoothly. a new management team carry appropriate business operations, seek transfer business assume financial institution soon possible. a part process, bank japan provide liquidity, include extension special loan pursuant article 38 bank japan law necessary. fortunately, present, regional financial institution face condition comparable severity. in fact, financial statement end september 2003 show improvement regional financial institution loss disposal nonperforming loan reduced. regional financial institutions, however, seem lag behind major bank address tasks, appropriately evaluate economic value nonperforming loans, make provision accordingly, work toward corporate revitalization. while land price continue decline, small medium-sized nonmanufacturing firms, dominate regional economies, find business recover gradually. in difficult circumstances, increasingly hop regional financial institution play active role. we bank much support effort regard, supervision means, whenever occasion present itself. v. issue 2004 2004 final year preparation removal blanket protection demand deposit april 2005. this removal, view, perceive simply adjustment extent deposit insurance protection applicable. rather, recognize last hurdle management financial institution become truly independent regulatory authorities. at end march 2005, major bank expect reduce nonperforming loan ratio half autumn 2002 levels. at time, industrial revitalization corporation japan cease purchase loan assets. from april 2005, fix asset impairment account rule introduced. firm continue strengthen business structure competitiveness. initiative base private sector’s creativity vitality drive force japan achieve steady economic growth global competition. together firms, financial institution also play important role support japanese economy. dynamic expansion economy possible financial institution remain dependent regulatory authority generous safety nets. not firm also financial institution confront frequent new entry withdrawal market, well consolidation reorganization respective industries. this make critical financial institution demonstrate firm intention stand feet, enhance credibility market. in regard, let point major task address 2004. in order achieve reform economic structure sound financial system rapidly, financial institutions, especially major banks, must work hard firm revitalize corporate sector, expedite disposal nonperforming loans. it true financial institution already establish subsidiary specialize corporate revitalization. further efforts, however, still require area 4 bi review 57/2003 bi review 57/2003 5 effective use industrial revitalization corporation japan resolution collection corporation. in corporate revitalization, regional financial institution basically face problem major banks. there borrower firm competitive technology expertise, find difficult improve profitability financial legacy past borrowing. for reason, strategically important issue many regional financial institution address include provision detail consultation service borrower firms, extension great assistance borrower firms, prompt realization business revival. we hope effort bear fruit. financial institution also important role play help corporate sector develop new business underpin japan’s future economy, time support ail business firms. regional financial institution particular expect play active role generate new business region. we observe first shoot new regional business variety areas: biotechnology advance technologies, new industrial cluster link recycle environment-related technologies, well regional city revival, sightseeing, medical care, nurse services. to strengthen trends, regional financial institution expect play new role regions. in regard, think behind business decision-making past need radically overhauled. for example, decision whether assume particular risk base close examination nature project hand rather depend unduly traditional collateral guarantee-based methods. they also raise level expertise provide advisory service relate smooth management projects. this turn lead revitalization regional financial institution themselves. once blanket protection demand deposit removed, financial institution long able count support authorities. in principle, rely entirely intellectual resource creativity deal task face them, include nonperforming loan problem. it conceivable, however, may financial institutions, keen rebuild financial base, may able strengthen capital position within limit time frame without outside assistance. to deal possibility, injection public fund may execute without reference systemic risk consider apart measure stipulate article 102 deposit insurance law. i aware variety learn opinion call caution establish another system capital injections. bear opinion mind, i hope somehow manage find way design appropriate new framework - one function last public support effort private sector. in closing, let reiterate determination support effort private sector exert full achieve sustainable growth. villy bergström: can best again? the importance capital formation long-term growth speech mr villy bergström, deputy governor sverige riksbank, meet kiruna, 8 december 2003. * * * i would like begin thank invitation come speak local group center business policy studies. i intend speak today factor affect country’s long-term growth capacity. to end, i focus role play regard capital formation, also discus important factor change labour supply age structure population come years. like many countries, sweden face problem age population. this go place great burden public finance entail increase demand work population forgo consumption favour support elderly. meanwhile, labour force growth sweden slow year ahead. moreover, rate net investment sweden low comparison previous periods. this affect sweden’s long-term growth capacity thereby also prosperity people general. it topic i shall concentrate speech today. but allow first begin word riksbank’s role context. the riksbank little opportunity influence sweden’s long-term growth capacity a everyone knows, one riksbank’s statutory remit promote price stability. a large part riksbank’s operation revolve around remit. in order successful regard, important process wage formation work well central local government manage finance responsible manner. relatively stable inflation recent year expectation future inflation around riksbank’s target 2 per cent indicate bank successful conduct monetary policy recent years. this success largely attributable increase stability economic policy general; particular, fiscal policy govern ceiling central government expenditure surplus target public finances. furthermore, partly result great credibility riksbank’s inflation target, social partner manage halve rate wage increase level common 1970s 1980s. these circumstance form environment riksbank act recent years. the point give riksbank’s objective price stability high priority economic policy stable economic environment foster economic growth high employment. the experience begin 1970s 20 year thereafter indicate high inflation, devaluation fuel economic growth follow austerity measure prevent overheating, entail weak productivity growth drop standard live compare industrialise nations. the riksbank help create favourable environment rapid economic growth growth must come source monetary policy. nevertheless, riksbank every reason take interest source economic growth since fast growth facilitate riksbank’s task. this task involve tighten ease monetary policy regulate demand, keep even pace country’s growth capacity. in way inflation stabilised. a high potential rate growth allow scope high aggregate demand without give rise inflationary pressures. long-term growth demand the riksbank distinguish two concept growth: potential growth demand-driven growth. potential growth rate growth sustainable long term, take account resource growth economy effectively resource employed. thus, could say potential growth determine combination labour force growth, investment activity scientific technological progress. the latter determine efficiently labour force capital utilised. none fundamental factor influence riksbank temporarily. the riksbank’s work is, however, affect potential growth. the high bi review 56/2003 1 long-term sustainable rate growth, easy u balance aggregate demand economy coincide available household consumption, business investment need public sector. so monetary policy cannot raise potential growth rate but, bad case scenario, witness 1970s 1980s, worsen chance attain high potential growth rate affect demand economy wrong way. consequently, abstract level, “formula” economic growth simple. it weight sum labour force growth capital growth well technological progress. however, compare growth different countries, interest note country high growth labour force grow fast. it standard live interest improve population labour force growing. the important issue instead quickly country’s production grow per caput lead u concept productivity broad sense. for productivity - production per capita. it measure per inhabitant, per employee per hour worked. the concept closely related. one interest observation unite states’ rapid growth recent year attributable mainly high labour force growth. productivity unite states, however, fast sweden. during first half 1990s, swedish productivity growth among vigorous world, result increase prosperity swedish citizens. during 1950s 1960s, productivity growth sweden increase further. this partly due considerable reconstruction need follow second world war robust demand result this. in addition, trade liberalise period lead stiff competition, - - capital formation rapid. the favourable productivity growth year further sweden’s prosperity. in 1970, sweden fourth place oecd league term gdp per capita, mean one four rich country world. during period followed, however, productivity growth appreciably slow widely know 1970s 1980s bad period sweden. today, sweden find 17th place oecd league average industrialise countries. what cause decline then? it may relevant look reason behind sweden’s weak growth 20 year mid 1990s. these mistake need avoid future. when i discus unsuccessful period sweden i mainly focus productivity since measure determine standard living. we somewhat modify growth formula i mention earlier. the basic growth mechanism standard living, i.e. labour productivity, become weight sum capital growth per caput technological progress. give constant age structure population, evenly balance age pyramid, basic formula growth standard live also express weight sum capital growth per employee technological progress (a complication i return late age structure constant). capital formation contribute low productivity growth sweden why go badly sweden 1970s 1980s? first, note majority industrialise nation suffer drop productivity growth begin 1970s. this due supply shock associate first oil crisis, price oil tripled, follow second oil crisis end 1970s price increase threefold time high level. a know, price oil affect many part economy. oil use energy transport heat purpose price therefore direct impact cost these. moreover, firms’ cost affect since oil product often use intermediate input in, example, different plastic products. so country encounter problem due oil supply shock, productivity growth decline sweden countries. many explanation put forward this. social benefit improve time. compensation sick leave raise qualify day abolished. furthermore, legislation introduce job security co-determination workplace. many believe firms’ cost rise production disrupt sick leave kind leaf absence also introduced. these factor difficult ass likely contributed. at time oil price shock, swedish economy also hit domestic cost crisis result decline production. in spite this, firm retain employee great extent countries, lead low growth labour productivity. 2 bi review 56/2003 moreover, mid 1970s, dramatic change capital formation, undoubtedly explain slowdown productivity growth. of course, capital growth turn result variety economic condition enterprise public sector, include mention earlier. for part speak investment activity country gross terms. this concept also include investment need replace depreciation occur production. when exclude part gross investment make compensate depreciation, leave net investment. net investment new addition capital already employ production form plant, machinery buildings. so, regard net investment, word contribution capital formation, halve percentage gdp mid 1970s. this mean two things. first, capital growth per employee, per hour worked, fell. for number years, investment drop much capital per employee business sector actually declined. in words, employee work le capital. in order illustrate capital per employee means, take extreme example, namely lone worker accomplish dig spade iron bar compare hydraulic excavator. the latter represent considerably capital per employee dig spade, well substantially le physical effort worker. therefore, expect productivity growth fall capital per employee declines. but also another indirect effect. with new capital, new technology introduce production process. investment mean put new technology research practical production. through investment, new method new technology usher production processes. for reason, expect le technological progress production capital formation falls. an excavator much large number spades; represent entirely new technology affect whole production process. figure 1 show capital formation, net investment percentage gdp, fell mid 1970s - around 15 per cent gdp 5 per cent. so growth capital per employee slow mid 1970s, new technology employ extent before. such dramatic change consequences. this evident bottom curve show current account, almost always deficit 20 year 1975 sweden’s save decline even investment. it first half 1990s surplus restored, result weak krona, high capital formation even high saving. figure1. saving, investment(net) currentaccount, percentageof

56/2003 3 in order illustrate importance low capital formation, i compile productivity data period mark change take place (see table 1). in 1980s, low capital growth established. capital per employee - capital intensity - halve industry business sector whole. productivity growth follow trend halve high growth level 1960s. this mean value work perform decreased, scope high real wages. table 1. capital intensity productivity growth industry business sector capital/ employee productivity capital/ employee productivity 1963-70 8.3% 7.6% 6.5% 5.3% 1970-80 6.3% 3.4% 6.2% 3.2% 1980-86 2.8% 3.2% 3.0% 2.0% source: own calculation the previous diagram also show level capital formation relation total resource 1960s return fluctuation large mid 1970s. on average remain approximately one-third level resource previously allocate new capital. one difference save increased, investment. this mean export capital. despite continuation relatively low capital formation, weak trend see total swedish labour productivity recent year break first half 1990s productivity growth increased. but factor capital formation contribute this. among things, economic crisis begin 1990s lead substantial rationalisation measure wind low-productivity operations, result increase productivity growth also high unemployment. during period, also shift swedish economic policy order create condition sustainable long-term economic growth. this shift fiscal monetary policy lead increase stability predictability, likely enhance efficiency economy. moreover, tax social security system reformed. sweden’s entry eu’s single market together deregulation several important market also entail stiff competition. furthermore, fast growth private sector compare public sector, well evolution ict sector second half 1990s, likely contribute high productivity growth. against background low capital formation since 1970s, however, worth ask prospect swedish growth year ahead. will able regain previously prominent position comparatively rich industrialise nation? what low level capital formation imply sweden’s chance recapture lead position among industrialise nation begin 1970s? it important note structure business sector changed. the industrial sector whole, include basic industries, mining, ironwork steelworks, paper pulp, decrease proportion gdp favour expand service industries. basic industries’ share fall 6.5 per cent gdp 1970 4 per cent today, service production business sector increase approximately 30 per cent gdp 40 per cent period. we therefore move away capital-intensive production production dependent human capital heavy plant machinery. another factor take account decline house construction, also contribute drop figure capital formation. however, house construction importance productivity growth industrial investment, example. this mean dramatic decline capital formation imply equivalent fall productivity growth. nevertheless, i still impression focus le capital formation before. this indicate fact structural change currently relatively limited. 4 bi review 56/2003 the labour supply permit discus component determine country’s long-term growth capacity besides productivity, namely labour supply. this determine number people work number hour work. the number hour work rise year crisis begin 1990s. this partly due great demand labour, rise work age population (20-64 years) relatively low number sick leave. the trend number hour work break recent years, however. this total number people sick leave rise sweden since 1997-1998. accord common measurement methods, sweden high incidence sick leave eu. there also increase work absence due holiday leaf absence well decrease overtime additional work hours. meanwhile, labour market make satisfactory use immigrant population sweden. the employment rate among group markedly low among native swedes. in addition, accord statistic sweden, population growth year ahead le favourable labour force perspective now. the number people work age indeed continue rise increasingly small amount. this number people enter retirement year ahead rise sharply. in particular, large number 1940s generation start retire years. this could negative impact potential growth. over come 10-year period, number people 65 year age estimate rise 270 000 - 1.6 per cent per year average. between 2012 2030, group increase around 1.3 per cent per year. the number people work age forecast rise 170 000 come 10-year period, i.e. approximately 0.3 per cent per year. between 2012 2030, increase work age population estimate average 0.05 per cent per year, effect amount stagnation. in all, mean measure need take boost supply labour year ahead. these could achieve reduce number sick leave few people take early retirement. the trend also imply great demand people enter work life early age increase labour force participation among elderly. moreover, currently unutilised labour force reserve form immigrant population. the employment rate among group average 30 per cent low native swedes. measure improve integration immigrant labour market could make positive contribution labour supply. for example, growth number hour work could 0.4 percentage point high per year 2008 government’s target halve sick leave attained. furthermore, labour reserve represent immigrant population utilised, number hour work could rise further. if reserve utilise extent native swedes, number hour work could rise additional 0.1 percentage points. this would positive impact potential growth. heavy burden public finance a i mention initially, important monetary policy wage formation process efficient central local government manage finance satisfactory way. the change population’s age structure year ahead challenge future potential growth. it also implications. for instance, population trend mean proportion people 65 year old increase 17 per cent today 23 per cent 2030. at time, work age population decrease 59 54 per cent period. this imply work age population sweden support increasingly large proportion young elderly. at present, person work age support 0.70 people work - words, young old. by 2030, forecast person work age support 0.84 people, represent rise dependency burden 20 per cent. the whole increase dependency burden due retirement large number specific generations, 1940s generation year 2005-2015 1960s generation year around 2030, time average life expectancy expect increase. so take elderly account, bi review 56/2003 5 person work age today support 0.29 people 65 year older. by 2030, forecast rise 0.42. so problem see today public sector’s finance trifle compare await u nothing done. the population’s age structure entail great demand welfare service thereby heavy burden public finances. in addition, small supply labour resultant low level production mean drop receipt government. however, problem would increase even event even population growth. the structural shift imply ever large production service also problem context. worker service sector demand wage part population despite considerably slow productivity growth compare industrial sector, expose competition. the latter undergo constant rationalisation increase ratio capital per employee - something quite feasible service sector. this mean relative price service increase time, particularly large problem services, like sweden, largely provide public sector finance via taxes. the wage rise drive forward high-productivity industrial sector spread service could entail consequent increase price taxes. allow finally touch upon overlook industrial sector swedish business - basic industries. basic industry - good example. in public debate 1990s new economy, often claim old industrial society day traditional industry would suffer fate agriculture. basic industries, roughly compose iron steel industry, paper wood product industry mining, indeed decline significance recent decades, especially employment, still important net exports. while rise fall ict sector number year take centre stage debate, evolution long way within industry. for non-ict industry much gain afford new technology achieve able achieved. basic industry undergo mark structural change. for example, average production capacity per mill forestry sector increase eight time paper manufacture six time manufacture pulp past 40 years. the small mill close substantial concentration companies. the exploitation economy scale well strict environmental standard force company invest large scale. sweden currently account 3 per cent paper manufacture world 9 per cent exports. almost 85 per cent production paper pulp exported. it true mine industry big was. it value add today account 1 per cent total value add industry. but period stagnation begin 1990s, net export ore increase end decade account approximately 2 per cent total net export industrial products. lkab account approximately 4 per cent world trade iron ore, swedish company hold dominant position europe term production iron, silver lead.1 in spite competition country considerably faster-growing forest cheap ore, well fact technology area become easy transfer countries, basic industry survive several crisis years. the reason fact basic industry still relatively important today probably owner industry executive management quick assimilate new

oecd country 1970 1990, basic industry recover towards end 1980s. basic industry also outperform industry term productivity, vigorous productivity growth particular second half 1980s. in iron steel industry, example, productivity rise sharply 1977 1984, reflect extensive rationalisation measure especially regard manufacture merchant steel. a i say earlier, swedish capital formation percentage

finance convention, london, 2 december 2003. * * * i the treaty european union - good know maastricht treaty - enter force ten year ago 1 november 1993. the 12 ec member state launch time innovative unique approach create europe economic monetary union (emu). this late step far-reaching process economic integration initiate 50 year ago. back then, soon become clear time ripe political integration. the pragmatic path follow go economic monetary integration. the wide political purpose establish europe area peace prosperity serve well approach, despite major minor setbacks. emu bring profound transformation within international monetary system. sovereign country show determination hand one major instrument macroeconomic policy make supranational institution. the historical dimension political project undisputed. europe - least continental europe - fundamentally change creation emu consequential introduction euro. the project weather many storm past ten years. however, thundery cloud still lingering. it obvious everybody fully grasp ramification project. the damage do legally dubious abeyance stability growth pact (sgp) constitute real institutional crisis. this politically short-sighted decision regrettable step backwards european integration process show talent politician increase already impressive number challenge ahead. but one forget come achieve already. right now, actually process establish constitution europe. something already monetary field. maastricht fact establish stability-oriented monetary constitution. on hand, purpose convention’s draft constitutional treaty, discuss intergovernmental conference, replace modify content exist treaties. the constitutional treaty seek establish efficient structures. the whole decision-making process intend become transparent comprehensible. this strengthen democratic legitimacy eu, step also necessary view upcoming enlargement increase diversity complexity within union. it therefore integrative step rather consolidation exist institutional framework. change institutional framework emu originally intended, seem agenda. the ecb euro area central bank voice opinion. it intergovernmental conference decide change european stability consensus interest europe’s citizens. i intend comment whether uk join euro area not. when uk request allow move third stage, council eu decide necessary condition - say, convergence criterion - fulfilled. ii europe changed. it confuse europe ten twenty year ago. the process lead final stage emu especially help country unstable track record reduce inflation rates, interest rate fiscal deficits. the appeal part emu certainly helpful release impressive amount energy. what key characteristics, main achievement maastricht? bi review 56/2003 1 a medium-term-oriented macroeconomic policy framework base sustainable economic convergence two distinct features: 1. independent system european central bank supranational european central bank primary objective maintain price stability 2. fiscal institutional framework - properly apply - mean ensure fiscal discipline goal preserve sustainability public finance. be enough? have achieve worthy courageous objectives? where would like go? and direction go? the expectation emu manifold. there many sceptical voice believe “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy appropriate heterogeneous area. convergence see insufficient, criterion optimal currency area fulfilled. the proponent view saw monetary union last crown step economic integration. furthermore, experience show attempt past establish currency without state failed. the optimistic view focus advantage great price transparency, removal exchange-rate-induced plan uncertainty low transaction cost intra-euro-area trade. the euro see next logical step complete single market. emu expect serve catalyst economic reform political integration. who right? after almost five year emu one acknowledge neither positive negative extreme become true. however, institutional framework currently face crucial stress test. the eurosystem’s monetary policy manage gain credibility build confidence despite quite number challenges. this could take grant give fact blueprint fall back on. the centralise monetary policy decentralise closely coordinate economic budgetary policy constitute rather demand regime. the eurosystem least prove task. the ecb endow unambiguous mandate develop strategy accordance late insight monetary theory practical experience. even severe criticism anglo-saxon economist medium become le ardent

unambiguously call retain medium-term-oriented fiscal policy rules. it apply mechanistic procedure. stability growth go hand hand. there trade-off goals; instead, mutually reinforcing. the structural

australia, house representative stand committee economics, finance public administration, brisbane, 8 december 2003. * * * mr chairman, pleasure today front committee again, i please able meet brisbane first time. a know, take hear seriously enable parliament, representative committee, question reserve bank depth public. a usual i make introductory remark i focus three subjects: • situation change since statement i give committee june; • forecast evolved; • background monetary policy actions. 1. june now calendar year 2003 unusual one world economy. in first half, prospect world growth look doubtful, extreme uncertainty concentrate mid-year. if remember, talk possible deflation unite state reach peak, u authority give impression need low interest rate low u dollar help through. in europe, economic activity weakening, asia receive temporary knock-back severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak. at time, virtually central bank note - federal reserve bank new york (the fed), bank england, european central bank (ecb), bank canada, etc. - reduce interest rates, i indicate committee thing improve, might also so. in event, witness one sharp turnaround economic prospect u seen. while june quarter major countries, include many asia, saw decline gross domestic product (gdp), september quarter grow strongly. the weakness see june quarter turn ‘false signal’. in financial markets, bond yield rise sharply, share price continue rise, various price connect international trade, commodity price transport prices, also rose. talk deflation cease short-lived bout monetary ease stopped. business consumer confidence indicator around world rise back level consistent reasonable economic growth. at time perception world economy raised, general run economic indicator australia continue improve, particularly employment, retail sales, construction activity business consumer confidence. prospect farm production also pick sharply follow widespread rain, even though uniform across country. economic condition abroad return something relatively normal and, consequence, judge long need expansionary set monetary policy: interest rate raise accordingly november december. 2. forecast at point, i follow usual practice discuss forecast i give previous meeting, add new one come calendar year. when last meet june, i say expect gdp grow 3 per cent real term course 2003. with three quarter year behind us, expect figure come little higher, 3½ per cent. the thing notice, however, big difference two half year, growth first half annual rate 2 per cent, growth second half expect annual rate around 5 per cent. the thing notice growth domestic demand (gross national expenditure - gne) 2003, 5 per cent, expect well figure 3½ per cent gdp. bi review 56/2003 1 over course 2004, expect gdp grow 4 per cent. the profile growth, however, unlikely smooth. it would surprise u four-quarter-ended growth rate gdp reach 4½ per cent mid 2004 due effect sharp rise farm gdp, return 4 per cent end year. if world economy continue surprise strong side, recent months, gdp growth could even higher. on inflation, say last time expect cpi increase 2½ per cent calendar 2003. we think little low 2¼ per cent, largely due exchange rate high assume early forecast. over course 2004, expect cpi increase 2 per cent, mid 2004 could well maximum effect high australian dollar could felt then. a state quarterly statement, expectation imply profile inflation exhibit shallow u-shape - fall present 2½ per cent 2 per cent mid 2004, rise back 2 per cent end 2004, 2½ per cent mid 2005, continue upward pressure thereafter. of course, difficult precise things, especially since future level exchange rate play major role. i say later. 3. monetary policy a i outline start remarks, growth world economy get back normal, growth australian economy also get back normal, slightly it, could long see justification australian interest rate clearly normal. that is, major reason two increase interest rate quarter i give committee 18 month ago late may 2002 talk tighten then. another way put say maintain low level interest rate begin 2002, would gradual build-up inflationary pressure growth rate world australian economy rise 2003, 2004 beyond. interest rate low economy grow well. a turn out, process return interest rate normal level gradual one. two increase interest rate make mid-2002, 16-month gap next two increases. i explain previous two meet committee long gap occurred. it clear that, despite best endeavour explain ourselves, number people think bank tighten cool property market. in fact, i receive unsolicited advice would good u explain action way people could easily identify it. the overheat property market something people see around them; much concrete concept inflation-targeting return interest rate normal. however, approach would consistent truth. for start, sign overheat house market clearly evident second half 2002 2003, yet bank change monetary policy. it become clear good economic growth return globally domestically rate raised. i often stress monetary policy set take account average part economy, happen one sector. of course, sector overheated, may push average economy, way exert disproportionate influence. it also true that, historically, borrow house purpose one interest-sensitive sectors, may affect sector previous low level interest rate may respond sector recent increases. but mean single out. we also accuse set monetary policy relation sydney melbourne house markets, ignore rest country. this clearly cannot true case recent tightenings, house price sydney melbourne grow le quickly states; fact, house price part city already falling. in australia conduct monetary policy use inflation-targeting regime decade now. it successful regime deliver (along various reforms) long period uninterrupted good economic growth post war period, rate exceed significant develop economies. it concentrate mind reserve bank conscious need deliver result committed. over 10-year period, inflation average 2.4 per cent. by act early monetary policy keep inflation check, avoid large swing interest rate thereby allow economy prosper. 2 bi review 56/2003 bi review 56/2003 3 a aware, target relatively flexible one aim achieve average rate somewhere 2 3 per cent. it average judged, make accountable. but observer think system prescriptive strict rule determine actions. for example, people still think aim keep inflation 2 3 per cent times. this clear misinterpretation system fail realise average interest in. on number occasions, inflation 3 per cent 2 per cent. in fact, 45 per cent time outside 2 3 per cent range, regard failure policy. since objective achieve average inflation rate, multiple path inflation consistent meet medium-term objective. we wish choose one best satisfy obligation contain act, i summarise achieve sustainable growth income employment. we simplistically commit achieve minimum possible variability inflation rate, even hit target fix period ahead, two years. another approach sometimes put u say raise interest rate if, if, forecast inflation 3 per cent, low if, if, 2 per cent. again, misinterpretation system works. it also ignore complication uncertainty involve economic forecasting. the forecast horizon relevant policy today least two, even three, years. we relatively confident forecast first half horizon, much go happen period already set place. but le confident forecast second half. the situation particularly uncertain when, case present, direction inflation expect change forecast period. since type forecast hard make, we, like number central banks, wish lead public believe much precision. in fact, tend appeal balance risk around central forecast order convey message. in last month’s quarterly statement say balance risk shift upside, mean indicate inflation upward trajectory course second year. we also draw attention fact domestic price pressure increasing, show fact rate increase price ‘non-internationally trade good services’ increase 2 per cent 4 per cent past years. that mean inflation rise 4 per cent exchange rate effect wear off, least significant part economy influence figure. in summary, i want assure committee bank remain commit inflation target framework decision take past 18 month fully consistent framework. it seem plausible u argue bank could confident meet inflation commitment interest rate hold 30-year low face pick international domestic economy currently way. finally, let end update development payment policy reforms. since last met, challenge bring reserve bank’s reform credit card scheme mastercard visa dismiss federal court. both scheme subsequently appealed, visa withdraw appeal. the new interchange fee bankcard, mastercard visa come effect end october, almost halve fees. the reserve bank monitor flow merchant service fees. the data still gathered, anecdotal evidence suggest merchant start see reduction merchant service fee pay banks. there several development payment streams, i happy answer question arise, i aware i already take fair amount time, i finish point. k j udeshi:

link establish branch india. i may add wto commitment bank service fulfilled. a critical issue increase international concern question money laundering. the impact money launder begin extend economic crime international terrorism. a financial transaction grow complex, become difficult bank maintain customer profile. the challenge, therefore, ensure bank know customer without hind smooth flow financial transactions. the reserve bank issue several guideline bank non-banking financial company implement `know your customer’ principle. the basic aim prevent bank unwittingly use channel fund

demand product competitiveness quality considerations. finance act facilitator two precondition satisfied. this vindicate recent surge growth export automotive component c.d. roms. the initiative regard set electronic data interchange (edi) bank sector benefit exporter importer bear mentioning. edi provide several benefit corporates operational efficiency cost save elimination paperwork, logistical benefit good schedule reduce stockholding etc., strategic benefit competitive advantage access new markets. under edi project, one major benefit exporter rbi abolish gr form export

major economic stakeholders, sugar beach resort, 28 november 2003. * * * lady gentleman good even i please welcome bank mauritius annual dinner. right year i set tradition hold annual dinner major economic stakeholder country i focus mostly regulatory supervisory issue addresses. intentionally, i choose certain regulatory supervisory issue lead theme address reason i strongly believe clear now. tonight i shall briefly outline present challenge monetary policy context external environment characterize uncertainties. before i proceed main theme address let reiterate remark i make post february 2003 month year. the perception emerge wake discovery fraud mauritius commercial bank (mcb) inevitably make compel i re-emphasize remarks. the guide principle regulatory supervisory authority economic financial system first foremost attempt save trouble financial institutions. the legal framework regulatory supervisory authority design promote financial stability rather jeopardize financial stability. this envision bank mauritius bank acts. the act instrument empower bank mauritius promote sustain monetary financial stability. regulatory supervisory authority world use provision law defeat objective laws. arbitrary decision motivate emotional even personal consideration set aside favour genuinely professional approach sustain soundness bank situation similar one mauritius commercial bank find in. the regulatory supervisory authority cannot exercise independence mind. without presumptuous mcb/npf case handle bank mauritius manner best serf interest financial sector economy. i like re-underline supervision bank control procedure orient transaction oriented. view light determine step take mcb realm risk management along number prudential measure take month discovery fraud, mcb/npf case expect soon far bank mauritius concerned. regulatory issue relate worldcom enron scandal u deal settle within months. our bank industry bless surmount one tyranny: adverse publicity motivate consideration go beyond acceptable norm conduct. the bank mauritius ensure step take mcb fully revamp internal control procedure carry finish internal control appropriately exercise procedure strictly followed. suffice say mcb/npf episode, despite trauma associate it, serf good lesson financial industry. have say let turn main theme address tonight. a i explain april last seminar full appreciation bank’s monetary policy stance require perspective stretch beyond month even beyond single year. a month even year rather short time really gauge monetary policy central bank accomplish last basis. monetary policy tend impact economy long variable lag. unforeseen event undesirable consequence economy take place minutes. predictability course monetary policy disturb circumstances. policy post world war ii quite predictable. they predictable steady economic performance lead economy world context remarkably stable international socio-political economic financial environment. central bank government world enjoy full sovereignty policy making. in sharp contrast, international socio-political economic context far predictable today. additionally, wake financial liberalization across world, estimate us$1.2 trillion trade daily, capital move country remarkable ease speed never witness before. the bi review 55/2003 1 monetary policy stance one country affect monetary policy another process part sovereignty monetary policy-making thus lost. central banker necessarily constantly watch radar screen determine steer monetary policy best interest economies. “the manner central banker must operate compare decision people make whenever cross street. if traffic, little risk, pedestrian don’t need worry speed cross street. but road heavy fast move traffic, it’s different story, safety demand pedestrian wait confident make side. the hold true central bank governors.” the introduction euro, september 11 attack impact seriously u economy importer last resort, ever grow instability middle east, disagreement trade policy tendency country resort protectionist measure one form other, volatility exchange rate major currency international exchange well weak performance economy across world make monetary policy make abroad plain sail endeavour. successive year uncertainty intensify event beyond control central bank increasingly blur visibility. central bank constantly chart safe way forward world unexpected twist turn events. five year ago, substantial capital outflow trigger loss confidence rupee bring foreign reserve bank mauritius unacceptable levels. the rapid weaken euro international exchange follow introduction january 1999 translate significant appreciation rupee. and appreciation rupee quick reversal precede three year rapid depreciation rupee. the mood pessimism emerge wake september 11 attack bring world economy throe deflation. central bank around world effect series cut interest rate bid revitalize respective economies. notwithstanding policy adopt central banks, lead world economy enter period balance sheet recession recent years. in wake drastic fall equity prices, many company world could long afford maximize profits. they choose restructure balance sheet corporate governance demanded. however, household sector continue save money business community almost stop borrow money even low rate interest. this peculiar situation rather fallacy composition problem exacerbate recessionary trend world economy. monetary policy become much le effective company will borrow type recession. fiscal policy take absolutely important instrument boost aggregate demand well keep money supply shrinking. in trouble water navigational hazard impair visibility, quite often case. monetary policy judgment become question balance risk small open economy like vulnerabilities. observer outside wall central bank may find monetary policy make mechanical process describe textbook hardly realize circumstance policy decision weigh probabilities. this area policy make even think people differ judgment regard course policy actions. i cannot claim divine insight. nor i think anyone u may claim gift insight. however, would surprise u always agree judgments. when everyone agree time one really think enough. criticism bank mauritius policy stance profoundly appreciate long criticism educate criticisms. the hazard pose trouble water abroad third party threat competitiveness export process zone render conduct monetary policy quite puzzle exercise. basically, conduct monetary policy recent year aim bring rate inflation. the informal inflation target approach monetary policy make pay good dividends. the average inflation rate first five year 1990s 6.8 per cent, 6.1 per cent second half 1990s 5.2 per cent last five years. for current year rate inflation forecast close 4 per cent. clearly, tendency rate inflation either post marginal decline stay current rate around 4 per cent. that excessive monetary tighten could adversely affect growth performance economy consideration well bear mind. the successive cut interest rate like several country induce borrow desire extent. the pace bank credit expansion currently subdued. some corporate body borrow foreign currency substitute borrow rupees. while rate interest 2 bi review 55/2003 foreign borrow low compare rate interest charge local banks, borrower need mindful risk involved. risk associate external borrow could turn high. with upside risk inflation minimal foreseeable need re-aligning interest rate parity felt order prevent build short-term foreign liabilities, bank mauritius effect cut rate interest yesterday. against backdrop four successive year surplus record current account balance payment le buoyant aggregate demand economy, bank face policy dilemma. the market flush liquidity quite sometime. excess supply foreign exchange give rise situation excess rupee liquidity. in last two year bank mauritius purchase foreign currency domestic market amount equivalent us$500 million. the rupee counterpart purchase amount around rs14 billion ultimately land balance sheet bank mauritius well balance sheet government. the interest burden rupee counterpart foreign currency purchase bank indeed heavy. to extent bank keep buy foreign currency market remain complex policy question consider view current exchange rate level maintained. give volatility exchange rate international foreign exchange market take exchange rate rupee give price u ignore consideration regard domestic economic fundamentals? economics textbook teach u market economy, invisible hand market promote economic efficiency. do systematically take international financial market decide give u despite common belief invisible hand market often suffer arthritis? sometime back council member european central bank liken behaviour currency market herd run direction. he say, “i meet lot sheep know run wrong direction. but want run opposite direction certain rest herd follow.” the problem best determination exchange rate rupee foreign exchange market reconcile domestic economic fundamental international financial market dictate us. the bank’s policy concern need stem excessive foreign exchange inflow sustain current exchange rate levels. this policy dilemma specific mauritius also giant economy like china others. the bank mauritius one instrument strike appropriate balance interest rate. in last 30 month bank mauritius reduce interest rate 9 occasions. the lombard rate reduce step step 12.5 per cent 9.75 per cent. the prime lend rate bank fell 11 per cent 8.5 per cent; reduce result yesterday’s cut. however, borrower default risk pay premium prime lend rate banks. the high default risk high premium. monetary policy limits; cannot influence premium either direction. in policy scenario saver face vicissitude interest rate mauritius world over. our household sector traditionally place save banks. risk averse investors, particularly depend pension living, benefit risk-free investment avenues. in december 1998 bank mauritius start sale treasury bill over-the-counter individuals. over rs4 billion 11,000 individual investor soak bank mauritius. evidently market government debt instrument growth potential mauritius. the sale bill subsequently suspend view decision develop secondary market government debt instruments. there many request public bank mauritius regular sale treasury bill over-the-counter. though helpful rudimentary method conduct open market operation le develop market, sale treasury bill over-the-counter bank mauritius way forward. we decide treasury bill time government debt instrument trade stock exchange mauritius. our stock exchange good operate characteristic trade government papers. we expect market eventually develop bond market efficient system good price discovery. the bank mauritius, stock exchange mauritius stockbroker make unite effort start trade sometime next weeks. the stock exchange mauritius stockbroker come detail december. the bank mauritius keen interest development market government debt instruments. such market would provide bank good medium conduct monetary policy. bi review 55/2003 3 4 bi review 55/2003 lady gentlemen, address tonight base decision make monetary policy stance bank mauritius increasingly transparent. it adopt practice among central bank country move transparency area monetary policy making. i one really believe move direction. before conclude may i say bank mauritius live challenge monetary policy year ahead. in uncertain external environment bank far chart best possible course support non-inflationary growth. the bank pursue course spirit. may i behalf board director bank mauritius behalf wish family merry xmas happy new year. philipp m hildebrand: asset management central bank - special case? speech mr philipp m hildebrand, member govern board swiss national bank, university st gallen, st gallen, 5 december 2003. the complete speech find french swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * summary next monetary policy, management international reserve another important task swiss national bank (snb). since obligation cannot define precisely, exact determination optimal level country’s international reserves. in accordance buff stock model, level international reserve determine - one would choose appropriate insurance - base likelihood crisis, contribution manage avoid crisis well opportunity cost imply hold reserves. both insight derive model international comparison show switzerland hold reasonable level international reserves. the long-term development reserve base set clear goals, case switzerland growth nominal gdp strategic benchmark. in define investment policy, snb take account safety, liquidity, performance. the new national bank law enable snb good adapt investment profile needs, ought low opportunity cost imply hold reserves. a investment activity become increasingly complex, demand corporate governance. in conformity private financial sector, central bank - snb count among - professionalise investment risk control process improve accountability toward public. with increase professionalism, particularly result apply mark-to-market principle, snb’s profit volatile past, however. in order safeguard independence monetary policy restrict investment policy, snb’s annual profit distribution - already spell message federal council new national bank law - must remain variable residual amount long term must tie specific purpose. bi review 55/2003 1 european central bank: press conference - introductory statement introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, mr lucas papademos, vice-president european central bank, frankfurt main, 4 december 2003. * * * lady gentlemen, vice-president i report outcome today's meet govern council ecb. follow comprehensive economic monetary analysis, conclude monetary policy stance remain appropriate preserve price stability medium term. accordingly, leave key ecb interest rate unchanged low levels. while annual inflation rate likely fluctuate around 2% come months, gradual limit decline take place late on. we also note economic recovery euro area start confidence strengthen further. we continue carefully monitor development might affect medium-term assessment risk price stability. we also discuss potential implication deeply regrettable development ecofin council meet 25 november. a already stress statement day, development risk undermine credibility institutional framework confidence sound public finance member state across euro area. let add credible fiscal framework key stability also growth, precondition low risk premia financial market preserved. i shall explain assessment detail. in context economic analysis, late data release confirm economic activity euro area pick up. real gdp growth third quarter reflect strong momentum world economy, assume continue next year. we expect domestic demand start improving. private consumption support positive terms-of-trade effect due past appreciation euro. with usual lag, also profit increase employment growth. business investment expect recover gradually, mainly help expansion external demand, low level interest rate generally favourable finance conditions. moreover, increasingly benefit adjustment effort corporate sector enhance productivity profitability. take together, look forward gradual recovery euro area economic growth next quarters, lead broad strong upswing course next year year after. the risk scenario appear balanced. over long horizon, remain concern sustainability global economic growth undermine external imbalance part world economy. concern prices, late information line early expectations. accord eurostat's flash estimate, annual hicp inflation 2.2% november, follow rate 2.0% october. similar rate prevail year inertia inflation rate around 2% likely continue come months. due adverse food price developments, evolution oil price plan increase indirect tax administer prices, inflation rate fall neither quickly strongly expect early year. however, assess price trend medium term, number factor dampen inflationary pressures. first, give past appreciation euro, import price contribute effect. second, domestic cost pressure remain moderate. in particular, wage growth contain context recovery which, time being, expect remain gradual. provide wage moderation preserved, indispensable foster employment, cyclical recovery productivity tend dampen growth unit labour costs, thus far relatively high judge weakness economy. overall, view also reflect recently release forecast seem line survey data financial market expectations. accordingly, rather broad consensus main scenario. at time, outlook price stability conditional quite number assumptions, global developments, oil prices, exchange rates, wage development bi review 55/2003 1 2 bi review 55/2003 fiscal measures. therefore, element risk outlook price stability need keep mind. in respect, note financial market indicator inflation expectation show upward momentum recent months. while technical factor might also play role movement indicators, indicator remain broadly unchanged, inflation expectation warrant close monitoring. turn monetary analysis, m3 growth strong past two years, reflect portfolio shifts, precautionary save low level interest rates. the low level interest rate also support growth credit demand. in assessment, accumulation excess liquidity concern price stability current juncture, give that, time being, economic recovery gradual. however, high excess liquidity continue prevail significant strengthen economic activity, could lead inflationary pressure medium term. we therefore continue carefully examine monetary developments. in summary, economic analysis indicate main scenario price development medium term continue line definition price stability. this picture confirm cross-check monetary analysis. turn fiscal policies, i already mention express deep regret follow ecofin council meet 25 november. furthermore, stress support commission's view ecofin council's conclusions. we also take note commitment make france germany correct excessive deficit rapidly possible late 2005. moreover, note ecofin council stand ready take decision article 104(9), basis commission recommendation, two government fail act accordance commitments. we strongly urge government concern live responsibilities. confidence soundness public finance essential sustainable growth consumption investment. the overall fiscal framework stability growth pact remain central importance fully respected. the apply requirement avoid excessive deficits, lay article 104 treaty, reference value 3% 60% deficit debt-to-gdp ratio respectively, specify protocol excessive deficit procedure annex treaty. these foundation trust confidence emu. trust confidence also crucial context structural reform. enhance competitiveness euro area, particular labour product markets, increase efficiency tax system ensure sustainability social security scheme foster good allocation utilisation capital human resources. there doubt measure respect improve growth perspective euro area. however, order foster confidence short term, convince assurance must give challenge indeed tackle decisive manner clear action taken. while progress made, govern council strongly encourage government accelerate implementation structural reform also call upon social partner fully commit objective make euro area dynamic innovative economy. we disposal questions. rakesh mohan: challenge monetary policy global context speech dr rakesh mohan, deputy governor reserve bank india, 22nd anniversary lecture central bank study central bank sri lanka, colombo, 21 november 2003. dr rakesh mohan grateful dr michael patra, dr a prasad shri muneesh kapur reserve bank india assistance. the reference find bank india’s website. * * * i. introduction recent global development significantly transform environment monetary policy operates. this throw opportunity well challenges. globalisation expand economic interdependence interaction country greatly. this create need great coordination term design appropriate institutional architecture well standardisation reflect adoption similar monetary policy approaches. it also associate dramatic low inflation worldwide. central bank seize opportunity bring institutional reform enhance accountability, hence, credibility monetary policy making. they hone technical specialist management skill acquire adequate competence deal emerge complexity financial markets. the recent evolution global economy accentuate challenge face monetary authorities. increasingly, monetary policy decision make environment heighten uncertainty. structural change associate globalisation increase uncertainty interpret macroeconomic indicator regard state economy. another form uncertainty stem strategic interaction private agent monetary policy authority and, particular, role expectation monetary transmission mechanism. financial markets, drive massive cross-border capital flow information technology revolution, immediately transfer valuation risk associate uncertainty across globe lead contagion. indeed, global interdependence mark common shock “confidence channel” rapidly transmit shock various part world. all render conduct monetary policy extremely complex environment interdependent risks. therefore, even though monetary policy conduct towards achieve domestic objectives, central bank follow development carefully across world. more ever before, choice monetary arrangement depend choice country make (meltzer, 1997). in lecture today, i propose dwell upon uncertainty characterise monetary policy environment, underlie macroeconomic condition monetary policy set, process inflation change institutional response commitment price stability, role capital flow future hold store. against backdrop, i hope shed light emerge discussion among central banker course monetary policy great relevance develop country ours. ii. the setting: global economic situation the grow internationalisation monetary policy bring sharp focus synchronise global downturn since late 1990s. in response, monetary authority world make concert effort ease policy stance significantly. the u power world economy last 7-8 year responsible 60 per cent world growth. despite burst stock market bubble, rash corporate governance problem it bubble, u main engine world growth recent year partly responsible recovery asian country 1997 crisis. in bargain, u accumulate twin deficit - current account deficit (cad) five per cent, fiscal deficit six per cent (a sharp turnaround surplus 1.2 per cent 2000). with emergence imbalance us, region world exhibit equal opposite imbalance own. ironically, develop country asia fund cad u exhibit surplus. the central bank asia finance roughly 3-3.5 per cent cad u fiscal deficit, compare early situation private sector flow bi review 54/2003 1 fund deficits. in view difficulty monetary management situation entails, situation clearly sustainable indefinitely. there short-cut solution since problem deep, structural inter-dependent: hence cannot solve independent unilateral action. for example, difficult structural reform necessary euro area; much structural reform require japan, particularly financial sector; india large fiscal deficit problem, china cannot afford major appreciation. hence, relatively coordinate medium term action call among major economy world. unilateral action country unlikely solve problems. recent month see emerge sign recovery economic activity, particularly us, japan emerge asia. in us, pace growth pick up, assist expansionary macroeconomic policy supportive financial conditions. equity bond market respond optimism prospect recovery investor interest return technology stock rapidly sectors. in japan, strong sign third quarter cyclical upswing underway, lead industrial activity exports. in uk australia, sign recovery clearly evident rise household spend reflect retail price inflation, prompt monetary authority two country raise key policy interest rate inflation surprises. china continue grow remarkably strong pace activity part asia bounce back effect sars. there nevertheless considerable uncertainty regard durability pick-up. in us, labour market remain sluggish significant excess capacity persists. moreover, substantial support provide consumption tax cut unlikely sustained. despite prospect strong growth, japan continue experience deflation. the ongoing concern relate structural weakness financial system remain. in contrast rest world, euro area remain conspicuously weak although tentative sign modest recovery recent months. household demand remain sluggish unemployment rate area whole risen. the burden adjustment global slowdown highly asymmetric raise risk associate sustain recovery. the u virtually alone among oecd country pursue aggressive flexible countercyclical monetary fiscal policy - cut policy interest rate large swing structural government balance surplus 0.6 per cent gdp 2000 deficit 5.1 per cent 2003 large three decades. global growth continue lead us, significant downside risk could emanate emergence record current account fiscal deficit us. while depreciation u dollar far relatively orderly, substantial depreciation remain danger global recovery shadow twin deficits. history suggest even orderly adjustment key exchange rate likely associate slowdown u growth - and, growth rest world remain weak, global growth well (imf, 2003). the continue dependence world u heighten risk disorderly adjustment, particularly translate off-setting appreciation euro. in contrast mid-1980s, u run current account deficit similar order 2003, neither europe japan position today pick slack. look ahead, unlikely u provide degree support global economy past. in particular, high fiscal deficit would offset longer-term benefit tax cut rise debt service burden household sector curb future consumption spending. in euro area, whereas monetary policy adjudge successful inflation target framework, economic slowdown deep prolonged, gdp decline second quarter 2003. the large economy - germany, france, netherlands italy - recession high level unemployment. the unemployment rate 8.8 per cent euro area whole even high individual countries: 13.2 per cent belgium, 9.7 per cent france, 10.5 per cent germany, 8.5 per cent italy 11.4 per cent spain. despite recent improvement expectations, household business confidence remain depressed. the poor performance germany, particular, threaten hold back region’s recovery. corporate balance sheet still adjust burst asset price bubble late 1990s hold investment spending. export adversely affect weak external demand well substantial appreciation euro past two years. monetary policy accommodative different inflation unemployment rate different country blur effectiveness common monetary policy. a activist approach warrant especially downside risk individual country potentially area-wide spillovers. although germany france expect post fiscal deficit 4 per cent gdp 2003, scope countercyclical fiscal policy limit stability growth pact. structural reform hold key 2 bi review 54/2003 improve europe’s economic performance, include liberalisation labour product markets, pension reform offset measure deal age population. in japan, macroeconomic performance 2003 exceed expectation alongside improve external environment upturn equity markets. the outlook remain overcast deflationary pressure persistent weakness financial sector. the possibility decline equity bond prices, sustain appreciation yen rise public debt remain danger durable recovery. more rapid bold reform financial sector need address large overhang non-performing loan poor quality capital bank sector. financial sector measure need complement corporate restructuring. quantitative ease monetary policy keep short-term interest rate zero, aggressive enough end deflation. the build-up public debt pressure population age necessitate medium-term strategy impart sustainability fiscal policy. overall, global macroeconomic imbalance associate misalignment g-3 currency remain serious threat broad-based robust recovery. this implication pattern capital flows. in contrast precede years, u current account deficit finance primarily sale government corporate paper rather equity inflows. the bulk investment central banks, particularly asia. this clearly unsustainable adjustment need achieve medium-term stability. an eventual narrow u current account deficit require emerge economy share adjustment prevent undue burden euro area. a current issue concern practice great flexibility exchange rate regime countries, result effort real economy. study show great volatility develop countries’ real exchange rate associate great misalignment g-3 country disruptive effect trade finance channels. this emerge major source uncertainty conduct monetary policy. the current imbalance world asian country finance western countries, particularly, u could root long term demographic imbalances. the long-term demographic face world, effect save rate encouraging. the demographic europe, japan u high save rates. the median age japan, europe u 4l, 40 35 years, respectively. current trend indicate median age japan increase 50 2025. the situation u may turn adverse due flexible immigration policies. within asia, india china expect save rate increase further, give private save two country among high world, view favourable demographic next 20 years. country like india china, account large proportion world population, also low urbanisation level 30 35 per cent move 50 55 per cent next 20 30 years. this would necessitate high infrastructure investment require high capital inflow high current account deficit. thus, asian country run large capital account surplus current account deficits, situation u europe would meet reversal. the issue try comprehend would require macro reversal occur. the current demographic trend europe japan sustainable. in future, may able afford pension system social security exist now. the solution europe seem u type immigration policy towards labour market reforms. currently, possible high unemployment. iii. inflation: go in brief overview global economic situation today, i try indicate global imbalance inter-related monetary policy make country like become much difficult day-to-day basis. the notable achievement recent year substantial success almost country reduce inflation low level several decades. sustain inflation relatively modern phenomenon. until world war i, international experience one long-run price stability. follow turbulence inter-war period, second world war korean war early 1950s, vietnam war 1960s early 1970s, inflation gradually increase late 1960s, party result expansionary fiscal monetary policies. the massive oil price hike 1973 step global inflation double-digits u western europe. there huge transfer resource middle east rest world include asia. the last consequence development 1970s migration worker country like remit back large sum money sustain basis. bi review 54/2003 3 although inflation abate 1978, rise double-digit level end 1979 follow second oil shock. inflation finally break 1982, impact aggressive disinflationary policies. the 1980s mark strong widespread effort restore reasonable price stability combination tight monetary policy, fiscal consolidation structural reforms. the reduction inflation, facilitate significant decline oil prices, set stage robust economic recovery continue till end 1980s. another inflation episode 1989-90 due harden oil price meet aggressive monetary policy action enable cooling-off 1991 cost much shallow recession early 1980s. since then, world go one long phase low inflation post-world war ii history. the decline inflation evident across country different stage development. it spectacular develop country inflation fell 31 per cent early 1980s 6 per cent 2000-03. in latin america country transition inflation average 230 per cent 360 per cent, respectively, 1990-94, project around 10 per cent 2003. out 184 member imf, 44 country inflation great 40 per cent 1992. in 2003, number fall 3. for industrial countries, inflation, currently around 2 per cent, fall low 1950s. arguably, deflation threaten country today high inflation. what bring significant decline inflation globally? a significant strand literature point institutional change conduct monetary policy - independent central banks, increase transparency, great accountability contractual frameworks, great coordination monetary fiscal authority - enhance reputation monetary authority increase public credibility ability deliver low inflation. an equally influential body work, however, suggest monetary authority lucky factor work increase level competition due force globalisation, successful fiscal consolidation develop countries, particularly context maastricht treaty, structural change global economy productivity major role play rise prominence new economy. have central bank lucky good? perhaps bite (rogoff, 2003). while evidence either side still evolving, current assessment unlikely reversal current trend inflation. it important, however, introspect little order understand dynamic low inflation future compatibility monetary policy international setting. an important factor might contribute low inflation productivity growth. although productivity growth europe may high unite states, disinflationary effect productivity growth one region get transmit across border increase competition globalise world, operate low price mark-ups erosion monopoly price power expansion cross border trade. increase competition make price flexible response real activity, thereby reduce incentive monetary policy expansionary. this reinforce credibility commitment monetary policy’s contain inflation (rogoff, op cit). despite grow globalisation synchronisation business cycles, strike change past three decade moderation volatility gdp growth g-7 country could also contribute low inflation (stock watson, 2003). a number factor work. first, service sector, le susceptible volatility manufacturing, increase share output. second, inventory management improved. third, financial market provide household easy access credit. in us, sector witness great reduction volatility housing. moreover, few oil supply price disruption well small productivity shock 1980s 1990s 1960s 1970s. although small part moderation output volatility attribute monetary policy, hotly debated. for instance, widely believe monetary policy u successful implement anticipatory non-inflationary policy focus sustainable long-term real rate interest (de long, 2003). a significant increase flexibility u economy smoothen shock result deregulation, technology, good inventory management flexible labour market enable absorb shocks. the manner shock define critical. the perception small shock really ‘net shock’ i.e. gross shock minus absorbed. thus, event like september 11 measure net sense. moreover, integrate world, would difficult distinguish exogenity endogeneity; instance, increase oil price could well treat endogenous. 4 bi review 54/2003 yet another set force operate inflation emanate technological change. advance architecture engineer well development light strong material result “downsized” output, require technology sophisticate input. this process accelerate recent decade advent semi-conductor, micro-processor, computer satellite. the impact technological change evident huge expansion money value output trade tonnage. a consequence, material intensity production decline reflecting, feed chairman alan greenspan (1998) noted, “the substitution, effect, idea physical matter creation economic value”. this contribute secular decline commodity prices. in fact, long-run trend decline commodity price last 140 year show little evidence reversal. concern increase commodity price volatility around decline trend have, however, increasingly engage monetary policy attention short-run. a significant strand literature credit change institutional operate framework monetary policy success achieve low inflation. after experience sustain inflation 1960s 1970s, objective inflation control become stronger, movement inflation target emerged. massive cross-border capital flows, globalisation financial market information technology revolution combine alter significantly choice instrument monetary policy, operational settings, lag structure transmission mechanisms. in particular, force lead progressive erosion traditional anchor monetary policy. in general, wan importance intermediate targets. even monetary authority deal difficult transition, several country radically alter institutional architecture monetary policy, include increase independence monetary authority, clarity rule responsibility constrain discretion. about 22 country adopt policy regime inflation single target monetary policy. indeed, inflation target quickly emerge orthodoxy design monetary policy. the ongoing slowdown global economic activity threat deflation has, however, weaken analytical edifice. although practice inflation target associate low inflation, jury still extent inflation target policy actually contribute reduction inflation occurred. moreover, low inflation, observe today, disincentive production decisions; also delay consumer spend time could critical trigger upturn. it impart inflexibility labour markets, cause unemployment deepen slowdown. signal financial price get blur lead misallocation resources. in context, recent experience inflation target framework monetary policy warrant close hard scrutiny. the fixation short-run price stability ‘inflation nutting’, borrow term mervyn king, governor, bank england easily lead neglect important sign macroeconomic financial imbalances. moreover, available empirical evidence suggest inflation target improve economic performance. in euro area, instance, set inflation target close 2 per cent associate weaken economic activity. this get pronounce second quarter 2003 real gdp declined, accompany large scale unemployment threat deflation large constituents. furthermore, relevance single inflation target large economy, particular, debated. the inflation target euro area suffer problem ‘one size fit all’ monetary policy. regional disparity warrant different short-run monetary policy approach objectives. a certain amount target flexibility balance conflict objective unavoidable real world, particularly emerge market economy (eichengreen, 2002). indeed, grow sense time current phase global business cycle run out, inflation target may stand test time. high sustain growth economy conjunction low inflation central concern monetary policy. the rate inflation choose policy objective consistent desire rate output employment growth. an inappropriate choice lead loss macroeconomic welfare. monetary authority continually contend short-run trade-off growth inflation. the problem compound fact association growth inflation non-linear. at low rates, inflation could operate manner assist bring back unemployed resource economy beneficial or, worst, neutral growth. at high levels, inflation inimical growth. there also low level inflation associate growth even deflation. how low policy choice inflation threshold rate inflation, one, associate absence harmful effect growth, therefore, become key question. there various study attempt estimate threshold inflation rates. they suggest threshold inflation rate depend upon number factor structure economy, past inflation history, degree bi review 54/2003 5 indexation, inflation expectations. some study suggest threshold inflation develop develop country fall range 1-3 per cent 7-11 per cent, respectively (khan senhadji, 2000). an abide problem cross-country studies, however, risk influence extreme value since sample include country inflation low one per cent high 200 per cent even higher. the estimation inflation threshold rates, therefore, need do country separately (rangarajan, 1998), order understand behaviour economy relation inflation. a major source uncertainty conduct monetary policy lack clear understand inflationary process unfold recent years. this obscure proper assessment nature shock impact economy result risk price stability. variation timeliness reliability inflation indicators, uncertainty surround unobservable indicator like potential output gap intrinsic knowledge central bank state economy complicate make monetary policy. knowledge relationship inflation determinant remain limit (ecb, 2001). even consensus suitable model, considerable uncertainty would remain regard strength structural relationship within model. an even fundamental problem parameter may vary time result structural change economy. this presumably explain central bank us formal model derive actual policies; foreseeable future, model aid judgement rather substitute judgement (feldstein, 2003). the simple principle inflation target thus also simple and, pose problem monetary policy make develop countries. iv. the prime mover: international capital flow global capital flow impact conduct monetary policy daily basis. the problem, however, capital flow follow boom-bust pattern. net capital flow currently limp back severe retrenchment impose asian financial crisis, bring end dramatic surge capital flow post-world war ii history. it recent period, particularly 2003, condition rejuvenation capital flow improving. large swing capital flow observe short term long term pattern well. a major surge capital flow start around 1870s continue till first world war. the flow mainly so-called develop country - core country western europe peripheral europe overseas european settlement - form foreign investment, two-thirds comprise portfolio inflows. this era, coincide operation classical gold standard, widely regard high watermark capital mobility. the boom end first world war. a brief restoration gold standard shatter great depression ensue period early 1940s characterise modest flow emerge market economy development finance. capital control widespread attempt maintain gold parity international finance become fragment bilateral trade agreements. in post-world war ii period 1970s, control spread intensified. international capital flow primarily among industrial economies. the u remove restriction capital outflow 1974-75 germany retain control inflow late 1970s. the uk maintain control 1979 japan complete liberalisation capital account 1980. develop country persevere control latin american country embark flaw liberalisation part exchange rate-based stabilisation programme mid-1970s. in period since 1973, dramatic change set in. private capital flow develop country renew commercial bank furiously recycle oil surpluses. asia latin america receive maximum share. develop country debt exploded, rise compound annual rate 24 per cent (world bank, 2003) debt crisis 1982 burst bubble. capital flow develop country slow substantially dry up. between 1983 1989, fell le third level 1977-82. a generalise risk aversion develop country debt dominate international financial market develop country turn attractive destinations. by end 1980s, direct investment inflow develop country one-eighth flow develop countries; portfolio flow develop country virtually non-existent. during 1980s 1990s, several develop country asia undertake capital account liberalisation part unilateral financial deregulation, often face large external surpluses. in general, period mid-1980s mid-1990s characterise removal official restriction financial market wide market-oriented reform mature emerge market economies. the dramatic 6 bi review 54/2003 move towards capital account liberalisation occur among continental member european union. investor confidence return develop world early 1990s aftermath brady plan. net capital flow surge pre-1914 level 1996, temporarily slow em crisis 1992. the impact mexican crisis 1994 absorb large mobilisation official finance act buffer. the composition flow alter significantly, private flow exceed official flow end 1980s. whereas 1970s bank lend dominant component capital flow emerge markets, start early 1990s, equity bond investor become dominant. over last decade, portfolio investment exceed bank lend eight years. the range investor purchase emerge market security broadened. specialise investor hedge fund mutual fund account bulk portfolio inflow mid-1990s. in subsequent years, pension funds, insurance company institutional investor increase presence emerge markets. although portfolio flow become important, fdi account bulk private capital flow emerge market economies, go 6-fold jump 1990 1997. international bank lend develop country increase sharply period, pronounce asia, follow eastern europe latin america. much increase bank lend form short-term claims, particularly asia. in late 1990s, capital flow develop country receive severe shock - first asian crisis 1997-98, turmoil global fix income markets, recently collapse argentine currency board peg 2001 spate corporate failure account irregularity 2002. net flow develop country decline almost continuously 1997. the fall particularly sharp form bank lend bonds, reflect uncertainty risk aversion. in 2002, net capital flow fell again, remain far 1997 peak. flow latin america reach low level decade. flow asia begin hesitant recovery new bank lend exceed repayment first time five years. global fdi inflows, 41 per cent 2001, fell another 21 per cent 2002, attributable weak economic growth, large sell-offs equity markets, plunge cross-border merger acquisitions. the usa uk account half fall. flow asia hold china. despite global uncertainties, condition capital flow improve 2003. sell-offs international bond market june july reflect upward revision investors’ expectation growth prospects. spillover credit equity market limited. emerge markets, general, outperform mature markets. some positive aspect roller-coaster last decade are: steady consolidation external debt develop country cushion resilience fdi, growth local-currency bond market innovation manage credit risk. the experience live capital flow since 1970s fundamentally alter context development finance. it also bring drastic revision manner monetary policy conducted. in particular, dramatic shift still unsettle debate determinant exchange rate choice appropriate exchange rate regime, although weight opinion clearly favour flexible regime. accord conventional wisdom, trade flow key determinant exchange rate movements. consequently, degree openness international trade, price non-price competitiveness factor determine market share abroad think crucial bear level movement exchange rate. in recent times, tail mobile capital account wag dog balance payments, importance capital flow determine exchange rate movement increase considerably, render early guidepost monetary policy formulation possibly anachronistic. on day-to-day basis, capital flow influence exchange rate interest rate arithmetic financial markets. instead real factor underlie trade competitiveness, expectation reaction news drive capital flow exchange rates, often alignment fundamentals. capital flow observe cause overshoot exchange rate market participant act concert price information. foreign exchange market prone bandwagon effects. the effect capital flow exchange rate amplify fact capital flow ‘gross’ term several time high ‘net’ capital flows. the experience capital flow important lesson choice exchange rate regime. the advocacy corner solution - fix peg la currency board without monetary policy independence freely float exchange rate retain discretionary conduct monetary policy - bi review 54/2003 7 distinctly decline. the weight experience seem clearly favour intermediate regime country-specific features, target level exchange rate, exchange market intervention ensure orderly rate movements, combination interest rate exchange rate intervention fight extreme market turbulence. in general, emerge market economy accumulate massive foreign exchange reserve circuit-breaker situation unidirectional expectation become self-fulfilling. it combination strategy guide monetary authority impossible trinity fix exchange rate, open capital account independent monetary policy. capital movement render exchange rate significantly volatile before. for majority develop country continue depend export performance key health balance payments, exchange rate volatility significant real effect term fluctuation employment output distribution activity tradables non-tradables. in fiercely competitive trade environment country seek expand market share aggressively par margins, even small change exchange rate develop significant persistent real effects. for labour intensive export producers, volatility exchange rate movement easily translate large loss economic welfare. in final analysis, heighten exchange rate volatility era capital flow adverse implication country except reserve currency economies. the latter experience exchange rate movement alignment macro imbalance danger persist currency misalignment loom large non-reserve currency economies. the issue dominate conduct monetary policy exchange rate policy today country india china excess capital inflows. be flow result temporary global imbalance emanate current economic policy problem g-3 countries? or reflect global change last nature. it consideration issue i turn. v. look ahead: economic demographic some recent research focus macroeconomic effect demographic pattern (joshi sanyal, 2003; un, 2003). over next half-century, population world age fast past half-century fertility rate decline life expectancy rises. the proportion child (0-14 years) expect decline 30 per cent 2000 20 per cent 2050 whereas proportion age (60+ years) double, reach 21 per cent total population 2050. the phenomenon global age likely associate progressive decline save rate growth. in interregnum, regional pattern global population age expect bring fundamental alteration saving-investment balance would reflect magnitude direction international capital flow implication conduct future monetary policy. in general, economy pas three stage demographic transition - (i) high youth dependency (large proportion population 0-14 year group), (ii) rise work age population (15-59 years) relative youth dependency (iii) rise elderly dependency (60+ years) relative work age population. the second stage regard productive point view secular growth since associate high rate save work force growth relative stages. so far, develop region lead process population age likely deep third stage demographic transition. in europe, population age advance 2050, project accelerate. japan currently country old population; 2050, expect high proportion elderly people among industrialise nation (government japan, 2003). projection suggest turn point 2010 2030 european union, north america japan experience substantial decline save rate relative investment would reflect current account deficits. these region switch import capital. most high performer east asia china second stage demographic cycle. elderly dependency expect double 2025. their work age population increase modestly shrink. these projection suggest east asia could increasingly become important supplier global save 2025; however, rapid population age thereafter would reinforce rather mitigate inexorable decline global saving. increasingly would moderate low performer among develop country would emerge exporter international capital. india enter second stage demographic transition next half-century, significant increase save rate share work age population 8 bi review 54/2003 expected. the share labour force population expect overtake rest asia, include china, 2030. in scenario, current phenomenon overall surplus balance payment run several emerge market economies, include india, may temporary one. the large reserve hold country (excluding gold) world emerge market economies. monetary authority country grapple expansionary effect net foreign asset domestic monetary conditions. face loss control monetary aggregates, interest rate exchange rates, almost country engage devise innovative method sterilisation delay inevitable sacrifice discretion conduct monetary policy globalisation. the emerge pattern demography indicate source uncertainty monetary authority could become significant before. the key challenge macroeconomic policy would ensure anticipate expansion save develop country productively utilise within economy export abroad. accordingly, vital ensure investment rate rise close co-movement save rate. sustainable growth hinge around existence critical minimum term physical infrastructure. the acceleration growth future require massive investment close gap demand supply key infrastructural area power, road highways, port telecommunication, city urban utilities. india, china indonesia, account third world’s population expect continue urbanise next 20 40 years. during period, investment demand resource emanate country relate urbanisation assume large magnitudes. the history urbanization country undergo growth level urbanization - around 25 30 per cent around 50 60 per cent - typically attract external save supplement satisfy massive finance need infrastructure investment period. if conjecture regard course demography associate save pattern i posit correct, unlikely current low inflationary scenario continue medium term long term. it also possible current phenomenon increase save rate asian country like india china continue valid next medium long term. if happens, could reversal capital flows. there would tighten liquidity world capital market increase competition resources. thus, assurance current trend excess liquidity accompany low inflation necessarily continue world. recent experience tell u reversal occur rapidly. this pose significant problem conduct monetary policy country year come. the future growth strategy also need labour absorb accommodate project expansion work force. reform labour market, educational systems, pension medical care would gather importance within overall intensification structural reforms. monetary policy would play important role bring force together ensure appropriate real interest rate low stable inflation. vi. the emerge challenge monetary policy there many issue relevance emerge economy like india sri lanka open up. it would useful summarise here. in world generalise uncertainty, monetary policy lose traditional moorings. a consequence, conduct monetary policy become increasingly complex. the determinant exchange rate behaviour alter dramatically. earlier, factor affect merchandise trade flow behaviour good market provide proximate guide operate monetary policy. in environment, monetary policy principally target low inflation relevant commodity purchase power parity seem offer satisfactory explanation exchange rate changes. since 1980s, vicissitude capital movement show volatility exchange rate movement major currency move far alignment underlie purchase power parities. on day-to-day basis, capital flow move exchange rate account much volatility. the impact great exchange rate volatility significantly different reserve currency country develop countries. for former, mature well-developed financial market absorb risk associate large exchange rate fluctuation negligible spillover real activity. consequently, central bank take care risk monetary policy operations. on hand, majority develop countries, bi review 54/2003 9 labour-intensive exporters, exchange rate volatility significant employment, output distributional consequences, large persistent. all make operation monetary policy difficult complicated. for develop countries, particular, consideration relate maximise output employment weigh equally upon monetary authority price stability. a crucial objective development strategy stabilise fluctuation output employment. accordingly, develop countries, difficult design future monetary policy framework inflation single-minded objective. thus operation monetary policy take account risk great interest rate exchange rate volatility entail wide range participant economy. both fiscal monetary authority inevitably bear risks. the choice exchange rate regime develop countries, therefore, reveal preference flexible exchange rate along intervention ensure orderly market activity, without target level exchange rate. there interest maintain adequate international reserve readiness move interest rate flexibly event disorderly market conditions. it need recognise develop country engage process development integration financial markets. consequently, signal market get blur degree management unavoidable transition. the actual experience last two decade great liberalization financial system, inflation fall output volatility moderated. monetary policy play important role tame inflation last two decades. a valuable lesson economy process open increase globalization competition contribute predominantly towards containment inflation. thus countries’ perspective inflation need inform increasingly world price trends, particularly commodity interest them. with continue deregulation globalisation, unlikely reversal current trend inflation. however, suggest globalization solution problems. any widespread relapse relatively favourable trend globalization deregulation, relatively benign fiscal policy could reverse achievement recent years. an important consideration rein inflationary expectation relate need clarity price stability, effective communication, consistency conduct policy transparency explain actions. central bank speak clearly market listen market carefully ensure intend objective policy. there negative process globalization form great prominence credit asset price boom increase incidence financial crisis. the wave financial liberalization raise risk financial system. the key policy challenge emerge economy would put place mutually supportive safeguard ensure monetary financial stability. the important lesson u financial imbalance build even inflation low hence monetary policy slightly long time horizon term inflation. apart above, merit country great transparency, combine simple rule discretion effective communication. orderly development financial market make big difference regard manner risk shock make impact economy. a flexible exchange rate regime impart great flexibility monetary policy deal shock efficiently. on prudential side, would imply strengthen macro-prudential orientation. monetary policy prudential regulation should, therefore, co-exist. great transparency cooperation monetary policy supervision increasingly recognise world result many central bank publish financial stability reports. although uncertainty economy operate monetary policy itself, uncertainty excuse pursue price stability. in pursuit monetary goals, monetary policy authority could adopt formal model policy rules; informal target rules; case-by-case decision making. in practice, central bank rely exclusively formal model derive final policy. model assist central bank take judgments. furthermore, greenspan recently commented, formal model vastly simplistic despite effort quantify capture variables, inadequate. their knowledge base barely able keep pace complexity world. the problem model complexity world economy. an explicit numerical target good anchor inflation come cost. if explicit inflation target cannot achieve weaken credibility central bank. thus may appropriate formulate monetary policy base simplistic inflation target single point inflexible point target argue many. the risk system emanate variable, exogenous endogenous policy maker response dynamic contextual. rule can, therefore, view thoughtful adjunct policy cannot substitute risk paradigms. a case-10 bi review 54/2003 bi review 54/2003 11 by-case approach provide simplistic framework analysis. ultimately, central bank judge outcome policy choice also take account market expectations. a prudent central banker expect high probability small outcome order avoid small probability high adverse outcome. to conclude, globalise world, possible formulate monetary policy independent international developments. monetary policy formulation become complex interdependent. continuous monitor financial markets, upgradation technical skill central bank, flexibility eternal watchfulness hold key make monetary policy matter evolve global environment. a key factor guide conduct monetary policy achieve benefit market integration minimize risk market instability. an integral component central bank work development financial market increasingly shift burden risk mitigation cost authority markets. the adverse implication excess volatility lead financial crisis severe low-income countries. they ill-afford downside risk inherent financial sector collapse. central bank need take account, among others, development global economic situation, international inflationary situation, interest rate situation, exchange rate movement capital movement formulate monetary policy. eva srejber: financial delegation - i keep check manage money? speech m eva srejber, first deputy governor sverige riksbank, swedish shareholder association, stockholm, 25 november 2003. * * * introduction let begin thank invitation speak swedish shareholder association. during time disposal i intend discus issue opportunity saver ensure money use purpose improve personal finances. this problem dog u quite time rise surface discussion ownership certain swedish life insurance companies. what make question particularly interest representative central bank complication ensue general public lose confidence manage savings. if happen, would affect savers. there risk would affect form poor economic growth. a confidence crisis arise form savings, regardless whether via normal bank accounts, direct purchase share deposit funds, i shall discus issue general level focus present problem life insurance companies. drive force behind save the deregulation financial market begin sweden 1980s signify major change swedish savers. suddenly much great right decide money take many save decision previously central government monopoly. the rapid innovative development financial market also give saver great opportunity choose different type savings. it surprise time also see large increase financial savings. the deregulation process explain this. the tax reform return low-inflation economy explanatory factors. however, underlie trend mainly due demographic changes. a recently 1980s, people invest great part save real assets, house durable consumption goods, well human capital, i.e. various form education. since then, financial investments, whether bank account various type securities, take large part people’s savings. this change broadly explain people adapt consumption thereby save accord different life phases. when young, consumption usually exceed income. this people start family, get education, buy car house apartments. to cover expenditure, u borrow money. a year go by, income rise, enable people reap fruit investment human capital, already make major investments. their debt begin pay financial save increase. one conclusion large percentage young people relation old people, large save real assets. on hand, country slightly old population relatively large percentage financial savings. this description apply quite well sweden. bear mind need change population development put onto pension welfare systems, also reasonable assume private financial save need increase near future. this require future able manage one’s finance retirement. i discuss link development inflation speech i hold 19 november. confidence form foundation when come savings, u probably want diversify much possible. of course, want receive good return savings, reasonable risk level. we also become aware net return, is, return deduction various charges, determine much save worth. the demand well-diversified save relatively low cost create basis substantial expansion passively-managed share index fund recent years. investment fund reflect development give index, mean active management become unnecessary. the fact fund widely successful, bi review 54/2003 1 least develop markets, see bi report institutional asset management present last spring.1 a report also shows, development financial market open exotic market sector savings. active management common markets, opportunity pan gold nugget outperform market average consider great here. this development great significance efficiency function supply financial sector. here i think possibility risk management conversion save risk capital investment. the financial sector also important functions, i discuss today. diversification, i mention earlier, one example household simply relatively cheaply reduce risk savings. the increase confidence saver feel diversification offer various save company increase flow capital saver investors. a national boundary le distinct within financial world, capital able move useful, whether sweden elsewhere world. deregulation enable market force utilise great extent allocate capital manage risks. once society take step, must take step ensure individual saver confidence market actors. the possibility financial system supply function important economy efficient manner base existence confidence. a glance rear-view mirror show confidence cannot take granted. what happen life insurance company good example this. although crisis fairly limited, clearly show fickle confidence be. the amount new save life insurance company decline time now, scandal skandia fuel savers’ mistrust. accord survey sifo print göteborgs-posten newspaper 2 november, three-quarters swedish public lose confidence life insurance company revelation scandals. herd behaviour cause problem the risk confidence problem arise connection financial delegation, say, i put management save hand someone else, cannot ignored. this largely form financial delegation contain potential conflict interests. the person manage save may quite different interest me. one example herd behaviour observe among asset managers. to extent, question rational behaviour base asset earn money charge pay savers. it important least good average avoid lose battle savers’ money. otherwise, much difficult attract new savers. from perspective, cost poor average weigh heavy gain good average. it rational asset manager act way counterparts. if everyone else buy it shares, i asset manager also buy avoid deviate much rest. the major problem turn could negative effect financial markets. it appear case. herd behaviour highlight one several possible reason recent stock market bubble ensue crash. large fluctuation financial market make save le secure. well-diversified savings, instance fund invest share debt securities, normally provide good protection change share price interest rates, people aware now. on hand, le certain realise asset managers’ behaviour contribute major fluctuation markets, turn make well-diversified save risky ought be. if incentive programme use motivate individual asset manager base success relation competitors, reinforce negative herd behaviour. these problem aggravate construction index many asset manager assessed. this one aspect take bi report i mention earlier. the weight use calculate company’s share many popular index base company’s market value. this tend lead overvalue company overrepresented 1 committee global financial system, bis, 2003, “incentive structure institutional asset management implication financial markets”. 2 bi review 54/2003 index. a asset managers’ opportunity deviate index underweighting overvalue company often limited, unavoidable result manager may force invest company consider overvalued. naïve view bonus programme the remuneration structure manager list company another potential source conflict interest affect savers. link senior management’s income development share price increase probability company management shareholder interests. senior manager concentrate increase value company, give high income. the idea reduce risk senior manager occupy business benefit development company. this also benefit invest money save company turn invest company. the whole idea is, course, base share price also reflect form fundamentally expect change value company. however, corporate scandal recent year show naïve link bonus solely short-term development share price. this evidently give le scrupulous senior manager incentive try affect share price creative account dubious deal attempt affect report profits. if type bonus programme function, require much sophisticate system merely link bonus temporary change share price. the bonus must base actual, sustainable improvement company’s result must ceiling. on hand, one wonder good salary consider enough incentive good job. whatever circumstances, observe tremendous pressure general public authority make changes. we therefore able assume improvement made, reduce risk senior manager act way detrimental shareholder save indirectly company’s shares. ownership issue important difficult many people point increase institutional save culprit bonus drama. the ap pension funds, insurance company various type asset management company try avoid take active ownership role far possible. the reason give active ownership benefit savers. active ownership cost money also make difficult withdraw company one dissatisfy with. the institution say prefer vote feet. if dissatisfy company, quite simply sell hold it. one consequence reluctance exercise active ownership power transfer company managers, able grant unreasonable fringe benefits. the emergence institutional owner also lead pronouncement advantage old, traditional family ownership. personally, however, i entirely convince best form ownership. in sweden mean one owner able control company despite small capital contribution, know pyramiding. a case excessively powerful company managers, owner act way benefit shareholders. in sweden desire control corporate group probably often important drive force among traditional owner family interest increase worth shares. personally, i believe sweden would benefit institutional investor elect take interest ownership issue check manage savings. this would reduce risk expression avarice see abb skandia. there also sign institution begin think along lines. for instance, couple ap fund take fairly firm stand ownership issues. however, important continue discus role institutional owners. a potential conflict interest find shareholder mutual fund participant bank-owned investment fund companies. accord swedish law, investment fund company shall limit liability company act maximise value shareholders. if shareholders’ interest interest contribute capital coincide, grind conflict. one example bank-owned investment fund own share bi review 54/2003 3 company bank turn interest lender. if development company motivate sell shares, turn could put risk capital bank lend company, risk bank would try influence investment fund company retain shares. on hand, risk exaggerated. in sweden protagonist themselves, well finansinspektionen (the swedish financial advisory authority), prevent potential conflict burgeoning. in addition, considerable incentive act way benefit savers. bad deal would lead risk saver sell share perhaps reduction new savings. dividend ban circumvent the conflict interest see mutual life insurance company different could arise bank-owned investment fund companies. this special construction life insurance companies. the surplus mutual insurance company shall fall saver thus may pay dividends. despite ban pay dividends, common mutual life insurance company tie property liability insurance companies. one may wonder why. probably way earn money saver life insurance. it usually property liability insurance company manage capital life insurance company certainly free. although finansinspektionen task examine whether remuneration pay case reasonable, regular procurement procedure management task difficult determine whether contract benefit savers. a possible move money, saver opportunity take action dissatisfied. the present discussion skandia concern whether right wrong sell management contract den norske bank. however, problem case rather fundamental contract give property liability insurance company task manage life insurance company’s capital. it also common property liability insurance company handle sale life insurance company’s insurance policies. this contract expose competition, either, mean possible remuneration property liability insurance company could lower. there number example money could transfer life insurance company property liability insurance company. for instance, one could ask whether skandia ab’s sale property skandia liv really make market prices. folksam liv grant loan sister property liability insurance company nature risk capital. however, interest loan appear low require risk capital. the question able happen many years, without anyone reacting. we cannot blame ignorance problems. they bring various context year without trigger major discussion. perhaps current system become firmly establish mind unable see actual risks. this case me. during late 1980s i board director försäkringsinspektionen (the swedish private insurance supervisory service), i cannot remember issue discussed, despite fact problem now. everyone, government finansinspektionen corporate management consumer organisations, aware problems. despite this, little done, apart introduction possibility establish profit-making companies. lock-in effect i try give example conflict save chain could negative effect value savings. such conflict inherent form financial delegation not, course, limit sweden. the prevail institutional structure individual country lead conflict express different ways. but fact competition savers’ money allow take full effect probably important factor cases. from international perspective, difficult claim supply save product sweden small. on contrary, sweden fare well type comparison. here problem rather competition curb various type deadlock effect stem old day regulation sweden. 4 bi review 54/2003 bi review 54/2003 5 the capital flow ap pension fund safeguard legislation. regardless think management, little influence it. formerly, ap fund use political aim subsidise house build allow buy house bond treasury bond market rates. fortunately, case today. other part pension save go via collective agreement labour market company alecta amf. we cannot influence management money either. some life insurance pension policy turn protect taxation regulations. the premium “p insurance policies” make tax deductible income tax returns, together limit opportunity transfer money mean save lock in. there also lock-in effect regard save investment fund company attach banks. reluctance pay capital gain tax sell mutual fund share make saver le will sell shares, despite dissatisfaction fund growth. this course problem also affect save directly equity. these various form lock-in effect curb competition save market, together obscure ownership many limit companies, probably detriment savers. a problem significance competition concern financial advice. in unite state whole cadre independent financial adviser connection company sell various save products. this case sweden. here still accept investment advice come people earn money manage savings. it self-evident close link role far ideal. time change so shall do? we must ensure confidence maintain market participants. there evidently need review institutional framework regard mutual life insurance companies. it sufficient general requirement reorganise themselves. the government’s decision appoint commission look problem therefore welcome one. until commission put forward proposals, important ensure people abuse position replaced. this precisely happen skandia. that good. i think illustrate market economy works. even people upset event life insurance companies, need entail widespread confidence crises. some form prevention achieve point alternative efficiently-functioning, diversify save offer market. broad index fund low fee one example. it also important point need serious financial advice independent company sell save products. there market sweden, even expensive. however, release entire potential competition save market would provide best guarantee savers’ capital use purpose improve savers’ finances. if achieve this, lock-in effect currently hamper competition must broken. this turn require change tax regulation good opportunity insurance policyholder move money. i aware complicate issues. however, make le important deal quickly possible. thank you. lee hsien loong: seize opportunity address mr lee hsien

follow several negative quarters, financial sector start grow second third quarters. a result, growth first three quarter year average 2.5%. the sector register moderate growth rest year, strengthen 2004. prospect singapore’s financial centre what improve economic financial outlook mean singapore’s financial sector? back 1998, financial sector review group develop strategy grow financial sector, think singapore could become international financial centre certain activities, like london. for example, already fourth large fx centre world. we want build strength money market treasury centre become debt hub asia. at time, respect hop emulate zurich. we could become premier international asset management centre asia. after all, well-respected regulatory, legal account system stable socio-economic condition already make singapore location choice private wealth. after five year promotion development, achieve encourage results. the debt market grow 3-fold since 1998. we attract foreign issuers, corporates tap international market here. however, remain largely market domestic focus. we therefore need make market deeper, liquid internationally established. the prospect good. asian country cooperate closely develop domestic bond markets. a corporates region expand business take advantage recovery, need funding. we also see clear trend towards derivative product structure investor look good yield protection. all factor help u continue grow debt market size sophistication major debt hub. in equity market, global trend five year ago seem towards cross-border alliance linkages. this generally work out, except limit extent europe. indeed, last year difficult stock market world-wide. however, year thing seem turned. in singapore, stock market activity reach record level recent months. activity stay strong, portfolio inflow anticipation economic pickup next year. the increase interest sgx list exchange, company substantial operation china encouraging. there also new interest among regional exchange explore alliance other. we maintain position lead global fx centre, open opportunity le apparent 1998. one area commodity trading. financial institution also major commodity players, financial product structure base commodity price underlie risk. these structure trade team usually business unit fx experts, number base singapore. in investment banking, time interest seem concentrate north east asia. south korea recover asian financial crisis fast rest, china create great excitement. however, strong investor interest recent deal southeast asia indicate revival regional m&a activity. many singapore firm interest expand overseas, possibly acquisition strategy. with economic recovery firm likely increase capital expenditure, country invest infrastructure big-ticket projects. this foster pickup syndicate loan market asian dollar market. one particularly successful area wealth management, prospect remain good. in fund management, global mandate increasingly manage singapore. the industry also expand breadth depth. beyond market portfolio management, fund management firm also locate regional function trading, risk management research singapore. more hedge fund also set here, add industry’s diversity. private bank continue sterling performance, asia-pacific fast grow region private bank world. accord merrill lynch, asia-pacific high net-worth individual wealth jump 11% last year, support high save rate robust gdp growth key regional economy china, south korea australia. this figure could underestimate, give low penetration high net worth individual asia private banks. banker manage private wealth attract location enjoy political social stability posse well-respected regulatory, legal account systems. singapore attribute well place become premier centre private bank business asia. reputable well regulate regime like singapore provide location choice investor financial intermediary alike, especially renew emphasis corporate governance integrity excess dotcom era. we exploit advantage become regional risk mitigation centre, instance area clear & settle otc exchange-traded products. the current outsource off-shoring trend would also present opportunity us. one estimate two million job would create lower-cost location like india china next 5 years. while cannot compete india china cost, compete process activity mission critical high value-added. in past year, major financial institution relocate higher-end middle back-office operation here. these institution take view singapore’s develop infrastructure, reliability, skilled manpower make u suitable time-sensitive mission-critical functions. in bank sector, go 7 local bank 3 last 5 years. singapore bank grow large stronger, continue build regional footprints. a regulator, ma happy make progress strengthen management team build risk management systems. last year, one rat agency even rank singapore bank among strong asia whole world.5 however, international standards, three local bank group still rather small, despite make regional acquisition undergo domestic consolidation. the large them, db group, rank 96th world term assets. the bank also mainly singapore banks, rather regional player strong presence several countries. possibility domestic growth limited, consolidation. but country region like india korea open financial sector foreign participation, regional global player start explore opportunities. the local bank would conscious industry trends. doe size matter local banks? there differ views. one view does, economy scale increasingly important. the pursuit size global financial industry underway several years, despite less-than-successful merger overseas, still on-going. the recent merger bank america fleetboston financial would create second large u bank total asset nearly us$1 trillion operation across 34 countries. in view, size also enable bank diversify across geography products, give much strong base. this way industry moving. if singapore bank make significant regional players, least, risk marginalised, perhaps eventually absorb players. however, others maintain contrary view. they hold size essential bank financial industry success. there exist successful small player excel particular market specialise area expertise, singapore bank among these. furthermore, bank expand fast grow business assimilate new acquisitions. over-rapid expansion result weakness mistakes, turn small strong operation large vulnerable one. it singapore bank shareholder consider oppose argument continually reassess strategies. they need decide whether need scale compete effectively, whether achieve consolidation home, expansion acquisition abroad, combination both. ma cannot make judgment them, though continue strength bank system depend make right judgment call. whatever outcome, need core strong local banks, stability financial system hinge that. overall, prospect financial centre look good. last year, employment fell slightly mergers, consolidation general economic weakness, bad seem behind us. more job create new activity attract expansion 5 fitchratings, the singapore bank system, 19 apr 2002. establish area like wealth management. the financial sector continue important contributor economic growth. iv. progress review mas’ 2003 business priority let u briefly review well ma achieve business priority past year focus must grasp opportunity arise financial service upturn. manage within risky environment first, manage within risky environment. the financial industry ever-changing - risk management practice constantly test challenge new business model financial products. the impact innovation safety soundness financial institutions, resilience financial system always obvious. regulator must continually seek identify manage new evolve risks, without inhibit creativity dynamism markets. a continue shift one-size-fits-all risk-focused supervision, modified, adapt update specific supervisory practice methodology line industry developments. in last year, take step clearly define (1) objective desire outcome supervision, (2) function ma perform directly facilitate indirectly achieve outcomes, (3) principle guide supervisory approach. this help u steer environment continuous change great uncertainty. we intend publish framework idea issues. in area supervision, continue build institutional knowledge. this include understand key risk area individual institutions, manage risks. we keep ask fundamental question: what could go wrong institution supervise? then allocate appropriate supervisory resources, depend probability potential impact different mishaps. we also make progress implement risk-based capital requirements. the risk-based capital requirement sgx member company take effect october. the model insurer rigorously test implement next year. in banking, international risk-based capital standard already exist, ma work local bank prepare basel ii. we go prescribe approach bank adopt, encourage put place advance risk management practice would enable move internal ratings-based approach choose so. to enhance risk management capability institutions, also issue comprehensive guideline international best practices. we recently complete imf/world bank’s financial sector assessment program (fsap). accord preliminary findings, assessor conclude singapore’s financial sector robust short-term vulnerabilities. while take heart positive fsap findings, must complacent. we must remain vigilant ensure continue confidence financial system. strengthen partnership industry second, strengthen partnership industry. ma collaborate industry several areas. we embark joint initiative sgx cultivate strong research-oriented environment stock-broking industry. we also partner bank establish cheque truncation system, include singapore dollar one 11 global currency cl (continuous link settlement). the participation cl eliminate fx settlement risk, consolidate singapore’s position lead fx trade centre key node global financial system. last year formally adopt policy extensively consult industry new regulatory changes. since january 2003, issue 17 consultation papers. the feedback industry abroad, useful help u formulate changes. deepen talent pool third, deepen singapore’s talent pool. a move towards provide high value-added services, face intense competition talent. we need deepen talent pool train local workforce whilst step effort attract foreign talent requisite specialist skills. the industry need professional market experience skill deal increasingly complex volatile financial markets. to meet demand, need enhance train development initiatives. besides co-funding financial skill train financial sector development fund, actively promote singapore financial train hub. discussion on-going newly establish wealth management institute insead well major institution develop corporate train centre corporate universities. we would also like build singapore’s financial research capability asian emerge market focus. we currently explore possibility establish financial research institute, partnership establish financial research institute worldwide. enhance market discipline to enhance market discipline, facilitate establishment industry-sponsored independently-run complaints-handling process mechanism customer settle dispute bank insurers. the bank industry consumer mediation unit insurance industry insurance dispute resolution organisation (idro). presently, work security industry study feasibility industry-based dispute resolution scheme capital markets. together government agencies, launch national financial education programme “moneysense”, aim improve basic financial literacy consumers. the “for consumer” portal mas’ website provide one-stop access financial education materials, include consumer guides. v. ma workplan 2004 the past year challenge one many fronts, ma make good progress meet business priorities. with global regional economic recovery, many new opportunity emerge. to capitalise opportunities, identify three key thrust 2004 workplan. enhance competitive operate environment the first thrust enhance competitive operate environment. we aim follow areas. we enhance transparency supervisory initiative policies. to improve financial institutions’ understand statutory responsibilities, ma articulate explicitly systematically intent significant change legislation regulation. we also intend share best practice compliance. we also review process conduct monetary policy light ongoing structural change economy. we look make decisions, communicate monetary policy statement, implement policy, well study transmission mechanism exchange rate affect real economy. next, seek judicious cost-benefit balance regulatory supervisory work. ma compromise safety soundness individual institution systemic stability. but strive supervise institution without place unnecessary regulatory burden well-managed individual institution inhibit innovation dynamism financial sector. compliance cost supervisory action commensurate risk pose individual institutions. we seek consistency apply equivalent prudential market conduct standard financial institution conduct similar business activity subject risks. harmonise integrate regulation supervisory practice across financial activity reduce opportunity regulatory arbitrage. work towards win-win outcome singapore region second, must work towards win-win outcome singapore region. the growth development singapore depend health world economy, well-being neighbour trade partners. a hub gateway region, singapore benefit region competitive attractive investor new businesses. southeast asia must work together make attractive, especially new opportunity competition arise north east asia. last month, asean leader agree bali build asean economic community 2020 - single market production base free flow goods, services, investments, capital skilled labour. asian country need foster close cooperation integration financial system market region. this facilitate financing, payment settlement intra-regional trade. it also improve work capital markets, business raise capital need conveniently low cost. asian country make great effort regional financial cooperation. when succeed, hopefully spur country go further. they recently launch usd asian bond fund. although lead big bang, underscore interest among asian economy develop capital markets. in consultation private sector, regional central bank work local currency abf. a financial centre, singapore well place seize opportunity regional market integrate. we pursue two-pronged strategy. first, actively participate regional initiative objective make singapore key “interchange” regional financial flows. within asean asean+3, singapore lead initiative strengthen capital market capacity-building effort foster great cross-border collaboration among regional capital markets. we advocate adoption international capital market standard practice asean essential market foundation. we realistic regional market take time develop accept cannot force pace. but need stay engage strengthen linkage major economy emerge regions, offer high value-added activity secure place key node region. on own, already work establish exchange linkage major market enlarge market coverage singapore. second, work take full advantage new ftas currently negotiate create great financial flow singapore, enable financial institution access markets. in comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (ceca) india, explore close integration financial markets. both country stand benefit financial sector player operate seamlessly two markets. while many regulatory issue addressed, see unique opportunity india singapore. empower consumer achieve fair deal third, must empower consumer achieve fair dealing. this help u develop inform savvy consumer market, necessary grow vibrant financial sector. with liberalisation, channel save entice investor high yields, bonds, equities, unit trusts, hedge funds, insurance annuity products. these product also carry high risk. ha consumer sophistication rise line complexity financial products? a consumer seize new investment opportunities, far ma safeguard interests? ma long practise merit-based regulation products. it neither feasible desirable ma prescribe consumer cannot invest in, product priced, term condition govern transactions. this would inhibit business enterprise, restrict consumer choice, raise compliance costs. ma cannot intervene commercial dispute individual institution arbitrate contractual matters. therefore, 1997, state rule “caveat emptor” - let buyer beware, watch interests. however, leave consumer entirely alone fend themselves. there may imbalance power consumer financial institutions. consumer may lack information resource participate confidently knowledgeably marketplace. thus, ma help empower consumer promote fair deal establish regulatory framework increase information disclosure sound market business conduct standards. this regulatory regime require offeror investment provide full, timely, accurate meaningful disclosure information consumers, continuous basis. the intent consumer make inform decisions. one objective “money-sense” financial education programme equip consumer skill tool evaluate financial products, judge risk involve take responsibility actions. to address issue mis-selling misrepresentation financial intermediaries, ma facilitate set affordable efficient channel aggrieve consumer seek recourse. this necessary market discipline work, consumer receive fair dealing. with channel place, aim develop consumer self-reliance. let illustrate principle two examples. my first example aia critical year issue. this commercial dispute aia policyholders, resolve bilaterally them, whether negotiations, industry-based dispute resolution mechanism court last resort. ma could intervene. but ma responsibility ensure policyholder full information aia offer them, worth, alternative had. ma also strong interest see idro, industry base dispute resolution mechanism, work. thus ma ensure information disseminate promptly, accurately adequately, policyholder could make consider decision. we issue policyholders’ guide help affect policyholder understand policy option available them. aia ask issue public statement explain fully clearly support package adjudication process. ma also make clear industry dispute arise jurisdiction authority idro, would contemplate introduce statutory regulatory mechanism dispute resolution. full disclosure work dispute resolution mechanism precondition disclosure-based regime self-reliance work. the aia dispute simmer many months. eventually aia respond concern policyholders, include raise case behalf, revise substantially improve offer. a offer address many early concerns, ma welcome publicly. this one instructive example consumer investor bodies, case, play useful role bring together articulate common concern consumers. the second example structure deposits. structure deposit become popular new investment instrument provide chance high return conventional fix deposits, exchange risk low return bet turn wrong. however, calculation return risk product may complex. the average retail investor may understand outcome depend on, much le judge odds thing work favour. investor may also mislead assumption that, deposits, product safe. nevertheless, ma prohibit structure deposits, would restrict investor choice would benefit neither industry consumers. but disclosure-based philosophy, important consumer understand exactly buying. so ma propose guideline full meaningful disclosure risk involved, include reasonable illustration potential benefits, clear explanation limit returns. we also require bank distribute product treat investment product rather deposit sell over-the-counter bank tellers. these guideline currently consultation. ma monitor market develop see action required. go forward, produce educational material help consumer understand product better. vi. conclusion we stand threshold cyclical economic recovery amid profound structural change global economy. for first time, emerge economic powers, china india, thrust global economy. they force major reorder economic landscape, whether term new competition investment exports, new market products. despite problem complexity asia faces, dynamic region world. we need continue restructure singapore economy move value chain economic activities. singapore continue role important financial centre despite change environment challenge pose china india, must find way benefit developments. financial service continue area competitive advantage. the economic recovery present great growth potential. we need position capitalise opportunities. market player must seek seize business opportunity arise. they must continually reassess strategy remain competitive change world, importantly, implement good strategy vigorously create new opportunity themselves. ma continue ensure integrity financial sector, singapore remain attractive regional hub financial sector activities. it also adapt respond market development facilitate competitive operate environment. together, ma financial industry navigate wind economic change strengthen position premier international financial centre. pavel racocha: join eu - impact financial sector new member state

sector, different. this brief presentation cannot deliver basic description past development financial market transition country current standing. hopefully data presentation serve background information interest studies. the financial sector new accession country undergo huge substantial reform last 13 years. when communism collapsed, trace market economy, free legal entrepreneurial economic activity, institution necessary function market economy. if look transition economy - represent 8 10 accede country - today, see completely different picture. the basic institution place run (though sometimes slowly always predictably). the private part economy flourish symbol new well function economy. how happen? and happen financial sector? and impact accession eu financial sector, accession country synonymous bank sector. in 1990, average start point reform former socialist countries, situation financial sector bleak. there service aside basic bank insurance functions. the bank sector comprise specialize institutions, monopoly area [one institution monopoly collect deposit public, another institution provide foreign trade financing, yet another institution allow open account individual foreign exchange incomes]. then monobank, important financial institution, perform functions, commercial bank central bank [however skew could centrally plan economy]. we also understand commercial bank evaluate loan application look projects’ fundamental clients’ credentials. in former socialist countries, state plan commission decide much certain production would get produce whom. the role bank limit find fund finance plan production. it important acknowledge situation outset economic political reforms. this would also help u understand problem transition economy go late on. thirteen year ago basically real banks, capital markets, experience staff experience management. in addition that, capital banks. the ratio capital banks’ asset average well 1%. at time, boom entrepreneurial activities, ten thousand new company sprout up. their common characteristic history, experience, capital, great need debt financing. on top this, law changing, institution [such prudential bank supervision] build gradually, state decisive owner bank sector duty good manager. a say above, bank sector represent crucial part financial sector country. therefore, also one hit seriously course economic reform, especially credit allocation side. on contrary, deposit continue grow despite negative real interest rate. bi review 53/2003 1 the economic transformation include

policy introductory statement mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), hear stand committee finance economic affair storting (norwegian parliament), oslo, 1 december 2003. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. the statement partly base assessment present “report monetary policy 2003 - first eight months” norge bank’s inflation report 3/2003. the chart pdf find norge bank’s website. * * * i would like thank storting invite norge bank appear first time committee report answer question monetary policy connection storting’s deliberation government’s credit report. the mandate the operational target monetary policy define government inflation close 2½ per cent time. the target symmetrical - equally important avoid inflation rate low, avoid inflation rate high. the inflation target provide anchor economic agents’ expectation concern future inflation. it provide important basis choice concern saving, investment, budget wages. households, businesses, public entities, employee employer base decision assumption inflation norway 2½ per cent time. we open economy free capital movements. the krone exchange rate fluctuate day day. we instrument fine-tune krone exchange rate. stable inflation expectation may nonetheless contribute stabilise exchange rate. stability exchange rate exchange rate expectation time dependent stable inflation expectations, turn depend low stable inflation. norge bank set interest rate future inflation equal inflation target 2½ per cent. high demand good service labour shortage normally point high inflation. an increase interest rate curb demand keep inflation bay. when demand low unemployment rises, inflation tend slow. interest rate reduced. the inflation target therefore vehicle for, obstacle to, monetary policy’s contribution stabilise output employment. this objective also express regulation monetary policy. normally, norge bank set interest rate view achieve inflation 2½ per cent two-year horizon. there two reason this: • change interest rate affect inflation lag. • a reasonable balance usually achieve stabilise inflation one hand smooth fluctuation output employment other. a rapid pronounce change interest rate may appropriate case risk inflation may deviate considerably target long period, heighten turbulence financial market cost- push shock result wage negotiation indicate confidence monetary policy jeopardy. financial market confidence inflation target provide norge bank great scope promote stability output employment monetary policy. this scope also increase inflation target incorporate anchor wage formation. we also indicate event runaway overall credit growth sharp rise property house price well equity prices, may necessary reassess time horizon. it would general possible achieve inflation target horizon short two year change interest rate rapidly markedly. this might, however, great impact output employment. bi review 53/2003 1 norge bank base monetary policy flexible inflation targeting, variability output, employment inflation give weight. how change interest rate affect economy? norge bank’s monetary policy instrument key rate. norge bank’s key rate affect short-term money market rates, expectation concern future development key rate decisive banks’ deposit lend rate bond yields. it may useful distinguish three channel monetary policy operates: • the demand channel • the exchange rate channel • the expectation channel the effect inflation change interest rate occur lag may vary intensity. in time take change interest rate fee through, factor also impact result change inflation output. we cannot assume various relationship entirely stable. a interest rate fall, household municipal consumption investment tend accelerate. this money leave service debt borrow le expensive. corporate finance strengthen investment may become attractive. high demand lead high output employment. wage growth may pick up. high wage growth combine high profit margin result high inflation. the effect interest rate change may amplify interest rate also affect krone exchange rate. when interest rate lower, people borrow money few invest nok. low interest rate thus normally lead depreciation krone. import good become expensive inflation accelerate. a weak krone also boost export improve profitability norwegian business industry. the effect exchange rate change interest rate vary theme sentiment shift foreign exchange market. we believe expectation play important role price wage set. expectation concern future inflation economic stability considerable impact, least foreign exchange market. inflation expectation also influence wage demand effect company adjust prices. it may difficult form opinion expectation generated. confidence inflation target may provide anchor. past inflation rate may also influence think inflation future. there thus interaction inflation expectation inflation. if confidence monetary policy, expect inflation equal close inflation target. this contribute stabilise inflation around target. the expectation channel thus amplify effect monetary policy. we therefore place considerable emphasis ensure households, companies, social partner financial market participant confident inflation remain low stable. to question high price expect rise, companies, social partner others answer expect rise 2½ per cent time. financial market participant also expect future inflation 2½ per cent. this reflect development long-term bond yields. this indicate monetary policy underpin confidence future inflation 2½ per cent. consumer price development there wide fluctuation norwegian economy 1970s 1980s. economic development mark high variable inflation. the fix exchange rate regime, introduce 1986, reinstate monetary policy instrument economic policy norway lay foundation stable economic development late on. inflation slow gradually end 1980s around 2½ per cent average since then. the prolong period low stable inflation probably contribute anchor inflation expectations. 2 bi review 53/2003 when government introduce flexible inflation targeting, set target core inflation 2½ per cent time.1 core inflation slow past 12 month considerably target. stabilise development output employment accord mandate, one aim monetary policy stabilise development output employment. the economy grow time. output move waves. actual output alternately long- term trend. the difference trend output actual output call output gap. stabilise output mean aim keep actual output close trend level. we pronounce economic cycle norwegian economy. the downturn begin 1990s follow upturn 1993. this upturn peak 1998. the economy shift upturn high growth rate expansion low growth low unemployment, labour shortage many sector strong growth labour costs. in recent years, capacity utilisation decline high level par level prevail year 1995-1997, rise cost accelerated. consumer price inflation 2003 background deviation target in year 1998-2002, norwegian economy characterise substantial labour shortage considerably high rise labour cost among trade partners. last year fifth consecutive year high annual growth. wage growth substantially high level time consistent inflation target normal productivity growth. pay increase vary widely across different groups. in norge bank’s view, therefore substantial risk new wage-wage spirals. further round strong wage increase might lead decline output employment. monetary policy therefore tighten interest rate increase last summer krone remain strong. at one-year horizon, strong krone would push inflation 2½ per cent, subsequently effect strong wage growth would dominate. last year, norge bank’s executive board strike balance consideration stable inflation development short term consideration stabilise development output employment. inflation thus expect intend low 2003. in october 2002 inflation report, inflation project fall 1¾ per cent summer 2003. however, price development uncertain even six month year ahead. there thus possibility inflation could fall even low projected, one percentage point target. a may 2003, core inflation (measured cpi-ate) one percentage point target. average core inflation 2003 project 1¼ per cent. the difference outcome projection thus prove nevertheless unusually wide, largely reflect fact economy expose sizeable, unexpected disturbances. inflation 2003 push particular fall price import consumer goods. the low rise import price inflation consequence appreciation krone throughout 2002 low inflation abroad. the rise price domestically produce good service also slow somewhat. this particularly case price domestically produce good influence world market prices. weak expect economic development 2003 the krone appreciate autumn 2002 end year assume projections. this relate unexpectedly weak development global economy result low interest rate abroad wide interest rate differential norway countries. 1 a measure core inflation rise consumer price adjust tax change exclude energy product (cpi-ate). bi review 53/2003 3 negative event account scandal large u companies, fear terror, war iraq spread sars contribute weak growth low inflation countries. development international equity market risk high oil price also contribute strengthen krone. change economic outlook abroad clearly reflect development interest rate expectations. interest rate expectation u adjust downwards considerably since summer 2002. the apply europe. development interest rate expectation reflection ail world economy. the situation change somewhat since summer. a slightly rapid rise interest rate abroad expected. fluctuation exchange rate monetary policy ease interest rate development abroad substantial influence effect interest rate set norway. about 40 per cent appreciation krone may 2000 january 2003 explain increase interest rate differential norway countries. when equity bubble burst 2000, capital move equity interest-bearing securities, affect capital flow exchange rate movements. this shift theme explain 55 per cent appreciation krone. a third reason may high oil price fear war terror would disrupt oil supply.2 while growth norwegian economy stall last winter, wage growth moderate rapidly expected. this considerable influence inflation outlook. the interest rate reduce 4.5 percentage points, krone appreciate 10 per cent. the interest rate reduction year make significant contribution bring inflation back target. in short term, effect primarily channel weak krone. in somewhat long term, fall interest rate also lead high inflation would otherwise case strong demand norway. inflation back target two-year horizon we expect inflation move stabilise around inflation target two-year horizon. output employment pick up. in projections, capacity utilisation stable output gap, calculate norge bank, close zero.3 uncertainty associate inflation projection projection uncertain. experience uncertainty surround inflation forecast would indicate monetary policy orient towards reach target 2½ per cent, inflation remain within interval +/- 1 percentage point around target four five years. this consistent experience country inflation target regime. it noted, however, level accuracy base period stable inflation oecd countries. the interest rate reduction fall krone exchange rate imply inflation gradually increase considerably high current level early next spring. after period low inflation witnessed, appropriate particularly vigilant monetary policy event inflation increase projected. 2 these estimate uncertain must therefore interpret caution. the analysis development exchange rate may 2000 january 2003 discuss detail bjørn naug (2003): “faktorer bak utviklingen kronekursen – en empirisk analyse” (factors underlie development krone exchange rate – empirical analysis), norge bank’s occasional papers, no. 31 (norwegian only). 3 these projection discuss detail norge bank’s inflation report 3/2003. the analysis base technical assumption interest rate move line expectation financial foreign exchange markets, imply interest rate remain current level well 2004. thereafter, interest rate norway assume rise gradually pace interest rate countries. the forward exchange rate imply moderate depreciation krone projection period. 4 bi review 53/2003 share employment back trend a mention earlier, development output gap measure output stability. fluctuation output also reflect change share work age population employed. this share employment show rise trend since early 1970s, trend since 1996. this year, appear share employment trend level. the exchange rate fluctuate fluctuation krone exchange rate become pronounce since 1996 par fluctuation currency small economy float exchange rate. the krone fluctuate 9.24 7.22 krone euro/ecu since 1997. norge bank set specific target level exchange rate. however, change krone exchange rate are, course, important interest rate set affect inflation development activity. the response change exchange rate depend expect impact inflation, output employment. this require evaluation reason duration change. very short-term fluctuation krone exchange rate tend limit effect economic developments, long-lasting change impact. however, difficult determine whether exchange rate change permanent temporary. long-term relationship exchange rate price in 1980s, rise price norway considerably high among trade partners. measure common currency, price high, time remain fairly stable relation trade partners. the ratio norwegian foreign price today, convert currency, substantially different average past 30 years. there evidence suggest exchange rate contribute cushion change price ratio.4 when inflation norway high among trade partner period, krone tend depreciate. when expectation inflation norway develop approximately line countries, exchange rate also normally return normal range period krone particularly strong particularly weak. this relationship reason stability exchange rate exchange rate expectation time dependent stable inflation expectations, turn depend low stable inflation. evidence indicate inflation target provide sound anchor exchange rate expectations. however, expectation also depend fundamental condition development government expenditure revenues, productivity growth, oil price term trade, exclude oil. deterioration competitiveness follow several year high wage growth high wage growth several year erode competitiveness norwegian business sector. last year, effect high wage growth amplify change krone exchange rate. although nominal krone exchange rate depreciate year, competitiveness norwegian industry still rather weak. the krone revert around level prevail mid-1990s, labour cost manufacture rise 13 per cent5 among trade partner period. the development krone exchange rate prove reversible, loss competitiveness job cause relatively high wage growth norway difficult recoup. a precondition considerable improvement competitiveness probably real wage growth low productivity growth business sector period. experience show occur period excess capacity economy. this mean change competitiveness time 4 q. farooq akram (2003): “reelle likevektsvalutakurser norge” (real equilibrium exchange rate norway) norge bank’s occasional papers, no. 31 (norwegian only). 5 wage figure trade partner revise since publication “report monetary policy 2003 – first eight months”. bi review 53/2003 5 6 bi review 53/2003 depend real economic factor aspect wage formation cannot control monetary policy. however, flexible inflation targeting, social partner normally expect low wage growth great impact competitiveness result weak krone. in norge bank’s assessment, outlook internationally expose sector bright today year ago rise cost slow markedly. a mention earlier, decrease wage growth great importance enable u reduce key rate towards international level. we expect inflation pick first half 2004. output employment probably grow somewhat trend. again, thank give opportunity deliver statement. lars heikensten: the riksbank’s work financial stability speech mr lars heikensten, governor sverige riksbank, göteborgs university, göteborg, 25 november 2003. * * * first word thank invitation address today. i feel privilege speak felix neubergh lecture. in autumn 1992 decision short notice require sweden’s government parliament: choose support swedish bank without really know large support might be, risk financial crisis unforeseeable consequence swedish economy? all swedish bank incur large loan losses. and regardless much particular bank lost, international credit market little confidence swedish bank system. the bank face severe finance problem might ultimately lead failure could make difficult short run swedish company cover fund requirements. the decision reasonable alternative - rescue swedish banks. the government issue general guarantee banks’ liability set authority, bankstödsnämnden, specifically cope bank serious difficulties. the government, explicitly support opposition, act vigorously promptly situation required. but entail make decision - basis insufficient information cause depth crisis - could burden government budget least hundred billion kronor. that experience wish repeat. sweden recover crisis occasion many instance way resolve serve model countries. the crisis also focus attention work financial stability. with grow complexity payment system financial sector’s expansion, financial stability become increasingly important issue riksbank, central bank around world. a review the bank crisis spawn certain amount self-criticism, least riksbank. in practice, bank back function promote safe efficient payment system systematic analytical work. the problem arise take riksbank, along many others, surprise. so start build knowledge analytical capability field stability. the work initiate modest scale handful staff. it narrow focus early detection weakness bank system might lead another bank crisis. the riksbank also decide publish report would discus situation bank sector stability. internal report produce earlier. in autumn 1997 riksbank accordingly present first cohesive public analysis financial stability. the new report intend signal importance riksbank attach work stability also help focus develop internal efforts. the experience work inflation report encouraging, seem natural build work communication issue stability way. by launch financial stability report or, call initially, financial market report, riksbank first central bank issue public account appraisal financial system stability. it example follow date thirty countries. recurrent financial crisis make clear always problem authority oblige address way may therefore assistance clear, structure presentation approach financial stability. this lead international monetary fund, example, pay grow attention issues. since 1999 imf world bank engage joint evaluation national financial system call financial sector assessment program. matter stability also agenda almost every time i meet colleague countries. bi review 53/2003 1 principle financial system oversight first i perhaps reiterate mean financial system. it system provide payment services, convert save financial resource investment consumption, contribute facility manage risk. in words, financial system perform number important social functions. if function disrupted, social cost could high. the damage inflict disruption would probably particularly great involve vital component payment system. this readily understand one consider enormous flow payments. in sweden, instance, payment system daily turnover around sek 500 billion, mean equivalent annual gross domestic product handle le week. study show, moreover, past fifteen year dozen crisis cost country concern least 10 per cent gdp. so good reason state supervision financial system. the riksbank function riksdag (sweden’s parliament) make u accountable promote safe efficient payment system. a major grind make u responsible efficiency stability that, along banks, riksbank central player payment system provide mean payments. the bank distribute note coins, keep transaction account link giro system operate credit card systems. the riksbank turn provide account payment system, rix, available large-value interbank payments. the work financial stability undertake three main ways. one concern rule regulation set bind operation financial companies. another continuous surveillance system perform finansinspektionen (sweden’s financial supervisory authority) well riksbank. thirdly, state need able manage crisis nevertheless occur. the work stability call highly develop cooperation finance ministry, finansinspektionen riksbank. the law govern financial operation enact riksdag, finance ministry important agent. more detail regulation issue finansinspektionen, also monitor observance. the riksbank’s contribution work rule regulation consist first place submit opinions; addition, bank participate international effort develop regulatory framework. the role riksbank surveillance work central focus function financial system whole risk may arise. the identification risk system whole means, moreover, individual institution financial infrastructure scrutinised. it primarily finansinspektionen extent also riksbank need keep continuous eye individual banks. due central function banks, crisis bank system might swiftly serious consequence payment system well supply credit. but significance bank payment system source credit warrant supervision. a the economist write last spring, bank “the hazardous economic institution know man”. that may sound rather drastic truth it. it banker tribe irresponsible gambler much-needed function economy require act certain ways. bank essentially matter take risks. a bank’s fund (its deposit loan banks) liable disappear short notice, realise asset take longer. moreover, problem one bank liable spread banks. this systemic risk exist bank liability form loan security transaction participate payment system. the similarity operation also mean problem elsewhere may hit bank group. contagious effect may occur, moreover, simply people suspect bank inter-connected. to grow extent, oversight system stability call oversight financial infrastructure sense system need effect payment trade deliver financial products. bankgirocentralen case point. if system function properly, le risk problem either spread participant financial markets, arise system disrupted. the third aspect surveillance work - crisis management - possibility state need act prevent crisis jeopardise system stability. in order manage crisis, state 2 bi review 53/2003 must able judge consequence distress institution fail and, consequence likely serious, measure take mitigate them. the solution case may contribute orderly closure, others may provide financial support. an example latter general bank guarantee state provide sweden’s bank crisis. in certain case may riksbank provide assistance liquidity. if bank’s problem serious stability threaten - bank consider viable long run - riksbank grant credit special term act usually know lender last resort. the continuous surveillance crisis management closely connect other. oversight essential riksbank’s ability judge whether crisis constitute threat financial stability. without continuous analysis banks, would difficult determine whether support provide crisis. the work oversight crisis management the riksbank present analysis system stability every six month financial stability report. the report basically aim provide picture swedish banks’ ability stand disruptions. the purpose identify conceivable risk present sound analysis influence market’s participants. the task riksbank perhaps describe keep cool restrain undue optimism seem problem upward phase, fill picture, necessary, downward phase allay concern serious loan losses. the analysis concentrate four major swedish bank size make likely relevant system stability. the failure one bank might jeopardise stability, though mean certain. the durability bank dependent number factors. the riksbank analysis main category borrower, development bank group financial infrastructure. borrower analyse term corporate household sector general, particular reference level debt future ability pay. the real-estate sector consider separately company account much one-third banks’ corporate lending. the price commercial property private house also analyse reflect value collateral pledge loan bank mortgage institutions. in swedish bank expand operation nordic country baltic region, development country become increasingly important them. borrower abroad account approximately half banks’ total loan stock. the analysis borrower therefore extend abroad. the major bank group analyse various respects. profitability trend illustrate ability bank build reserve unexpected losses. moreover, always strategic risk bank weak profitability tempt try new, bold line business order generate high return equity. the analysis banks’ credit portfolio provide indication loan loss likely develop come year two. another aspect analysis banks’ liabilities. traditional bank involve accept deposit use fund make loans. people’s grow propensity save instrument bank account force bank finance growth credit borrow capital market. the structure bank fund provide indication risk bank liquidity. monitor perhaps difficult part liquidity situation liable change rapidly. if problem one bank group spread player system via banks’ mutual commitments, payment system may affect immediately. the riksbank therefore keep eye interbank exposures. oversight infrastructure concentrate system vital function financial market sweden. besides rix, system large-value payment provide riksbank, primarily central security register (vpc), stockholm stock exchange clear system retail payment (bakgirocentralen bgc). bi review 53/2003 3 the riksbank also choose work practical matter risk management. these issue invariably complex. financial crisis arise short notice, least account massive payment flow bank tend large element short-term funding. the ongoing integration may make thing even difficult. the riksbank therefore build internal crisis organisation clearly document event crisis, include contact put picture, press informed, legal consequence various measures. another important element work readiness regular crisis exercises. crisis management also come feature prominently sweden’s international profile. this experience well basic stand importance transparency. the riksbank lead nordic european work group field. one article late financial stability report publish yesterday deal role riksbank lender last resort. it discus principle determine situation riksbank consider provide support distress bank term support. many country reluctant talk matter openly fear bank tempt take great risks. the riksbank, hand, see openness mean deter great risk-taking. clear game rule mean bank know expect. future stability work much do riksbank’s work stability past seven year hard pick field room improvement. the analysis borrower abroad enhanced. the riksbank need acquire good understand bank manage liquidity, select source fund effect durability. the analysis stability also need supplement method stress tests, is, way analyse sensitivity bank durability. to obtain inspiration work improve analysis, riksbank commission external evaluation work financial stability. this evaluation hand trio represent international research frontier, central bank world swedish bank sector. they bring individual perspective bear joint effort evaluate quality focus work build up. we intend publish report issue invitation broad discussion work’s future direction. in conclusion i would like say something - without prejudice trio’s find - issue i believe grow importance future. a natural starting-point discussion identify force drive future financial developments. three main force are: – grow cross-border integration europe, – advance risk management banks, – focus aspect efficiency. consequence european integration it perhaps increase international dependence affect u clearly. while bank system europe still largely national, integrate system start appear certain regions. this trend seem come furthest nordic-baltic region grind expect great integration elsewhere, too. a result, national bank system become increasingly interdependent. this number dimension riksbank’s work stability. one component work consist promote integration influence construction rule systems. we conviction integration favour economic growth. the current rule system design integrate european bank market transcend national borders. moreover, common legislation take integration account limit extent. in order achieve inner market financial services, eu strive produce uniform set rule possible financial company throughout union. bank compete equal term give rise common market competitive enterprises. 4 bi review 53/2003 the riksbank support admirable ambition. but also important avoid conceivable pitfall may hamper development. one danger rule system become excessively detailed, harmonisation start strict exist system instead proceed entirely open discussion. integration also affect regular supervision oversight. the current principle home-country supervision. in words, bank’s legal country domicile responsible supervision bank’s branch offices; bank subsidiary, hand, supervise country subsidiary legally domiciled. but still legal country domicile parent bank responsible supervision bank group whole. this solution ought work long foreign operation bank fairly modest. but happen banks’ foreign branch become systemically important? how much responsibility home country will take financial stability country foreign branch located? and authority latter country prepare relinquish responsibility essential part financial system home country parent bank? these abstract issues, see fact nordea, domicile sweden, large bank finland swedish bank major part bank system baltic states. thus, seem supervision international bank group could lead problem coordination duplication. on whole, appear lack incentive supervise cross-border bank operations. the problem rather certain case rule system prevent active country exercise supervision, liable fall two stools. on hand, excessively generous right supervise lead burden supervision unduly heavy individual banks. that could hamper integration well efficiency. formalise crisis management difficult part work stability. discuss crisis management perceive sensitive troublesome extent concern state’s willingness assist financial sector liquidity. the divide line whether discuss openly often run country experience financial crisis not. those live crisis generally favour transparent process. a clear-cut arrangement management crisis difficult construct advance. it hard tell present problem resolved. in principle two conceivable approaches. one involve continue cooperation agreements, joint principle regulatory frameworks. the supranational management. it probably combination two needed. the important thing today, however, debate complex issue get way find situation necessary instead deal emergency. more advance risk management another factor probably affect future work supervision oversight stability banks’ increase possibility manage risks. the assessment risk one banking’s traditional functions. thing change markedly respect since mid 1990s. technical progress new financial theory lead refinement method possibility measure credit risks. this accompany facility trade risk additional financial instrument increasingly international markets. all enhance ability bank manage risks. bank general - large international group - invest new system risk management. the trend, begin earlier, accelerate new capital adequacy rules, basel ii, produced. all major bank sweden work actively issues, partly expect result small capital requirement. for riksbank, course decrease capital requirement relevant much fact new rule make good allowance actual risk different credits. finansinspektionen central role ensure financial company honour letter spirit basel rules. this turn lead adequate price risk thereby efficient financial system. bi review 53/2003 5 a problem discuss connection recent method risk management basel ii possibility development accentuate cyclical fluctuation economy. in basic idea behind basel ii size bank’s capital dictate credit risk lending, possible bank capital requirement thereby cost credit co-vary business cycle. the increase credit risk associate economic slowdown mean bank need capital. this, feared, might lead contraction credit downturn expansion upward phase thereby make cyclical fluctuation pronounced. there grind criticism. experience business cycle teach u large credit risk tend take business cycle approach peak. however, solution problem lie oppose new risk management technique basel ii. they help promote financial stability. but need bank find way handle effect arise accentuation cyclical fluctuations. it important economic development credit venture capital available even business activity cyclically low - perhaps somewhat le activity peaking. besides influence bank handle capital, advance method risk management lead creation new financial instruments. two example securitisation credit derivatives. this enable bank divest credit risk loan hedge credit derivative market simply sell risk securitisation loans. the credit risk economy spread agents. that fundamentally favourable financial stability market efficiency. at time, authority must follow development closely order understand credit risk end up. their departure bank sector mean disappear economy; turn instead different form somewhere else, instance insurance company mutual funds. do new risk management facility also mean bank operation take different direction? will bank try slim large illiquid balance sheet sell loan securitising assets? and mean long describe hazardous economic institution know man? this development come unite states, market finance considerably important sweden rest europe. so would similar trend, current predominantly relation-based lend replace market funding, imply cyclical supply credit sweden? strong focus aspect efficiency a third driving-force clearly affect financial system strong focus aspect efficiency. permit touch briefly. improvement financial infrastructure recent year make safe robust various ways. for example, settlement routine use bgc vpc considerably secure before. every component infrastructure good solution continuity, mean operation ensure even connection extreme events. now serious shortcoming rectified, focus shift enhance efficiency give framework safety. considerable social gain make infrastructure efficient. this apply central settlement system perhaps even different payment instruments. increase automation great use electronic payment instead paper-based instrument cash generate large save society general. although may amount single krona even le per transaction, save add large amount payment require modern economy. economy great efficiency feature prominently banks’ activity recent years. for authority always important consider condition competition balance force efficiency, economy scale. it also important monitor development ensure level risk rise again. moreover, riksbank major player payment system. we must also scrutinise activity continuously ensure approach impair economic efficiency general. 6 bi review 53/2003 bi review 53/2003 7 from i say future work hopefully clear financial market change rapidly present development excite many ways. the riksbank continue central player work. talk issue feel natural university. perhaps i even succeed inspire become involve question contribute future developments. thank you. mark w olson: functional regulation financial modernization remark mr mark w olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, annual meet national conference insurance legislators, santa fe, new mexico, 22 november 2003. * * * introduction my thank national conference insurance legislator (ncoil) invite speak today, special thank former senator, cal larson, host. you’ve ask provide think financial modernization functional regulation, discus specifically issue may, perspective federal reserve board, relate insurance. i’d like discus first importance cooperation federal reserve system state insurance supervisors. then i’ll describe lesson feed learn participant dual bank system. i hope hear experience useful consider initiative enhance state insurance supervisory system. my comment today necessarily represent view fellow board federal open market committee members. cooperation federal reserve state insurance supervisor the mccarran-ferguson act long keep supervision insurance within exclusive domain states. for past century, - is, federal reserve state insurance professional - travel completely different circle practical reason well. the federal reserve little insurance issue bank bank hold company responsible little involvement insurance. in fact, federal legislation charge federal reserve supervise bank hold company - bank hold company act 1956 - enact large part prevent affiliation one large bank country large insurance underwriter. congress go strengthen separation bank insurance 1982 amendment act generally prohibit bank hold company engage insurance agency activities. at point insurance underwrite sale activity bank organization constrain four limit categories: bank organization permit underwrite sell credit-related insurance; state-chartered bank could engage insurance sale state law either grant explicit permission contain implicit authority activities; national bank could engage insurance sale small towns; limit number bank hold company grandfathered thus allow continue insurance activity start prior enactment 1982 amendment. the historic statutory separation bank insurance alter 1999 congress enact gramm-leach-bliley act (glb act) allow well-managed well-capitalized bank affiliate insurance underwriter insurance agencies. that bring federal reserve state insurance professional circle. to date, 630 bank hold company choose become financial hold companies, vehicle glb act bank, insurance, security affiliation may take place. of those, 165 (more 25 percent) use new glb act authority engage insurance agency activity 26 (fewer 5 percent) engage underwrite insurance unrelated credit. all company must comply state law govern sale underwrite insurance. the significant interest bank organization sell insurance make sense. the bank system still dominated, number, small bank organizations. more 90 percent bank country total asset le $500 million each. bank size quite large branch network - end last year almost 67,500 branch 7,800 commercial bank country. enter insurance market agent, underwriter, fit naturally nature bank industry dominate small providers. bi review 52/2003 1 more broadly, bank organization develop good network system deliver financial product consumer - business model always require manufacture product. insurance increasingly view product stand own, important item menu financial vehicle help consumer create portfolio financial assets, manage financial risks, plan financial security. many consumer prefer make financial decision purchase financial plan product single location offer full package financial services. thus, bank organization natural alternative delivery system insurance underwriter look expand customer base. the affiliation bank insurance underwriter modest. one large bank organization affiliate large insurance underwriter, one large insurance underwriter acquire small bank. in addition, several foreign bank insurance operation abroad begin offer insurance bank product unite states. before glb act, foreign bank organization require choose operate bank unite state engage insurance activity unite states; generally could both. whether affiliation insurance underwriter bank organization become common unclear. insurance underwrite involve much large commitment resource insurance sale and, apart underwrite credit insurance, seem far little synergy banking. bank insurance company far seem determine whether make business sense mesh manufacture distribution insurance manufacture distribution traditional bank products. the experimentation begin way would expect. for example, insurance company long think trust fiduciary power bank would offer opportunity manage insurance payouts asset large estates. and bank organization experiment manufacture insurance product deliver. these trial run need time work out. what important federal law long prevent marketplace evolve industry experimenting. the result beneficial consumers. with development come new supervisory challenges. a i mention earlier, federal reserve little expertise supervise insurance companies. while type risk common bank organization insurance companies, products, business practices, historical framework insurance industry unique outside experience. similarly, risk operation bank bank hold companies, area expertise, quite different typically see domain insurance supervisors. the obvious supervisory approach suggest different risk regulatory scheme cooperative functional regulation match supervisory expertise risk encounter regulate entity. this cooperation functional regulatory scheme require glb act. but also make good supervisory business sense. it crucial supervisor talk order understand risk pose functionally regulate entities, one other. it also important supervisor overburden organization duplicative conflict regulation destroy cost save consumer benefit affiliation. consequently, examine insurance underwriter insurance agency business bank hold companies. instead, defer appropriate state insurance authorities. we also rely report information insurance company provide state insurance authority understand activity financial strength insurance company, rather impose report requirement insurance companies. importantly, establish successful partnership national association insurance commissioner (naic) many state insurance supervisor enhance mutual understand supervisory framework facilitate share supervisory information consumer complaints. to date, information-sharing agreement nearly state district columbia. while agreement spur important affiliation require information sharing, process establish agreement introduce u appropriate authority state begin relationship improve supervisory cooperation effectiveness difficulty develop road. it important open line communication among supervisor framework relationship state prepare u respond development needed. 2 bi review 52/2003 we also work naic state insurance supervisor compare supervisory approach identify resolve trouble organizations. bank insurance company must comply different minimum capital requirement - requirement tailor businesses. it important circumstance affiliate bank insurance company experience financial stress, bank insurance supervisor able work cooperatively resolve stress without take step help one regulate institution expense other. we think effort understand other’s supervisory tool process identify resolve trouble institution allow functional regulator work effectively cooperatively find early effective solution trouble institutions. to improve understand issue develop insurance industry, also establish resource center board federal reserve bank boston monitor development insurance industry. we particularly value fruitful relationship organization naic, welcome input work help educate u important insurance issues, various state insurance supervisors, foster cross-training opportunity us. state regulation multi-state entity when senator neil breslin, chairman ncoil’s state-federal relation committee, testify early month house financial service committee, identify several initiative state take address issue involve modernization state insurance regulation. ncoil commend initiate efforts. while many structural difference bank insurance industries, i would like share experience bank supervisor maintain viable state bank supervision option increasingly interstate bank environment. until early 1980s, bank prohibit combination federal state law establish branches, even bank affiliates, across state lines. in mid-1980s, several state begin experiment interstate compact allow bank affiliate bank states. by 1994, consensus interstate bank important enough bank consumer congress repeal federal prohibition interstate affiliation establish framework interstate branching. at time, congress greatly limit ability state restrict interstate entry out-of-state banks. a result, bank industry flourish customer benefited. bank provide product service seamlessly customer nationally, include customer wide geographic operation customer move geographically. and customer gain convenience afford bank wide footprint branches. at time, interstate expansion pose challenge u supervisors. although federal reserve limit geographically, partner supervisory effort state authority constrain state lines. interstate expansion supervisory framework tie state boundary mean state-chartered bank operate interstate basis face possibility regulation charter state well state bank establish branch office, plus overarch federal supervisor. in addition potential conflict burdensome duplication multiple supervisor presents, state bank operate multistate basis must compete nationally charter bank supervise national basis single regulator. to meet challenge, work state supervisor develop uniform seamless approach supervision. under auspex conference state bank supervisors, various state bank supervisor develop protocol cooperation examine collect information multistate banks. this protocol deal examination two types. responsibility safety soundness examination rest charter “home” state bank. however, protocol recognize state bank branch - so-called host state - also legitimate interest monitor safety soundness bank operate within borders. thus, allow host state conduct safety soundness examination out-of-state bank branch state. it contemplate however host state conduct safety soundness examination emergency situation part examination conduct home-state supervisor. the protocol rely robust information bi review 52/2003 3 share coordination state supervisor federal bank agency take place examinations. responsibility compliance applicable consumer protection law divide among state supervisors, state supervisor responsible monitor compliance local law local offices. examination compliance federal consumer law instance leave federal bank agency others share state bank supervisors. in addition build strength system state bank supervisors, realize supervise large interstate operation require different significantly sophisticate technique employ small local banks. for example, bank examination practice many year focus review sizable number individual loan file bank. this amazingly intrusive time-consuming process. and become increasingly obvious institution grow size, technique practical large scale. over time, develop more-sophisticated sample technique well method identify focus examination area great risk bank organization. we continue review policy effort bank employ identify risk faces, set implement standard address risks, monitor effectiveness risk-management practices. this approach involve examination policy procedure review statistic loan default experience entire portfolio rather large number individual transactions. we process develop more-sophisticated approach capital well. the current “basel” capital standard develop 1988 negotiation conduct bank supervisory authority auspex bank international settlement basel, switzerland. current effort replace capital accord new version (called basel ii) take decidedly risk-focused approach measure risk. the propose approach would build technique use large bank worldwide produce result much consistent exist standard market perception risk. it would separate risk component part give supervisor important new tool evaluate level risk, also performance responsiveness bank management. although propose standard challenge implement enforce, also provide important necessary incentive manager large institution adopt more-sophisticated practice measure manage risk. we also develop risk-focused technique review compliance applicable consumer laws. at time, - like state insurance commissioner - establish consumer complaint division federal bank agency monitor investigate individual consumer complaints. to sure, system risk-focused supervision bank organization rely heavily cooperation among multiple state federal supervisors, perfect. but working, think work effectively. state-chartered bank remain competitive strong, asset share state-chartered bank remain relatively constant. while bank industry’s continue consolidation widely recognize total number u.s. commercial bank continue decline, le evident consistent charter new bank - roughly one new charter every three consolidations. seventy-five percent newly charter bank state banks. the state charter apparently le attractive bank gain new power expand nationwide. certainly, could postpone interstate bank devise perfect system supervise it. the marketplace moving, adjust role take account that. the system develop bank arena evolutionary one, one continue work improve. i know work hard similar effort insurance industry. i understand sante fe, number important effort underway, include proposal involve model law would govern market conduct surveillance property casualty insurance regulation. the institution supervise face challenges: competition grow number front unregulated entities, consumer sophisticate choose financial products. regulate institution must allow respond change marketplace survive. less-regulated institution prevail process diminish protection regulation seek preserve. at time, course, cannot forget require 4 bi review 52/2003 bi review 52/2003 5 law supervise entity jurisdictions, protect public, preserve strength financial system. to conclude, i offer one final think important subject financial regulation legislation. while regulator legislator responsibility set maintain standard safety soundness benefit consumers, cannot ignore power market force cause continual development consumer financial products. improvement technology consumer techno-literacy prompt dramatic change financial industries. yet change seen, likely still early stage realize full benefit technological innovation. our effort regulator legislator continue relevant consistent change market forces. lars nyberg: some swedish experience financial stability surveillance speech mr lars nyberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, bank indonesia, jakarta, 10 december 2003. * * * introduction first i want express thank bank indonesia invite conference. financial stability - lack - topical subject light event past decades. furthermore, financial stability issue seem strikingly similar countries, whether big small. it make good sense, therefore, different central bank talk experiences. and, always, best experience come mistake made. with mind, i shall tell little sweden look stability surveillance today. first, background. systemic stability come serious threat swedish bank crisis begin 1990s. a late case indonesia, risk severe financial instability lead government intervention. a decision short notice require sweden’s government parliament autumn 1992: should choose support swedish bank financially without really know expensive support might be, risk financial crisis unforeseeable consequence swedish economy? the decision take reasonable option - rescue swedish banks. the government issue general guarantee banks’ liability set special bank support authority cope bank serious difficulties. the government, explicitly support opposition, act vigorously promptly situation required. but entail make decision - basis insufficient information cause depth crisis - could burden government budget least 10 billion u dollars. have take important decision short notice without adequate information financial system experience wish repeat. the riksbank accountable swedish parliament regard keep stable price level - inflation target - also regard promote financial stability safe efficient payment system. after crisis room self-criticism respect. in practice, support stability target systematic analytical work overall stability. to address this, start build knowledge analytical capability field stability. by publish financial stability report 1997, among first central bank issue periodic public account appraisal financial system stability. it example follow date thirty countries, include indonesia. today, interest financial stability well established. the crisis 1990s reveal serious flaw macroeconomic management also, importantly, structure, regulation operation financial system. most major financial crisis various country around world emanate override economic financial problem rather bank-specific issues. if override problem identify early stage, crisis might prevent least effect might reduced. financial stability work bank focus work financial stability. this bank institution ensure function payment system. we know experience individual company unable make ordinary payments, credit function society disrupted, may disastrous effect economy. insurance companies, finance companies, security broke firm may also important society, critical system way banks. but bank critical stability. their balance sheet also contain built-in source instability. banks’ fund generally short term nature quickly disappear, asset long maturity cannot realise quickly. should depositor financier lose confidence bank, could face acute liquidity crisis. moreover, problem one bank spread banks. bank liability one another due loan security trading, bi review 58/2003 1 participate payment system. contagion effect also arise economic player suspect connection banks. bank encounter difficulties, even original suspicion completely unfounded. give this, work financial stability may undertake along three main strands. the first concern rule regulation set bind operation financial institutions, notably banks. the second continuous surveillance system perform supervisory authority well central bank. thirdly, management crises, since, unfortunately, must assume crisis may occur must prepare handle them. i discus three strand turn, concentrate last two. 1. regulatory framework first, course, financial stability rest legal structure, establish bind operation financial institutions. the parliament responsible legislation financial operations, supervisory authority issue detail instructions. in many countries, include sweden, experience 1990s pave way thorough review legal structure financial sector. in context, worth note law regulation today great extent develop international negotiation basel committee and, u europe, eu. the role central bank process comfortable one knowledgeable observer, pose relevant question work group committee point inadequacy suggest solutions. there much say process, i shall leave different occasion. 2. day-to-day oversight the second strand financial stability work day-to-day oversight. this may describe rest three pillars: • first pillar supervision individual banks, • second pillar surveillance systemic stability, • third pillar payment system oversight. the first pillar clearly responsibility supervisors, whether separate fsa or, many countries, department within central bank. the supervisor collect data banks, analyse data make on-site inspections. prudential supervision perform competent authority must basis day-to-day oversight. the second pillar joint responsibility fsa central bank. the division responsibility really one perspective. while fsa base work individual institutions, central bank look bank system whole attempt ass risk could arise short long run. of course, overlap task fsa central bank, often fruitful approach problem somewhat different angles. detail important, look detail sometimes miss overall picture. this, least, one conclusion draw sweden experience 1990s. the third pillar oversight supervision financial infrastructure. this relatively new task derive complicate technical legal system handle financial transaction today. the infrastructure particular importance central bank, since would probably provide emergency liquidity assistance anything go wrong. the infrastructure dominate system clear settlement payments. in sweden, like many countries, manage large-value payment system in-house central bank. but infrastructure also include stock exchange, derivative exchange, central security depositary (csd) connect trade systems. well-designed system reduce risk contagion financial market institutions. they also reduce risk infrastructure cause problem through, instance, operational disturbances. 2 bi review 58/2003 the financial stability report in sweden, main tool address oversight systemic stability report financial stability. the report, sweden well countries, basically aim provide picture banks’ ability stand disruptions. factor might influence bank simultaneously focus, instance emergence burst financial bubbles, excessive debt leverage certain economic sector structural change lead reduce revenue increase risks. the purpose identify conceivable risk present analysis influence behaviour market participants. a first relevant question whether stability report really would help prevent crisis. will financial sector read listen central bank say? will kind moral suasion sufficient? could write report late 1980s would make bank see see? we know. but least long management memory last crisis, likely listen. and crisis develop slowly, certainly thing done. i shall return question i talk crisis management. let turn main element stability report i see them. first, look banks’ borrowers, long healthy bank usually well. borrower analyse term corporate household sector general, particular reference level debt future ability pay. the real-estate sector consider separately lend sector country major part banks’ total lending. the price commercial property private house also analyse least reflect value major part collateral pledge loan bank mortgage institutions. insofar bank conduct activity foreign countries, stability surveillance also need encompass development country ensure negative development destabilise banks. second, major bank group analyse various respects. profitability trend illustrate ability bank build reserve future unexpected losses. moreover, always strategic risk bank weak profitability tempt try new, bold risky line business order generate high return equity. our analysis banks’ credit portfolio provide indication loan loss likely develop come year two. another aspect analysis relate banks’ liabilities. traditional bank involve accept deposit use fund make loans. people’s grow propensity save instrument bank account force bank finance major part growth credit borrowing, mostly short-term funds, capital market. the structure bank fund provide indication risk bank liquidity. monitor perhaps difficult part since liquidity situation liable change rapidly. 3. crisis prevention turn last financial stability issue, crisis management, view mainly question prepared. or prepare possible, i say, adequately prepare unknown? there basically two type crisis: slow crisis fast crisis. by fast crisis i mean single severe event like fraud, major loan loss general event quickly lead loss market creditor/depositor confidence. these case call quick action. normally central bank take lead ability provide emergency liquidity assistance access update information liquidity situation market. but close cooperation required, especially supervisory authority, information individual banks, ministry finance, need solvency support. in experience, many possibility process fail. misunderstand information, unclear leadership conflict interest may delay process late. the chance solve fast crisis increase enormously institution involve prepare it, e.g. crisis management drills. such drill tend uncover shortcoming conflict may prevent smooth cooperation really needed. a slow crisis, hand, may detect always prevent financial oversight. in slowly develop crisis time prepare action, may even include new legislation, instance bank resolution. bi review 58/2003 3 4 bi review 58/2003 to detect crisis may sound easy, practice difficult. for instance, gradual increase asset price actually turn unsustainable bubble long constitute reflection fundamental values? look house market country around world right now. be bubble and, so, they? another problem timing. at point central bank sound warn bell? by act early, might add volatility market place hence worsen situation. remember central bank hold accountable negative repercussion prick bubble, potential le tangible benefit do so. by act late, hand, fulfil mandate full-blown crisis might prevented. in addition problem timing, problem select appropriate response threat. the first line defence moral suasion, i.e. try convince bank market participant act proper fashion. the problem moral suasion may difficult calm market rush new heights. still, publish financial stability report issue warn relevant parties, possible influence public discussion. the second line defence prudential regulation. discussion could hold supervisory authority ministry finance solutions, strict formal regulations, call improve risk management system condition order strengthen banks. a good example hong kong monetary authority, which, situation unrealistic property prices, use power gradually low loan-to-value ratio property collateral order limit bank lending. a third line defence course use monetary policy, practice probably mean raise interest rate prick bubble. this, view, clearly option. but also strong argument central bank try respond asset price credit expansion change monetary policy stance. and certainly situation unlikely work. i shall leave issue now, however, listen another hour. conclusion let conclude say much do work financial stability past years. still, hard identify area room improvement. the analysis borrower counterparties bank home country, also abroad, need enhanced. central bank need acquire good understand bank manage liquidity, select source fund effect resilience disturbances. the analysis stability also need supplement method stress tests, is, way analyse sensitivity bank shocks. another area prove challenge stability analysis risk management preparedness future ongoing integration europe and, generally, banks’ tendency set cross-border establishment many countries. i see great scope close international cooperation issues, term develop method analysis aspect stability surveillance crisis management. i would like thank bank indonesia devote international conference important topics. thank you! niklaus blattner: the task oversee payment security settlement system introductory remark mr niklaus blattner, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 12 december 2003. * * * with revise national bank law, national bank receive explicit mandate contribute stability financial system. this is, particular, lay specifically law task oversee payment security settlement systems. why national bank oversee payment security settlement systems? by oversee payment security settlement systems, national bank support security efficiency financial market infrastructure switzerland. in so, help ensure stability financial system whole. this stability essential successful monetary policy particular, economic efficiency switzerland general. the importance market economy’s financial system derive function fulfils. the financial system responsible allocation financial resource risks, well intermediation saver investors. a financial system describe stable perform task efficiently market institution prove shock-resistant. another part stable financial system secure financial market infrastructures. these include, specifically, payment system system clear settlement financial instrument (securities settlement systems). deficient payment security settlement system might potentially trigger crisis system. an operational technical system failure delay transaction settlement severely - even prevent long period - widespread credit liquidity problem among financial institution result. in particularly serious cases, financial institution concerned, perhaps even financial markets, long able perform role economy limit extent. yet hand, payment security settlement system also play major part prevent transfer payment delivery problem one participant others. such difficulty might also trigger chain reaction could jeopardise entire system. this make architecture payment security settlement system important, determine capacity limit transfer weaknesses. secure efficient financial market infrastructure especially important swiss economy, large financial sector generate significant payment flows. their significance illustrate relevant figures: every day, sum amount around 180 billion swiss franc pas financial institution via swiss interbank clear system (sic), switzerland’s important payment system. with system scale easy imagine problem clear settlement transaction might jeopardise stability financial system whole. i would like outline swiss national bank help ensure efficient reliable financial market infrastructure oversight payment security settlement systems. i would, however, like make one key point right away: state intervention in, regulation of, financial market infrastructure justify must assume private sector necessarily perform function accord manner best economy. in reality, design system operator participant probably consider direct cost would bear event system failure withdrawal participant. however, remain cost bear directly party involve event system crisis tend forget management calculations. it cannot rule out, then, operator participant take le account security system would necessary perspective broad economy. it classic problem market failure. the sense purpose oversee payment security settlement system give due consideration externality would neglect private sector ensure financial market infrastructure provide optimum degree reliability point view national economy. bi review 58/2003 1 the oversight payment security settlement system practice in future, national bank take risk-oriented approach, i.e. deploy resource specific area risk particularly high. the national bank law stipulate three-tier oversight process. the first tier obligation part operator payment security settlement system provide statistical information. the national bank use data collect gain overview breadth importance system instrument clear settlement payment security trade available switzerland. the second tier wide-ranging disclosure obligation impose upon operator security settlement system payment system process payment excess 25 billion swiss franc year. with payment system size larger, national bank look great detail extent might jeopardise stability financial system. finally, national bank law provide power part national bank impose minimum requirement systemically important financial market infrastructure third tier oversight. detail implementation provision oversight lay ordinance issue national bank. in early november 2003, national bank submit consultation draft ordinance interest parties. the draft find website. i would like briefly address three central point connect oversight: system oversee national bank? what minimum requirement operator system fulfil? and finally: collaboration regulatory supervisory authority - especially swiss federal bank commission (fbc) - structured? oversight focus system might constitute threat stability swiss financial system. the question system apply cannot answer precise terms. the ordinance list number criterion consider assess systemic importance infrastructure. in addition type, number monetary volume transaction clear settle via system, outcome assessment depend, example, financial market infrastructure system linked, whether clear settlement transaction divert temporarily another system event failure first system. the latter option alleviate problem somewhat. give criteria, assume group system oversee national bank compose first foremost payment security settlement system part know swiss value chain. these interbank payment system swiss interbank clear (sic), secom security settlement system x-clear, central counterparty. in addition, however, multi-currency payment system continuous link settlement (cls), use settle foreign exchange transactions, may also classify systemically important. close investigation reveal whether group expand include yet systems, operate postfinance. the national bank’s main point reference respect minimum requirement operator system must fulfil two internationally recognise standards: “core principle systemically important payment systems” “recommendations security settlement systems”. like two standard mentioned, national bank’s minimum requirement target-oriented i.e. system operator question largely free determine achieve require state affairs. the minimum requirement aim two aspect reliability payment security settlement system particular. the first relate technical operational security system. the system may cause crisis. specific emphasis place last guarantee virtually uninterrupted system availability. the regular review test emergency plan procedure part this. however, minimum standard also call measure protect integrity confidentiality data well traceability transactions. the second aspect minimum requirement concern risk management architecture payment security settlement systems, i.e. rule procedure transaction clear settled. structure must place prevent weakness financial system, payment delivery difficulty part system participant, spread uncontrolled fashion participants. in context, focus is, example, requirement relate payment instrument used, irrevocability transaction already settle (finality), instrument procedure limit credit liquidity risks. 2 bi review 58/2003 bi review 58/2003 3 collaboration authority the national bank institution actively endeavour secure stability financial system. there also contact authorities. one point contact arise fact that, example, operator secom (sis sega intersettle ag) hold bank licence therefore subject supervision fbc. the fbc still regulatory body responsible institution itself, national bank handle oversight system operate institution. a parallel situation exist case x-clear, operate si x-clear ag - also regulated, bank, fbc. the fbc national bank coordinate activity avoid overlaps. a point contact authority exist case financial market infrastructure systemic importance switzerland operate abroad thus cannot oversee directly national bank. from present perspective apply particular foreign exchange settlement system cls. here too, close collaboration primary supervisory authority, federal reserve bank new york, national bank central bank involve essential. in addition, national bank consider cooperate private sector auditors. in way fbc, work private-sector auditor conduct supervisory activities, national bank intend use dual system certain examination may carry private audit companies. there particular need approach area specific specialist knowledge required, assessment information security. conclude remark two point conclusion: firstly, must emphasise oversight payment security settlement system new task national bank security settlement concerned. a bank banks, already help shape financial market infrastructure limit systemic risk inherent them. in segments, however, new law give national bank forceful range instrument allow act effectively transparently. secondly, would wrong assume explicit mandate national bank oversee payment security settlement system response fundamental concern reliability switzerland’s financial market infrastructures. on contrary - believe swiss financial centre infrastructure function good come well international comparison security efficiency. by oversee payment security settlement systems, national bank help ensure remain future. philipp hildebrand: the swiss national bank’s view international financial market background trend unite state introductory remark philipp hildebrand, member govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 12 december 2003. * * * the past year turbulent one international financial markets, essentially influence trend us. during first half 2003, market development shape economic deflation fear well war iraq. in environment, equity market reach annual low march. in june, bond market yield fell low level. the second half year saw economic recovery us, spread economic region well. capital market long-term yield swiss paper rise approximately 60 basis point low june roughly 2.7%, approximately track yield euro area. in cases, yield follow u market closely, albeit modest fluctuation (see graph 1). under present economic conditions, interest rate environment switzerland still view attractive consumers. the high level new fixed-rate mortgage indication sentiment. the high swiss yield reflect improve economic outlook inflation expectations, modest give still pronounce underutilisation capacities. in contrast capital market yields, money market yield decidedly stable. the three-month libor remain almost constant 0.25%. the global trend capital market yield chiefly determine long-term yield us, shape recovery u economy. in early summer, deflation fear drag yield ten-year u government bond 3.1% - level last reach end 1950s. in july august, however, positive economic data push yield right 4.6%. convexity hedge one factor contribute unusual scale turnaround. a interest rate fell early summer, refinance exist mortgage - possible u time - trigger extensive buy government bonds. u investor hold substantial mortgage portfolio make purchase order keep residual maturity portfolio constant. when interest rate rose, therefore, correction similarly swift. in september, increase doubt voice sustainability economic upswing us: bi review 58/2003 1

year, swiss franc move sideways euro. heavy fluctuation record vis-à-vis dollar. with positive economic data emanate u june onwards, franc initially weaken firm part general dollar consolidation witness since september. on whole, swiss franc hardly register independent movements. it depreciate strongly first half year interest rate decision remain stable since summer. in relation switzerland’s 24 major trade partner euro zone, real exchange rate index swiss franc slightly level begin 1999, i.e. time euro launch. gold market owe favourable economic situation, raw material price continue rise start 2001. at 400 usd/ounce, gold price seven-year high begin december. because weak dollar, gold price increase franc modest. however, peak approximately 17,000 chf/kg still high several years. the main reason rise persistently modest hedge activity gold producers. 2 bi review 58/2003 equity market international equity market exhibit positive course overall, steadily make lose grind mid-march low (see graph 3). a equity environment begin present perceptibly bright picture, turnover also pick up. this, together confident investor sentiment, reduce volatility. the ambitious

synchronise economic recovery take place backdrop external imbalances. an autonomous economic recovery outside u - underpinned, least all, supply-side reform - would help substantially redress imbalances. key feature snb’s future investment risk control process the snb’s investment activity subordinate monetary policy determine criterion liquidity, risk returns. the new national bank law extend snb’s investment opportunities. the current national bank law (nbl) limit eligible investment gold fixed-interest securities, eligible borrower states, international organisation banks. article 9 new nbl define wide scope possible transactions. this allow national bank optimise structure investment view specific central bank needs. a part process, also evaluate possibility enlarge investment universe. however, extension would raise number fundamental question first need examined. before new law enter force, establish publish investment policy directive set govern board plan make use extend investment policy scope. while asset already manage largely conformity principle modern asset management, improvement nevertheless call for. it essential bring internal investment risk control process line new legal framework. the opportunity diversification bring additional investment instrument would, principle, reduce market risk investments. at time, though, snb would incur new risks,

foreign correspondent’s club, seoul, 16 december 2003. * * * open remark lady gentlemen, let begin express deep thank ms. sohn, jie-ae, president seoul foreign correspondent’s club member invite address today’s gathering. over past half-century, correspondent club acquaint entire world korea’s politics, economy, society, culture. at time praise encourage korea’s astonish development. at others criticize advise korea’s outmode practice keep global standards. in way, contribute korea’s growth member international community. today i would like brief movement korean economy past year, prospect next year, need do achieve sustainable growth. i intend focus especially desirability north-south economic cooperation korean peninsula. movement korean economy past year policy initiative a may well aware, year korean economy go difficult period since overcome 1997 currency crisis. in early part year, geopolitical risk run high war iraq north korean nuclear issue world economic recovery still awaited. along woes, spread sars greatly undermine consumer business confidence. after that, situation worsen production setback arise labor dispute damage cause typhoon maemi. despite now-evident recovery world economy match improvement exports, household sector’s over-indebtedness inefficiency country’s social structure act hind recovery consumer business confidence. a result, korea’s gdp growth consider fall 6.3 percent last year 2.9 percent year. on front price current account position, picture rather satisfactory. core inflation show stable movement around 3 percent mark, midpoint target range. the current account expect register surplus around 12 billion dollar year thank briskness exports. in spite price stability current account surplus, economic activity remain doldrums. thus bank korea low call rate target 50 basis point support recovery economic activity, bring may july 4.25 percent current 3.75 percent. for part, government expand fiscal spending. it draw supplementary budget 6.3 billion dollars(7.5 trillion won) year. prospect korean economy next year look ahead, effect pump-priming policy become evident world economy, notably unite states, continue show clear sign recovery, expect gradual improvement korean economy. in third quarter, gdp growth already increase 2.3 percent 1.9 percent second quarter. it think economy bottom move phase mild recovery. next year korea’s gdp growth expect rise 5.2 percent. for part, core inflation next year anticipate show stable movement 2.8 percent. we look see current account surplus scale around 6 billion dollars. bi review 57/2003 1 change growth environment task sustainable growth if judge korean economy prospect next year’s growth, price current account position, might think serious problems. see long-term perspective, however, growth environment surround korean economy change fast. how appropriately respond change decisive future korean economy. these change growth environment largely summarize three headings. the first korean economy’s shift low wage system high wage system. the second dynamic rise neighbor chinese economy unlimited resource low wage labors. and third korean economy inevitably expose worldwide revolution openness. due combine shock three major changes, korean company product grow previous low wage protectionalist framework destine lose much competitiveness. therefore, short-term pump-priming measurer insufficient sustain solid growth path korean economy long run. heighten competitiveness structural reform i describe over-riding importance. firstly, effort financial structural reform step ever. it true korean financial market develop greatly term quality quantity thank drive structural adjustment since 1997 financial crisis. more recently, however, new factor make instability financial market emerged. they include worsen management status credit card company investment trust companies, rise overdue ratio household loans, increase number individual bank’s credit blacklist. bad still, act hindrance economic growth, cause shrinkage consumer business confidence. therefore, important resolve problem pose destabilize factor early stage intensive financial reform korean economy enjoy continue growth. secondly, problem high costs, deeply root area korean society, solved. the major high cost i would identify high house cost cause steep rise property prices, high education cost cause fevered atmosphere private tutor institutes, high transportation cost cause urban traffic congestion. these high cost consequently lead high wages. though cause high social cost vary complicated, say main factor lie development imbalance regions. for reason, important promote balance development region solve problem high costs. and particular, highly necessary devise countermeasure ease concentration population seoul notably kangnam area. lastly, least, problem low social efficiency tackled. typical example low efficiency immature labor-management relations, influence vest interest groups, unproductive political structure, anti-globalization sentiment. these phenomenon mainly arise underdevelopment structure popular consciousness. therefore, korea overcome reinforce social leadership steady effort reform consciousness. that is, korea shift labor-management relation mind-set orient toward conflict confrontation one focus understand cooperation. and shift wearisome unproductive political process one constructive productive, close mental attitude outward-oriented way thinking. the importance north-south economic cooperation korean peninsula so far, i outline three path enhance korean economy’s competitiveness. however, medium- long-term task need long time bring fruition. so then, provide short-term breakthrough strengthen competitiveness? the answer promote north-south economic cooperation korean peninsula. north-south economic cooperation could open new path toward absorb impact korean economy high wage costs, dynamic rise chinese economy, revolution openness. north korea offer low production costs, particularly low-cost labor, also possibility direct inland transport north south. it also 2 bi review 57/2003 bi review 57/2003 3 relatively unproblematic south korea company locate operation share language historical traditions. in addition, people two half korean peninsula sense belong one nation. on basis advantageous conditions, combination south korean capital technology north korean work force lead strong competitiveness high-end information technology sector well as, course, labor intensive sectors. needle say, setting-up brisk economic cooperation north south also important term preparation reunification. at present time, north korea great need basic necessity backwardness industrial facilities. if reunification take place without adequate preparation circumstances, huge number north korean people would flow south look work. this could turn national disaster. for timely prevention situation, need narrow economic gap two korea step investment north korea. in respect, great deal depend whether industrial complex kaesong, southernmost city north korea, prof success. with ground-breaking ceremony june 30, construction first stage kaesong industrial complex underway ticket 180 million dollars(200 billion won). kaesong important stag post road seoul pyongyang, locate 60 km north seoul. and understand within factory complex, minimum wage 57 dollar 50 cent per month. the rate tax low. there also guarantee firm autonomy flexibility management locally-hired human resources. consequently, many south korean company plan set kaesong industrial complex. whether succeed provide touchstone future investment north korea economic cooperation two half peninsula. when look overall picture relationship north south korea, say thaw arrived, even though remain factor make tension north korean nuclear issue. the proportion population side go horror korean war decline rapidly mutual hostility easing. meanwhile, bilateral exchange cooperation constantly expand academic, cultural sport area well humanitarian dimension. it absolutely essential reach peaceful solution north korean nuclear issue order sustain desirable atmosphere foster economic cooperation two koreas. it indispensable also firm assurance security throughout asian-pacific region. i would like ask member fourth estate, give supportive cooperation progress make north korean nuclear issue. close remark a i point today, korean economy face many difficult problems. but probably observed, korean long tradition unite one effort overcome adversity. korea bring “miracle han river”. it rise ash korean war utter destitution become member so-called rich countries’ club oecd within le half century. korea also offer successful example achieve imf’s structural adjustment program. through bold structural reform, able overcome, prudent manner, foreign currency crisis break 1997, exhibit characteristic dynamism. for part, i convince korea move present difficult situation, draw strong foundation build historical experience sense self-confidence provided. thank listen attentively. y v reddy: towards globalization financial sector india inaugural address dr y v reddy, governor reserve bank india, twenty-fifth bank economists' conference - 2003, mumbai, 11 december 2003. the reference speech find website reserve bank india. * * * mr. chairman, distinguish panelists, participant friends, i indeed happy be, again, amongst friend - albeit slightly different capacity. all totally supportive and, i must express deep sense gratitude warm affectionate welcome give appointment. my address today nature share preliminary think process subject globalisation financial sector. the presentation today start framework appreciate globalization provide insight context financial sector, special reference banking. in indian context i would setout initiative reserve bank india, relevant issue globalisation. globalisation: framework the concept globalization, sense use now, trace phenomenon nation states. government-imposed restriction movement goods, services, people capital le hundred year old; fact, passport visa whole gamut restriction feature late 19th century first half 20th century. the nation state put restriction citizen involvement nation state perceive collective self-nterest citizens. in context public policy relate globalization, critical issue trade-off individual freedom collective self-interest also burden proof lies, namely, individual national authorities. globalisation several dimension arise may call consequential enhance connectivity among people across borders. while enhance connectivity determine three fundamental factors, viz., technology, taste public policy, cross-border integration several aspects: cultural, social, political economic. for purpose presentation, however, focus economic integration. broadly speaking, economic integration occur three channels, viz., movement people, good services, movement capital financial services. the notable achievement recent globalization freedom grant some, all, tyranny root place opportunity move connect freely. for example, many indian relatively poor section benefit development middle east many talented profession gain movement uk usa. at time, reality, several economic well non-economic, especially cultural emotional reason people globalising. in regard trade movement good service across borders, two type barriers, viz., describe natural artificial. natural barrier relate various cost involve transportation information distances. artificial barrier relate public policy, as, import restriction way tariff non-tariff barriers. the pace nature globalization depend combine effect technology public policy, national international levels. in regard capital movement also, interplay technology public policy become relevant. there are, however, special characteristic capital flows. these characteristic highlight issue describe contagion, namely, country affect development totally outside policy ambit though domestic policy may, extent, determine degree vulnerability contagion. in case, cross-border flow capital wide macroeconomic implications, particularly term exchange rate directly affect cost movement people well good services; conduct monetary policy efficiency well stability financial system. furthermore, capital flow definition involve future liability asset could involve inter-generational equity issues. bi review 57/2003 1 development technology innovation financial service impact domestic cross-border transactions. the implication public policy development domestic area different foot sense domestic financial market way subject governmental regulation national authority cross-border flow susceptible governmental regulation. finally, context cross-border capital flows, absence procedure deal international bankruptcy facility lender last resort, liability incur private account devolve public account. in brief, juncture, respect global economic integration movement capital, several risk devolve domestic public authorities, especially case develop countries. globalisation complex phenomenon process is, perhaps, best manage public policies. in manage process, develop country face challenge world order particularly burdensome them. yet, many develop country demonstrated, possible public policy manage process view maximize benefit citizen minimize risks. the nature optimal integration, however, highly country specific contextual. on balance, appear great advantage well-managed appropriate integration global process, would imply large-scale effective intervention governments. in fact, market cannot exist vacuum, i.e., without externally impose rule order result public policy. the poor, vulnerable underprivileged continue responsibility national government hence concern public policy. sound public policy national level country like critical current context level development extent globalization. in brief, necessary recognize nation-states, still primarily responsible social order community people live, duty manage process globalization. this challenge particularly complex area financial services, case bank large emerge economies. globalisation context financial sector at outset, would useful consider emerge picture financial flow per late data release imf context increase globalisation. for almost year 1999, current account balance advance economy negative estimate reach u 225 billion year 2004 positive u $ 41 billion 1998. the develop countries, current account deficit u $ 83 billion 1998, estimate surplus balance project u $ 28 billion 2004. it interest note globalization expect result flow capital develop develop countries, clear whether turn arounds current account deficit temporary phenomenon. the removal attenuation cross-border barrier trade capital flow render assessment international financial flow much difficult capture data. it also interest consider pattern net capital flow emerge market economies. while private net direct investment consistently positive u $ 100 billion since 1995 2003, private net portfolio investment positive year 1995 1999 since negative rest years. the range 1995-2003 positive u $ 83 billion negative u $ 53 billion. it is, thus clear term magnitude stability, private direct investment seem significant edge portfolio investment. on quality capital flows, interest note end 1997, estimate share off-shore financial centre total cross border asset stand 54.2 per cent, per recent study oecd discuss g-20 meet mexico. the study mention inadequate access bank information centre greatly facilitate money laundering, smuggle goods, counterfeit finance terrorism, etc. in approach policy relate financial integration, may useful keep fact mind, particularly quantitative qualitative factor flows, particularly context bank sector. a already mentioned, increase recognition distinction trade integration financial integration distinction recognize forcefully recent study make month ago imf. the summary study read follows: “the empirical evidence establish definitive proof financial integration enhance growth develop countries. furthermore, may associate high consumption volatility. therefore, may value 2 bi review 57/2003 develop country experiment different pace strategy pursue financial integration. empirical evidence suggest improve governance, addition sound macroeconomic framework development domestic financial markets, important element strategies. it might essential country develop full set sound institution match best practice world embark financial integration. do might strain capacity country. an intermediate practical approach could focus make progress core indicator note above, namely transparency, control corruption, rule law, financial supervisory capacity……..” apart interest research subject, judgemental basis, consider cross-country experiences, possible discern disconnect impression reality. though many develop country adopt significant policy measure financial integration rest world, capital flow foreign direct investment portfolio investment, predominantly account country high term financial integration rest world. in words, de jure financial integration seem distinct de facto integration. furthermore, way financial market well international financial institution respond economy require adjustment problem appear asymmetrical. the financial markets, fact, tend far pro-cyclical case emerge economies, thus make emerge economy subject great volatility flow countries. it essential recognise capacity economic agent develop economies, particularly poor segments, manage volatility prices, good forex highly constrain legitimate role non-volatility public good. globalization bank sector it overall scenario, policy relate financial services, particular banking, must considered. it interest note wto negotiation financial service cautious commitment many large economy bank sector rather particularly limited. in words, context issue national ownership financial intermediaries, bank appear unique place public policy. there several noteworthy feature ownership control bank major economy - irrespective whether develop emerging. in almost cases, bank either widely hold substantial state ownership. furthermore, special condition govern extent ownership, nature ownership control, transfer ownership control statutory backing. these justify since bank admittedly special. the discussion wto commitment relate open domestic bank sector foreign banks/ownership reflect concern major economies. it worth recall sir eddie george, governor bank england say subject bank special: “they remain special term particular function perform - repository economy’s immediately available liquidity, core payment mechanism, principal source non-market finance large part economy. and remain special term particular characteristic balance sheets, necessary perform function - include mismatch asset liability make bank peculiarly vulnerable systemic risk traditional sense term.” he even forthright make clear treatment bank par non-banks. “on hand, i persuade special public interest bank activity extend non-banking financial institutions, though different functional public interest many case clearly do.” data clearly indicate bank continue play pre-dominant role financial intermediation develop countries. this understandable several reason viz. savers’ eagerness assure income; inadequate capacity manage financial risk fact bank institution sense different degrees, enjoy deposit insurance either implicit explicit guarantee government. it important note bank crisis invariably result heavy cost government, whether publicly owned, privately owned, domestically own foreign owned. the fiscal cost bank crisis ownership-neutral. bi review 57/2003 3 an important question context whether role bank financial integration develop country different emerge market economies. it useful ass significant difference structure bank industry emerge vis-à-vis develop markets. in emerge markets, bank asset comprise well 80 per cent total financial sector assets, whereas figure significantly low develop economies. in emerge market economies, five large bank (usually domestic) account two-thirds bank assets. these figure much low develop economies. another difference bank industry develop emerge economy degree internationalisation bank operations. internationalisation define share foreign-owned bank percentage total bank assets, tend much low emerge economies. this pattern is, however, uniform within world regions. finally, significant feature bank develop versus emerge economies, especially recent years, process consolidation. the notable difference consolidation process develop emerge market overwhelm cross-border nature merger acquisition latter. in particular, cross-border merger activity continental europe also u european institution exception rather rule. in contrast, sharp increase foreign ownership emerge market bank due process privatisation often associate crises. an important difference context role play authority financial sector consolidation process. in mature markets, consolidation see way eliminate excess capacity generate cost save institution. in emerge markets, other, consolidation predominantly way resolve problem financial distress, authority play major role process. indian context while significant progress towards globalisation recent past policy-wise, impressive initiatives, extent india globalise considerably low end emerge economies. this indicate enormous opportunity also challenge term transition stage low base. more importantly, issue financial integration particular integration bank sector consider term overall sequence process integration rest world. the override issue whether globalise not, best manage process globalization, particularly view accelerate process current juncture global outlook india india’s confidence well competitiveness strong. there consensus among academician policy maker trade liberalization take precedence financial liberalisation. even context financial liberalisation, liberalisation regard borrow foreign currency low priority compare capital flows. there also consensus foreign currency exposure households, corporate sector financial intermediary assess separately continuous fashion ass gain well vulnerability system. in particular, great recognition need put place appropriate prudential regulation regard financial intermediary insofar foreign currency transaction concern emerge countries. there virtual unanimity currency mismatch financial intermediary major source downside risk financial integration mitigate monitor regulations. among financial intermediaries, bank doubt unique place. there also strong consensus, globally, importance describe precondition capital account convertibility - particular fiscal front efficiency financial sector. in context maximise benefit financial integration minimise risks, link condition real sector cannot lose sight of. in china, reform real sector precede reform financial sector possibly reason vulnerability latter. in india, reform financial sector start early reform cycle impart significant efficiency, stability financial sector. the financial sector add competitive strength growth reform financial real sector keep apace. in words, flexibility product factor market play part capture gain financial sector reform also generally globalisation. a major agenda reform juncture us, give impressive all-round confidence economy, relate structure function institution particular 4 bi review 57/2003 high transaction cost prevalent systems. there several dimension transaction cost - range legal provisions, judicial system, procedures, etc. attitudes. it propose mention measure contemplate rbi direction. some measure rbi at outset must recognize improvement efficiency financial sector india, particular bank sector respect admiration observers, include capital markets. the bank sector india poise quantum jump productivity scope expansion view competitive strength acquire indian industry. public sector bank show substantial improvements, though view large presence institutional constraints, progress reform desirable. the analysis report trend progress bank india week ago provide excellent overview problems, prospects, area reforms, hence cover here. the ongoing effort rbi, close co-ordination government consultation market participants, especially move policy well regulatory regime global standards, narrate successive announcement monetary credit policy statement dr. rangarajan, dr.bimal jalan, recently mid-term review. these narration would indicate rbi’s effort open economy, maximize benefit globalization minimize risk enable well equip bank face global competition. this ongoing process i believe india good equip ever globalise sense confidence pride. have say this, useful mention initiative consider rbi juncture. governor jalan inaugural address forum january 2001, say - “the long term vision india’s bank system transform domestic one global level may sound far fetch present. however, beyond capacity provide determination”. it interest year, subject choose relate globalization perhaps i enlist measure take rbi demonstrate determination make bank industry really global. consolidation a mention governor jalan address forum 2002, “in financial system worldwide, today buzzword competition, consolidation stability”. there impressive stability considerable competition india process consolidation bank industry commenced. the issue consolidation address narasimham committee report bank sector reform (1998) issue regard policy yet pursue vigorously. there three aspect consolidation viz. clear cut legal regulatory regime govern consolidation, enable policy framework especially several bank own government, market condition facilitate consolidation, recognise merger acquisition may necessarily interest either party concern system whole. a regard legal framework, reserve bank comfortable lack clear statutory provision regard takeover management banks. in 1970, reserve bank issue direction bank require seek reserve bank’s permission acknowledgement effect transfer share favour person would take hold share one per cent (subsequently raise five per cent) total pay capital bank company. since share acquire first lodge registration, reserve bank’s direction create somewhat piquant situation. to plug gap, bill introduce parliament relate bank regulation. the rbi’s proposal regard reasonably take care takeover management one another reserve bank appropriate regulatory power satisfy person propose acquire share fit proper persons. the procedure amalgamation two bank company section 44a bank regulation act, 1949 (the act) easy follow cost effective. after two bank company pass necessary resolution general meet represent le two third value shareholding two bank companies, propose amalgamation one bank another bank, resolution contain scheme amalgamation submit reserve bank sanction sanctioned, order write reserve bank, bind bank company concerned, also shareholder thereof. while sanction bi review 57/2003 5 scheme amalgamation, reserve bank take account financial health two bank company ensure, inter alia, amalgamation, new entity emerge much strong bank. the experience reserve bank large satisfactory approve several scheme amalgamation recent past. these provisions, however, apply bank public sector, viz., nationalise banks, state bank india subsidiary banks. a regard nationalise banks, act authorise central government, consultation reserve bank, prepare make scheme, inter alia, transfer undertake correspond new bank (i.e. nationalise bank) another correspond new bank transfer whole part bank institution correspond new bank. under procedure, new bank india amalgamate punjab national bank experience regard consider altogether satisfactory. unlike sanction scheme reserve bank section 44a act, scheme frame central government require section 9(6) nationalisation act place two house parliament. the state bank india act, 1955, empower state bank india consent management bank institution (which would also include bank company) acquire business, include asset liability bank. under provision, require consent concern bank approval reserve bank sanction acquisition central government. several bank acquire state bank india invoke section. section 23a regional rural bank act, 1976 (rrbs act), empower central government, consultation nabard, concern state government sponsor bank, amalgamate two rrbs, issue notification official gazette, liabilities, duty obligation may specify notification. a case amalgamation nationalise bank section 9(2) nationalisation act, every notification section also require lay house parliament. of course, case bank company financial distress place order moratorium, application make reserve bank central government sub-section (2) section 45 act, reserve bank frame scheme amalgamation transfer asset liability distress bank much good strong bank. such scheme frame reserve bank require sanction central government notify official gazette. a case amalgamation sanction central government nationalisation act rrbs act, notification issue compulsory amalgamation section 45 act also require place two house parliament. one area concern reserve bank amalgamation non-banking company bank company law impose obligation part non-banking company (for matter, even concern bank company) seek reserve bank’s regulatory approval file scheme amalgamation high court section 391 company act, 1956. to take care gaps, reserve bank propose amendment legislation bank regulation act amalgamation non-banking company bank company make follow similar procedure applicable amalgamation two bank companies. payment system payment settlement system india

these requirement also highlight year 2000 bhide advisory group examine international standard code relate payment systems, perspective conformity indian context. with grow importance ascribe towards payment settlement system world over, view significance financial stability, central bank set appropriate machinery regulate supervise system provide explicit legal base payment settlement systems. in background, draft ‘payment settlement systems’ bill prepare reserve bank forward government india. in anticipation statutory changes, certain preliminary step propose take reserve bank build requisite infrastructure effective supervision payment settlement systems. a board payment settlement system (bpss) propose constitute soon. the board would function manner similar board financial supervision. bps would provide policy direction area relate regulation supervision payment settlement systems, approval payment systems, criterion membership, various aspect relate admission, continuation denial

secure efficient payment settlement systems. these arrangement facilitate easy transition formal statutory system. rat supervision the supervision bank is, accounts, become extremely complex. the supervisor require acquire technical skills, exhibit considerable judgement system develop inter-institutional interaction continue basis. while every effort make reserve bank regard, considerable benefit introduce system feedback supervise bank adequacy, appropriateness quality supervision. this would help rat supervisory performance time time obtain suggestion improvement range banks, large

regulatory organsiations, users’ consultative panel consist incharge compliance regulate institutions. the intention obtain feedback regulation formulation stage avoid ambiguity operational glitches. the reserve bank will, time time, seek advice select member panel avoid burden official regulate units. i would seek full co-operation bank industry regard. conclusion in conclusion, i would like

what know years, 94 percent workforce, average, employ market match idle worker seek employment new jobs. we thus confident new job displace old one always have, without high degree pain job-losing

direction today’s far globalize financial world could unexpectedly destabilizing. a likely fall wage income profit could lead, ironically, fall job job security short term. so, yes, shut part foreign competition, would pay price - perhaps rather large price. * * * i doubt vast majority u would prefer work le stressful, le competitive environment. yet, role consumers, seem relentlessly seek low product price high quality prominent feature current frenetic economic structure. in particular, america’s discount retailer respond learn profit intermediary consumer low-cost producers, whether

consumer otherwise shop retailer does. retailer afford little leeway product sourcing. if consumer stern taskmaster marketplace, business purchaser capital equipment production material input take competitive paradigm step apply global scale. understandably, consequence, trade discussion aegis world trade organization become increasingly contentious. after four decade le successful negotiations, “low-hanging trade agreement fruit,” speak, already picked. current trade negotiators, accordingly, must grapple remaining, difficult issues, intellectual property right agricultural subsidies. debate trade restriction understandably become far confrontational early years. for example, strain so-called conventional wisdom attribute weak labor market unite state widen trade deficit, loss job since begin recession 2001 low-priced competition abroad (often deem “unfair”) increase foreign outsource part corporate america. in fact, council economic adviser chairman greg mankiw recently point out, u.s. “job loss ... closely relate decline domestic investment weak export import competition.”1 in addition, course, increase productivity enable ongoing demand meet few workers. noteworthy single particular exchange rate, chinese renminbi, significant cause american job loss. the renminbi widely believe markedly undervalued, claim rise renminbi slow export china unite states, accord some, create increase job opportunity american home. the story trade jobs, judgment, bite complex, especially respect china, strain conventional wisdom would lead one believe. if renminbi rise, presumably u.s. import china would fall china lose competitive position low-wage economies. but would, example, reduce import textile china induce increase output american factories? far likely import low-wage country would replace chinese textiles. despite large surplus china’s trade unite states, overall chinese trade much close balance. chinese exports, majority foreign-owned firm affiliates, many american, depend purchase east asian company supply input product chinese sell unite state elsewhere. emerge asia use manufacture many good directly export unite states. however, grow fraction good partially assemble capital-intensive, high-value-added manufacture rest emerge asia; export china, final process do - typically labor-intensive, lower-value-added manufacturing;

hence, indirectly u.s. output jobs. in order maintain tight relationship dollar initiate 1990s, chinese central bank purchase large quantity u.s. treasury security renminbi. what clear much unquestioned current upward pressure renminbi result underlie market forces, much capital inflow due speculation potential revaluation, much capital control suppress chinese residents’ demand dollars. no one truly know whether ease end capital control would ease pressure currency without central bank intervention and, process, also eliminate inflow speculation revaluation. many china, however, fear immediate end control could induce capital outflow large enough destabilize nation’s fragile bank system. others believe decontrol, gradual pace, could conceivably temper concerns. central bank purchase dollars, unless offset, threaten excess so-called high-powered money expansion consequent overheat chinese economy. the chinese central bank year indeed offset, is, sterilized, much heavy dollar purchase reduce loan commercial banks, sell bonds, increase reserve requirements. but currency commercial bank reserve rise enough support growth money supply well excess 20 percent annual rate far year. should pattern continue, central bank confront choice overheat economy, potential recessionary consequences, curtail dollar asset purchases. the latter presumably would allow renminbi

protesters, even among commit market-oriented economies, important difference remain capitalism role globalization. these difference capture clearly soliloquy attribute prominent european leader several year ago. he asked, “what market? it law jungle, law nature. and civilization? it struggle nature.” while acknowledge ability competition promote growth, many observers, nonetheless, remain concern economic actors, achieve growth, require behave manner govern law jungle. in contrast skeptical views, others argue ethical merit market-driven outcome posit value preference individual

supervisor. for institutions, regulatory rule must changed. this practical reality bank supervisor face. change complexity, flexibility comparability this audience well aware reality i described. but second practical problem one like change, least change impose them. change expensive and, worse, require new construct potential unintended implications. for reason, other, development basel ii take long time. not issue complicated, also bank supervisor engage continue conversation complexity implications. both party share common goal try develop cost-efficient workable system. on occasion differ tradeoff cost complexity comparability flexibility. bi review 56/2003 1 another practical problem world’s supervisor try develop good risk-based capital standard. they also try harness modern risk-measurement risk management technique regulatory system, try construct framework evolve science art risk measurement management evolve. i previously call evolutionary potential basel ii “evergreen” element, i believe one many attractive feature proposal. modern asset-pricing theory may begin academia, growth application quickly take root money, capital, bank market new way think risk, way essentially mean measure risk quantifiable ways. the large banks, operate multiple product geographic markets, simply could operate without apply new evolve principle measuring, shifting, manage risks. several implication follow. harness large banks’ internal practice supervisory process imply supervisor could use cutting-edge risk measure evaluate bank risk profile relate truly risk-sensitive capital standard. it also suggest bank’s adoption best-practice risk measurement management could use supervisor-imposed prerequisite application new capital standard; set prerequisite would accelerate development adoption new techniques, counterparties increasingly demand event. state point directly: basel ii design harness best new technique also ensure application bank le aggressive adopt them. that is, basel ii, least advance form, much proposal strengthen risk management proposal improve capital standards; consideration are, be, inseparable. that inseparability, turn, i discus later, important factor lead bifurcate application basel ii propose unite states. the use advance technique go far enough sophisticate organization want use model estimate risk functions, particularly estimate portfolio correlation effects. some also concern hard-wired risk function correlation parameter prohibit good practice available. in view, full model regime could not, plan period basel ii, produce capital charge would sufficiently comparable regulatory capital standard. specifically, determination portfolio correlation effect tend much art science; subjectivity make difficult, impossible, validate credibly. to ensure broad comparability regulatory capital ratio across banks, therefore, risk function embed internal risk-based (irb) framework employ correlation parameter specify basel committee. in effect, sacrifice flexibility potential risk sensitivity great comparability. we face similar tradeoff repeatedly development basel ii proposals, many way one basel committee’s great challenge reach consensus right balance flexibility comparability. in addition, evidence credit risk model many large, complex bank organization attain sophistication robustness would consistent use regulatory capital. although state art progress rapidly, many bank still must resolve fundamental question finish compile sufficient data adopt full credit model produce reliable accurate results. ultimately, basel ii propose capital standard imply need reasonable comparability across bank across boundary ensure competitive balance i refer earlier. nonetheless, look beyond current proposals, i believe time regulatory capital function hard-wired basel ii, along embed correlation assumptions, give way individual bank-developed model verifiable supervisors. that development probably central part evergreen process. but time individual bank model now, i see reason hold improve regulatory capital regime state art permit innovation. until then, i think develop workable balance flexibility comparability. a old say goes, perfect enemy good. level play fields: treat comparable bank comparably basel ii, i noted, try develop standard banks’ risk exposure treat comparably. such standard central require level play field. but comparability require bank treat rather comparable bank treat comparably, 2 bi review 56/2003 raise practical issue definition, unintended consequence competitive markets, unavoidable difference national regimes. general issues. a know, basel ii propose three option bank national jurisdiction may choose - standardized, foundation, advance internal risk-based (a-irb) approaches. the increase risk sensitivity three option potential application different capital charge across bank exposure imply bank le average mix corporate retail exposure may reduction overall minimum regulatory capital requirement move across three options. any difference regulatory capital charge potential distort national competitive positions, issue domestic authorities, international competition, issue national authority basel committee. in consider issues, one must, course, make distinction among minimum regulatory capital base regulatory rules; economic capital base bank’s assessment risk capital needs; actual capital held, include buff capital measure reason vary reduce cost fund counterparty demand desire contingency flexibility. minimum regulatory capital low three capital “requirements,” thus degree may may affect competition across bank important conceptual practical issue involving, bottom, way price credit get determined. when say done, nation participate basel committee develop proposal establish revise capital standard bank organization compete across national boundaries. basel i negotiate basis. after basel i, participate nation nevertheless choose apply new standard bank organization jurisdiction. the european japanese apparently make decision propose basel ii. in contrast basel i, however, bank organization subject basel ii, organization choose among three variants. application unite states. the u.s. authority make somewhat different decision. consistent letter spirit basel ii proposal, late u.s. proposal state u.s. bank organization meaningful cross-border exposure - least $10 billion - require adopt basel ii. in addition, bank organization consolidate asset least $250 billion similarly require adopt basel ii. if criterion apply today, ten u.s. entity would meet one criterion hence would among “core” group u.s. bank organization require adopt basel ii. to sure, actual number mandatory u.s. bank may change actual implementation - among could u.s. subsidiary foreign bank organization meet core bank standards. in addition, initially assume ten large entity might choose opt basel ii; believe number may well underestimate, still process survey large bank determine plans. even twenty bank count currently mandatory opt-in would account, estimate, 99 percent foreign exposure u.s. charter bank two-thirds domestic asset entities. any non-mandatory bank unite state estimate internal risk parameter credit exposure - is, measure manage risk exposure satisfaction supervisor - may opt basel ii unite states. but bank choose meet test adopt basel ii, remain current, unchanged, capital regime. bank require choose adopt basel ii rule unite state one option: a-irb approach credit risk advance measurement approach (ama) operational risk. neither standardize foundation approach credit risk basic indicator standardize approach operational risk available unite states. the authority unite state propose bifurcate application basel ii (with one group basel ii bank remain current capital requirements) reject trifurcate approach (with bank choose among three basel ii variant credit risk, well three variant operational risk), look prefer countries, three basic reasons. first, basel ii, i noted, require adopt apply internationally active banks. the data i refer evidence u.s. framework apply basel ii would meet test. second, i also note earlier, basel ii capital requirement intend sensitive risk also link risk-sensitivity significant bi review 56/2003 3 increase standard risk measurement management large banks. only a-irb ama approach fully impose prerequisite large entities. the u.s. authority believe large u.s. bank organization adopt best-practice risk measurement management reason safety soundness. third, basel ii without cost. most thousand u.s. bank neither core set likely opt-in set operation that, u.s. authorities’ view, would require dramatic change credit risk measurement management associate either a-irb foundation approach. additionally, increase risk sensitivity standardize version seem modest u relative additional cost system changes. regard operational risk, argument even strong ama would impose undue burden small banks. in short, basel ii seem favorable cost-benefit ratio american banks. the decision bank would remain current regime unite state also condition institutional fact perhaps well know elsewhere. minimum basel i requirement capital regulation unite states. they supplement

almost totally within unite states. the argument bank core banks, especially small medium-sized banks, ought free choose basel ii current regulatory requirement seem overwhelmingly convince us. that is, bank free choose bear cost implementation benefit great capital risk-sensitivity. neither international agreement domestic supervisory reason impose basel ii u.s. bank seem reasonable. but international agreement domestic supervisory reason seem reasonable u require nothing le a-irb ama bank adopt basel ii. unintended consequence competitive distortions. have make bifurcate proposal unite states, public comment congressional oversight make clear purely domestic concern bank remain current regime, even though avoid cost adoption, may disadvantage relative basel ii banks. specifically, argument goes, basel ii give large banks, low overall capital requirement, low capital charge certain credit bank adopt basel ii compete. focus place residential mortgages, small business loans, credit cards. concern also voice basel ii bank use newly create excess regulatory capital acquire small banks, whose capital use efficiently large basel ii banks. in short, create international competitive balance basel ii carry potential domestic competitive balance become distorted. at bottom, concern raise empirical question credit priced, locus competition, determinant actual capital held, matters. question raise comment oversight process question addressed. we still review evidence present us, federal reserve staff member conduct empirical research issue make

application; change current capital regime unite states. we look seriously step preclude propose measure believe necessary ensure level play field domestic bank market. but first, i noted, must examine evidence, nation undoubtedly review unintended consequence trifurcate application markets. even though objective level play field internationally, practical problem differ supervisory regime procedure may distort international competitive position remains. frankly, u.s. authority hear argument foreign supervisor neither resource experience apply rule rigorously anticipate case unite states. and foreign authority hear complaint bank competitive implication 4 bi review 56/2003 create u.s. insistence a-irb ama treatment large u.s. subsidiary meet cross-border scale criterion core

foreign bank easily meet require standards, national treatment policy apply. discussion within aig issue - well bilateral discussion affect bank supervisor - productive, i think associate problem addressed. however, one issue appear particularly difficult one jurisdiction: allocation capital operational risk among legal entity within across jurisdictions. problem come practical this. operational risk generally measure consolidate basis, often business line. that diversification benefit exist consolidate basis suggest operational risk estimate bottom - by, say, legal entity - would difficult might well add total top down. the problem make complicate understandable focus supervisor jurisdiction ensure entity supervision sufficiently capitalize absorb risk. we come long way global banking, deference home consolidate supervisors, legal entity supervisor still need assurance capital protect risk individual unit. basel ii go succeed fail practical problem similar problem - certainly last. through aig compromise develop issue operational risk capital ensure capital sufficient allocate reasonable way. other issues, include home-host tensions, resolve similar way member country hear comments, conduct analysis, seek viable compromise solution. the process the practical give take discussion exactly first second capital accord developed. we critical stage process change significant provision study modified. example shift standard unexpected loss review securitization, credit card, credit risk mitigation, actively studied. it may seem strange far process - approach year six - change made. these changes, however, show seriously basel committee participate national authority regard public comment process benefit analysis banker interest parties. when analysis evidence put forward, committee responded. the unite state considerably review public comment advance notice propose rulemaking (anpr), country go process translate consensus proposal rules. the process unite state nation may well bring proposal change, provide supportable argument forthcoming. in unite states, next round committee discussions, additional procedural step still required, opportunity comment stage, final rule place. to clear, bi review 56/2003 5 6 bi review 56/2003 need procedural step unite state take indication lack commitment basel process. rather, sign attempt develop proposal transparent basis possible hear wide range comments. the congress unite state also hold hear development new accord. the interest oversight congress discussion appropriate welcome, particularly undertake extensive basel ii. the u.s. regulator appreciate fact able operate independent agency also realize obligation keep elect representative inform progress major effort. of course, expect country european union follow procedure well. overall, i impress efficacy comment process believe offer open forum party voice opinions. debate discussion important undertake essential, provide opportunity enhancement final product. the current proposal good comment elicit good idea seriously considered. at time, need ensure momentum maintained. in october, committee member commit work promptly resolve outstanding issue mid-2004. in january, basel committee meet address analysis outstanding issue review timetable complete implement committee’s work accord. use agreement reach committee template, u.s. supervisor plan conduct another quantitative impact study (qis) gauge clearly effect basel proposals. we believe must carefully test new proposal determine effect individual institution ascertain need fine-tune proposal further, process could include recalibrating risk-weight functions. our sense country same. because time function degree change require qis, u.s. agency conduct full notice propose rulemaking seek evaluate public comment adopt final rule. conclusion basel i long viable supervisory tool large, complex bank organization industrial world need replace soon feasible new capital accord. the proposal develop basel build best-practice risk- measurement risk-management technique and, least advance versions, much ensure bank use technique risk-sensitive capital approach. indeed, consideration two side coin. any complex change induce opposition concern, part fear change comfort know rules, part preference alternative affected, part anxiety may upset current competitive positions. but basel ii build upon modern technique entirely consistent direction large bank counterparties moving. and use future advance evolve even flexible sophisticate supervisory tool. basel i propose basel ii design provide level competitive play field bank organization meet international competition. and though propose application procedure - bifurcate approach unite state trifurcate approach country - large maintain objective, may unintended consequence distort domestic competitive equity. the empirical analysis whether will, especially bank maintain capital well excess regulatory minimums, yet completed, authority require investigate concern adjust proposal analysis require it. tension cross-border application exist cannot avoid world national

banker association, copenhagen, 3 december 2003. * * * for twenty year fixed-exchange-rate policy cornerstone economic policy denmark. it widespread acceptance business, organisations, political player media. at begin 1980s, danish economy catch vicious circle high inflation, frequent devaluation long-term interest rate around twenty per cent. we break circle get public finance shape, abolish cost-of-living adjustment implement consistent fixed-exchange-rate policy. late 1980s, tax reform introduce limit interest-deduction entitlement. these structural reform basis stability-oriented economic policy pursue ever since. it serve denmark well, virtuous circle replace vicious circle. dane question value fixed-exchange-rate policy, analyst country sometimes perceive old-fashioned. fixed-exchange-rate regime often target criticism warn report international organisation least academic literature. the general view denmark fixed-exchange-rate regime provide smooth sailing. nevertheless, two main point criticism generally raise fixed-exchange-rate regime merit close look. the first point criticism history shown, fixed-exchange-rate policy difficult maintain vulnerability speculative attacks. it may especially difficult resist speculation build anticipation devaluation currency. globally, several example speculative attack cause fixed-exchange-rate regime collapse. the famous example withdrawal sterling european monetary system september 1992. at begin 1990s finland sweden also force float currency thus abandon fixed-exchange-rate policy. finland, however, revert fixed-exchange-rate policy 1996 preparation introduction euro. in year since early 1980s, denmark experience number currency crises, fixed-exchange-rate policy remain intact. the recent speculation danish krone take place five year ago, denmark’s fixed-exchange-rate policy today enjoy unique credibility market. the present central rate vis-à-vis euro represent conversion exchange rate d-mark danish krone fix january 1987. why could weather storm despite argument system vulnerable? the short reply take great pain follow “rules game”. first, use monetary policy solely stabilise exchange rate - whether necessary interest rate appropriate relation domestic economic situation. monetary policy earmark exchange-rate stabilisation. second, important fiscal policy “come through” - use modern expression. fiscal policy responsible ensure stable credible macroeconomic development medium term. adjustment make primarily connection annual finance acts. nevertheless, isolate case specific measure required. the late example whitsun package economic measure 1998. the main point criticism fixed-exchange-rate regime flexible exchange rate necessary shield economy external shocks. the argument use participation monetary union. the hypothesis flexible exchange rate allow external disruption reflect exchange rate. bi review 56/2003 1 follow em crisis begin 1990s, number country give speculative pressure choose let currency float. this enable use monetary policy - i.e. interest rate - stabilise domestic demand thus inflation. a new inflation-management model introduce monetary policy, so-called inflation target model. new zealand canada already apply approach time. however, bank england sverige riksbank primarily develop principle policy close cooperation academia. central bank apply inflation target aim influence economy solely use interest rate keep inflation two year ahead within define interval, typically 2 2½ per cent plus/minus 1 per cent. the interest-rate decision take committee base economic projections, model calculation personal assessments. the ecb clear objective price stability interpret inflation rate close two per cent. the ecb’s interest-rate decision also base economic projection analysis key economic indicators. the decision-making process is, however, formalise extent sweden uk, example. the federal reserve system broad economic objective inflation necessarily take centre stage. in 2001 norway implement inflation-targeting regime. this happen gradually phase fixed-exchange-rate policy. denmark presently nordic country pursue fixed-exchange-rate policy, finland participate euro area. it worth examine whether lead unstable inflation growth denmark finland recent year sweden norway, floating-exchange-rate regimes. to end danmark nationalbank compare development four nordic country 1996. the result publish article monetary review publish 4 december. the comparison show course inflation measure harmonise index consumer prices, hicp, general comparable measure price development. the message emerge comparison variability inflation output clearly low denmark countries. it show fixed-exchange-rate policy obstacle stable economic development. this contrary economic theory subject. the article present possible explanation apparent contradiction. one explanation reality, stability jeopardise external shocks, rather internal shock form inappropriate economic-policy changes. history rich example wrong economic policy lead instability. a recent example netherlands. for long time country seem perform extremely well praise strong economy. from end 1990s two year ago, netherlands experience high growth, drive inflation. a consequence, government budget tend improve, course. but netherlands let trend prevail automatic stabiliser fiscal policy could work freely. instead, introduce set “ground rules” whereby save expenditure side use payment other, new expenses, half revenue improvement could use reduce taxes. at first sight rule look convincing, clearly procyclical. when reversal came, performance decline rapidly. this year, negative growth 3/4 per cent expected. at time netherlands tighten fiscal policy considerably, include significant expenditure cuts. this also reflect procyclical approach, dutch want keep budget deficit three per cent compliance stability growth pact. if euro area member state determine netherlands. this example show succumb relaxation fiscal policy good time lead highly unstable development. the consequence activist fiscal policy may entirely different expected. 2 bi review 56/2003 in denmark, change government well aware risk economic policy could go course - precisely potential vulnerability fixed-exchange-rate policy. therefore, denmark countries, watchword “stability-oriented economic policy”. and everyone accept monetary policy could contribute domestic stabilisation, earmark stabilisation exchange rate. a mentioned, increase responsibility impose fiscal policy. fiscal-policy “activism” avoided, largely neutral fiscal policy pursued. the shock frequent fiscal-policy change thus avoided. the internationalisation financial sector eu’s single market financial service key issue many years. many rule regulation make facilitate development. the primary purpose create level play field. another purpose facilitate cross-border activities. all contribute make financial market open competitive give customer advantage large market. in reality, large financial corporation national affiliation even foreign ownership. they mainly contact national authority country’s financial supervisory authority, central bank, deposit guarantee scheme ministries. however, development nordic bank market recent year indicate may head integration magnitude significantly change national relations. this make difficult authority observe traditional national borders. one specific field evident practice statistics, apply concept “domestic” “foreign”. if financial group operate several country bring together certain activity one country, may cause strange shift statistical information, mean indicate underlie change transaction conducted. the statistic may long present accurate picture. such restructure within cross-border group require new approach statistical authorities. it also pose new problem supervisory authority one large financial institution become branch foreign banks. the deposit guarantee schemes, too, fundamentally national thus difficult adapt comprehensive cross-border activities. and role central bank branch foreign bank large systemic importance perhaps even large retail bank? in financial stability, publish danmark nationalbank spring, summarise problem follows: “where branch large large home-country entity, branch individual host country large systemic importance could affect financial stability host country, close collaboration establish authority across national borders, irrespective home-country supervision”. these issue discuss intensively authority nordic countries. in danmark nationalbank’s analysis financial stability focus increasingly nordic groups. in practical terms, nordic central bank prepare memorandum understanding, available website. it describe arrangement cooperation case financial crisis nordic bank group subsidiary several nordic countries. financial integration advance nordic country rest eu. some feature currently observe nordic country begin show eu well, tend strengthen enlargement eu ten new member states. therefore, nordic country spur discussion issue eu level. and country indeed interest learn nordic experience. internationalisation also aspects. so far, danmark nationalbank issue government bond via copenhagen stock exchange, trade government bond long predominantly national matter. danish government bond sell large number international investors. bi review 56/2003 3 4 bi review 56/2003 in recent years, international trade platform mt become standard trade european government bonds. mt use 12 eu member states, international investment bank use system. to obtain best possible price danish government bond choose move issuance mts, whereby international investment bank become primary dealer active player market danish government bonds. this intensify competition time modernise market government bonds. in 1980s, denmark one first country introduce option electronic stock-exchange trading. nevertheless, government bond trade mainly phone introduction mt november. the trade platform electronic, quality price information available day increase considerably. to consider interest small investors, danmark nationalbank conclude special agreement number danish bank quote price small trade copenhagen stock exchange. this agreement enter force recently give small investor possibility trade government bond execute directly stock exchange. a mentioned, eu many year facilitate progress towards financial integration order create single market financial services. recent year show development well underway. however, eu cannot plan development. financial integration drive markets. it authority respond development necessary adapt rule facilitate it. david dodge: past adjustment future trend canadian economy remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, london chamber commerce, london, ontario, 8 december 2003. * * * good afternoon, lady gentlemen. i’m happy opportunity visit forest city finally honour long-standing invitation address you. when give speech near end year, common practice look back past 12 months, consider learn event experience year, think bite might lie ahead. i become governor bank canada 2001 and, since time, i find say end year, “well, won’t see another year like again.” in 2001, saw burst tech bubble 9/11 terrorist attack unite states. last year, fallout enron example corporate malfeasance, well grow threat war middle east. and currency drop all-time low u.s. dollar. not outdone, 2003 also share momentous event impact canadian economy. the list seem almost biblical: war, pestilence, form sars mad-cow disease, fires, floods, hurricane, power outage. this year also bring another type shock keep canadian preoccupied, sharp rise currency foreign exchange markets. the canadian dollar jump 64 cent u.s. start year 76 cent end last week - unprecedented movement. the bank canada closely follow economic effect events, include rapid movement canadian dollar. but good understand happen economy past year so, i place comment context longer-term economic trends. the adjustment 1990s let start recall state economy 1990s began. although inflation come high level see early 1980s, still quite high today’s standards. several approach try bring environment low, stable, predictable inflation. these include wage price control target money supply. but none method provide suitable medium-term anchor inflation expectations. this make difficult individual business form long-range plan degree certainty. on fiscal side, picture pretty grim start 1990s get worse. public sector deficit would eventually peak around 8 per cent canada’s gdp, public debt level continue mount. clearly, situation sustainable. adjustment urgently needed. the first adjustment come 1991, bank government canada agree adopt series explicit inflation-control targets. the agreement call inflation target-defined term annual rate increase consumer price index - descend gradually 2 per cent, midpoint 1 3 per cent range. that initial agreement extend three times, late agreement cover period end 2006. in case, midpoint inflation-control target range keep 2 per cent. this framework work well - good might expected. by january 1992, inflation already close 2 per cent, end 1994 today, inflation average almost exactly 2 per cent. moreover, inflation fallen, become stable. indeed, trend inflation - measure call core inflation - stay within target range almost continuously past 10 years. just importantly, find that, year inflation targeting, inflation expectation canadian fell line 2 per cent target. and expectation remain close target recent years. the point successful use monetary policy create economic environment low, stable, predictable inflation. with credible monetary policy, whole nature bi review 56/2003 1 inflation process changed. inflation become stable and, turn, lead stable better-functioning economy. the second big adjustment begin earnest around middle 1990s. a i say before, time, canada face unsustainable fiscal situation. compound immediate fiscal problem loom challenge pose age population. spend put viable long-term course, ratio public debt gdp steady downward track. by middle decade, government - federal provincial - begin take painful step balance book reduce debt burdens. it take long benefit tough decision materialize. in jurisdictions, vicious circle rise deficit debt become virtuous circle balance budget fall debt burdens. this fiscal adjustment help canada’s economic policy credibility reduce risk premium investor demand canadian government bonds. not low interest rate reduce debt-servicing costs, stimulate economic growth, bring revenue governments. the federal government recently announce sixth consecutive surplus budget. our public pension plan sound footing. the federal debt-to-gdp ratio fall 44 per cent, close 70 per cent peak. the ratio total government liability gdp decline peak 100 per cent 80 per cent, accord oecd. and canada’s triple-a credit rat restored. i don’t mean suggest inflation target fiscal adjustment factor behind canada’s overall improve economic performance. of equal importance difficult restructure do wake free-trade agreement 1990s. business employee make difficult adjustments. none easy, leave canada’s economy good position grow sustainably handle economic shocks. our economic record past years, even face event i mentioned, testament that. now, let talk role canadian dollar long adjustment process. on day-to-day basis, number factor drive movement value canadian dollar foreign exchange markets. but intention stick discussion long-term trends. from perspective, really two major factor work currency 1990s. government cut spend address fiscal problems, lead reduction domestic demand. on top this, commodity price sharply second half decade. historically, fairly strong correlation price non-energy commodity external value canadian dollar. in face two factors, canada’s float exchange rate job “shock absorber” economy. how? give tight fiscal policy time, low dollar - context ease monetary policy - play appropriate role encourage foreign demand canadian product time domestic demand weak. further, low currency cushion shock fall commodity price resource producers, also boost profitability sector able expand wake free-trade agreement strong foreign demand. this help facilitate transfer resource within economy sector shrink growing. the depreciate canadian dollar 1990s also change relative price labour capital. at time, fair bite excess labour economy, structural adjustment take place. the low dollar raise cost machinery equipment relative labour. and make easy labour release shrink sector economy absorb growing. future trend economy that’s quick look back 1990s. so expect future? what major issue grapple come decades? what adjustment needed? i don’t crystal ball, couple issue seem fairly clear me. a i already mentioned, first important issue demographics. the canadian economy must prepare retirement baby boomers. under current projections, canada’s working-age population - 15 64 year age - start decline 15 years. 2 bi review 56/2003 give demographic outlook, two point made. the first need continue low ratio public debt gdp. this help ensure canada able support grow elderly population. the second point need make adjustment help u deal labour force soon shrink relative term and, ultimately, absolute term well. what kind adjustments? we need make sure old segment working-age population discourage participate labour force. but importantly, need raise productivity canadian continue enjoy rise incomes. it easy get productivity gains. we need see great investment new, improve machinery equipment. we need see good application information communication technology. we need ensure worker skill receive train require take advantage productivity-enhancing technology. and need improve business organization practices, fully exploit potential new technologies, minimize barrier application workplace. raise productivity also require major effort ensure microeconomic policy facilitate innovation high productivity private public sector canada. in think macroeconomic policies, can’t assume shock behind us. we see buildup economic imbalance recently, large current account surplus asia large current account deficit unite states. and fiscal imbalance grow europe unite states. so bank canada help prepare challenge ahead? most importantly, must stick monetary policy framework build 1990s. that mean keep commitment low, stable, predictable inflation. and mean float exchange rate continue important part monetary policy framework. this framework continue help economy adjust change economic circumstances, home abroad. of course, exchange rate don’t always move smoothly desire expected. still, let repeat i say many time before: float exchange rate facilitate economic adjustment far best option canadian economy. recent economic development let turn current economic situation, start outlook inflation. a note october monetary policy report, expect canada’s inflation rate fall next months. the core rate inflation - measure remove eight volatile component consumer price index - likely move close bottom 1 3 per cent inflation-control range early next year, start move back towards 2 per cent. on bank’s late fix announcement date last week, decide leave key policy rate unchanged. in so, note development alter outlook since publish monetary policy report. let review them. at end november, statistic canada release national account data third quarter. these data show canada’s economy grow annualized rate 1.1 per cent third quarter, rate well expectations. what’s more, downward revision growth previous quarters. this mean that, end third quarter, excess capacity canadian economy anticipated. in monetary policy report, say expect economy close output gap return level full capacity early 2005. close output gap period would consistent inflation return 2 per cent target mid-2005. but know output gap large expect october, also know economy grow fast rate fourth quarter 2004 close output gap early 2005. while growth early year disappointing, see number encourage sign suggest strong growth resume, begin current quarter. i mention three signs. first, overall growth rate third quarter 1.1 per cent, note figure depress business meet demand large part inventories. final domestic demand grow quite strongly - close 6 per cent - thank healthy household bi review 56/2003 3 4 bi review 56/2003 spend rise business investment. this investment bode well high future production. and, continue employment growth, expect household spend remain robust. second, reduction inventory investment probably over. while adjustment depress growth third quarter, fourth quarter. in fact, completion inventory correction contribute growth fourth quarter. third, canada’s export sector receive boost rise foreign demand, particular, unite states. remember u.s. economy grow annualized rate 8 per cent third quarter, canadian exporter see benefit continue strong growth expect u.s. economy month ahead. rise non-energy commodity price also boost economy. all told, canadian economy poise solid growth ahead, begin fourth quarter. we would expect economic growth quarter well 4 per cent annualized basis. however - let stress - effect recent sharp appreciation canadian dollar major uncertainty time. it clear extent increase foreign demand i mention offset effect strong currency. nor sure enough monetary stimulus economy support increase household spend business investment would require return economy full capacity early 2005. some important economic data expect next fix announcement date, 20 january. these give u good sense canada’s export sector doing, household spend go holiday season. we closely watch data ahead evidence economy grow rate solidly growth potential. conclusion this past year, like two year it, full “interesting” economic challenge canada world. it tempt hope next year somewhat le “interesting” bring few challenges. but regardless next year brings, critical keep eye longer-term horizon focus challenge ahead. these challenge include adapt shift demographics, raise productivity, get microeconomic policy framework right. at bank canada, remain commit sound monetary policy framework help u rise tomorrow’s challenges. and that’s good news us, matter come year may bring. panayotis thomopoulos: the financial environment southeast europe speech mr panayotis thomopoulos, deputy governor bank greece, second international bank forum southeast european market

would wish be. growth eurozone accelerate slowly, within next year growth rate gradually approach potential, estimate around 2 ? % per annum. the us, hand, grow fast, maybe fast. certainly, i wish belittle achievement american economy, especially high productivity growth, continuation twin deficit certainly cause concern, sudden correction could far-reaching implication international financial system. the u see benign neglect twin deficits. on one hand, expect continue fast rate growth would generate sufficient tax revenue medium term, which, combination gradual phase tax relief measures, reduce deficit and, hand, expect current balance payment correction realize via devaluation u dollar, would help sustainability u recovery generate high profit dollar term u investment abroad. in summary, expect abrupt substantial rise interest rates, would adverse effect fiscal deficit consumer demand, thus precipitate cyclical downturn. however, european point view, i allow summarize, unsustainably fast growth rate, base private public borrow good anyone u cannot exception. the eu, especially eurozone, play constructive role promote stable financial environment. the recent appreciation euro indication markets' confidence economies. i believe strong euro good europe world, help fight inflationary pressure support confidence consumer producers. it also clear eurozone cannot solve imbalance threaten stability international economy. i wish enter debate whether fiscal stimulus u necessary two year ago, onset economic slowdown, certainly reverse u grow unsustainable rate. at time, third countries, especially asia, contribute allow market force play great role determination exchange rate, abandon mercantilistic attitudes. however i mention that, open debate whether revaluation chinese renminbi present appropriate, given, one bi review 55/2003 1 hand, fact make relatively small difference, far concern china's trade surplus, chinese wage express u dollar 10% u eu average wage rise 15% 20% result revaluation, hand, revaluation could lead deterioration already chinese banks' fragile condition would also make expensive acquisition chinese factories, commercial sites, etc foreign investors. one positive development i cannot stress enough absence challenge financial stability europe us. unlike situation early 1990s, recently go period prolong synchronize slowdown, make bad geopolitical risks, major financial institution impaired. there course problems, especially european insurance sector, exacerbate natural catastrophes, financial institution manage through. undoubtedly, make mistakes, simply unfortunate, suffer market economy. nonetheless, problems, whenever surfaced, contain systemic repercussion could threaten macroeconomic stability economies. indeed, e.u. economy long recognize key role bank sector health constant preoccupation authorities, especially central bank which, even directly involve supervision, wide responsibility good function financial system whole payment systems. we build sound banks, withstand successfully cyclical pressure kind shocks, also bring crucial support economy failure appear other, le important, part financial system. the burst stock exchange bubble subsequent substantial decline capitalization, certain country amount much 30 50% gdp, produce relatively little damage was, moreover, contain thank bank sector. likewise, result also i would say, least, "not prudent policies" significant loss insurance re-insurance company last year partly absorb bank sector, respond promptly need liquidity capital injections. the bank sector country unwillingly assume responsibility well financial sector whole, understand danger systemic risks, wreak havoc. i cannot pretend tension there, loss due write-off non-performing loans, plummet share value lay costs, bank post operate loss and, moreover, those, rule, relatively small. even today, three year downturn, capital adequacy ratio, remain well minimum 8% almost cases, e.u. whole average 10%, underline good health bank system. moreover, expect continue improve recovery get underway. here, i wish repeat positive role central banks, which, almost 50 years, many still supervisory authorities. indeed, central bank succeed create competitive sound bank system europe last fifteen year so, period characterize liberalization financial market intense competition within europe u banks. the lesson i draw help natural interlocutor, central banks, private sector become adept deal risk supervisor learn mistake past improve vigilance. look ahead, new prudential practice introduce basel ii improve ability deal financial risk good tailor prudential requirement market's special needs. another positive development diminish danger contagion, see argentina's default, lead widespread withdrawal fund emerge markets. this particularly significant emerge market economy southeastern europe, look great integration world economy without fear hit crisis originate elsewhere. all course, provide maintain healthy fundamentals. turn development southeastern balkan themselves, present situation far cry bleak picture early stage transition, decade ago. apart often-bloody conflicts, hyperinflation financial stability seem endemic region year ago. regard financial sector, start initial position practically commercial banks, country region face problem often beyond administrative regulatory capabilities. financial institution reform insufficient regulation unclear focus expansion associate improprieties, scandal fraudulent scheme early stage transition. therefore, financial sector unable attract deposit develop extensive client networks. finally, state bank compel carry 2 bi review 55/2003 high number non-performing loans, accumulate government subsidization program state run enterprises. the development financial sector hamper begin inadequate macroeconomic management. fiscal deficit mostly excessive, often monetized, inevitable outcome high inflation. it encourage last year see clear evidence maturity economic management. the path macroeconomic stabilization different every country. in region observe type monetary exchange rate regimes, formal euro-ization currency board link euro, way monetary targeting. this proof, proof needed, single solution, economic problem policy country tailor specific needs. go beyond diversity region, point i would like underline two characteristic financial system practically country region, result past, also shape future developments. the first extensive currency substitution. a result past inflation, also large number people work abroad, foreign currencies, especially euro, play large role often become main currency use. one gauge degree currency substitution note country region deposit foreign currency account least half bank deposits. one must add this, money "kept mattress" capital flight. undoubtedly vote confidence domestic policymakers. people show dissatisfaction local financial institution monetary authority move save abroad, use other, stable currencies. this high degree currency substitution find latin american country undermine effectiveness monetary policy. the ability monetary authority extract seignorage severely limited, partial justification high inflation rates. at time, monetary management become difficult, small shock disproportionately big impact inflation exchange rate. in countries, namely bulgaria, extent hyperinflation currency substitution leave little alternative authority accept reality move hard peg form currency board link initially deutschemark euro. similar regime also impose bosnia, dayton accord, kosovo. the euro appropriate anchor exchange-rate-based policy countries, closely integrate country eurozone. most transactions, trade-related, also workers' remittances, official transfer financial transaction country eurozone. a measure macroeconomic success recede level currency substitution. in 2002, last year full data, bank deposit foreign currency fell proportion total deposit country region, sometimes quite fast country strong performance context monetary inflation targeting, one exception. this indicative grow trust domestic currency effectiveness stabilization. it important achievement squandered, prudent macroeconomic policy continue. nonetheless, i would like warn possible problems, especially country tie exchange rate euro, one way another. the weakness euro last year undoubtedly help growth performance external competitiveness. from now, period strong euro rely domestic productivity gain structural adjustment maintain growth rates. in addition, growth take hold advance economies, country region adjust interest rate high current historically low levels. an area much remain do area develop efficient stable financial system. in respect, economy region lag behind transition economy due join eu next year. the public sector still control substantial part bank system, obvious need continue effort privatize remain state-controlled banks. a transition economies, state interference stabilize factor, quite opposite. state control bank often lose substantial sum politically-motivated investment contribute systemic crisis countries. a transition economies, foresee increase number bank take become affiliate foreign ones. set aside nationalistic prejudices, i think see welcome development whole, provide foreign entrant strong well-supervised financial institutions. in accede country central europe foreign bank already bi review 55/2003 3 play major role crisis hit country late 1990s, overall experience positive. (foreign bank control 80% domestic market central european accede countries). foreign bank bring many advantages, especially case country limit experience sophisticate financial markets. at first, access good know-how technology. more importantly, mostly immune political interference. while local participant often intimidate pressure give loan well-connected borrowers, foreign institution generally feel strong resist pressures. also, foreign bank consider "safer" local depositors, recognize manipulate political authorities, also understand foreign bank supervise experience supervisor home. finally, experience emerge market show foreign bank good able withstand loss case something go wrong. the international evidence show bank affiliate one advance economy access capital low cost local one re-capitalized fast easily others. of course, foreign bank may disadvantages. foreign-owned financial institution may lack understand local market works. indeed, note bank often tend concentrate finance affiliate foreign firms, large local firms. there thus danger local small medium enterprise may find access credit curtailed. there also possibility foreign-owned bank alter credit base local conditions, condition home economies. indeed, greece observe foreign bank enter market subsequently expand leave haphazard way, basis local condition profitability, mostly basis wide strategy whether expand globally not. formally, say increase correlation emerge market outside world. research show operation financial multinationals become major channel transmission business cycles. for reason, economy southeastern europe find economy affect happen rest europe happen locally. although time local euphoria may regret hold back european business cycle, time benefit become tie stable economy eurozone become overwhelming. this especially country apply eu membership. great synchronization european cycle smooth path towards full membership. foreign ownership bank also allow great risk diversification might achievable small local bank whose whole portfolio locally invested. foreign bank thus behave le risk-averse way local ones. the issue financial stability proper supervision important us, bank greece, greek firm invest heavily neighbor countries. in greece among five big supplier foreign direct investment. of course, extent cause delocation greek companies, negative impact investment employment greece short medium-term, economy grow almost 4% p.a. since 1997 investment gdp ratio 24% delocation pose serious threat long term performance. look data preparation speech, i amaze number branch greek bank neighbor countries. this show greek bank enter plan offer wide range service see future closely link evolution host economies. they enter order concentrate lucrative activity offer service greek firms. the positive effect presence foreign bank predict theory support experience greek bank country southeastern europe. greek bank already well-established bulgaria, romania, serbia-montenegro, albania fyrom, represent least 20 percent bank system accord asset share one-third two thirds. overall, good capitalize competitors, something could expect access diversify source funds. their good capitalization allow take somewhat high risks, show fact loan private sector generally high share asset average bank. although take somewhat risk, profitable overall, average competitors. this signify greek bank region comparative advantage, either form access capital markets, superior organization know-how, good understand local conditions. 4 bi review 55/2003 bi review 55/2003 5 while greek bank play major role neighbor economies, exposure economy generally small. for greek bank exposure southeastern europe exceed 3 percent. this simply reflection different level development greece nearby countries. the result greek bank face little risk exposure economies, important stability financial system balkans. in bank greece well aware this, take responsibility neighbor seriously indeed. a home country supervisor recognize ability exert prudential supervision effect beyond greek borders. in recent year sign several agreements, form memoranda understanding, discuss one supervisor region order enhance ability ensure stability bank jurisdiction. what needed, beyond formal agreements, confidential frank exchange information among supervisor order identify problem early on, become threatening. in era, also vigilant avoid abuse financial system illegal activities, money launder terrorism financing. of course, take comfort fact greek bank expand balkan quite strong, well necessary prudential ratios. actually, fact greek bank able retain high share local market also indication comparative advantage allow thrive internationally competitive environment. i must admit interest stability growth neighbor extent reflection selfish instincts. we realize strong grow economy region useful greek economy, also prerequisite political stability balkans. i mention presence foreign financial firm southeastern europe would transform business cycles. but work way round. greece's orientation toward dynamic economy region help u somewhat weather good recent economic slowdown. in specific way, one see grow interlinkages balkan evidence trade good financial service help growth stability. look ahead, challenge neighbor remain formidable. now first step towards stabilization growth taken, lie ahead difficult issue manage emerge economy. top priority i would like put improvement governance structures, deregulation privatization strengthen respect property rights. i end say count continue support. t t mboweni: recent economic development speech mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, dinner head foreign missions, pretoria, 1 december 2003. * * * 1. introduction dean diplomatic corp - ambassador alzubeidi member diplomatic corps, ambassador high commissioner representative of: unite nation system - mr ohiorhenuan the european union - ambassador lake the international labour organisation - dr andoh the world bank - mr omar foreign affair - ddg: africa, ambassador mamabolo management & staff south african reserve bank lady & gentleman a relatively open develop economy, south africa affect considerably world economic condition past year. the weak fragile global economic recovery impact domestic economic growth, low world inflation contribute decline domestic inflation substantial financial inflow lead recovery external value rand. 2. international economic development global economic activity suffer setback second half 2002 business confidence detrimentally affect revelation corporate account malpractices, decline stock exchange price threat war iraq. in first half 2003 equity price begin rise somewhat war iraq conclude without severely impact oil production. yet international economy continue move sluggish pace, result analyst downgrade initial forecast world growth 2003. more recently encourage sign macroeconomic environment improve somewhat. production growth unite state 8,2 per cent third quarter 2003 seem confirm much-anticipated economic recovery gain momentum. this acceleration pace growth impact favourably demand labour, cause u unemployment rate edge low 6 per cent october 2003. the real gross domestic product japan also increase stronger-than-expected rate 2003, growth china remain high. a strong domestic demand, improve export performance fiscal monetary policy rest asia expect support growth rest continent. in contrast economic activity euro area weak expect second quarter 2003, indicator region indicate economic activity could firm somewhat come months. rise net export real exchange rate development expect lead modest recovery latin america. global inflation remain low monetary fiscal policy ease advance economy past two years. however, recent acceleration economic growth, authority begin le lenient policy stance. the reserve bank australia bank england recently increase official central bank rate 25 basis points. both central bank cite pickup economic activity increase household borrow main reason tighten monetary policy. an important characteristic global economic environment past two year considerable weaken external value unite state dollar. in particular current year affect currency develop country substantial financial inflow countries. bi review 55/2003 1 3. domestic production expenditure although domestic growth expect benefit improvement global economic environment come months, weakness international economic growth impact severely domestic production. have record high rate 5 per cent second quarter 2002, real output growth south african economy slow progressively next four quarter mere ½ per cent second quarter 2003. in third quarter 2003 growth production rise somewhat annualised rate 1 per cent. this bring increase real gross domestic product 2 per cent first nine month 2003 compare period precede year, i.e. considerably low rate 3½ per cent attain 2002 whole. a could expect world economic condition take consideration, decline domestic production mainly result decrease volume net exports. the growth south african export always closely correlate world demand goods, especially demand mineral metals. the recovery exchange rate rand also significant price effect manufacture export rest world. at time accompany rise real import south africa. fortunately considerable improvement term trade country relate substantial increase international commodity prices, soften effect deterioration volume net exports. a consequence, surplus current account balance payment 2002, change deficit approximately 1 per cent gross domestic product first nine month 2003. this relatively small deficit pose threat recovery domestic economic growth. growth domestic production 2003 continue support domestic demand. domestic final demand increase rate 4 per cent first nine month 2003 compare period precede year. this continue high growth domestic final demand result increase consumption well fix capital formation. the growth real final consumption expenditure household also remain strong throughout 2003. the sustain high growth private consumption expenditure underscore rise real personal disposable income owe recent salary wage increases, reduction income tax rate recently decrease interest rates. to supplement growth disposable income, household become will incur debt. consequently, household debt percentage disposable income rise somewhat 51 per cent fourth quarter 2002 53 per cent third quarter 2003. this level still low compare many countries. the strong domestic demand also support growth real final consumption expenditure general government annualised rate 4 per cent first three quarter 2003. this mainly due government purchase good services, real spend salary wage government employee rather restrained. expenditure real gross fix investment continue buoyant throughout first nine month 2003. private business enterprise well public sector increase fix capital outlays. the government public corporation increase capital expenditure infrastructure expansion aim service delivery, private business appear make condition favour expenditure capital goods. such condition include exchange rate conducive import goods, low cost borrowing, rise price international commodity market considerably stability inflation front. the strong domestic final demand unable prevent decline manufacture output. have increase robustly first half 2002, real manufacture output start grow slow rate second half year decline first nine month 2003. this mainly reflection lacklustre global growth trend recovery exchange rate rand. most subsectors manufacture affect low demand export increase import great proportion domestic demand meet competitively price imports. a could expected, mark effect employment. 4. inflation monetary policy the inflation outlook improve significantly 2003. the twelve-month cpix inflation fell peak 11,3 per cent october 2002 upper boundary inflation target september 2003. in october 2003 even recede mid-point target range reach 4,4 per cent. this achievement underpin sustain maintenance prudent 2 bi review 55/2003 monetary fiscal policy together recovery international exchange value rand moderation food price increases. a inflation outlook improved, monetary policy stance adjust four occasion 2003. the first reduction repo rate make june 2003, already clear sign inflation rate move towards inflation target march meet monetary policy committee. at time meet felt upside risk limit possible action mpc could take. in particular, commencement war iraq first day meet important effect committee's decision. a uncertainty inflation outlook dissipate become increasingly apparent factor favour attainment inflation target next two years, mpc start low interest rates. the repo rate cut 150 basis point june, 100 basis point august september, 150 basis point october. all all, total reduction 500 basis point period five months. this indeed aggressive low interest rates. nominal rate level last see 1980s, difference current expect inflation rate significantly low observe 1980s. although international domestic economic condition allow mpc reduce short-term interest rate aggressive manner, override objective reserve bank remain attainment inflation target. achieve low inflation end itself. it important prerequisite sustainable high economic growth employment creation. the current importantly expect state domestic economy always carry weight determination monetary policy. 5. the exchange rate rand of recent economic developments, behaviour external value rand attract attention. the exchange rate rand volatile past years. after nominal effective exchange rate rand decline 13 per cent 2000 34 per cent 2001, increase 24 per cent 2002 nearly 25 per cent first eleven month 2003. such volatility exchange rate seem fact life economy days. fluctuation external value currency unavoidable current international monetary system generally float exchange rates. even currency peg another currency basket currencies, still float currency fluctuate widely times. large fluctuation exchange rate rand clearly healthy economy. the uncertainty cause fluctuation make investment export plan extremely difficult. what may seem profitable venture turn completely different substantial swing external value rand. the reserve bank would obviously prefer great exchange rate stability, already indicate fluctuation exchange rate rand seem unavoidable. the bank create environment favour exchange rate stability. one important recent development regard improvement net open foreign currency position reserve bank. the oversold foreign currency position bank always perceive source exchange rate weakness instability. the bank's objective therefore eliminate oversold position, stand us$23,2 billion end september 1998. during past year objective finally achieve may. at end october positive net open foreign currency position us$2,7 billion recorded. have remove perceive vulnerability, price discovery process market foreign exchange display good two-way trade pattern. in attempt improve function south african market foreign exchange, bank shift focus reduce oversold forward book strengthen official foreign exchange reserve position. considerable success achieve bring oversold forward book low levels. the balance oversold forward book stand us$2,3 billion end october 2003, compare us$6,9 billion end december 2002. in mean time, official foreign exchange reserve position also increase level us$7,8 billion end october 2003. bi review 55/2003 3 4 bi review 55/2003 6. conclusion these improvement function foreign exchange market low inflation rate least provide basis stability value rand. however, south african economy always affect considerably development rest world. any weakness u dollar major currency affect exchange rate rand. our focus therefore develop environment favour great stability. monetary policy continue focus objective price stability. fortunately world economic outlook recently improve considerably, assist attain high domestic economic growth. in addition, outlook inflation look good. thank you. toshihiko fukui: achieve sustainable growth speech mr toshihiko fukui, governor bank japan, luncheon eu ambassadors, tokyo, 28 november 2003. * * * today, i talk japan's economic outlook conduct monetary policy pursuit sustainable growth. japan's economy start recover gradually. export production increasing. corporate profit rising, business fix investment stag modest recovery. the majority bank japan's policy board member forecast real gdp growth around two half percent fiscal 2003 2004. behind japan's nascent economic recovery synchronize recovery world economy. the u economy clearly rebound, european economy show sign moderate recovery, close home, east asian economy regain high growth path quickly overcome adverse impact sars. increase interdependence unite states, east asian country japan one key achieve sustainable growth japan. for example, japanese firm strategically incorporate china low-cost production center also potentially huge consumer market good services. this underscore increase amount export import china. we also observe increasingly important mechanism whereby, example, recovery u economy stimulate east asian economies, turn positive impact japan. look domestic front, steady progress make solve structural problems. the debt sale ratio industry decline peak 1993. the employment income situation somewhat improve recently. corporate profit increase largely result firms' restructure efforts. this lead recovery business fix investment. while economic activity improving, mild deflation expect continue. indeed, recent figure bank japan's policy board members' forecast consumer price index exclude volatile food prices, generally refer “core cpi,” slightly negative, minus 0.2 minus 0.5 percent fiscal 2004. the combination economic recovery continue deflation suggest number underlie problems, may policy implications. first, output gap remain large. since real gdp growth fiscal 2003 2004 slightly potential growth, output gap reduce marginally. second, inflation decline globally. this due mainly successful conduct monetary policy worldwide increase penetration emerge country market economies. firm regain price power market. therefore, strong possibility inflation stay relatively low level, growth rate increase. third, japan's economy still suffer structural problem excess debt, excess labor, financial system fragility. because structural problems, cyclical recovery large manufacturer able generate strong positive spillover effect non-manufacturers, small medium-sized companies, households. to return sustainable growth path overcome deflation, japan must thus solve structural problem enhance growth prospect firm households. in japan, europe, structural reform ensure efficient use capital labor urgently call for. despite recent progress, complacent need structural reform. the process solve structural problem still half-finished. for example, debt sale ratio non-manufacturing industry still high bubble period. in addition, sense still hold excess labor remain among firms, whether manufacture non-manufacturing, whether large small. bank also make progress restructuring. large bank reduce outstanding amount nonperforming loan increase provisioning. they also reduce risk pertain bi review 55/2003 1 stock price sell shareholding market well bank japan stock purchase scheme. almost bank reduce shareholding level tier 1 capital. banks' financial result turn good expect first half current business year end september. because loss result disposal nonperforming loan small operate profits, bank post profits. the average capital adequacy ratio large bank around 11 percent. give schedule removal blanket deposit insurance spring 2005, time run short u engage restructure financial system restore soundness bank system. moreover, decline bank lend illustrate demand loan weak also risk-taking ability bank recover sufficiently. under circumstances, bank japan adopt quantitative ease fundamental policy framework. and make commitment maintain current quantitative easing, maintain zero interest rates, core cpi show year-on-year rate increase zero percent sustainable basis. quantitative ease help maintain financial market stability make environment surround corporate finance accommodative, thereby underpin economic activity. concern liquidity shortage money market almost dispelled, short- medium-term interest rate low, reflect bank's commitment term policy duration. in area corporate finance, borrow rate stable low levels. although outstanding amount loan declining, lend attitude bank perceive firm fund situation firm improving. during 1997 1998 amid currency crisis asia russia, failure several large japanese financial institution trigger credit crunch. since then, however, firm experience hardships, thank provision ample liquidity bank strengthen safety nets. under quantitative easing, bank raise target outstanding balance current account three time year, result total increase 10 trillion yen. in april may, bank raise target response downside risks, include negative effect sars decline stock prices. in october, bank raise upper limit target. this intend give bank flexibility provide liquidity money market operations. unlike early increase target, objective increase october deal downside risks, rather reinforce recent momentum recovery. in view, two thing important strengthen framework quantitative easing. one clarify commitment maintain quantitative ease policy, thereby enhance transparency increase effectiveness monetary policy. the strengthen transmission mechanism monetary policy area corporate finance. in october, view enhance transparency monetary policy, decide clarify commitment maintain quantitative ease policy. we also decide improve way communicate market think economic outlook. in term commitment, specify two condition terminate quantitative easing. first, recently publish year-on-year rate increase core cpi must register zero percent above, tendency must confirm period months. second, need convince future year-on-year rate increase core cpi fall zero percent. to specific, majority policy board member must forecast rate increase core cpi zero percent forecast period. while two condition necessary conditions, might case even though condition met, bank might still deem appropriate continue quantitative easing. a way improve communication market, introduce follow measure particular emphasis time frequency communication conjunction clarification commitment. we decide release interim assessment state economy price january july. previously, bank release view “standard scenario” economy review outlook risk assessment economy price twice year, april october. now, addition these, bank discus possible deviation 2 bi review 55/2003 bi review 55/2003 3 standard scenario monetary policy meet report outcome discussion january july monthly reports. the bank also decide change schedule publish monthly report well hold governor's press conference day monetary policy meetings. we hope clear concrete commitment continue quantitative ease help effect monetary ease permeate economy efficiently. we believe contribute strengthen foundation sustainable economic recovery. some argue clarification bank's commitment may impair flexibility able conduct future monetary policy. for example, market participant consider bank's commitment inflationary, cause yield curve steepen. it reflect eventual increase future short-term interest rates, also great risk premium attach concern “too-easy” policy may continue “too long.” in sense, idea policy commitment involve delicate balance act secure short-term economic recovery achieve long-term sustainable growth. consider deflation, though mild, expect continue zero interest rates, i believe unusual policy commitment, link specific observe economic indicator, necessary strike best possible balance circumstances. to strengthen policy commitment, i well aware home abroad argue adopt inflation target numerical definition price stability. in regard, let reiterate nominal interest rate constrain zero bind financial institution perform intermediary function sufficiently, cannot expect transmission mechanism monetary policy function properly. under circumstances, hard believe adoption inflation target would increase effectiveness enhance transparency regard future conduct monetary policy. i believe current policy commitment effective enhance transparency monetary policy stabilize expectation market. it clarify condition long bank intend maintain framework current quantitative ease policy. in addition enhance transparency, need strengthen transmission mechanism monetary policy area corporate finance. in regard, bank begin purchase asset-backed security back private sector corporate debt. the credit market japan traditionally dominate bank lending. however, give situation banks' ability take risk constrained, need expand market asset-backed security credit instruments, susceptible fluctuation banks' capital levels. to date, bank purchase 200 billion yen asset-backed security asset-backed commercial paper. we hope effort contribute expansion asset-backed security market raise awareness advantage among financial institution investor well encourage origination asset-backed security market. early month, bank initiate series workshop wide range market participant best coordinate effort improve market asset-backed security similar credit instruments. our current framework quantitative ease couple measure strengthen transmission mechanism monetary policy improve financial environment within firm bank engage structural problems. it thus facilitate japanese economy's return sustainable growth path also bolster effort overcome deflation. since strategy bank japan rely effort private sector, policy may take time pay off, effective way tackle root structural problems. in closing, i express sincere hope current momentum recovery europe japan successfully translate sustainable economic growth. sir k dwight venner: economic reform – towards programme resuscitation economic growth development caribbean remark sir k dwight venner, governor eastern caribbean central bank, open ceremony 35th annual caribbean monetary study conference, basseterre. st kitts, 24 november 2003. * * * the caribbean region find crossroad economic history must make fundamental choice order ensure economic viability citizens, improvement social prospects, maintenance political freedoms. all issue fit squarely within theme 35th annual conference monetary studies, “economic reform: towards programme resuscitation economic growth development caribbean”. the international domestic environment within operate make one challenge epoch experience make case economic reform even urgent one. the increase pace globalisation constant spectre poverty international level present formidable challenge instance reduce option member international community, is, develop countries. the dominant country international system pose expose threat terrorism counterpoint eradication poverty. they may express terms, fact resource divert fight poverty prosecute fight terrorism. the question increasingly ask “are circumstance poverty pre-requisite terrorism?” the opposition globalisation certainly bring number dissident different persuasions, include new style anarchist oppose violence. these issue speak fundamental systemic disjunction international level, certainly limit impact capacity develop. the stark reality may little control matters, thing equal, still must strategy disposal avoid, possible, mitigate impact country communities. this require clarity think rigorous intellectual analysis well clear understand long-term goal oppose short-term expediency. the policy maker region could possibly find rock hard place attempt balance two sometimes conflict demands. on one hand demand international community insistence raft standard codes, rat agency financial sphere, also governance democracy, environment, etc. on hand insistent demand populations, large section experience poverty unemployment, education, health social services. it must also bear mind standard live relative bangladesh sub saharan africa, americas. the weighted, undemocratic vote system well lack participation decision make

showstopper development process. this contingent approach solution domestic regional economic, social political problems. these approach base vision, technical capacity broad societal consensus goal society achieve them. with respect vision, broad outline fully accepted. that is, solution problem lie close possible integration caribbean countries. this vision devalue raise utopian proportion state would possible lifetimes. this, one could bi review 55/2003 1 posit, fact represent clear disjuncture fact political authority resides, recognition economic efficiency, require large contiguous economic space. consideration economic benefit mass people sense primary objective, extent clear articulation economic benefit wide space. a recent opinion survey jamaica reveal 61% population not, speak, averse federal arrangement. a similar poll country time ago, reveal uncomfortable view issue independence. these two result large probably best-endowed country region pose significant question u caribbean citizen begin 21st century. the answer one unspoken question independence necessary, sufficient condition economic social progress. independence give u capacity must exercise policy choice lead sustainable economic social progress. we never doubt collective regional approach also necessary condition social economic progress. the impediment always political traffic could bear demise ill-

november 2003. * * * allow begin thank invitation come speak riksbank’s work financial stability. in way stand committee opportunity regularly question riksbank governor monetary policy, natural committee also able learn riksbank’s stability efforts. in aftermath bank crisis, riksbank begin develop expertise analytical capacity regard stability issues. in autumn 1997, riksbank publish first report coherent analysis financial stability. the riksbank become first central bank present view stability publicly. other country hesitant speak openly stability financial system. their opinion would nevertheless impossible open issue event crisis occur. the riksbank’s attitude, however, good open. discuss risk vulnerability early stage would enable crisis avoided. moreover, experience transparency area price stability positive. today, thirty country follow suit. repeat financial crisis make clear always problem take account authority therefore benefit structure approach financial stability. bank focus work financial stability. this bank institution ensure function payment system. experience show individual company unable make ordinary payments, credit function society disrupted, highly adverse effect economy. insurance company also important society, system-critical way banks. i intend return subject insurance company late undeniably spotlight present. but bank important stability; balance sheet also contain built-in source instability. banks’ fund generally short term nature quickly disappear, asset long maturity cannot realise quickly. should depositor financier lose confidence bank, could face acute liquidity crisis. moreover, problem one bank spread banks. this happen liability one another due loan security trading, participate payment system. contagion effect also arise economic player suspect connection banks. bank encounter difficulties, even original suspicion entirely unfounded. a result factors, bank operate within bind strict regulatory framework subject public supervision. finansinspektionen primary responsibility prudential supervision individual banks. the riksbank oversee bank system whole attempt ass risk could arise short long term. of course, overlap task finansinspektionen riksbank, sometimes fruitful approach problem somewhat different angles. i also opinion cooperation authority work well. if crisis actually occur spite regulation supervision - happen know - government may need take action. the riksbank’s task crisis provide emergency liquidity assistance (ela) bank run liquidity problems. allow underscore, however, far certain bank difficulty give ela. since experience say easy provide assistance not, especially decision make time constraints, reason carefully consider measure - well prepared. it would serious bank feel certain would automatically give assistance event difficulties. such think could cause take unnecessary risks. be crisis spread healthy bank bank request ela, perhaps riksbank concentrate liquidity injection bank order rescue system rather bank itself. if problem bank serious nature, whereby solvency - bank’s ability meet long-term obligation - rather liquidity question, issue bi review 54/2003 1 government riksbank. even cases, reason question whether bank really systemically important take measures. in practice, every crisis entail intensive cooperation finansinspektionen, riksbank ministry finance. i keen stress important well prepare cooperation, especially give quickly crisis develop today’s financial markets. stability swedish financial system the riksbank present analysis system stability twice year. this comprise partly review development banks, mainly four major bank groups, partly analysis financial infrastructure. the analysis bank discus borrowers’ indebtedness ability service debt change bank acted. the analysis financial infrastructure discus problem risk rather complicate technical system currently use transfer payments, example rix, vpc bgc. the financial stability report enable riksbank describe banks’ ability cope unexpected disruptions. we point conceivable risk dampen exaggerate optimism upturn, everything appear problem-free. similarly, modify picture downturn and, help thorough analysis, ease concern serious loan losses. we also call attention risk discus banks. however, day never come riksbank indicate financial stability report risk financial crisis occur high. in case, crisis would materialise immediately, price financial market base expectation future developments. follow background information riksbank’s stability efforts, i intend discus recent assessment swedish financial system publish financial stability report yesterday. a always, point departure general picture economic activity. an improvement activity usually enhance bank profitability thereby resilience financial system. i probably add apply short term, prolong economic upturn lead over-optimism price imbalance asset markets, subsequently affect bank form loan losses. at moment, doubt overall economic outlook appear positive six month ago, sweden abroad, even somewhat mixed. prospect acceleration growth favourable unite state number emerge markets, le europe. the major swedish bank begin increase profitability first time since 2000. this partly equity market strengthen again, also bank cut cost interest income lend continue increase. bank thereby improve ability cope unexpected losses. loan loss remain low. there expansion credit mortgage households. the tier 1 capital four major bank rise past two year average seven per cent, satisfactory give current economic conditions. development come year expect lead increase profit capital adequacy ratios. neither banks’ borrower - half actually reside outside sweden - expect cause bank considerable loss period ahead economic activity strengthen accordance riksbank’s main scenario. the corporate sector, large borrower group group previously cause banks’ big loan losses, reduce debt burden somewhat relation equity. company also able benefit improve economic situation thereby low interest expenditure relation income. property company feel effect decline office price rents, debt moderate earn continue well interest expenditure. we far situation exist end 1980s. however, households’ debt burden increase throughout slowdown. the main reason high disposable income low interest rates, lead high house prices. debt relation income approach level see crisis begin 1990s. the difference, however, interest expenditure make considerably low percentage income then. this make high debt level possible endure. 2 bi review 54/2003 there reason vigilance regard growth household debt, even household never cause banks’ loss pose threat financial stability. but also possible increase indebtedness partly adaptation low-inflation economy. the pattern rise household borrow evident many industrialise country get good inflation past decade. when le uncertainty future inflation thereby interest rate levels, lender will grant credit also demand low risk premium credit. loan become cheaper. this make borrower incline borrow, also le uncertain future costs. thus, accumulate debt. however, households’ willingness borrow tend boost demand house thereby raise house prices. this observe sweden countries. house price sweden rise 56 per cent since 1997 current prices. also, unlike commercial property prices, decline economic slowdown recent years. in addition low finance costs, increase disposable income low house supply also contribute price rises. doe give u reason suspect speculative bubble develop house market? i don’t believe so, even glimpse local tendencies, notably stockholm. we don’t see sign house buy investment view lease price rise further. such indication evident couple european countries. a far see, price increase swedish house market appear due fundamental factor drive speculative behaviour. low interest rates, rise income limit house construction go long way towards explain current price developments. low confidence insurance company recently, medium draw attention strain financial situation life insurance companies. the crisis company place par bank crisis begin 1990s, concern could equally serious repercussion society. this case. the action life insurance company jeopardise financial system’s basic function - transfer payments, provide credit manage risk. what could happen save company choose transfer save elsewhere, event this. in case, few people sign new life insurance policies. this bad news life insurance companies, limit significance financial system stability. it unfortunate criticism life insurance companies, justified, also affect products, especially traditional life insurance. traditional life insurance excellent product anyone hop long life. the insurance include “risk” policyholder live long life, is, policyholder ensure receive predetermine income life, enable even risk large insurance portfolio. it unique product form save deserve good fate disappear confidence crisis. anyone doesn’t know exactly they’re go pas away, mean us, reason reflect advantage life insurance. in opinion, serious consequence life insurance companies’ problem confidence financial system whole may take blow. a saver feel cheated, break promise return forthcoming greed inherent perk bonus programmes. low confidence financial market institution tend subdue capital formation, lose long run. function financial market precondition good growth. a regard life insurance companies, i personally believe root problem find mutual construction, long cherish since mean profit give back policyholders. but company largely affiliate non-life insurance company banks, natural charge high fee various services, sale asset management. a profit go policyholders, way yield gain affiliate life insurance companies. this new problem, far it, come spotlight due recent events, particularly sale asset management companies, value previously difficult establish become evident. it especially annoy life insurance companies’ mutual construction no-dividend rule make policyholder responsible entire risk capital. affiliate non-life insurance company bank neither able reason contribute equity, spite fact bi review 54/2003 3 control life insurance company practice. for reason, board finansinspektionen propose possible board mutual life insurance company control affiliate companies. the fact mutual corporate structure investigate plan is, i believe, also necessary, though overdue. it observe insurance committee call attention problem associate mutual life insurance company 1998 report propose profit-making company establish clarify ownership structure control. legislator adopt committee’s proposal profit-making life insurance company since established. in case, moreover, owner force inject new risk capital result equity market decline. another confidence issue stem fact many saver since burst equity market bubble naturally feel mislead advice receive banks, security brokers, insurance broke life insurance companies. it happen many time salesperson institution present advisers, create credibility associate neutrality. unfortunately, advisers’ competence rather superficial respects, especially regard assess risk. although information, particularly major bank life insurance companies, become appreciably better, much remain do saver limit knowledge lead astray. whether companies’ effort sufficient respect delicate question. strict ethical guidelines, draw company follow finansinspektionen, could start. in country like unite states, family long force plan save finance children’s education pensions, become natural turn independent investment consultant discus much way save. a new financial landscape? allow conclude take look ahead discus number challenge may encounter regard financial stability. they tie increase international dependence. financial market integration begin become reality several part europe lead increase interdependence countries’ bank systems. a problem one country spread various way bank system countries. this place new demand prudential supervision, oversight regulations. in order create single market financial services, eu strive introduce regulatory framework common financial company within union. this enable bank compete equal terms, thus allow evolution single market competitive companies. this important initiative. common regulation often precondition enable far-reaching integration. the integration see far positive growth, even difficult quantify exact effects. study indicate increase financial integration eu could boost growth around half per cent per year. the risk, however, harmonisation make regulation extensive onerous bank really desired. in eagerness safeguard stability, regulator risk overlook efficiency. if regulation harmonised, risk strict rule union also prevail, reluctance ease already exist rule often great reluctance tighten rule further. the big common denominator natural choice smallest. neither ambition regulate away potential problem - also regulate away competition efficiency, sweden mid 1980s. therefore, unlikely also witness bubble asset market future, well bank over-expanded encounter difficulty reasons. we able manage situation without develop systemic crises. our ongoing work financial stability one way deal issues, least regard financial system’s sensitivity bubbles. but also need legislation bolster effort crisis, something lack several countries, include sweden. however, bank law committee put forward proposal 2000 legislation sweden. we hope government bill come need become acute! 4 bi review 54/2003 bi review 54/2003 5 although harmonisation regulation desirable open new possibilities, also lead problem need deal with, example regard prudential supervision crisis management. i intend leave regard supervision, would like say word crisis management. manage domestic bank crisis tricky enough, manage one across national boundary probability even difficult. let give example. after recent restructuring, nordea swedish bank subsidiary nordic countries. it market share approximately 40 per cent finland, 25 per cent denmark, 20 per cent sweden 15 per cent norway. the bank want change subsidiary branches. this would make nordea entirely swedish bank branch potentially could systemically important countries. accord current eu legislation, prudential supervision crisis management would principle issue swedish authorities. but would finnish authority accept sweden take responsibility important part finnish financial system? and would sweden will resolve bank crisis finland, would ask swedish taxpayers, nordea run difficulties? the answer question straightforward. but fairly obvious present eu legislation accommodate bank systemically important branches. an article riksbank’s financial stability report discus particular problem. the nordic central bank joint work group discuss cross-border crises, draw memorandum understand manage them. the supervisory authority correspond group purposes. unfortunately, cooperation still uncommon european level. thus, sum up, require harmonise rule financial sector europe, important resist force seek make unnecessarily extensive. we also need legislation crisis management sweden, wait long time for. and need new regulation eu manage cross-border banks. these main priority now. thank you. ewart s williams: the role credit union emerge financial landscape address mr ewart s williams, governor central bank trinidad tobago, breakfast seminar host cuna mutual group/cuna caribbean trinidad tobago unit trust corporation, port spain, 6 november 2003. * * * thank invite me. let give belated congratulation mr. chairman celebration credit union month october. i read interest many accolade received, deservedly so, sterling contribution credit union movement make towards encourage practice thrift, self-help, cooperation among member towards promote development co-operative ideals. a i review history credit union movement trinidad tobago i could help impress resilience movement ability survive prosper good time bad. i noted, example, period first economic boom, 1973 1983, one rapid growth credit union movement reflect registration new credit unions. the growth credit union resource flat late 1980’s early 1990’s, period economic decline, many credit union either collapse merged. in 1986, government introduce tax incentive help boost save credit union 1993 task force establish examine condition specific credit union provide proposal generally strengthen sector. in recent years, credit union industry go adaptation cope change financial environment. while growth last years, lopsided way. some institution adapt cope new market reality prospered, many remain traditional mould languished. what picture today? accord available data: • • • • we 130 operate credit union 400 early 1980s. total asset movement estimate around $3 billion fairly sizable sum make credit union movement important part overall financial system. interestingly, 6 large credit unions, asset $200 million $750 million account 50 percent total credit union asset large 17 account three quarter industry assets. the small institution raise resource share save deposit make small loan consumer purposes; essentially run co-operative society base principle volunteerism. in case large credit unions, new paradigm involve product service readily associate commercial banks. these large credit unions, addition share save deposits, offer certificate deposits, make mortgage commercial loans, provide credit debit card use automatic teller machine also provide cambio travel agency services. the expansion credit union sector last 35 year take place absence appropriate legislative framework. a know, present legislation, cover credit union movement {the co-operative society act} date back 1971 address prudential issues. in attempt fill gap, co-operative credit union league, past years, promote system prudential management base adherence “pearls” system, provide guideline capital adequacy, liquidity non-performing loans. the league’s effort mix results. the preliminary data i able muster suggests: (i) 40 percent operate union maintain liquidity ratio 10 percent suggest pearl system; (ii) non-performing loan industry average relatively high 20 percent; (iii) 40 percent operate credit union maintain capital adequacy ratio 10 percent, recommend ratio. the need strict regulation credit union recognise several year ago. indeed 1993 task force report recommend amendment co-operative act: (i) provide regulation supervision credit union new supervisory agency responsible minister finance; (ii) give regulator power make regulation respect prudential criterion credit unions; (iii) grant full enforcement power include removal director suspension license operate. late 1996, idb project implement participation credit union league initiate review regulatory framework establish credit union supervisory unit within ministry finance responsibility development implementation system surveillance credit unions. it clear status new draft legislation prepare context project. from vantage point, let emphasise views, official government policy. the sheer volume resource intermediate credit union well rapid change take place aggressive segment sector underscore critical need strict regulation protect fund member generally help maintain soundness financial system. the low interest rate environment promote great competition within financial sector, opinion, add urgency tight regulations. but get right regulatory framework credit union easy. it indeed ironic main strength credit union constitute unique challenge supervision regulation. for example, traditional credit union collective ownership members, technically equal vote rights, regardless size monetary investment. control therefore legally vest one person group person virtue stake. all particularly true small community employment-based credit unions. large credit union tend operate share save member well general public, much way bank non-banks. this dichotomy, personal opinion, make strong case two-tier regulatory system type common several latin american countries. in typical latin american system one tier regulatory regime pertain small “closed type” credit union continue rely volunteer manage run operation provide traditional basic services. the regulatory tier pertain “more open credit unions” diversify resource base involve wide range services, basically operate like banks. in apply model trinidad tobago, i could envisage regulatory regime closed-type operation would continue base prudential criterion although le rigid. for instance, small credit union require minimum capital requirement (but ‘real’ capital devote solely meet losses). even small credit union continue meet modest liquidity ratio require make provision delinquent loans. very importantly, require submit information operation least quarterly basis subject close monitor meet specify standards. these small credit union could monitor supervise strengthen unit ministry co-operatives. in view, large “open-style” credit union fact subject regulatory regime pretty similar obtain bank non-banks. this stringent regime place emphasis good governance risk management structures. for instance, supervisory regime clearly define distinguish role board director management, require director assume purely oversight function ensure appropriate risk-management policy place. because diversity service offer large credit union require professional management meet fit proper criterion posse technical ability conduct credit risk analysis. they subject high level capital adequacy, liquidity, loan loss provision ambitious delinquency standards. they operate clear rule establish ethical standard behaviour control insider loan avoid conflict interest. for convenience large credit union could be, first round, supervise ministry finance pending consideration broad financial supervisory authority responsibility supervision financial institutions. because unavailability data i unable say whether large credit union would able meet current standard establish bank non-banking sector. for record, delinquency ratio commercial bank average around 3 4 percent; non-banks slightly higher. while stationary minimum capital ratio commercial non-banks 8 percent, actual capital ratio bank average 20 percent even high non-banks. the liquidity ratio currently average 30 percent bank 35 40 percent non-banks. i recognise ambitious proposal may find favour current industry player would argue operate successfully without strict regulation. my point large credit union intermediate significant resource assume sizable risk operation contagion effect rest financial system. let make general observation issue credit union would need grapple context trinidad tobago’s march developed-country status. there issue, instance, whether credit union help member become saver investor - instance pool resource investment equity government fix income securities. of course, investment carry risk member would need advise agreeable investments. there clearly issue role credit union provide credit small medium size industries, area critical achievement sustain growth employment trinidad tobago. there argument give movement’s connection small man group deprive access normal bank services, entry credit union micro finance logical natural step. and honestly, i believe way find involve credit union movement area without incur excessive risks. the fact matter that, general, lend many small medium size enterprise carry high transaction cost great risk inadequate security. in many country latin america asia, government intervene mitigate risk credit guarantee schemes. such scheme seek help overcome problem loan applicant good projects, creditworthy cannot offer adequate collateral satisfy normal requirement lend institutions. the objective guarantee scheme, could finance government grant low cost loan multi-lateral agencies, share risk lend institution (in case, credit unions) borrower default lender compensate part loss involved. in case i envisage partnership institution like nedco business development corporation, provide technical assistance, project management consultancy services, one hand, resource credit union movement back government credit guarantee other. there number best practice arrangement reduce risk abuse subsidise arrangements, perhaps that’s discussion another time. i would like end follow conclude remarks: firstly, credit union movement intermediate significant financial resource assume great risks, would contend high regulatory standards. secondly, credit union movement need pay great attention improve system co-operative governance, risk management information disclosure. thirdly, movement need expand range investment opportunity available membership maintain competitive position current financial market place. fourthly, develop strategic alliance institution involve provision financial service small medium size enterprise goal credit union movement embrace. finally, let congratulate cuna mutual group sterling contribution credit union movement trinidad tobago let wish new initiative new partnership best. jean-claude trichet: testimony committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, committee economic monetary affair european parliament, brussels, 1 december 2003. * * * it pleasure appear committee first time capacity president ecb. i would like tell i impress last encounter i thank committee parliament confidence express give approval appointment. i look forward continue regular dialogue fruitful constructive spirit dear predecessor wim duisenberg, whose achievement i wish pay tribute occasion. i shall begin first report assessment economic monetary developments, turn another issue topical importance, namely draft eu constitution. i like conclude statement briefly address international role euro. 1. economic monetary development at time mr duisenberg’s last testimony september, note economic activity weak first half 2003. at time, early sign recovery emerging. since then, data confirm main scenario, one gradual improvement economic activity start second half year. eurostat provisionally estimate quarterly real gdp growth 0.4% third quarter year. there are, increasingly, reason expect gradual economic recovery euro area broaden strengthen course 2004. recent data show recovery world economy clearly make progress. the expansion global trade economic activity support euro area exports. on domestic side, recent survey data continue point towards improvement confidence. the condition investment also improve result firms’ continue adjustment effort enhance productivity profitability. finance condition generally favourable, least due low level interest rates. finally, terms-of-trade effect stem past appreciation euro also positively affect real disposable income thus facilitate pick-up consumption growth. development financial market broadly consistent overall picture gradual resumption economic growth. a compare month ago, downside risk main scenario gradual recovery clearly receded. overall, risk scenario come quarter appear balanced. over long horizons, risk sustainability economic growth global level remain. this due, primarily, unresolved structural problems, sustainability public finance external imbalance part world economy. a regard prices, annual rate hicp inflation decline 2.0% october, 2.2% september. look ahead, inflation rate may fall quickly strongly expect time last testimony president ecb. we see rather strong increase category food price owe effect summer’s heatwave. in addition, oil price remain high expected, owe mainly ongoing political uncertainty middle east. furthermore, come months, plan increase indirect tax administer price euro area country likely upward impact annual inflation rates. however, also factor continue dampen inflationary pressures. first, context gradual economic recovery, wage development remain moderate. in addition, past appreciation euro, reflect current subdue price pressure producer level, continue low import price pass consumer price time. at time, development inflation expectation need monitor closely. cross-check assessment monetary analysis, see liquidity euro area remain ample follow period strong monetary growth past two years, reflect past portfolio shifts, precautionary save low level interest rates. the latter factor also provide counterweight negative impact weak economic growth loan private sector. in view govern council, accumulation excess liquidity not, current juncture, concern price stability, give that, time being, economic recovery gradual. however, high excess liquidity continue prevail significant strengthen economic activity, could lead inflationary pressure medium term. monetary development therefore need monitor carefully. overall, govern council ecb, meet november, continue ass outlook price development line definition price stability consider current stance monetary policy appropriate. at time, govern council make clear carefully monitor development might affect assessment risk price stability. turn recent fiscal policy developments, well aware serious concerns. in recent month see gradual move away commitment make stability growth pact. the govern council already make clear 6 november recommendation european commission regard step take excessive deficit procedure push room interpretation rule procedure limit. a already know govern council’s statement public last tuesday afternoon follow decision ecofin council, govern council deeply regret ecofin council’s decision act basis commission’s recommendation regard france germany. it fully share view make public commission ecofin council’s conclusions. the conclusion adopt ecofin council carry serious dangers. the failure respect rule procedure foresee stability growth pact risk undermine credibility institutional framework confidence sustainability public finance across euro area. the govern council take note commitment france germany correct excessive deficit rapidly possible, 2005 latest, strongly urge government concern live responsibilities. it absolutely imperative effective action take limit negative effect confidence. moreover, also note ecofin council stand ready act basis commission’s early recommendation give notice two countries, fail comply council’s conclusions. the public rest assure govern council remain staunchly commit maintain price stability. we firmly believe need correct excessive deficit country pursue sound fiscal policy general frame within comprehensive credible medium-term reform strategy. it necessary executive branches, parliament social partner push ahead structural reform aim enhance competitiveness euro area, notably labour product markets, well social security systems, order foster flexible allocation utilisation capital human resources. the govern council strongly support recent ongoing effort number government direction. it also encourage social partner fully commit objective make euro area dynamic innovative economy, intend “lisbon agenda”. once convince commitment implement comprehensive structural reform foster growth perspective euro area, confidence increase among economic actors, include consumers. the upswing currently foresee sign confidence returning, economic recovery sustain essential excessive deficit correct reform currently discuss carry out. 2. the draft eu constitution for last two years, eu engage intense debate future constitution union. these debate result draft constitution present convention june culminate intergovernmental conference, seek finalise constitution end year. the ecb follow constitution-building process great interest welcome effort construction unite europe. when european union re-writes rulebook give constitution, mean profound change provision relate ecb monetary union general? throughout process draft constitution, ecb consistently advocate monetary constitution eu - basic set rule provision emu, lay maastricht treaty - sound term objective set allocation responsibility different actor level government. i grateful convention follow similar line reasoning. it draft constitution take provision relate emu without change substance. the single monetary policy is, nature, indivisible. thus, exclusive competence union. the conduct monetary policy assign independent european central bank, fulfil task together national central bank euro area clear primary objective maintain price stability. the european system central bank explicitly mention first part draft constitution. however, refinement draft constitution possible, ecb make several suggestions. for example, strongly believe price stability add list union’s objective set first part constitution, price stability great importance ecb union whole. it ensure confidence long-term value euro translate low stable medium long-term market interest rates. it also avoid arbitrary redistribution wealth, thereby help protect weak member society. there doubt price stability deserve one european union’s objectives. furthermore, would like see clarification allocation responsibility regard international representation euro. it would also useful formally recognise widely use term “eurosystem”. it intergovernmental conference use convention’s draft finalise constitution. i sincerely hope foreign minister head state government take decision full awareness historic nature task. from ecb’s point view, recent proposal introduce constitution extend enable clause would allow european council amend, unanimity, important part statute escb ecb certainly welcome. in letter i send current president council, mr frattini, last week, i stress ecb seriously concern proposal. such expansion simplify amendment procedure would imply far-reaching change current constitution escb, ecb could support. 3. the international role euro let conclude statement observation international role euro, issue i know european parliament follow great interest. the ecb monitor development area carefully and, previous years, shortly publish annual review international role euro. the find report suggest use euro non-euro area resident continue increase gradually prominent region neighbour euro area. in addition, use euro is, extent, drive euro area itself, euro area investor account significant part demand international euro-denominated bonds. while feature change past years, number new development emerge 2003. first, evidence rise interest euro-denominated bond part asian investors. second, accord late data publish imf, recently revised, share euro global foreign exchange reserve also increase 2001 2002, 16.4% 18.7%. third, euro area country increasingly use euro settlement invoice currency trade non-euro area residents, especially follow cash changeover. this suggest cash changeover may encourage exporter importer review settlement invoice practices. a know, development outcome decision essentially take market participants. they underscore confidence non-euro area resident euro. i open questions. jean-pierre roth: what expect monetary policy? summary speech mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, international center monetary bank study (icmb), geneva, 25 november 2003. the complete speech find french swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * a number current issues, weakness economy new national bank law, raise question expect monetary policy. with regard stability consumer prices, answer relatively simple. the goal price stability top swiss national bank’s priority list. since inflation deflation monetary phenomenon long term, snb guarantee price stability future too. expectation monetary policy considerably low come regulate economic activity. economic activity switzerland strongly dependent growth abroad. inflation bring long-term economic growth. stable prices, however, best precondition sustain growth. a goal price stability automatically ensure degree stability economy. because uncertainty time lags, however, fine-tune economy impossible task. speculative bubble real estate equity market increase source macroeconomic instability past two decades. although equity property price serve important indicator future development economic activity, goal monetary policy. many reason militate direct monetary-policy response change asset prices. the question nevertheless arise whether monetary policy could prevent speculative bubble form first place. bi review 53/2003 1 lars heikensten: euro entry reform reform euro entry? speech mr lars heikensten, governor sverige riksbank, frankfurt european bank congress, frankfurt, 21 november 2003. * * * the outcome sweden’s referendum unambiguous “no” euro adoption. this mean business usual swedish monetary policy. since 1993 inflation target 2 per cent, gain credibility public markets. since introduction inflation target, inflation average 1.7 per cent average growth 3 per cent. this compare well swedish experience previous decades. it also compare favourably recent performance euro area. this relative strength swedish economy opinion important factor behind result referendum. however, outcome referendum mean business usual relation vis-à-vis rest europe. we seat negotiate table frankfurt brussels could had. of course, try compensate this. to extent, do keep house order - conduct sound economic policies. also, utmost contribute european policy discussions. be outside euro certainly doesn’t mean want margin debate monetary integration europe. sweden remain ‘pre-in’; consider euro adoption point future. therefore evolution enlargement euro area concern us. secondly, sweden probably one eu nation benefit enlargement european union. our economy one eu’s integrate accede countries, surge east-west trade fdi. also, estonia, latvia lithuania adopt euro, would directly affect swedish bank baltic bank system. i would therefore like share reflection two subject relevance euro area enlargement: risk associate erm ii membership long-term framework fiscal policy. however, let stress two things: first, long-term advantage euro area enlargement evident. i believe advantage would roughly accede country would sweden: integration trade capital market stimulate growth euro adopter euro area. in case accede countries, probably additional advantage monetary integration; give add stability difficult year transition important underdevelop financial sectors. so issue really euro area enlargement such, rather time preconditions. second, perspective euro area hard see accede country could pose major risk price stability. the sum economy new member state presently amount gdp netherlands. furthermore, historically high inflation rate accede country reduce reinforce macroeconomic discipline (which turn owe much enlargement process). a simple calculation show even growth accede country average 4 per cent euro area, catch-up, accord estimates, generate balassa-samuelson price convergence 2-3 percentage point high inflation euro economies, inclusion euro area would still add 0.2 percentage point area-wide inflation. instead, perspective accede country crucial. risk erm ii the one risk erm ii discuss length recent year potential conflict peg exchange rate inflation target. both exchange rate stability low inflation necessary fulfil conversion criteria, case may difficult monetary policy alone meet two target time. one possible situation central parity set low real appreciation pressures, due catch up, strong upper band come question. this result bi review 53/2003 1 large-scale speculative currency flow unnecessary turbulence, demonstrate attack forint begin year. the obvious solution speculation upper band reach agreement erm ii revalue. but often difficult practice. when political decision-makers force choose inflation exchange rate targets, take courage - good analysis - give priority low inflation opt revaluation. a case ireland demonstrated, exclusively apply accede countries. in end, result inflationary pressure inside euro area. however, acute risk erm ii probably exchange rate low part band. virtually currency crisis experience recent decade due speculation weak currencies. erm ii, course, different previous fail regime peg exchange rate sense clear exit strategy regard euro adoption. but mean erm ii immune large fluctuation short-term financial flows. i think big problem currency board regime so-called hard peg new baltic member states. in case, erm ii membership would merely confirmation credible regime successfully maintain nearly decade, even confront severe shock russian crisis. this possible thank high degree wage flexibility well serious effort achieve fiscal consolidation. there reason concern presently float regime move towards erm ii. substantial fiscal slippage occur countries, bring far 3 per cent deficit requirement. in case deterioration consequence additional cost relate accession; neither mainly result automatic stabiliser - considerably small accede country present eu members. instead, large - cyclically adjust - deficit reflect increase public wage so-called mandatory social spending, combine lack expenditure cut fields. consolidation plan take place mainly medium long term, deficit set reduce level compatible convergence criterion towards end decade (fig. 1). some central bank colleague new member state argue rapid entry erm ii target early euro adoption precisely force politician respective country improve fiscal policy. in word one eminent colleagues: “delay entry equal delay reforms”. of course, i understand argument, end hinge political economy country. but use erm ii straightjacket risky strategy. it reminiscent period 1990-92 sweden “nominal anchor” ecu peg suppose “bind u mast” end macroeconomic shipwreck. a botch entry erm ii, increase public deficits, prone economic political instability. furthermore, meet convergence criterion view main leverage fiscal reform, worth remember particular leverage disappear emu entry. a framework fiscal policy this bring next topic: fiscal policy framework country currency union. this important issue, partly stability union whole. it also perspective behind stability growth pact. but strong framework public finance also important individual country long independent monetary policy. only fiscal policy order asymmetric shock deal reasonable way. the risk asymmetric chock necessarily high accede country many present member states; case might even smaller. a number study point relatively strong correlation accede country business cycle euro area. however, would unwise assume important asymmetric shock relative rest euro area cycle ever occur. also, risk domestically generate “political” shock due policy mistakes. we example sweden could also happen countries. how euro adopter prepare public finance asymmetric shocks? this major issue swedish debate ahead euro referendum. despite fact reform public-finance framework sweden 1990s, riksbank others argue do join euro area. 2 bi review 53/2003 essentially two thing required: first, need sufficient margin public finances. in practice, mean debt level high. if economy enter downturn affect rest euro area extent, important scope conduct expansionary policy. if scope there, one reasonably sure used. it difficult handle second, opposite situation - upturn over-heating tendencies. what require framework stimulate even force political decision-makers act time take decision might difficult short run correct long perspective. here draw inspiration monetary policy set-up. fiscal policy could guide clear target define term countries’ output gaps. alternatively, national inflation target could introduced. in combination transparent processes, include recurrent evaluation national parliament arenas, could put pressure politician act. be stability growth pact sufficient itself? after all, design ensure fiscal discipline member countries. the answer clear; could pact followed. but situation different. a pact follow large euro countries, risk newcomer take attitude. however, could dangerous conclusion. it would wise look issue way round. both germany france attain 3 per cent mark public deficit criterion narrow margin despite global upturn. but clearly enough afterwards term consolidation, despite intense pressure many small countries. today, significant problem euro area whole; country also pay price term deep long downturn. this, anything, warn new euro adopters. conclusion have raise complex issues, let clear sentiments. i wish see new obstacle separate rule new member states; equal treatment essential. no rule convergence apply new euro adopter apply present euro area participant would apply sweden vote “yes” adopt euro. indeed, early euro adoption may entirely beneficial new member state sufficiently stable flexible economy follow course fiscal prudence long time, i personally would consider beneficial sweden join 2006. rather, euro adopters’ interest independently consider risks. country use exchange rate flexibility rush system fix exchange rate condition right. if already achieve fiscal discipline, enter erm ii opt early euro adoption leverage politician bring discipline. it matter meet 3 per cent convergence criterion also reach maturity fiscal policy include transparent predictable fiscal framework sufficient room manoeuvre stabilisation policy. the road euro may otherwise become rocky, euro eventually adopted,

draft 2004source: pre-accession economic programme 2003 update 4 bi review 53/2003 jean-claude trichet: financial stability speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, forum financier belge, brussels, 26 november 2003. * * * a. introductory remark it give great pleasure brussels address well-known forum kind invitation governor quaden. the topic i shall talk today, namely “financial stability”, obviously broad challenging. my main topic discussion probable consequence profound change currently take place financial sector financial stability policy eurosystem regard. the main reason i talk topic - ecb follow issue - stability bank sector financial system large utmost importance eurosystem, central bank. it precondition successful conduct monetary policy maintenance smoothly function payment systems, major responsibility central bank. i would like focus three specific developments: increase importance financial market general market volatility specifically, financial innovation, process hand increase integration financial system across countries. when think major challenge maintain financial stability i find useful first look notion “real world” deviate “frictionless” ideal world academic textbooks. in order organise reasoning, serve useful start point, since ideal world thing financial instability. indeed, concern financial stability actually stem fact “real world” financial market friction - word - market imperfections. a fundamental friction financial market participant often imperfect information. when information perfect - market fully transparent - investors’ decision may constantly subject reassessment, lead inevitable volatility market prices. this necessarily mean inherent threat financial stability. on contrary, existence level volatility indicate market serve function suppose deliver - efficient exchange mechanism among economic agents. nevertheless, recent episode extreme volatility draw attention accurately delineate boundary “normal” could call “harmful” volatility. the second source friction also fall short ideal complete markets. through rapidly evolve process financial innovation, new instrument - often entirely new market - created, take u towards complete market provide remedy shortcoming traditional instrument markets. while process clearly increase efficiency financial system, new risk may also create along way. a major recent example emergence instrument transfer credit risk bank financial institutions. this change activity risk profile financial institutions, previously credit risk largely confine banks. one could consider third friction lack international framework crisis prevention resolution. owe fact supranational government judicial system exist, national autonomy cause problem come practical implementation, possibly hind resolution crisis global scale. a financial system inevitably become integrated, risk stem potential lack common framework increase accordingly. substantial coordination effort make international community overcome friction. here europe unique situation, go region term integration across national borders. indeed, financial stability increasingly european, rather national, concept. in particular, single currency, european system central bank single market liquid reserve - money market euro - create much interconnect european financial system usually acknowledged. consequently, cooperation effort bi review 53/2003 1 make central bank supervisory authority overcome problem cause fact supervision oversight primarily remain national responsibility. the ecb - eurosystem whole - also enhance activity field european financial stability. one part activity visible regular article reports. many activity le visible take form discussion concern financial stability ecb govern general council escb bank supervision committee, regular contribution strengthen cooperation among relevant european authority participation international discussions. i would like organise rest remark around three theme i identified. first, i look evidence provide past crisis severity market frictions. second, i would like discus change policy framework make and, third, make order preserve financial stability. b. the three theme financial stability past crisis could give u hint could also important financial stability concern future. one go far back financial system rapidly change one must always prepare surprises. often new crisis come complete surprises. b.1 the grow role financial market volatility let turn first theme - grow role markets. this development mean financial stability threat could increasingly stem financial market problems. a i allude earlier, sudden extreme shift expectation concern value asset increase volatility could represent one major type financial instability. in europe, historical period financial instability link traditional loan loss banks. however, one look longer-term perspective past 15 year so, european financial market grow rapidly. no doubt, recourse market-based finance europe still significantly unite states, gap seem rapidly narrowing. a market grow become liquid - thank also euro - investor move bank deposit direct collective security investments. whereas sharp large price adjustment may necessarily systemic implications, financial institution leverage market position may directly affected. the russian crisis august 1998 illustrate point well, mature market experience spillover effect investors’ leverage position russia emerge markets. one leverage exposure hold ltcm hedge fund. prior rescue undertake private bank aid u federal reserve, liquidity plunge price many market drop low levels. an additional element threaten stability global financial system virtually leverage treasury bond investor similar positions, include major financial institutions. banks’ direct exposure may important aspect financial instability period financial market volatility. in addition, bank may hold significant exposure non-bank financial institutions, suffer direct market exposures. the bar crisis 1995 example first case, ltcm case example second. in view, eventual scale systemic crisis might depend magnitude deviation asset price fundamentals. how, then, asset price bubble get create first place? they may create exacerbate form herd overly buoyant investor expectations, group investor imitate lead institutions’ strategies. bubble may boost lack adequate disclosure, problem conflict interest, destabilise trade investment strategies. once bubble burst, portfolio insurance strategy event fall price - dynamic hedge - might heighten downward spiral. particularly early episode equity-driven financial instability, 1987 stock exchange crash, initial wave sale equity future appear result accelerate decline stock prices. however, jury still role tool portfolio insurance automatic trade rule exacerbate aggregate financial risk. le controversial seem observation downward spiral price magnify institution involve sell wave crash, thereby generate contagion across market 2 bi review 53/2003 countries. in particular, russian ltcm crisis demonstrate important role market liquidity potential channel crisis contagion, market price fall due liquidity withdrawal could cause loss many market participants. to summarise lesson learn past experiences, seem volatility necessarily threat financial stability. other element necessary serious concern arise financial stability. one key element risk face bank financial institutions, could channel function financial system whole could jeopardised. this view support recent episode market volatility late 2002 early 2003, sequence substantial market readjustment generally manage orderly manner financial institution across globe. b.2 progress financial innovation let turn second theme - implication progress financial innovation. in fact, reason late episode stock market adjustment cause systemic problem could attribute contribution financial innovation even distribution risks. however, concern emerge regard securitisation credit risk transfer markets, instance. from perspective public authorities, concern express particular lack transparency identity ultimate risk holder adequate risk management institution deal instruments. in particular, financial innovation may subject problem behaviour yet test difficult market conditions. a new instruments, probability analysis basis historical data cannot use credit risk transfer instrument around year only, and, thus, accurate price risk always possible. inadequate data already problem use value-at-risk model risk management purpose hedge fund prior russian ltcm crises. this kind experience could reflect lack full understand market participant nature risk face. turn back credit risk transfer instruments, instrument allow bank sell credit risks, risk profile financial institutions, particularly insurance companies, also transformed. hence, major outcome financial innovation process transformation traditional risk face financial institutions. these development also affect effective supervision financial institutions, increasingly difficult obtain adequate information monitor complex possibly fast-changing risk positions. the financial innovation process has, indeed, necessitate revision traditional supervisory approach concern bank financial institutions. it also make imperative ensure risk management system financial institution able handle complexity activities. b.3 integration european global financial market i would like turn last three themes. the increase integration national financial system pose particular issue european union euro area integration fairly advanced, although fully complete. integration increase international finance flow also much global issue. recently, particular, emerge market crisis least potential major spillover effects. these financial stability risk may also relate grow complexity finance emerge country relate coordination problems. with many party instrument involved, inevitable coordination become much press problem past, small number major bank industrialise country could come agreement issuer term repayment. with sophisticate fund structure increase use debt securities, equality among creditor also become complex issue time debt restructuring. c. policy framework aim preserve financial stability let look policy response issue raise market development i described. the structure policy discussion base around three themes: importance bi review 53/2003 3 transparency order overcome information-related problems, reaction financial innovation and, lastly, increase integration potential international spillover crises. c.1 response lack information the information imperfection illustrate recent episode market turmoil notably include incomplete disparate publish information firm trade markets. i see key challenge harmonise improve availability information. the ultimate objective allow rational investment decision correct price risk. much do global level eu financial service action plan increase degree transparency support work financial markets. this action intensify since high-level corporate failure unite states, demonstrate ample scope mislead investor manipulation account information disclosed. maybe eye-catching reform - key challenge company bank particular - introduction new account standards. the international account standard board federal account standard board constantly try improve harmonise framework side atlantic. indeed, harmonise high quality account standard could make significant contribution integration efficiency financial markets, could also help europe difference account rule could affect cross-country comparability firms’ account information. in europe, reform ia 32 39 represent attempt improve comprehensiveness banks’ disclosure requirements. in recent years, banks’ risk exposure shift instrument have, now, report assets. what maybe important increase reliance financial institution derivative contracts, result grow disparity information contain financial statement true risk profile report entities. the new account standard finalise next year introduce definition financial instruments. they also cover derivative instruments, report balance sheets. a consequence, information quality coherence improved, provide accurate reflection new financial environment. however, framework emerge still far satisfactory. the revise account standard likely include option bank measure financial asset liability fair value. this mean instrument market price available could also value basis estimate fair value. several serious concern arise approach. comparability financial statement could affected, transaction could carry different value compete financial institutions. moreover, reliability valuation non-traded asset limited, quality information contain financial statement go deteriorate, thus allow imbalance build without possibility activate correct mechanisms. what concern u potential impact financial stability. empirical investigation recently conduct ecb suggest extensive use fair value account could significantly increase volatility banks’ balance sheets. valuation effect might also reduce ability financial institution react adverse shocks, thus enhance pro-cyclicality. these concern severe great caution warrant reform account standards. more accurate timely market information also useful supervisory perspective. supervisor indeed rely increasingly market discipline tool financial institution - thus complement activities. the future role financial market supervisory toolbox likely increase, despite possible period heighten volatility financial markets. in particular, reform capital framework bank (basel ii) introduce market discipline independent pillar framework. c.2 response financial innovation the process financial innovation i refer early pose least two key challenge policy-makers. first, supervisory framework need constantly updated. second, legislative process need react effective timely manner challenge create market developments. 4 bi review 53/2003 a regard banks, first basel capital accord agree late 1988 serve purpose well term raise capital level bank make safer. however, financial innovation, particular securitisation banks’ assets, leave basel i outdated easily circumvented. a consequence, need reform exist accord widely recognise supervisor work hard shape new accord close consultation private sector. the basel ii accord aim bring capital requirement close true economic risk banks’ portfolio offer wide range option approach respond increase complexity financial instruments. basel ii achieve basically rely banks’ internal model supervisory process. an important by-product is, therefore, lot pressure bank improve risk management systems. improvement already visible. it seem clear supervisory efforts, similar bank sector, may also need sector financial institutions, example insurance. the ecb draw attention since early stage basel ii process implementation framework eu macro-prudential implication possibility increase pro-cyclicality certain provisions. when bank capital largely base risk risk increase recession, macroeconomic consequence might arise procyclical reduce ability bank lend. these concern appropriately address revise proposal submit consultation basel committee european commission. pro-cyclicality concern substantially mitigate good balance find risk-sensitivity macroeconomic stability. of course, attention pay aspect term implementation new framework well. c.3 response integration let talk next challenge cause third development, progress financial integration. i first discus relevant european issue turn global issues. eu/euro area issue in eu first challenge increase efficiency complex regulatory process meet pace innovation sustain market increase regulatory convergence across country order support integration reduce burden financial institution operate several countries. the so-called lamfalussy procedure - experience already gain security supervision - seek precisely this, also improve state affair bank insurance supervision. the deepen market integration experience eu give rise need enhance supervisory cooperation common financial stability surveillance. a regard pure, micro-level supervisory cooperation, cooperation gradually step “lamfalussy procedure” establishment so-called level three committees, supervisor exchange view - primary aim achieve consistent implementation exist legal framework. we need adequate cooperation central bank supervisory authority well safeguard relation crisis prevention. the escb bank supervision committee long work interface eu central bank bank supervisory authorities. it combine macro-level perspective central banks, best place monitor ongoing development financial system, equally important micro-level approach supervisory authority provide joint comprehensive assessment stability eu bank sector. let also note importance appropriate arrangement eu level financial crisis management. good progress make result recommendation brouwer report. notably, bank supervision committee conclude memorandum understand cooperation information-sharing crisis management situation central bank bank supervisor eu. global issue at international level, example effective crisis management resolution hind absence common legal framework well documented. however, common legal framework one important element require orderly pursuit international finance. another would bi review 53/2003 5 6 bi review 53/2003 concrete enforcement mechanism, possibly inconceivable context sovereign states. indeed, contractual arrangement increasingly aim compensate lack common regulatory enforcement framework. the response international community coordination problem include effort crisis prevention crisis resolution. in context crisis prevention, promotion international standard code promise avenue. the policy response alleviate crisis resolution cover three aspect involved: domestic adjustment, official finance private sector involvement. although three crucial successful crisis resolution, let focus last. a regard private sector involvement, several proposal put forward, include sovereign debt restructure mechanism (sdrm) propose international monetary fund (imf). this legally bind mechanism base idea element bankruptcy mechanism applicable domestic context private public sector entity could use sovereign context. the idea create sdrm put aside time being, mainly concern potential adverse effect borrow costs. a second proposal, support enthusiastically private sector number sovereign issuers, base use collective action clause (cacs). these clauses, facilitate coordination among creditor create clear rule reach bind agreement debt restructure proposal, would become regular feature new international bond issuance. cacs advantage easily integrate market practice straightforward structure, make powerful coordination tool creditor hold debt issuance. however, contribution solve coordination problem level total stock outstanding debt country le clear. finally, third proposal - actually one i suggest imf world bank annual meet washington september 2002 - currently study group twenty so-called code good conduct, would set best practice guideline borrowers, lender international community. the group twenty consist g7 major industrialise countries, large emerge market economics also eu presidency, ecb, imf world bank, well chairperson international monetary financial committee development committee. although best practice would non-binding, could improve process crisis resolution. in particular, code would spell general principle party involve would also offer “toolbox” agree instrument best practice use interest party depend circumstances. the code would also include cacs set instrument recommended. in october meeting, group twenty decide encourage group issuer market participant engage discussion. d. conclude remark in conclusion, issue generate fast evolution financial system i speak today complex demand public authorities. i hope i able demonstrate element necessary public response encouraging, others require renew efforts. my objective also focus european issue highlight special condition euro area role ecb eurosystem foster financial stability. thank much, lady gentlemen, attention. jaime caruana: the new basel capital accord: need we're remark mr jaime caruana, governor bank spain chairman basel committee bank supervision, fifth meet asian program institute international finance, beijing, 17 november 2003. * * * i’d like thank institute international finance bank china host discussion outlook bank finance asia. for many reasons, seem especially appropriate discus topic beijing. the tremendous growth china’s economy, recent accession world trade organisation, wide scope change occur make china reference world. i please opportunity discus effort basel committee bank supervision promote financial system good able sustain growth resilient period distress. it honour address forum, i must confess i come listen learn. the message i consistently hear one hand one strong support principle new capital accord desire best standard financial system country. too many example illustrate economic cost social unrest weakly capitalise poorly manage bank inflict economy. it seem recognize importance sound bank system economic well-being. in recent years, central banker supervisor around world work hard new requirement bank capital. i think familiar idea that, “he ask fool five minutes, ask remain fool forever.” for last five years, basel committee ask comment idea industry, academia, community supervisor improve international capital standards. the wealth idea view many share u make process long expected, benefit open honest dialogue good able achieve sound balance accord. i think close meet objective. today i would like emphasise, perhaps even over-emphasize, three word guide work new accord, namely balance, consistency cooperation. we seek balance approach new capital guideline apply around world. a balance approach meaningful global organisation yet flexible enough apply smaller, regionally focus banks. we work hard strike right balance many compete objectives, find balance introduce incentive bank improve risk management implement system prescriptive rules. we seek balance complexity risk sensitivity; complexity comparability; soundness conservatism; flexibility consistency, on. even structure accord regard balance among three different policy approaches: rules, discretion market discipline. in addition seek balance new accord, committee’s work also guide two words, namely consistency cooperation. i say later, i would like emphasize word “consistency” now. we achieve full potential prudential standard new capital accord support financial economic policy regulation share consistent set goals. policy maker long understand value monetary stability, recent year learn much importance financial stability interact monetary policies. interaction real economy financial market become intricate domestic level relevant global economy. indeed, sound fiscal policies, combine monetary stability aim base strong financial institutions, prudent regulation technical area accounting, provision bankruptcy value necessary companion financial regulation new capital accord. in remark today, i’d like begin brief reminder bank supervisor bank around world believe need “new basel accord.” then, i’ll discus new accord’s structure bi review 52/2003 1 share late news committee finish framework bank ready implement come years. finally, i’ll conclude think transition new capital accord. why need new accord we might begin recall care much capital - felt need new capital accord, first topic i address today. in many ways, supervisor view capital last line defence bank. when risk management insufficient, reserve exhausted, capital absorb loss prevent bank’s failure. but capital run out, bank may become insolvent, leave public authority taxpayer responsible restore depositors’ savings. the challenge determine much capital sufficient. a know, one basel committee’s best-known achievement release 1988 agreement define measure adequacy bank’s capital. the 1988 basel capital accord milestone. for first time, supervisor agree definition capital minimum requirement adopt 100 countries. more importantly, accord reverse downward trend internationally active banks’ capitalisation, thereby strengthen health stability global bank system. in year since 1988, drawback simple approach capital regulation become apparent. advance technology telecommunications, innovation bank product services, increase globalisation financial market change way many bank measure manage risk. today, 1988 accord long provide bank - supervisor - reliable measure actual risk face. the structure new accord in response, committee decide late 1990’s refine measure assess manage risk basel accord. but want achieve simple update rules. instead, want incorporate best practice use lead organisation across industry. by so, hope strengthen stability global financial system, something would benefit bank society large. in undertake challenge, bank supervisor recognise adequate level capital enough ensure success bank - even long-term survival. a bank’s long-term success determine chiefly quality management controls, together make first line defence. the new basel accord seek capture relationship adequacy capital quality risk management rely three important mutually reinforce “pillars”. these consist of, first, minimum capital requirements; second, supervisory review; third, market discipline. the three pillar reflect trend among bank supervisor embrace balance philosophy regulation provide incentive bank manage risk appropriately. the first pillar, example, seek align capital requirement closely actual risk bank face. but minimum requirement provide economic incentive - form low capital charge - bank develop good measure exposure risk good technique manage risks. bank traditional exposure le complex operation good able ensure capital base sufficient level credit risk face align capital requirement external measure borrowers’ creditworthiness. the sophisticate approach credit operational risk allow bank rely increasingly assessment risk determine much capital hold. this put responsibility assess respond risk appropriate place, namely bank’s management directors. they best position know customer risks, therefore appropriate - critically important - understand responsibility administer bank’s asset activity responsible manner the second pillar highlight important role supervisor play ensure individual bank hold adequate capital. under new accord, supervisor responsible evaluate 2 bi review 52/2003 internal process bank use determine need capital ensure manager exercise appropriate degree judgement. the responsibility supervisor ensure bank system operate safe sound manner individual bank run capable competent leaders. but supervisor manager banks. the decision bank best respond different risks: job always rest senior manager bank’s board directors. instead, engage manager dialogue risk face control adopt address second pillar, supervisor create incentive manager behave prudently find way improve performance. the third pillar seek leverage ability market provide discipline bank ensure hold unrealistically low level capital. by improve quality banks’ public report risk measure take control them, intend strengthen ability market participant understand bank’s risk profile. when investors, customers, even bank access good information well bank manage risks, good able make business invest decision relevant bank, create powerful incentive bank management improve handle risks. together, three pillar minimum requirements, supervisory review, market discipline intend ensure bank understand risk take adequate precaution protect risk control structure hold capital. but importantly, bank incentive find good way identify, measure, manage exposures. current status new accord this past summer, conclude third round public consultation proposals, i’d like give sense current status new accord, second topic i address today. by may read basel committee reach agreement last month address final issue raise public consultation summer complete new rule mid-year 2004. this easy task, committee receive 200 comment letter third consultative paper, “cp3”. while might somewhat surprise number response received, surprise hard work evident letters. on note, i would like offer committee’s appreciation banks, bank associations, include member iif, public agency asia elsewhere devote considerable time resource consultations. if you’ve follow work since first consultative paper release 1999, know proposal evolve improve considerably thank honest response letter others share us. at committee’s meet last month, member acknowledge responsibility consider carefully comments. at time, recognise need resolve open issue release new accord soon possible bank continue prepare new rules. in statement press meeting, member committee note expect take account remain issue complete text new accord come month late mid-year 2004. let briefly mention issue present comment letters. complexity balance risk sensitivity comparability certainly key issue address balance complexity agreement need sensitive risk offer different kind bank comparable approaches. it true new accord offer far sophisticate view risk far simple 1988 accord does. but intent. we seek adopt best measure credit operational risk. in field credit risk, example, loan officer risk manager lead bank worldwide disposal constantly evolve array databases, software, credit risk models, risk rat systems, provide supplemental empirical insight risk readily quantified. and new tool initially develop refine promote bank’s competitiveness protect loss - respond regulatory mandate. bi review 52/2003 3 nonetheless, committee seek balance complexity risk-sensitivity. when complex rule fail add much new accord’s measure risk, committee work remove it. most recently, example, announce madrid press release simplify proposal securitisation exposures. at time, industry ask committee sacrifice risk sensitivity make sense. the new accord complex document partly bank felt disadvantage simple rule want rule comparable situations. they ask u adopt option address risk unique particular business activity which, cases, require complicate considerations. if read comment letter website, see many late suggestion industry would tend increase complexity new accord even further. still, know easy enforce simple rule complicate one. a complete text new rules, continue simplify streamline framework. conservatism balance soundness conservatism a second issue respondent proposal raise sense new accord may highly conservative assumption much risk exist certain exposures. question conservatism matter u try align capital closely risk way conceptually sound. a good example would treatment retail exposures, include small medium enterprise fall category, committee find persuasive economic evidence support significantly low requirement compare early draft new rules. another example evaluate currently concern treatment credit loss bank adopt one sophisticate approach credit risk, “internal ratings-based” “irb” approach. our current rule irb approach derive capital charge mathematical estimate bank’s credit loss - could anticipate versus could not. bank criticise proposals, since traditionally capital exist protect bank unexpected losses, reserve hold bank expect experience credit losses. we seek revise treatment credit loss calibrate capital loss anticipate - “unexpected losses” - issue proposal comment website. we continue evaluate soundness assumption new accord relative degree conservatism final month ahead. competition balance flexibility consistency apply new accord consistently across country essential goal committee. by incorporate minimum standard new accord, want global competition bank market drive bank’s strengths, rather difference country’s rules. moreover, pillar two three create great degree level play field bank encourage consistent supervisory approach public reporting. to advocate great consistency application new rules, committee create accord implementation group share experience encourage share approaches. we expect discussion help supervisor apply new accord consistently encourage great cooperation among supervisors, one three word - together balance consistency - i mention begin guide committee’s work new accord. base implementation group’s work date, committee publish paper last august “high level principle cross-border implementation new accord”. in paper, reiterate view traditional allocation responsibility home host supervisor continue. cooperation critical effective supervision new accord, especially consider need internationally active bank receive approval adopt, validate, advance approach credit operational risk home host jurisdictions. similarly, supervisor need find practical way cooperate evaluation capital adequacy second pillar ongoing review compliance minimum operational requirement new accord. 4 bi review 52/2003 the implementation group core principle work group, make senior regulator variety country plus representative world bank international monetary fund meet second time december continue discussion issue relate especially responsibility cooperation home host supervisor issue significant systemically important foreign subsidiary may pose different jurisdictions. base progress lead bank worldwide make adopt sophisticate approach risk management, many country indicate plan implement new accord, whether short long run. this lead final topic i’d like discuss, namely issue relate transition new accord across world. broad application new accord around world, transition basel ii in draft replacement 1988 accord, member committee seek ensure capital guideline could apply around world many kind banks. this mean rule must build best practices, yet remain relevant conventional bank traditional markets. the new accord provide “menu” option measure risk, thereby offer degree flexibility necessary bank various size strategic orientiations adopt new framework. now new basel accord move away “one-size-fits-all” approach capital, supervisor every jurisdiction opportunity evaluate would appropriate bank large, complex, internationally active. at time, could say basel move away “one-schedule-fits-all” approach implement new rule worldwide. or, prefer, committee say country, “pick flower flower bloom”. this suggestion particularly crucial supervisor adopt 1988 accord recently. some supervisor believe bank may still strengthen credit risk management function consequently would benefit substantially new accord moment. for situations, member committee long express view bank supervisor concentrate fundamental first. bank country work toward develop adequate understand risk face sense best practice use worldwide. for example, bank develop understand credit underwrite cycle, skill credit analysis, insight danger pose operational risks. they nurture healthy environment corporate governance, strengthen system internal controls, promote robust internal external audit processes, adopt sound standard accounting, loan analysis classification, provision reporting. in turn, supervisor still fortify foundation bank system may consider variety approach capital regulation. for countries, application simple approach new accord may appropriate. but others may feel bank yet ready may decide, careful review, would continue apply 1988 basel accord several year bank continue strengthen risk management capabilities. i want emphasise basel committee support decision supervisor believe market may yet ready. we would encourage country choose remain 1988 accord look principle new accord, especially strengthen second third pillars. moreover, whether country intend implement new accord end 2006 perhaps later, basel committee recommend supervisor everywhere encourage bank strengthen ability identify, measure, manage full range risk face internal processes. at time, i encourage hear bank supervisor share notion none countries, regardless stage development, foster economic growth unless bank adequately capitalise well managed, financial system stable, market transparent open. i believe new basel accord go long way toward achieve strengthen three objectives. certainly hope that, time, bank bank system adopt advance approach risk measurement management lay new accord. when bank adequately capitalise well-managed, good able promote growth provide credit consumer business alike. but broadly, bank system worldwide bi review 52/2003 5 6 bi review 52/2003 adequately capitalise well-managed, international financial system become stable, good able promote sustainable growth, resilient period distress. thank attention.
