activityat stage, general expectation amongst economist privatesector monetary policy ease course 1997. difference opinion mayexist soon ease begin, much interest rate decline result ofthe easy conditions.this assumption based, firstly, projection slow-down inthe rate expansion total domestic economic activity. last year, rate growth ingross domestic production decline 3.1 per cent, slightly 3.4 per cent 1995.it must also note decline rate growth non-agricultural sector waseven pronounced, rate increase total real value add decline 4½ percent 1995 2 per cent 1996. in important manufacture sector, declinewas 7½ per cent growth 1995 ½ per cent 1996. it strong recovery theagricultural sector maintain overall growth level 3 per cent plus last year.agriculture make contribution growth 1997 foreconomic analysis purpose make sense ass future prospect non-agriculturalproduction decide possible course monetary policy rest year.there tentative sign total manufacture production may start anew expansionary phase fourth quarter last year seasonally adjust annualiseddecline 1 per cent third quarter switch 2 per cent expansion fourth quarter.this expansion production boost partly rise demand rest worldfor south african products, follow depreciation rand last year. this importantdevelopment make contribution maintenance reasonable growth 1997.developments demand side economy also indicate markedslow-down total economic activity last year. the rate increase total domestic expendituredeclined 6.5 per cent 1994 5.2 per cent 1995, 3.0 per cent 1996. in case,the decline broadly base rate increase gross domestic fix investment,private sector consumption expenditure accumulation inventory recede last year.there one exception, consumption expenditure general governmentwhich rise 5 per

financialmarkets, lead upward pressure inflation.bis review 31/1997 at stage, economist predict slow-down rate increase inprivate sector consumption expenditure continue growth current level grossdomestic fix investment. an important factor projection therefore behaviourof government consumption expenditure. it regard provision make theminister finance budget speech last week increase total governmentexpenditure 6.1 per cent 1997/98 vital importance. in real terms, afterprovision depreciation, total government expenditure indeed decline therefore makean important contribution retention macroeconomic equilibrium year.2. monetary policy balance paymentsmonetary policy decision obviously also affect overall balance ofpayments situation, development domestic economy. last year,international economic relation dominate south african economic scene. towards endof year, however, good equilibrium also restore external account thiscontributed expectation easy monetary policy 1997.the current account south african balance payment show asubstantial grow deficit first half 1996. in second quarter, seasonallyadjusted annualised rate deficit reach r12.9 billion justifiable concernthat could increase even further. against background slow-down total domesticexpenditure second half year, growth import level and, somegood increase exports, current account balance payment improve anannualised deficit r4.7 billion fourth quarter last year. prospect good asmall deficit record current account balance payment 1997.the main reason balance payment problem last year befound capital account. the net capital inflow decline r19.2 billion 1995 onlyr3.9 billion 1996. the capital inflow long sufficient cover deficit thecurrent account, official gross foreign reserves, low level beginwith, decline r5.4 billion.these development exert extreme pressure exchange rate randand, well-known, average weight value rand basket currency ofsouth africa’s major trade partner depreciate 21.9 per cent 31 december 1995 to31 december 1996.the balance payment situation obviously demand restrictive monetarypolicy throughout past twelve months. here also, however, important change take placeafter october 1996. the improvement domestic economic situation currentaccount balance payment restore confidence market foreignexchange, particularly foreign reserve start rise fourth quarter. theexchange rate rand reach low turn point october 1996, stabilise novemberand december show impressive appreciation 9 per cent since begin ofthe new year.optimism balance payment 1997 rest strongly theexpectation good net inflow capital country year. sofar, result encourage relatively strong demand south african equitiesand bond non-residents. in january february, non-residents indeed net buyer ofbis review 31/1997 - 3 -more r5 billion south african list securities, total amount necessarilyrepresent net inflow foreign exchange reserves.the announcement make minister finance budget speech lastweek relaxation exchange control also important effect thecapital account balance payments. it difficult forecast much capital ofresidents may leave country relaxations, generally assume thiswill balance inflow non-resident fund country. indeed, notunreasonable assume total net inflow capital excess project currentaccount deficit add amount official foreign exchange reserve courseof year.if assumption prove correct, exchange rate rand, measuredagainst basket, stable year experience last year. such abalance payment situation also reduce pressure monetary policy contributeto easy domestic financial conditions.3. monetary policy domestic financial situationin stable macroeconomic situation good equilibrium balanceof payments, monetary policy aim directly influence development themore important domestic financial aggregates. in statement issue last friday, reservebank indicate rate increase m3 money supply exceed 10 per cent in1997. this provide real growth economy rate 2 3 per cent, andinflation level well 10 per cent.the reserve bank concern rise trend inflation gainedsubstantial momentum course 1996. the average rate inflation last year was7.4 per cent, low rate inflation south africa since 1972. the annual figuredisguises fact however, inflation reach low turn point 5.5 per cent april1996, since rise level 9.4 per cent december 1996 also january1997. in fourth quarter last year, quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjust annualised rateof inflation high 12.7 per cent.the escalation inflation cause mainly depreciation rand, bysharp rise food prices, rise interest rate also rise unit labour cost perunit production. in situation, however, imperative rate increase themoney supply constrained, require meaningful slow-down rate ofincrease bank credit extension. last year, m3 money supply rise 13.6 per cent, andtotal bank credit extend private sector 16.1 per cent. if want make sure thecurrent trend inflation perpetuated, must make sure increase themoney supply automatically accommodate rise prices, even stimulate theinflationary pressure emerge sources.the recent development financial situation therefore emit thesame optimistic signal emanate real economy balance payment foran early ease monetary policy. on contrary, reserve bank would still want seeclear sign slow-down rate increase bank credit extension moneysupply lend official support decline interest rates, ease monetarypolicy general.bis review 31/1997 4. monetary policy budgetfor monetary policy purposes, important aspect fiscal budget isthe deficit must finance borrow government. a large deficit absorb agreater share available save private sector therefore leaf le scope forexpenditure private sector. a large deficit force increase demand privatesector bank credit replace government withdraw save pool.more bank credit, however, create money increase risk high inflation infuture.the reserve bank therefore particularly please determine effortmade minister finance reduce deficit budget 5.4 per cent grossdomestic product 1996/97 4.0 per cent 1997/98. in absolute terms, net borrowingrequirement (i.e. deficit take open cash balance consideration) increasedby r1.3 billion, r23.5 billion r24.8 billion. take account much loweramount mature debt new fiscal year, total gross borrow requirement factbeen reduce r41.0 billion current fiscal year r36.8

thattotal government debt end february 1997 amount r309.5 billion, equal 55.3per cent gross domestic product. this relatively large deficit country arelatively low overall save ratio, massive need

achievedthrough constraint government expenditure, increase taxes. bothgovernment expenditure level 30 per cent government revenue 26 per cent grossdomestic product, regard high side desire reduce

southafrican economy. in long term, implication budget work thefinancial markets, reduce pressure monetary policy.in short term, however, main objective monetary policy must toforce similar mood financial discipline also private sector. not government, butalso private sector individual corporates must reduce reliance credit thefinancing economic activity. some decline rate increase total

(the taxation “passiveincome” earn foreign country refer minister budget speech.)foreign investment will, however, hold new risk exposure south africaninvestors, particularly environment volatile international exchange rates. the time ofthe transfer investment foreign currency detrimental. a south africaninvestor may transfer save sterling investment early year whenthe exchange rate rand pound r8.00 = £1.00 could lose 10 per centof investment within short period time. last friday exchange rate back tor7.10 = £1.00. this bring foreign investment new speculative element notexist local investment market.finally, private individual south africa knowledge theexpertise manage foreign investment portfolios, ass alien risk exposure areconnected investments. we not, sentimental reasons, make use ofa new freedom invest fund abroad local investment serve need good andmore effectively.4. monetary policy environment exchange controlsthe new situation bring new challenge also monetary policy. thedepreciation rand last year, appreciation almost 10 per cent since november1996, give u taste new exposure financial system global markets. ifsouth africa want part global village, shall abide rule theinternational markets.without exchange controls, capital outflow dictate marketforces, market incline put heavy penalty error make government andcentral bank macroeconomic policy decisions. it fatal country liberaliseits financial system encourage integration domestic financial market theglobal system, balk discipline markets.5. financial institution without exchange controlsmany south african financial institution already take challenge ofbecoming part international financial community. such institution also toconsider carefully new venture affect security, liquidity solvability.there numerous example world collapse failure major financialinstitutions international exposure.governments financial regulator supervisor cannot protect multinationalinstitutions many risk involve global. south african institution wereprotected international risk exposure isolation country thebis review 30/1997 -

addresssome major issue hungarian bank - issue which, thank progress make thepast years, long totally dissimilar face bank western europe. iintend make comment these, since issue i possibly throwsome light basis professional experience.1. the first specificity banking, i.e. possibility ordesirability clearly distinguish banks, rule regulations, financialintermediaries. i note recent change hungarian bank law imply amovement towards de-specialisation banks, notably field security transactions. ibelieve development towards universal bank model justify - certainconditions. it justify two group reasons.first, financial innovation general, securitisation particular, arebreaking traditionally neat distinction bank financialintermediaries, indeed even financial intermediation financial markets, theworld. some time ago, bank define financial intermediary whose liability (mainlysight short-term deposits) equivalent money supply, money supply wasdefined total sum bank liabilities. this nice circular definition keep academics, bankregulators central banker equally happy moment financial innovation startedblurring distinction money financial assets, securitisation beganblurring distinction financial intermediation financial market operations. theproliferation derivatives, financial future like add confusion betweenbalance sheet off-balance sheet items. the result become increasingly difficultto identify bank basis old equivalence “banking liability = money supply”.this recognise sweep deregulation bank activity affect thewhole western europe and, though cautiously, also unite states. in case thishas go far allow emergence consolidate bank insurance activities.bis review 16/1997 - 5 -second, short hungarian perspective, bank hungary head starton financial intermediary collect financial save household theenterprise sector. admittedly, hungary badly need large-scale development lifeassurance companies, pension funds, mutual fund like, i.e. institutionalinvestors channel save towards equity investment. but take time, sinceexperience human resource rare reform pension system healthservices take time. bank allow fill gap time being, put thedisposal saver wide variety financial instruments.2. now let come risk generalise move towards universalbanking could entail, way mean contain them.the main risk, course, emergence conflict interest. one suchpotential conflict interest may arise within bank, bank’s risk-takingactivity risk-taking customers. the classic example potential conflict ofinterest credit-granting security underwriting, one example. thetraditional way avoid misuse conflict-creating situation (a) devise anorganisational structure clearly distinguishable line responsibility, (b) avoid flow of“inside” information various activities, (c) attribute activity costs, incomeand profits, (d) entrust external auditor surveillance system put place.the end-result will, course, never entirely safe. moreover, build “chinese walls”inside multi-polar bank organisation may weaken, even destroy, synergy betweenthose poles, i.e. may undermine rationale multi-polar organisation. i would want,however, overstate internal conflict interest argument. in long run, kind ofconflict i refer unlikely strong. in longer-term perspective, nobank afford favour risk-taking activity expense customer - especiallyif audit make certain misuse bank’s power would come light.3. another much dangerous conflict interest could arise bank iscapable exercise decisive shareholding power another non-banking firm, isat time major creditor. this could unacceptable consequence thefirm’s shareholder but, practice become widespread, could even lead structuraldistortions entire industries. to avoid happening, i would favour rather strict regulations.for instance, mutual fund manage bank either limit equityparticipation individual firm access firm’s board. the apply,a fortiori, bank’s direct permanent equity participation non-banking firm - unless,perhaps, bank remain shareholder (as were, say, pension fund), without directbanking operation firm question.4. under last point, i already touch one particular aspect corporategovernance, namely bank play decisive role non-banking firm’s life. but youwill also face reverse problem: non-banking firm become bank’s keyshareholder could therefore potentially induce risk-taking bank favour, theexpense bank’s shareholder depositor customers. this particularlyacute danger country many non-bank institutional shareholders, wherethe defence minority shareholder tradition depositor properlyprotected. such problem encounter western market economies. it clearly inhungary’s interest build up, consolidate, appropriate defence emergence ofsuch problems.bis review 16/1997 - 6 -5. in order avoid misunderstandings, i launch appeal infavour overregulation. in market economy, best regulator market itself. and whenspontaneous market regulation fail - happen - second-best solution useregulatory technique favour emergence market-led self-regulation. i simplytrying make two points. first, bank finance broad generalimplications economy whole kind activity. a crisis in, say, steelindustry create hardship, create general crisis. a bank crisis may well so.second, bank finance evolve fast pace combine influence oftechnological progress, innovation globalisation. this need careful adjustment theregulatory framework, general weakening.6. in different area, may i call attention need develop bothretail bank narrow sense term also bank service

bank soundness monetary policy world globalcapital market sponsor international monetary fund hold washington on29/1/97.i would like say first pleasure today participatein conference opportunity exchange view important issuesaddressed session particular. i also want thank governor george fine surveyon question whether bank remain special; paper make many good point i agreewith virtually say. a consequence, comment thenature expand upon remarks, rather take issue main points.as governor george noted, degree u regard bank as“special” bind color history development bank respectivecountries. of course, u.s. bank quite unique many respects. relative u.k., forexample, many depository (on order 25,000 so) operate withmore regulatory restriction activity u.k. many countries. also,our system deposit insurance generous u.k. bear difference inmind, i attempt address aspect subject today apply le generically inall countries, i draw u.s. experience illustrations.to begin, let say i find seemingly simple question “are bank stillspecial?” deceptively difficult. in read mr. george’s paper organize ownthoughts subject, i compel answer series even basicquestions as: “how define ‘bank’?”, “what mean ‘special’?”, “ifbanks indeed special, imply proper stance government vis-à-visthe bank industry type financial service providers?”for purpose discussion, i define bank rather broadly anyfinancial intermediary accept deposit extend loan household businesses. in theunited states, definition encompass domestic commercial banks, branch foreignbanks operate unite states, save loan associations, credit unions.defining constitute “specialness” difficult. in general terms,analogous governor george’s definition, i define “special” aspect bank one inwhich clear pronounce public interest exceed present type ofbusiness commerce. a i note fully following, definition “special”does necessarily imply special aspect bank question isolate orinsulated competition financial service providers. there least three generalaspects bank bank deem special many observer -- liquiditytransformation function banks, provision basic financial service creditextension, deposits-taking, payment processing, linkage bankingsystem conduct monetary policy. in following, i take these“special” aspect bank turn.so, liquidity transformation function bank still special? by term“liquidity transformation function” banks, i refer typical balance sheet structure ofbanks often feature sizable volume highly liquid liability -- bewithdrawn par demand balance check account -- combination abis review 13/1997 - 2 -portfolio generally longer-term asset often difficult sell borrow shortnotice.it probably fair say considerable agreement among centralbankers economic policymakers unique balance sheet structure create aninherent potential instability bank system. rumor concern individual bank’sfinancial condition -- even ill-founded -- spark run depositor creditor thatmay force bank unload asset firesale price and, extreme situations, suspendpayment withdrawal requests. especially distress institution large prominent, thepanic spread banks, potentially debilitate consequence economy awhole. most country private bank system experience episode bank panic tosome degree, unite states, panic occur frequency latenineteenth century major factor exacerbate great depression 1930s.while institutional regime differ, country establish safeguard bankingpanics rest three basic pillar -- form deposit insurance (explicit implicit), aprogram bank supervision regulation, institution act lender lastresort.to come back basic question whether liquidity transformationfunction bank associate instability remain “special,” i would say issimply doubt it. wherever bank panic occurred, effect economicperformance crippling. thus, develop institution mechanism preventor short-circuit bank panic remain important “special” goal economic policymakers.having say this, however, recent experience unite state elsewhere haveunderscored importance go task way overextend thebanking “safety net.” in unite states, lesson painfully convey 1980sand early 1990s hundred hundred bank thrift failure occur theseyears. while phenomenon extraordinarily complex, many argue underpriceddeposit insurance relatively lax supervision contribute problem distort theincentives bank thrift face assess risk business decisions.in response, u.s. federal bank agency implement change trimthe bank safety net somewhat -- example, require prompt closure troubledinstitutions, apply strict rule govern payoff depositor creditor inbank failures, curtail practice allow regulatory “goodwill.” in addition, newbank capital regulation basle risk-based capital standards, beenimplemented g-10 serve blueprint capital regulation many othercountries, help provide good incentive bank business decisions.to summarize, i would argue bank remain quite special theirsusceptibility run severe consequence large-scale bank panic wouldinvolve today. balance need bank “safety net” defuse potential bank run withthe need create right incentive bank assess assume risk one mostdifficult challenge face central bankers.a second way bank deem “special” theprovision basic bank service credit extension, deposit-taking, paymentsprocessing. there little question function critically important throughoutsociety. consumer turn bank safe investment time save deposits, fortransactions deposits, process payments, short- long-term credit. large andsmall business rely bank payment processing, short-term credit, backup creditbis review 13/1997 - 3 -lines. and government rely bank system conduct payments, distribute currency,safeguard tax receipts, serve conduit monetary policy. in short, basic businessfunctions bank heart financial system economy overall. by thedefinition i put forward earlier, i would say basic function perform bybanks remain special. however, far clear function beperformed bank always “special” public purpose ensure banks’role perform function protected.indeed, governor george noted, nonbanks make impressive inroad inmarkets previously largely banks’ domain. for example, money market mutualfunds stock bond mutual fund lure billion dollar formerly beenplaced staid bank investment certificate deposits. most mutual fund alsooffer “banking” service checkwriting privileges. the advent asset securitizationhas allow nonbank mortgage company compete successfully bank homemortgage market, nonbanks also important player explosion newfinancial instrument derivative structure notes.for part, blur traditional line bank andnonbanks seem positive development. new competitive force unleashed,financial innovation accelerated, business household enjoy far greaterrange choice menu financial service decade ago. bank haveresponded vigorously -- i would say successfully, give recent trend profitability -- tothe challenge pose nonbank competitors. to sure, rapid change also posednew risks. it critical environment policymakers stay abreast marketdevelopments ensure bank nonbanks face right incentive assess risksof business decisions, likewise ensure consumer investor bestpossible information available choose among financial service products.thus, i agree basic function bank make credit available, providingsafe investment choice (deposits) households, process payment special, i seelittle gain insist bank always type entity provide suchservices.the case electronic money help illustrate point i try make. itremains see popular form payment become unite states, thequestion whether nonbank institution allow issue electronic money activelybeing debate many countries. some argue issue money special bank function andthat electronic money properly remain exclusively bank product. for time being,however, i along policymakers federal reserve conclude anydecision reserve nascent market smart card form electronic money aprovince bank alone might well stifle competition technological innovation thisarea. thus, would agree provide efficient payment medium small dollartransactions “special” function bank currently perform, follow onlybanks allow perform function.as corollary, i would also say “special” public purpose inconstraining bank compete many market traditionally dominate nonbankfinancial institutions. this subject especially topical unite state becauseour domestic bank restrict business activity engage thanare bank many countries. a know, federal reserve push expandbanks’ ability compete investment house underwrite securities, scope foru.s. bank sell insurance-related product also expand recently.bis review 13/1997 - 4 -the third general aspect bank often deem special linkagebetween bank system monetary policy. of course, topic spawn atruly vast economic literature. without venture thicket, i would simply like note asfact much 1990-1994 period, growth broad u.s. monetary aggregatessuch m2 quite odds historical relationship nominal income growth. perhapsthe important factor underlie development fundamental realignment ofhousehold financial asset away bank deposit favor bond stock mutual fund andother capital

special policyguide, special role bank sector primary vehicle implement monetarypolicy country remain unchallenged. most central bank seek achieve theirobjectives form interest rate management. control short-term interest ratesis achieve every case i aware manipulate supply central bank reservesavailable satisfy banks’ demand reserves. banks’ demand reserve similarlyinfluenced central bank either directly set reserve requirement indirectly byallowing bank access payment system set rule regard themanagement central bank accounts.to conclude, i would like return one question pose outset ofthese remarks: if bank special, imply proper stance governmentvis-à-vis bank industry? a i hope previous comment make clear, regulatory andsupervisory policy must recognize dynamic force play financial sector. suchpolicies must promote exploit competitive process order foster efficient delivery ofservices encourage financial economic stability. these objective likely beachieved regulation arbitrarily identify rigidly segment bank nonbank financialmarkets. rather, goal policymakers establish rule game provideproper incentive financial institution accurately ass manage risk inherent intheir business decisions. likewise, foster report standard information flowsso consumer financial service product well inform possible aboutthe risk return financial service product buy. to maximum extentpossible, market force determine bundle financial service product areprovided bank type financial service providers.as final comment, i would note sound macroeconomic policy one ofthe important way encourage efficient delivery financial service safetyand soundness financial institutions. conversely, policy result significantmacroeconomic imbalance frequently serious adverse implication

subsidiaries.the subsidy inherent safety net would assure result, extend spread safetynet require federal reserve’s authority ability meet responsibility beshifted different paradigm.such result reason enough concern spread safetynet subsidy. but also concern distortion subsidy bring thefinancial system generally. after all, broad premise underlie financialmodernization -- removal legislative regulatory restriction -- free andoften intense competition create efficient customer-oriented business system.this principle prove itself, generation generation, ever higherstandards living.in financial, well other, market principle root anotherpremise -- interaction private competitive force will, rare exceptions, create astable error self-correcting system. this premise seriously call question ifgovernment subsidy supply key balance points. by nature, subsidy distort theestablishment competitive market prices, create incentive misalign private risk withprivate gains. such distortion undermine error self-correcting mechanism supportstrong financial markets.we must careful name free market efficiency notcountenance great power profit subsidize directly indirectly

subsidy inherent safetynet nonbank activities. to maintain level play field competitors, nonbankactivities must finance market, subsidized, rates.the board also belief financial modernization undermine theability authority central bank unite state manage crises, assure efficientand safe payment system, conduct monetary policy. we believe require thefederal reserve retain significant

convergenceand emu speech president deutsche bundesbank, prof. han tietmeyer,delivered boersen executive club copenhagen 14/3/97.ithe boersen executive club ask speak “economicconvergence emu”. i shall please so, especially i well imagine youhere denmark able adopt somewhat relax calm approach subjectof “convergence emu”.there two obvious reason that. firstly, denmark make distinctprogress economic convergence past years. that progress document inthe european monetary institute’s recently publish convergence report.-the danish krone stable internally good number years.-it unlikely denmark problem exchange ratecriterion either. happily, participation erm - germany - hasnever issue here.-and notable progress consolidate public finance.the assessment denmark european monetary institute’s convergencereport therefore decidedly positive germany.the second reason denmark rather relax subjectof “convergence emu” is, course, self-evident. denmark announce that, thetime being, go participate third stage monetary union.naturally, germany respect denmark’s sovereign decision, even atthe bundesbank unreservedly happy decision. that precisely inthe initial phase shall need stable partner emu. but door open. the term ofentry know sides. what happen yet can, course, take place pointin future. it go without saying, however, matter dane todecide. whatever decision denmark ultimately take participate third stage, i hopethat exchange rate stability maintain before.it likely danish krone belong least exchange ratemechanism “ems ii” outset. that would, rate, imply existence closebilateral link danish krone euro. for rest, precisely economicand stability record country wish belong outset represent achallenge commitment euro area. in way, denmark play part, leastindirectly, anti-inflationary orientation euro, even join emu once.naturally enough, setting-up “ems ii” will, time, enhancethe responsibility european central bank. a stable euro essential precondition forthe operation intra-european exchange rate system. i convince europeancentral bank fully aware precisely international responsibility euro theanchor currency.bis review 30/1997 - 2 -there also link danish central bank europeancentral bank:-the governor danmark nationalbank member theenlarged govern council ecb.-and central bank country derogation also invite toparticipate target, plan large-value payment system theeuro.in say that, i would ask understand minimum ofdivergence term participation target. those term take account thediffering commitment central bank inside

anti-inflationary performance, - fall behind- ability remedy worsen competitive position domestic efforts.these general requirement single currency area apply euro quitespecial degree. there three reason this: firstly, supranational euro area - incontrast usual national environment currency - hardly fiscal policymechanisms would able counterbalance regional disequilibria. there adominant central budget. at community level, network comparable aninternal, national system income redistribution. the public financial system socialsecurity remain national domain.secondly, regional

term hard economic data. it also need convergence term ofthinking. that imply convergence objective interpret explain theinteraction economic forces. monetary union abolish exchange rateinstrument domestically. it necessity also call single domestic externalmonetary policy, thus common stance key policy area.for euro area, however, achieve maintain common stance thiskind undoubtedly difficult traditional national currency area. whereasthe currency supranational, generally remain individual government willbe take decision economic social policy. that reason euroneeds dominant pattern preference common participants. that likewiseimplies affirmation major fundamental positions.firstly, maintain value money best contribution monetarypolicy make economic growth employment. price stability foundation whichsociety policy-makers must carry necessary adjustments. secondly, theevent conflict, internal price stability must priority external exchange rate stability.thirdly, experience show central bank independent vagary day-to-day politics, commit solely goal price stability, help safeguard thatindispensable price stability. by way, might even important supranationalunion purely national context.these three basic conviction essential durably stable currency. that iswhy rightly enshrine maastricht treaty.-article 107 lay european central bank’s independence ofinstructions.-the statute european central bank require “to maintain pricestability” primary objective.-and article 109 (1) (2) require eu council pursue externalexchange-rate policy without prejudice objective maintainingprice stability.any call political control european central bank differentobjectives thus firmly reject five year ago, treaty signed.bis review 30/1997 - 4 -but is, course, legal position create maastricht treatywhich argue favour primacy price stability safeguard mean ofindependent monetary policy. past experience economic reason argue favour, too. it isimportant perceive - lastingly perceive - case participatingcountries. otherwise, political conflict might impose heavy burden monetary union alate date.the task preserve durably stable currency is, however, one befaced policy areas, too. it cannot matter monetary policy europeancentral bank alone - particularly since ecb still establish reputation credibilityin first place. however great contribution independent central bank make stablecurrency, monetary policy never conduct political vacuum laboratoryconditions. and, long run, currency’s fate never divorce political andeconomic trend

policy areas. that apply towage rate policy, example. above all, however, apply fiscal policy. it resoluteand last pursuit sound policy crucial importance respect - notany one-off measures.an effective stability pact extremely important, too, reason - astability pact being, incidentally, precisely interest small countries. after all, anyundisciplined behaviour part large partner country substantial economic weightcould severe adverse impact interest rate confidence long-term stability,thus hamper economic growth partners. the pact stability growth agree indublin important reminder

admittedly, notby mean imply euro solve structural problem beset large number ofeuropean country present future. on contrary, pressure adjust derive fromthe single market globalisation will, anything, tend grow strong rather thanweaker.bis review 30/1997 - 5 -incidentally, increase competitive pressure mean imply allcountries pursue economic social policies. under condition obtainingnow future, policy-makers will, fact, different option available tosatisfy preferences. but one precept hold true everyone, whether theylike not. whatever policy country may pursue, economy must viable,

bank industry address governor reserve bank ofnew zealand, dr. donald t. brash, imf conference bank soundness monetarypolicy world global capital market hold washington 30/1/97.my address morning “banking soundness role market”.as already know, subject particular relevance new zealand,given adopt bank supervision approach place considerable emphasison role market promote sound financial system. in speech today i beoutlining key feature new approach bank supervision reason wehave go direction. although much address focus new zealandexperience, i attempt draw general conclusion role market disciplinescan play promote sound efficient financial system - conclusion may haverelevance design bank supervision arrangement countries. before i outlinethe new approach bank supervision new zealand, i think would useful give youa little background supervisory structure operate time reserve bankof new zealand conduct review bank supervision.background new zealand’s bank supervision arrangementsnew zealand first adopt formalise approach bank supervision 1987.for period end 1995 new zealand’s approach bankingsupervision relatively orthodox. it involved:minimum capital requirement (based basle capital accord);limits amount bank could lend individual customer relatedparties;a limit banks’ open foreign exchange positions;off-site monitor banks, use information provide privately reservebank;annual consultation senior management banks; anda range power enable reserve bank respond bank distress orfailure.however, former system bank supervision differ importantrespects approach adopt many countries. in particular, new zealand’ssupervisory framework:did involve license supervision deposit-taking business ofbanking - entity wish use word “bank” name weresubject supervision;did feature deposit insurance;did seek protect depositor per se - instead, seek protect financialsystem whole; andbis review /1997 - 2 -did involve form on-site examination banks.these distinguish feature continue apply new supervisoryframework.in late 1991 commence major review bank supervisionarrangements. the review motivate number concerns.probably main reason commence review concern thatconventional approach bank supervision generally make insufficient use marketdisciplines mean promote sound efficient financial system. we believe thatthere considerable scope use market discipline promote systemic stability. inparticular, wish provide market great capacity hold director andmanagement account sound management bank. and want improve themarket’s ability make well inform decision bank would businesswith. a i note late address, conclude introduction well focus andcomprehensive disclosure regime would go long way towards achieve objectives.another factor lead u review bank supervision arrangement wasa concern compliance cost regulatory distortion associate withconventional approach bank supervision. this concern reflect view bankingsupervisors tend strong incentive promote stable financial system, without alwayshaving appropriate regard compliance cost regulatory distortion whichsupervision prudential regulation give rise.we also concern taxpayer risk involve traditional approachto bank supervision. although risk present regardless form bank supervisiontakes, likely great bank supervisor, bank supervisor,has regular access financial information bank. it also likely great moreintensive supervision process is. we want explore way reduce risk thegovernment call upon rescue bank distress. finally, recognise conventional bank supervision go farin promote sound bank system. there inherent limitation extent whichprudential regulation supervision, even supervision include on-site examinations, canminimise incidence bank distress failure. this evidence fact countrieswith intensive supervisory regime immune serious episode financialdistress. indeed, concern bank supervision could even increase riskof bank failure distress, potentially reduce incentive bank director andmanagers make consider judgement constitute prudent behaviour.the new approach bank supervision new zealandin light concerns, follow lengthy period review, weconcluded concern identify could substantially address placinggreater reliance market discipline public disclosure banks, increase theaccountability bank director management, reduce extent prudentialregulation. the new bank supervision arrangements, come force 1 january1996, reflect conclusions.bis review /1997 - 3 -the new approach differ former regime two main areas. first, newdisclosure regime applicable bank operate new zealand introduced. thedisclosure regime design substantially strengthen market discipline bank andsharpen incentive director management bank manage banks’ affairsin sound responsible manner. i outline main feature disclosurearrangements shortly.the second major change involve reduction extent prudentialregulation banks. the main change included:the removal former limit amount bank may lend theircustomers;the removal limit banks’ open foreign exchange exposures;the removal reserve bank’s guideline internal control theassociated audit requirements; andthe removal need bank privately report financial position andrisk exposure reserve bank.we satisfy introduction new disclosure regime obviate theneed many former prudential control banks.undoubtedly feature new approach attract attention isthe disclosure regime. let briefly outline main features.under new arrangements, bank operate new zealand must publish adisclosure statement quarter. the disclosure statement two forms: brief keyinformation summary, aim ordinary depositor; comprehensivegeneral disclosure statement, aim principally professional analyst.the key information summary contain short summary key information abank, including:the bank’s credit rat (or statement bank credit rating); thebank’s capital ratios, measure use basle framework; information onpeak exposure concentration, peak exposure relate parties, asset quality,shareholder guarantee (if any) profitability.the key information summary must display prominently in, beavailable demand from, every bank branch.the general disclosure statement contain wider-ranging much moredetailed information bank bank group, including:corporate information information parent bank (where applicable);comprehensive financial statement (including five year summary keyfinancial data); credit rat information (including change rat inthe two year precede bank’s recent disclosure statement balance date);detailed information capital adequacy, asset quality various risk exposuresbis review /1997 - 4 -(including exposure concentration relate party exposures); information onfunds management securitisation activities, risk management systems, asummary prudential regulation impose bank question thereserve bank new zealand; information bank’s exposure marketrisk, peak end period (and respect full bank book).the disclosure statement issue bank subject full external audit theend year limit scope audit review half year. disclosure statement issue theother quarter year require audited.one important feature disclosure framework role itaccords bank directors. each director require sign bank’s disclosure statement (orauthorise someone sign behalf) make certain attestation disclosurestatements, including:whether bank comply prudential requirement impose bythe reserve bank; whether bank system place adequately monitorand control bank risk whether system properlyapplied; whether bank’s exposure relate party contrary interestsof bank; whether disclosure statement contain requireddisclosures false misleading.directors face severe criminal civil penalty (including three years’ jailand personal liability creditors’ losses) disclosure statement hold false ormisleading.the disclosure arrangement expect bring number important benefitsto new zealand financial system:we confident disclosure arrangement play important role instrengthening market discipline banks. under new arrangement market hasconsiderably great information bank’s financial performance risk position waspreviously case. and information available frequently timelymanner. the market therefore great scope react development affect bank’sfinancial condition - reward bank well manage penalise whichappear le well managed. the strong bank likely benefit strength byoperating low costs; weak bank likely pressure strengthen theirposition. over long term believe strong market discipline make majorcontribution soundness new zealand’s financial system.another benefit expect see disclosure regime growingemphasis important role bank director play oversee prudent managementof banks. the disclosure framework reinforce provide sharp focus dutiesof bank directors. in particular, sharpen focus directors’ duty ensure bankhas necessary system place identify, monitor manage adequately bank’svarious business risks, ensure system properly apply times.the disclosure requirement also likely increase accountability bankdirectors and, indirectly, accountability various level management within banks.as result disclosure arrangements, would expect see director take great carethan might otherwise case ensure adequately discharge theirbis review /1997 - 5 -obligations. in doing, likely director take step ensure areappropriate accountability mechanism within management hierarchy.over time, expect increase accountability bank director leadto improvement quality bank boards. shareholder face strong incentive toensure director bank appropriate skills, experience, integrity andjudgement fulfil duty expect them.another important benefit hope flow disclosure regime isa reduction risk taxpayer call upon rescue bank. a result thedisclosure arrangement hope strong public perception themanagement director bank sole responsibility management theirbank’s affairs. moreover, public access much information bank asdoes reserve bank, thereby eliminate monopoly information supervisorsgenerally tend respect bank’s financial condition. both factor shouldassist enable future government resist inevitable pressure rescue bank indistress insulate creditor loss - least extent.although new supervisory framework place great emphasis role thatmarket discipline play promote systemic stability, important note thereserve bank new zealand abandon responsibility financial system.we recognise that, time least, systemic stability best serve combinationof market discipline bank supervision. in particular, see value in:retaining control entity may call bank newzealand;the reserve bank maintain sound understand state financialsystem; andthe reserve bank retain capacity respond financial distress bankfailure, threaten financial system stability.in context, number reserve bank’s core function beenretained.the reserve bank continue responsibility register new banks.banks continue subject minimum capital requirement (in line thebasle capital accord) limit lend relate parties. although believe thatdisclosure alone would ensure bank would maintain capital least equivalent 8%minimum, consider retention minimum capital requirement reinforce thecredibility new supervisory framework, additional cost banks.the reserve bank continue monitor bank quarterly basis. however,monitoring conduct principally use banks’ public disclosure statements, contrast tothe former system monitor basis information provide privately reservebank. in respects, banks’ disclosure statement contain information morecomprehensive reliable information previously provide privately thereserve bank.bis review /1997 - 6 -the reserve bank also continue consult senior management banks.formal prudential consultation hold annually, generally focus strategic directionof banks, major change operation high level issues. in addition, asgovernor reserve bank new zealand, i meet chief executive largerbanks regular basis discus broad range issues, include issue relate thebanking industry wide economy.and, importantly, reserve bank retain wide-ranging capacity respond tofinancial distress bank failure bank’s financial condition pose serious threat thestability bank system.as former supervision arrangements, objective underlie aboveresponsibilities promotion sound efficient financial system. depositor protectiondoes feature reserve bank’s objectives.reactions new approach bank supervisionall all, i believe new approach relatively well accepted. but ithas take time acceptance achieved. it fair say that, review process,reservations new approach express number quarters, homeand abroad. i think would useful mention these.one observation make new zealand “free riding” theefforts home supervisors. we firmly reject notion. we believe newsupervisory framework least effective promote prudent bank practice themore traditional approach bank supervision. and satisfy newframework enable reserve bank new zealand fulfil duty host supervisorwithin term basle concordat. in regard, new approach bankingsupervision, reserve bank new zealand remain well inform activity andfinancial condition bank operate new zealand, well place respond toincipient financial distress appropriate. indeed, i already noted, disclosureregime provide reserve bank (and public) information generally morecomprehensive information previously receive reserve bank.but certainly true host supervisor - inevitably - rely someextent global supervision home supervisor. after all, intrinsic part thebasle concordat. the host supervisor realistically achieve promote prudentbanking practice local operation bank within jurisdiction.in context point, commentator suggest thereserve bank new zealand well place anticipate emerge financial distress theabsence conduct on-site examination bank otherwise obtain private informationfrom banks. although i acknowledge on-site examination increase informationavailable bank supervisors, i convince information obtain fromsuch examination enable supervisor reliably anticipate incipient financial distress. inmodern banking, risk position change rapidly. a week politics might longtime, bank long time indeed! this become increasingly case. theinformation obtain on-site examinations, source matter, canonly provide snapshot bank’s risk position particular point time, even thengenerally respect subset bank’s business. for reason i believe suchbis review /1997 - 7 -information limit usefulness assess dynamic bank’s risk position inanticipating financial distress.i acknowledge, course, publicly disclose information also theselimitations. but least public disclosure bring incentive sound managementof bank risks. i sure private disclosure information bankingsupervisor - whether on-site off-site - create type incentives.a concern on-site examination off-site collection ofdetailed private information banks, least new zealand context, risk theseapproaches blur line responsibility management banks. if bankingsupervisor responsibility regular on-site examinations, presumably follow thesupervisor also responsibility encourage require bank modify risk positionsor make adjustment balance sheet supervisor concern relation tothe bank’s risk profile. this potential erode incentive director andmanagement bank take ultimate responsibility management bank risks,effectively pass responsibility bank supervisor. it also potentialto create public perception responsibility manage bank risk effectivelyshared bank’s director bank supervisors. in turn, make verydifficult indeed government eschew responsibility rescue bank difficulty.i acknowledge system bank supervision - even one reliesprincipally public disclosure - inevitably create public expectation supervisoryauthority take responsibility management bank risks. and i acknowledgethat system bank supervision create risk taxpayer event bankgets difficulty. however, order minimise risks, reserve bank newzealand prefer keep spotlight clearly focus director management bank,rather risk blur accountability. we believe avoidance ofhaving on-site examination role otherwise regularly obtain private information frombanks assist regard reinforce market discipline banks.another observation frequently make new zealand would haveadopted new framework substantial part bank system domesticallyowned. it firmly-held conviction would adopt approach even ormost bank locally-owned. i say believe regime isactually likely promote prudent bank behaviour traditionalapproaches, low likelihood moral hazard regulatory distortion. in thiscontext, i note that, time commence review bank supervision, late1991, significant part new zealand bank system still domestically owned.indeed, i see it, many change implement new zealand would equalrelevance jurisdiction core bank system domestically owned.another criticism make new zealand approach comprehensive andfrequent disclosure can, circumstances, exacerbate financial system distress, rather thanpromote systemic stability. i acknowledge that, circumstances, disclosure couldexacerbate bank’s difficulties. for example, bank require disclose loss asevere deterioration asset quality, could lead sharp adverse reaction market,possibly cause bank question come liquidity pressure. of course, thispossibility exist even bare disclosure requirement - release anannual report six monthly interim disclosure. and risk adverse market reaction arepresent even absence disclosure requirement - example, result marketbis review /1997 - 8 -speculation bank’s financial condition. indeed, circumstance disclosure ofcomprehensive information might actually reduce risk market react adversely tomisinformation absence information. in case, bank know advancethat make adverse disclosures, would generally opportunity take stepsto reduce risk adverse market reaction. these step would include disclosure theremedial measure take address bank’s difficulties.of course, risk severe market reaction adverse disclosure create thevery incentive bank ensure manage affair way beno adverse development disclose. in long term, therefore, risk adverse marketreaction could expect promote sound financial system.one criticism often make public disclosure bank vastmajority depositor read banks’ disclosure statements. on assumption, someobservers suggest disclosure limit effectiveness. we agree. it certainlytrue depositor unlikely read disclosure statements. but disclosure regimein new zealand predicate assumption wide readership ordinarydepositor. the source market discipline lie wide public readership. rather, theefficacy disclosure regime rest assumption disclosure statement beread agent depositors, financial news media, financial analyst andinvestment advisers, wholesale creditor fellow bankers. it risk adversereactions type disclosure user create incentive bank director andmanagement manage banks’ affair way avoid need make adversedisclosures.although disclosure regime rely mass readership disclosurestatements depositors, reserve bank new zealand encourage depositor take agreater interest banks’ disclosures. over much last year actively promotedpublicity new disclosure arrangements. and prepare “user’s guide” assistdepositors (and agents) understand disclosure make banks. the user’sguide available every bank branch country. while unlikely “bestseller”, encourage note has, fact, surprise degree interest itfrom public. we hope that, time, increase proportion depositor take akeener interest banks’ financial condition.another observation make new framework approach placesan excessive emphasis role bank director - ask much them. toillustrate point, review process, i visit chief executive onemajor international bank operation new zealand. he come protest strongly atthe requirement bank director would sign disclosure statement every quarterand attest appropriateness risk management systems. when i ask why, said“... bank director understand absolutely nothing banking...”. this comment quite unfairabout many bank directors, course, uncomfortable element truth insome cases. the blame situation almost certainly lies, part, supervision regimewhich assume much responsibility viability banks. we much hopethat regime continue key regulations, base primarily onmarket disclosure director attestations, improve situation.bis review /1997 - 9 -early indication effect disclosure regimealthough far early make conclusive assessment success orotherwise new supervisory approach, encourage sign thedisclosure requirement meet number objectives. i briefly highlight fewof these.we encourage fact financial news medium newzealand take close interest new bank disclosure regime. the quarterly disclosurestatements receive quite detail scrutiny news media, result great andmore focus public exposure banks’ financial result risk positions. we hope thistype medium attention sharpen incentive banks’ director management tomanage banks’ affair prudently.a good example news media’s interest banks’ disclosure statement wasthe media’s interest one bank’s disclosure non-compliance reserve bankprudential requirement. we surprise intensity media’s interest thisdisclosure - as, i suspect, management director bank question. hopefully,this type medium attention, attendant adverse publicity inevitably give rise,will encourage bank ensure comply reserve bank requirement future. iam incline think threat adverse publicity likely effective disciplineon bank many standard supervisory sanction breach regulatoryrequirements.interestingly, disclosure regime seem strengthen extent whichbanks scrutinise other’s financial performance risk positions. we aware banksare make considerable use disclosure statement monitor other. the additionaland frequent information available could expect assist bank managingtheir inter-bank exposure position assess extent nature business theyconduct other. we believe bank industry one potentsources market discipline individual banks.anecdotal feedback suggest obligation place bank director arecausing director bank exercise great scrutiny banks’ risk positions. inturn, seem focus great attention system place identifyingand manage risks. moreover, seem bank take step increase theaccountability various level management within banks. we also aware somebanks engage external consultant review aspect risk management systems. itseems part motivation conduct review lie disclosure requirements- particularly director attestation adequacy bank’s risk management systems.these please developments. we hope auger well successof new arrangements. i confident will. but illusion newarrangements provide guarantee financial system stability. of course not. no systemof bank supervision that. the entitle believe disclosureregime significantly reduce likelihood financial system instability future - atlower regulatory, compliance taxpayer cost supervisory option might beexpected achieve.bis review /1997 - 10 -general observation incorporate market discipline bank supervisionbefore i conclude address, i probably make comment theextent market discipline could good incorporate supervisory frameworksin countries.i first make clear reserve bank new zealand notpromoting new zealand supervisory model ideal model country adopt.we make claims. the model adopt meet particular needs, mightnot necessarily suitable countries. clearly, country need make ownjudgement type supervisory framework best suit unique requirements.that judgement inevitably depend many considerations, including:the objective bank supervision expect meet, whether thoseobjectives include depositor protection;the existence otherwise deposit insurance arrangements;the structure bank system; andthe infrastructure within bank operates, bank law andaccounting standards.having say this, i believe market discipline play substantial role inmost financial systems. in particular, i think policy maker many country could usefullygive careful think merit introduce comprehensive well focus disclosurerequirements banks. similarly, i believe would much gain adoption ofpolicies design strengthen responsibility bank directors, ultimateresponsibility management bank risk lie squarely boardroom, rather thanbeing awkwardly balance bank supervisor bank director.but fair say effectiveness market discipline much dependon structure regulatory arrangement place nature infrastructurewithin bank system operates. in particular, follow factor would seem toplay important role determine effectiveness use disclosure mechanism forpromoting systemic stability.market discipline likely effective government notinsulate depositor loss - whether explicitly form deposit insurance throughimplicit depositor protection. understandably, depositor creditor le likely totake interest bank’s financial condition know, good cause surmise,that insulate loss bank get difficulty. in circumstances,banks perform poorly le likely face adverse market reaction anenvironment creditor operate expectation likely lose money inthe event bank failure. in part, why, new zealand, eschew depositinsurance depositor protection, seek make clear depositors, among others,that expect government insulate loss event bankfailure.it also fair say market discipline likely effective wherethe supervisory requirement apply bank keep minimum. i say two reasons.bis review /1997 - 11 -first, great supervisory requirements, likely market perceivethat government underwrite individual banks. and second, great supervisoryrequirements, le likely bank director management view ashaving ultimate responsibility management banks.the effectiveness market discipline also depend structure thefinancial system. in particular, seem likely market discipline would effectivewhere bank domestically own - is, bank stand behind it. where abank own another bank, market would naturally regard financialcondition parent bank assess react disclosure make localbank. market discipline might therefore somewhat subdue financial systemcharacterised foreign ownership one dominate locally own banks. have saidthis, i fully satisfy even financial system largely foreign owned, asin new zealand financial system, considerable scope use market disciplinesto promote improve risk management subsidiary branch foreign banks.indeed, possible new zealand’s disclosure regime might well add theincentives overseas parent bank vigilantly supervise new zealand operationsand give great attention financial condition.the extent government ownership bank system also likely toinfluence effectiveness market disciplines. i think would agree market isle likely impose meaningful discipline bank state own would thecase privately own bank - assuming, course, market faith financialsoundness political stability government question. however, even bank isstate owned, robust disclosure regime might well strengthen accountability directorsand management bank, lead improve risk management within bank.it come surprise i believe market discipline morelikely effective bank require make comprehensive disclosure frequentand timely basis. the disclosure requirement focus key aspect bank’sfinancial performance risk profile, make sufficient frequency andtimeliness provide market meaningful basis assess bank’s financialcondition compare one bank another. disclosure likely meaningful andeffective support robust account standard force law. certainly,in case new zealand, find disclosure regime assist greatlyby introduction legally bind rigorously draft account standards.moreover, disclosure requirement ideally couple appropriate legalframework govern bank director - framework design focus directors’ attention ontheir duty manage affair bank sound manner, hold accountfor breach duties.however, say, time place everything. and withdisclosure. i think would agree would helpful introduce new disclosurerequirements time bank system fragile state. do could wellexacerbate situation. that why, new zealand, introduce disclosure regime atime financial system strong position therefore disclosure wouldassist maintain confidence bank system, rather detract it.finally, effectiveness market discipline public disclosure willobviously influence infrastructure within bank operates. by“infrastructure”, i refer matter as: nature adequacy corporate law; thebis review /1997 - 12 -adequacy account standard audit requirements; sophistication integrity ofthe account profession; adequacy financial news medium financialprofessionals.all else equal, well develop infrastructure, likely itis market discipline effective. this suggest that, case developingcountries, perhaps infrastructure well developed, scope use disclosureto promote market discipline somewhat limit would otherwise case. buteven cases, i would dismiss potential merit develop relatively simpledisclosure requirements, draw international account audit standard asappropriate, mean promote rudimentary market disciplines.conclusionlet conclude reiterate view market discipline play apowerful role promote systemic stability, conjunction degree bankingsupervision. i think considerable scope policy maker give think howmarket discipline could good use reinforce effort bank supervisor thequest systemic stability. however, give think matter, may well necessaryfor policy maker re-assess fundamental aspect conventional approach tobanking supervision relationship promotion market disciplines. these includesuch issue depositor protection, deposit insurance, extent prudential regulation ofbanks, intensity bank supervision conducted. these substantialissues course, i little doubt continue international debate towhere appropriate balance lie. i much hope approach newzealand adopt assist promote international debate supervisory options.bis review /1997 summary article entitle risk

harm economyand society claim helping?this bring second group critics, concern changingfrom 0 2 percent 0 3 percent betray intention reserve bank act,requiring monetary policy focus exclusively deliver ‘stability general level ofprices’.there quite intense debate go moment around world among centralbankers academic economist best specification low inflation target shouldbe. there two broad schools.the first school accept monetary policy focus deliveringpredictably low inflation argue several reason target best express inflation ina range 1 3 percent. the best know advocate ‘low positive inflation’ school probablystanley fischer, formerly mit senior deputy manage director internationalmonetary fund. he visit new zealand next month, likely view receiveappropriately wide medium coverage time. he argue ‘low positive’ inflation target forvarious reasons, three particularly important: the way inflation measuredresults quite significant over-statement actual inflation. estimate over-statement theunited state suggest that, country, ‘bias’ measurement inflation isbetween 0.7 2.0 percent, bias 1.1 percent recently estimate group chair bymichael boskin behalf unite state senate finance committee. for reason, centralbanks target measure inflation least 1 percent, target anything low thatwould target de facto deflation.because stage cycle economy go may benecessary interest maintain high level employment reduction ininflation-adjusted (or real) wages, low positive level inflation desirable thanhaving absolutely inflation. this because, inflation, real wage slightlyreduced simply give increase nominal wages, whereas inflation reduce realwages involve actually reduce nominal wages. real wage still reduced, even withno inflation, expense high unemployment.similarly, argue stage economic cycle may desirable forinflation-adjusted interest rate fall zero provide strong stimulus demand and, since itbis review 23/1997 - 3 -is generally practical nominal interest rate fall zero, helpful inflation somelow positive number make negative real interest rate possible.the second school think argue low inflation target, often characterisedby 0 2 percent sometimes express level average price remain stable time.those favour view discount argument advance ‘low positive’ school. theyacknowledge upward bias way inflation measured, argue inmost country outside unite state bias almost certainly le 1 percent certainlycould justify target mid-point 2 percent. (the new zealand government statistician isstrongly convince le bias measurement new zealand cpi inthe measurement u cpi.) they acknowledge easy adjust nominalwages downwards recent years, argue substantial part result persistentlyhigh inflation country experience recent decades, thana transitional problem. moreover, even though may difficult reduce wage individualemployee, prevent significant reduction unit labour cost result ofunchanged wage positive productivity, natural turnover labour force. critic the‘low positive’ school challenge assertion monetary policy occasionally need reduce realinterest rate zero, note way monetary policy stimulate demand,particularly open economy movement exchange rate play important role ininfluencing aggregate demand short term.those favour low inflation (0 2 percent) argue noadvantages tolerate ‘low positive’ rate inflation also significant disadvantage ofeven quite low rate inflation. thus example martin feldstein harvard university (andcurrent president national bureau economic research us) argue strongly evenvery low level inflation significantly exacerbate bias tax system encourageconsumption, discourage saving, encourage excessive investment residential property. in arecent paper argue reduce measure inflation 3 percent 1 percent unitedstates would result permanent increase level u gdp 1 percent, large gain ineconomic well-being even temporary loss output require reduce inflation tothat level. others also argue interaction inflation one hand tax andfinancial report system gear historical cost account create significant biasagainst capital-intensive investment project investment long pay-back period, abias favour highly-geared company investment short pay-back period.this debate mean concluded. at major conference i attend last augustin unite states, seem majority express opinion favour 0to 2 percent target, clear predilection. but give veryexperienced central banker monetary economist schools, stage quiteinappropriate dogmatic, view target involve utmost keepmeasured inflation 0 3 percent certainly consistent intention legislationwithin monetary policy operated.indeed, irrespective mid-point target range be, maybe advantage slightly wide inflation target original 0 2 percent target. anumber observer suggest target width 2 percentage point require anexcessive degree activism part central bank, slightly wide band, whateverits mid-point, would sensible. this argued, example, david turner, oecdeconomist. the tension between, one hand, choose target range effectivelyanchors inflation expectation low level narrow provoke excessive policyactivism risk loss credibility frequently exceeded; other, target rangewhich le effective job anchor inflation expectations, require le policybis review 23/1997 - 4 -activism protect credibility rarely breached. a 0 3 percent range seem reasonablecompromise.but whether benefit wide target band depend significantlyon wide band, high ‘ceiling’, affect public’s expectation future inflation. ifpeople understand new target mean bank, government instructions, nowwilling accept 1 percent inflation previously, nothing positive beenachieved - indeed almost certainly net cost involve change. this isbecause increase inflationary expectation would tend fee slightly high pricingdecisions, slightly high wage settlements, slightly great eagerness borrow, slightly lessenthusiasm saving. if bank will accept behaviour, ‘accommodate’ thejargon, would end somewhat high inflation result (though course thehigher inflation would negative consequence real economy refer earlier). ifthe bank fact prepare accommodate increase inflationary expectation - whichit would i hasten emphasise - end result increase inflationary expectationswould simply high real interest rates, somewhat low economic growth, somewhat higherunemployment. if end result, widen inflation target would provideno benefit would positively damaging.so i think crucially important nobody misunderstand reserve bankis doing. let absolutely clear. the reserve bank go soft inflation. we betargeting inflation rate 3 percent, even inflation rate close 3 percent. the reserve bankwill strive keep inflation well inside 0 3 percent range, best try tohave inflation close middle part range possible.that mean, course, always hit target, wealways hit 0 2 percent. but mean constantly implement monetary policywith intention inflation define around middle part target. if this, thenumber occasion miss target minimised. indeed, give wide targetrange, few breach past.inflation growth expectationsand lead naturally second major theme address today, newzealanders’ expectation inflation growth. it contention expectation bothneed become lot realistic.first, let’s look expectation inflation. yes, encourage signsthat new zealanders’ expectation future inflation fall substantially last decade asactual inflation fallen. survey inflation expectation currently suggest that, average,householders expect year-ahead inflation around 3.9 percent, well level ofthe late 1980s (year-ahead inflation expectation 12.5 percent average towards end of1987, still 8.3 percent near end 1989), 10 year bond yield slightly lowerthan 10 year bond yield australia le 1 percent high 10 year yield us.wage settlement recent year also one area inflation expectation seem tohave subdued, great many wage settlement conclude level have, untilrecently least, put little upward pressure prices.however, indication nearly encourage suggest newzealanders’ inflation expectation still show effect two decade high inflation weendured 1970s 1980s.bis review 23/1997 - 5 -look new zealanders’ save behaviour example. among financialassets, many lock high real interest rate purport see invest inlong-term fix interest instruments, term bank deposit government bonds? the shortanswer ‘very few’. to sure, bond yield comparable international bond yields,and i use deduce new monetary policy framework produce profoundreduction inflationary expectations. i believe i unjustifiably optimistic, isforeign saver buy bond huge volumes, thereby reduce bond yield tointernational levels. more half new zealand government bond issue heldoverseas, proportion longer-dated bond hold overseas even higher. (inrecent months, example, 70 percent longest-dated nominal bond hold themarket hold overseas investors.) if look term structure new zealand-sourced deposit major bank, see overwhelmingly new zealander holdingtheir cash fix interest investment short term, great bulk maturity le than12 months. indeed, bank close 90 percent total deposit mature within sixmonths, 5 percent deposit mature beyond 12 months. by andlarge, new zealander invest save long-term fix interest security all,despite are, face it, attractive inflation-adjusted interest rates.what savings? though data save behaviour newzealand good, anecdotal evidence strongly suggest new zealander invest anyavailable save form equity investment, typically property: big house live in,another house rent out, big farm, another piece farmland, perhaps block flats, abeach-side section, industrial property, commercial building, perhaps forest block, anythingwhich, best-selling book advertisement constantly tell us, protect u inflation.protect u inflation? but we’ve hardly inflation last six year and, despite thebiggest change new zealand’s constitutional arrangement century, newcoalition government re-affirm strong commitment price stability. true, we’ve certainlyhad two decade high inflation memory adult new zealander know ofpeople lose life’s save period ‘making mistake’ invest in‘secure’ fixed-interest investments.i’ve tell true story uncle many time i almost embarrass tellit again, view contain explanation much current approach save newzealand, i tell again. after life-time orcharding nelson area, sell orchardin 1971 invest sale proceed ‘safely’ provide income security retirement. tobe absolutely safe, invest entire proceed 18-year government stock, then-interestrate 5.4 percent. perhaps fortunately, live bond mature 1989, hehad do $30,000 receive sell orchard 1971 mature 1989 wouldhave buy time one toyota corolla car (with little change). in 1971, $30,000would buy 11 toyota corollas. in space 18 years, lose 90 percentof retirement nest egg, make mistake assume inflation would stay therelatively low level 1971.as i say, adult new zealander know story similar one. or knowstories tell message another way. story people buy property withborrowed money early 1970s watch price house increase perhaps eight- ten-fold next 20 years, value equity actually invest house (after allowingfor money borrow help finance purchase) increase perhaps 30 times. perhaps havehad experience like ourselves. even not, assail book andadvertisements side assure u property investment best way ‘protectingyou inflation’, say nothing make effective use tax system. even weare familiar detail statistics, know recent year residential propertyprices rise hugely much country, obviously auckland. accord reinzbis review 23/1997 -

business private individual - long takeaccount prospective change general price level economic decision-making. it isclear still little way go.what new zealanders’ expectation economic growth? be quiteunrealistic? i believe are, least base current policy attitudes.in early 1990s, new zealand achieve real economic growth 5percent per annum two year succession. we tell grow fast anyother oecd economy, growth rate comparable achieve east asian ‘tiger’economies. we begin believe that, result economic reform last decade, toowere capable 5 6 percent growth indefinitely u want believe that. sadly, cannot, least evidence yet can. the fast growth 1993 1994 theresult part one-off productivity gain result micro-economic reform late1980s early 1990s, great part economy available large number ofunemployed underemployed people, unutilised industrial capacity, result recessionof 1991 early 1992. a people capacity bring back productive work,the rate growth real output jump well sustainable rate. the rate unemploymentfell sharply almost 11 percent 6 percent little three year and,while everybody hope unemployment fall further, clearly impossible reduce rate ofunemployment 5 percentage point every three year indefinitely.as i tell member auckland chamber last year, economic growth dependsprimarily monetary policy real factor -

debt rat bank subsidiary bank hold companies,which virtually always high parent hold companies. moreover,existing law regulation section 23a 23b federal reserve act require thatany credit extend bank

consider whether, extent, bank keep distinctivecharacteristics, extent financial institution develop similarcharacteristics bank long special sense.to extent bank changed?it certainly true, i note earlier, bank engage range financialactivities besides i describe distinctively bank activities. major bankseverywhere increasingly diversify product service offer, build upinvestment bank business trade activities, extend life insurance, on,sometimes single balance sheet sometimes separate non-banking entities. in thepresent context, however, question whether development fundamentallyaltered characteristic bank part balance sheets. it seem theanswer, generally speaking, not.on liability side, may (indeed countries,where close substitute money, money-market mutual fund take off, therecertainly been) erosion banks’ market share repository liquid assetholdings, erosion generally gradual. in uk, example, bank (andbuilding society) deposit still account 42% personal sector liquid asset hold against50% decade ago; proportion would much high liquid asset include onlythose capital certain. and vast bulk banks’ liability remain form ofunsecured, short-term, deposits. despite rapid development (secured) repo markets, onlysome 3% major uk banks’ fund (in sterling foreign currency together) wassecured (from information provide last autumn) repo; figure ukbanks, include business conduct branch subsidiary overseas banks, whichhave le direct access deposits, around 8½%. the proportion secure fund isbelow 5% major internationally active bank look at, exceptionof jp morgan banker trust - somewhat special case - proportion verybis review 13/1997 - 4 -much high (25-35%). and even special case still well majorus security firm (typically 55-80%).banks remain, too, heart payment systems. payment may madedirectly across bank account instructions, example, form cheque debitcard; may make indirectly, through, example, use credit cards, balanceson subsequently settle use bank account. even disintermediation createsnew cheque facilities, example, case money-market mutuals, stillcleared settlement banks. it true new form money transmission - e-money -are developed, sometimes outside conventional bank system. but i suspect thatthey, too, typically depend upon clear bank system. to extent thatthey come involve creation effectively direct deposits, representbanking different form become special, logically subject regulation, much thesame way conventional bank deposits. in payment system context, too, importantprogress make reduce inter-bank exposure (through introduction real timegross settlement system many countries, example, net foreignexchange settlements) exposures, well inter-bank exposure incur directinter-bank transaction - large bulk unsecured - remain extraordinarilylarge. individual inter-bank limit substantially exceed 25% capital (the normalsupervisory limit large exposures), example aggregate inter-bank exposure themajor uk retail bank currently place £115 billion, 16% total assets, eachother uk banks.turning asset side, evidence gradual erosion roleof bank financial intermediation. one measure uk decline banks’ (andbuilding societies’) share asset whole financial sector (including security firms,collective investment vehicles, life assurance pension funds’ investment etc) hasfallen fairly steadily past 10 years, close 70% 55%. i believe inthe us, financial innovation probably even greater, comparable figure alsoshow decline, around 45% mid-1970s one third now.in uk, bank lend corporate sector fallen, erratically, some27% total corporate borrow outstanding (including form debt well equityissuance) 1985 le 17%. this mainly reflect increase access large corporateborrowers domestic international capital market short longer-term corporatepaper, often good credit rat banks. small corporates, otherhand, remain heavily dependent upon bank finance - well half overall needs.meanwhile banks’ share net external finance personal sector change muchat past decade, around 80%.trends liquidity bank asset difficult ass liquidity itselfis hard judge simply balance sheet categories. the advent securitisation thedirect sale loan ought helped. but except us, securitisation fact farmade limit progress, debt sale focus mainly impair developingcountry corporate debt. one reason prime corporate loan far trade theimportance bank borrower still attach mutual relationships. my guess isthat liquidity bank asset mean gradually increase; process may behelped development technique credit derivatives. but time - andindeed time come - bank loan are, part, likely remain illiquid mostcountries.bis review 13/1997 - 5 -we nevertheless look crude balance sheet data, and, areworth, look share loan non-banks total asset measure theliquidity asset portfolio range different type institution. these data show that:-for representative small, domestic, uk bank loan ratio stillsome 70-80% total, apparently particular

fundamentally relevant key function theimportance function economy; alter fundamentally thedistinctive characteristic either banks’ liability assets.to extent financial institution become like banks?so, then, extent financial institution develop similarcharacteristics distinctive characteristic bank i describe them?the question, let quite clear, whether financial institutionsperform economically socially important function - clearly - function mayequally special distinctive ways.it also obviously true that, upsurge financial innovation andglobalisation see past 10-20 years, substantial blur theboundaries different type financial institution increase emergence ofmultifunctional, multinational, financial groups, non-bank institution take overbanks offer bank service bank enter substantially non-bankingfinancial activities. but issue either. the question whether distinctionbetween bank non-banking financial function eroded, whether thosefunctions carry separate entity balance sheet. i think has.take, example, long-term save institution - life insurance company andpension funds. they clearly perform vital economic social function, subjectto separate functional regulation special importance home long-termsavings personal sector provider long-term capital. but liability aretotally unlike liquid liability banks, liquidity asset liabilitiesare much closely match - indeed marketable asset tend liquid theirliabilities. the distinction remain even activity carry bankingbis review 13/1997 - 6 -group, though case different business conduct ring-fenced balancesheets subject different prudential tests, reflect quite different nature thecontracts different risk involved. that deny may well risksrunning one part group another - example reputational risk operationalrisks arise share system personnel on. it deny either canbe large cross-functional financial exposures. that, course, respective supervisorsneed take interest part financial group intra-group exposures. but noneof this, seem me, mean long-term save institution take distinctivespecial characteristic banks.so far, i would hope, good sense perhaps would agreethat particular distinction remains. but i choose extreme example auntsally?well perhaps degree i have. so let take le obvious cases.what money-market mutual funds, example? surely least havesome characteristic banks? they, too, act repository liquidity ispossible make payment them, look like bank arrangement?and does. but fact i think appearance deceptive, three reasons:- first, investment money market mutuals not, i understand it, inprinciple capital certain (though practice may support fund’s sponsor); norare cover deposit insurance (though may always understand theinvestor);- secondly, i mention earlier, money-market mutuals atthe heart payment mechanism, effect piggy-back bank are;- and, thirdly, money market mutuals undertake maturity transformation bymaking illiquid loans; like collective

may deceive. the liability housesare fact bite like bank deposits. while true house increase extentof unsecured funding, example public issues, bulk liquid liabilitiesare still secure - with, i said, 55-80% total fund u house havelooked typically form repos. nor house hold take depositsbis review 13/1997 - 7 -from public large. nor, finally, liability directly usable payment medium.in respect houses’ liability non-monetary - even rapidly turnedinto money.on asset side balance sheet, security house continue investprimarily liquid, marketable asset readily sold. this partly reflection thenature investment bank business, particular trading, underwrite on, ofregulatory requirements, also fund uncertainty: security house protect bybeing able, necessary, contract size balance sheet

necessary themoment selection member economies. it also necessary afterwards couldcall permanent regime euro. and stability growth pact essence. itcalls country remain sound position regard fiscal

introductioni greatly honor invite today address distinguish audience. iwould like take opportunity first discus recent monetary economic condition japan andissues regard financial system. i would like discus bank japan’s view financialmarket reform japan, subject heat discussion since prime minister hashimoto propose the“big bang” deregulation package japan november 11, 1996. the financial market constitute infrastructure support nation’s economy, andthus efficient stable function essential promotion unhindered economic growth inthe long term. accordingly, market reform become urgent issue japan, financial marketsseem lose international competitiveness. however, various argument hear paceand potential side effect reform. bear argument mind, i wish return thebasics market reform discus reform currently need japan approach betaken promote reform.ii. recent monetary economic condition japana. the strength economic recovery i would like start examine strength self-sustained economic recoveryover past several years. accord economic plan agency, current economic recovery begin inoctober 1993, continue three half years. the recovery, however, beenconstant, therefore, many people may able appreciate true strength therecovery.in fact, growth rate economy remain low around 1 percent even after1993, concern occurrence deflationary spiral one time 1995. thisextremely slow pace economic recovery due fact japanese economy toovercome various structural adjustment pressure - is, pressure reduce burden create thebursting economic “bubble” pressure adapt new global economic environment. since 1996, however, recovery real economic activity finally become evident. look gdp growth 1996, contribution fiscal expenditures, beenlarge begin year, gradually decreased. at time, pace decline netexports (exports excess imports) slowed, domestic private demand, business fixedinvestment personal consumption, show steady growth. owe mostly increase domesticprivate demand, gdp fourth quarter 1996 grow 2.9 percent period theprevious year, despite negative contribution public works. the key realization self-sustained economic recovery sustainability ofrecovery domestic private demand. in respect, concern recovery inbusiness fix investment might due large part temporary increase investment thetelecommunications industry. equally, concern growth house investment andpersonal consumption might cause mainly boost demand ahead rise theconsumption tax rate fiscal 1997. bi review 61/1997 - 2 -these issue must examine various point view judge economicoutlook current fiscal year. i would, however, like emphasize virtuous circle ofdemand, production, income gradually come operation latter half 1996. during first half 1996, increase demand bring significantimprovement production, increase offset growth import inventory adjustment. inthe latter half year, however, decline external demand halt due depreciation theyen, and, addition, inventory adjustment progressed. a result, increase final demand wasreflected fully production growth. in fact, year-to-year growth rate production improve fromless 1 percent first half 1996 4.4 percent latter half 1996, level consistent withthe growth demand. the increase production appear lead recovery business fixedinvestment employment latter half 1996, increase corporate profits. this virtuouscircle demand, production, income brighten prospect sustain recovery domesticprivate demand.the strength recovery, however, different economic sector. accord theresults march 1997 “tankan - short-term economic survey enterprise japan,” whileincreased corporate profit stimulate increase business fix investment, tothe extent lead increase consumption improve employment wage conditions. inaddition, business fix investment large firm continue increase, recovery level ofinvestment small firm yet gain strength.while several factor remain uncertain, bank japan judge economicrecovery gradually firm since autumn 1996, basis development theeconomic growth rate determine factors, strengthen virtuous circle.b. future economic price developments, monetary policy management the bank pay close attention whether self-sustained recovery privatedemand fiscal 1996 strengthen, lead firm recovery economy despite thedownward pressure fiscal tightening. the development financial market indicate considerable concern part ofmarket participant firmness economic recovery. long-term interest rate continue todecline autumn 1996 recently historic low 2.1 2.2 percent. stock price fellsharply begin year significant improvement thereafter. the result march1997 tankan also indicate firm confident business outlook term ofexpected sale profits, little expectation improvement business condition thesecond quarter.the low level confidence economic outlook may attribute variety ofcauses. the renew concern nonperforming-loan problem financial institution itseffects economy may one factor. with regard economic development short-term,however, significant factor likely concern downward pressure fiscaltightening. the bank yet detect clear sign downward pressures, intendsto continue examine possible effect fiscal tightening. there appear be, however, several goodreasons pessimistic.regarding fiscal tightening, public work cut drastically new fiscalyear, rather, already reduce gradually latter half 1996. despite decline inpublic works, domestic private demand continue expand, support part improvementin external demand. bi review 61/1997 - 3 -with regard rise consumption tax rate, may two different type ofimpact: (1) short term, rise may induce increase demand ahead implementation anda subsequent reaction rate change; (2) long term, may fundamentally affectconsumer behavior. a short-term influence, may make certain contribution recentimprovement economic indicator increase automobile sale department store sales. fromapril, therefore, likely reaction increase. from viewpoint ofachieving self-sustained economic recovery, however, matter increase theconsumption tax rate fundamentally change consumer behavior decline purchasingpower households. the degree change depend largely consumer confidence wageconditions. in respect, recent improvement employment wage conditions, though modest,is encouraging.nevertheless, temporary slowdown economic recovery likely various effectsof fiscal tighten see strongly summer. the bank, however, also ofthe view current trend recovery likely maintain owe recent strengthen ofthe virtuous circle economy. in respect, bank continue monitor closely economicdevelopments, especially consumer behavior. turn recent price developments, become increasingly clear price havestopped decline since end 1996, follow improvement domestic supply demandconditions rise import prices. while decline crude oil price make unlikely importprices rise further, put additional upward pressure domestic prices, bank continue tomonitor price development closely, include effect depreciation yen. if i mention one point recent foreign exchange developments, thatthe bank’s think base group seven agreement exchange rate reflecteconomic fundamental excess volatility undesirable. while refrain comment onspecific exchange rate levels, bank continue carefully watch foreign exchange ratedevelopments, recently show rather rapid movements. return subject prices, raise consumption tax rate april bereflected product prices, push price index accordingly. it would appropriate toformulate monetary policy one-time, superficial price adjustment. the issue concern iswhether rise tax rate trigger price hike take advantage rise lead toinflationary expectations, turn might bring price rise beyond immediate effect thetax rate increase. the bank also continue monitor price development carefully thisviewpoint, particular attention give underlie domestic supply demand condition andconsumer confidence. in management current monetary policy, bank japan continue tomonitor economic development closely, place emphasis strengthen foundation foreconomic recovery.iii. issue regard financial system i would like move issue regard financial system. from endof fiscal 1996 begin fiscal 1997, number bank announce intention front-loadtheir schedule write nonperforming loan revise business result fiscal 1996downward accordingly. on april 1, nippon credit bank announce comprehensive restructuringpackage, hokkaido takushoku bank hokkaido bank announce plan merge pursuit ofmore efficient management. these development indicate determination japanese financialinstitutions adapt far-reaching reform japan’s financial system, i discus later,while continue strive promptly resolve nonperforming loans. bi review 61/1997 - 4 -i would therefore like discus implication decision nippon creditbank hokkaido takushoku bank may japan’s financial system whole thenonperforming-loan problem system burdened. let first explain circumstance lead bank take drastic actions.in recent years, significant progress make disposal nonperforming loan majorfinancial institution include city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks. a result activeprovisioning write-offs, fact, bank already clear prospect complete disposalwithin year two. nippon credit bank hokkaido takushoku bank, however, tend fall behindothers due large amount nonperforming loan hold relative financial strength.needless say, believe bank could dispose nonperforming loan anextended period time. however, financial market undergo drastic change, financialinstitutions require time solve nonperforming loan problem unavoidably placedunder serious constraint try survive reform. with mind, domestic overseasmarket participant begin scrutinize financial condition japanese financial institutionswith increase severity since begin year. in context, two bank urge setforth restructure plan comprehensive enough remove source uncertainty themarket. nippon credit bank announce plan include thorough restructuring,comprehensive disposal nonperforming loans, reinforcement capital base. private financialinstitutions direct capital business interest nippon credit bank ask toparticipate capital subscription bank. the capital cannot obtain privatefinancial institution supplement new financial stabilization fund theunderwriting prefer shares. this carry use outstanding amount beencontributed fund bank japan. in respect, restructure plan nippon creditbank involve public support. we bank believe nippon credit bank mean insolvent,and fully capable reconstruct financial position. we time determinedthat entire financial system might adversely influence implementation thecomprehensive measure solve financial problem nippon credit bank delayed, shouldmarket confidence bank maintain restored. base judgment light theobjective fund - “enhance stability global confidence country’sfinancial system” - bank deem appropriate utilize new financial stabilization fund toreinforce capital base nippon credit bank. meanwhile, hokkaido takushoku bank announce plan merge hokkaido bank,also base hokkaido region, view become so-called super-regional bank stablecustomer base hokkaido region operation geographically large area rest ofjapan. a part plan merger, announce management strategy strengthen financialbase, improve customer services, thus contribute invigorate regional economy. although case nippon credit bank hokkaido takushoku bank different,one involve public support commercial solution, approach take two banksin cop problem point common. first, bank implement far-reaching restructure measure term theiroperation, personnel, branches, unprecedented major japanese banks. the plansadopted two bank would comparable drastic restructure measure adopt u.s.commercial bank latter half 1980s early 1990s solve managementproblems. second, bank plan withdraw overseas operations. nippon credit banksubsequently announce agreement business collaboration banker trust unite states.bis review 61/1997 - 5 -we bank strongly encourage initiative indicate significant shift fromthe conventional strategy pursue date major japanese banks, contribute significantly tothe smooth implementation two banks’ restructure packages. the common aspect two case illustrate determination japanese financialinstitutions renovate order adapt positively change financial environment. asi shall discus later, japanese financial system undergo drastic change preparation the21st century. these two case reflect fact management seriously reconsider theirstrategies, free traditional way thinking, identify area ofcomparative advantage improve customer services.the measure take two bank represent significant step toward resolution ofnonperforming loans. the disposal nonperforming loan nippon credit bank reach levelcomparable major banks. in addition, hokkaido takushoku bank hokkaido bank beable complete disposal nonperforming loan much fast would separately,for merger greatly enhance efficiency measure reorganization consolidationof branch network elimination redundant investment.the decision two bank thus expect contribute significantly removinguncertainties from, ensure domestic international confidence japanese financial system.at time, bank belief propose measure great significance sense thatthey represent voluntary action take financial institution preparation fundamental reformof japanese financial system.iv. financial market reforma. the necessity market reform i would like move theme speech, financial market reform injapan. specific measure big bang deregulation package japan currently deliberationin relevant councils. i would therefore like discus fundamental point issue, aswhy reform financial market financial system currently needed, approach tobe take promote reform. today, financial innovation progress around world, new financialinstruments transaction develop one another. at time, however, thejapanese financial market seem lose international competitiveness. this main reason themarkets need reformed. failure heighten competitiveness would result hollow ofthe japanese financial markets, eventually threaten sound development japanese economy. since 1980s, japan gradually deregulate financial sector. interest rate ondeposits liberalized, bank security company permit enter eachother’s field business subsidiaries. during period, however, tokyo market fallenfar behind new york london market ability develop diverse financial instrument andservices. this partly japanese financial institution divert much energy thedisposal nonperforming loans, burden create burst economic “bubble.” it alsoattributable conventional framework japanese financial market financial system,which leave unchanged despite rapidly change financial environment, make difficult todevelop introduce new financial instrument services. globally, conspicuous change financial market recent year beenthe rapid progress financial innovations, reflect development computer communicationstechnology. new financial instrument derivative securitization make possible tounbundle risk - namely, credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk - conventionalbis review 61/1997 - 6 -financial instrument loan bonds, trade risk individually variouscombinations risks. the risk trade new financial instrument different thoseoriginally incorporate conventional financial products. however, range service thatfinancial institution provide expand significantly become possible trade therisks without pay deliver underlie asset.conventional financial services, example, focus flow funds, is,investment financing, firm households. in comparison, recent financial service place greateremphasis analyze overall risk asset liability firm hedge risk takenew risks. the service thus elaborately tailor specific financial condition individualcustomers. in words, become possible firm household manage portfoliosefficiently flexibly utilize custom-made service base advice financialinstitutions. the word derivative securitization may sound irrelevant households, havein fact increase opportunity household efficiently manage asset liabilities, byexpanding range asset pension trust investment trust invest indirectlythrough institutional investors, increase range instrument access directlyby households. along progress financial innovations, advance computer andcommunications technology promote financial globalization. today, firm institutionalinvestors around world transfer fund frequently across borders, alsoaccessing financial market worldwide daily basis pursuit best mean control risk. interms technical capability least, utilize computer networks, even firm small scalecan solicit fund directly overseas investor individual deal directly overseas financialinstitutions. availability diverse financial service meet potential need firm andhouseholds provide basis revitalize financial sector growth industry. country aroundthe world recognize financial sector high growth industry, reason havebeen vie reform domestic financial markets. the big bang implementedin unite kingdom mid-1980s fact aim strengthen financial sector theleading industry country’s economy attract back london financial transaction hadshifted unite states. the development introduction diverse financial service become increasinglyimportant japan well, give change flow capital japan abroad. with theaccumulation personal asset need prepare age society, growingdemand household sector diversification asset risks, corporate sector iswaiting emergence venture business lead growth industry establishment newchannels facilitate supply capital businesses. there concern, however, whether japanese financial market thecapacity create financial service instrument satisfy various need corporateand household sectors. the conventional framework japanese financial system divide industry bytype business, entrust type business specialize financial institutions, prohibitedinstitutions enter type business. the majority opinion institutionalsegmentation financial business effective supply capital priority industry thepostwar reconstruction period era high economic growth. with rapidly expand scope offinancial service diversify need users, however, appropriateness segmentationhas come question. it must indeed thoroughly examine whether impede provision ofefficient financial service introduction new financial technology, whether restrictingmarket competition.bis review 61/1997 - 7 -it also important review institutional framework legal, tax, andaccounting system make suitable financial service new era. if institutional framework improved, even transaction residentsmay shift overseas market due exercise choice market participants. this may called“transactions flight” rather “capital flight.” a financial market constitute infrastructuresupporting economic activity country, hollow market must prevented.b. the basic approach market reform a i explained, market reform conduct mere deregulationprocess. rather, promote viewpoint create internationally competitivemarket make market attractive domestic overseas participants. in so, must beremembered country around world also strive attract domestic cross-borderfinancial transaction market enhance international competitiveness. that tosay, system various country differ significantly, country review existingsystem continuous basis pursuit improve efficiency. therefore, simply consider thepresent new york london market goal, might find trail behind thosemarkets time reform japan realized. in words, important try one ortwo step ahead time rebuild japan’s financial markets. the frame reference effort fully utilize creativity privatesector, words, maximize function market mechanism. in fact, drive forcefor development new york london market innovative strength marketmechanism. it therefore important exist regulation review abolish much aspossible place strong emphasis market participants’ self-responsibility honoringmarket discipline. it essential framework build diverse financial service madeavailable public, enable choose efficient product product sufficientlymeet various needs. such framework promote great efficiency entirefinancial system draw innovative idea competition, also contribute thestability financial system put work check mechanism inherent markets. when look back japanese financial market perspective, see thatevery attempt introduce new financial product, commercial paper securitized instruments,required lengthy process product could actually launched. this wasalways heat debate whether new product could construe negotiable security underthe security exchange act 1948, order determine type financial institution, is,securities company banks, would handle product. another feature japanese financial market restriction conditionsimposed limit risk carry security trade capital market, is, impose theinvestment instrument institutional investor corporate issuer negotiable securities.examples restriction equity investment investment trust pension fund thequalification criterion corporate bond issues, abolish end 1995. this feature,however, seem constrain basic function capital market realize efficienttransfers business risk base price mechanism consequently restrict access thecapital market. such feature japanese financial market aim protect investors,which realize make specific institution responsible specific financial instruments, andthen regulate supervise institution responsible handle financial products. shouldthis remain unchanged, however, new financial instrument may introduce expeditiously thefunctions capital market may fully utilized, weaken internationalcompetitiveness japanese markets. in addition, regulation continue severely restrict theactivities institution offer financial products, may leave little room financialbis review 61/1997 - 8 -institutions exercise creativity and, end, even discourage so. in practice, theregulations apply certain degree flexibility avoid impairment market functions. inorder strengthen competitiveness japanese markets, however, essential resolutelyrelax remove exist regulation allow private sector fully exercise creativity. it become important market participant hold responsible ownactions market discipline respected, also comprehensive rule make apply tothe entire market ensure adequate function market mechanism. such market rule besummarized conceptually follow two categories. the first type rule financial business general - example, banks, securitiescompanies, insurance companies, investment trust - must observe transaction withcustomers. these include rule provide adequate explanation risk involve certainproduct accordance customer’s level knowledge experience, strict separation ofthe customers’ asset institution’s assets. the second type rule pertain disclosure andthose prohibit unfair trades. the basis investor protection disclose information enablesinvestors make rational decision investment. with disclosure, responsibility theinvestment decision lie investors. it thus necessary enhance public disclosure, whileconsidering instrument investor protection provided. besides two type rules, prudential regulation need impose bankswhich participate settlement system. this failure one bank might trigger thematerialization systemic risk, disrupt entire financial system. however, prudentialregulations apply rigorously, bank may put major disadvantage vis-à-vis financialinstitutions. therefore, bank regulation review encourage effortsby bank themselves. these rule regulation control detail action financialinstitutions. instead, aim guarantee free self-reliant behavior financial institution withinthe minimum necessary framework. relaxation removal unnecessary regulation within thatframework promote competition among financial institutions, improve quality financialservices available user japan abroad.c. the future japanese financial market before concluding, i would also like discus bank’s view regard future ofjapan’s markets, question often raised. first all, light experience big bang unite kingdom, someanticipate market reform accomplished, japanese financial institution might end upbeing acquire foreign interests. it extremely difficult forecast whether happen japanand extent occur. however, whoever provider financial services, ismost important establish financial market efficiently supply diverse financial service thepeople thereby provide foundation sound development national economy.even attempt make protect domestic financial institution mean market regulation, thecost protection bear people, financial institution lack internationalcompetitiveness. this would reduce international competitiveness japanese firm and, end,might shackle economic development japan. follow big bang unite kingdom, london market grow andconsolidated status global market. it true process, capital various origin find itsway british financial institutions. this, however, occur london market thecapacity create new financial techniques, obviously subsequent revitalization market hascontributed development british economy. bi review 61/1997 - 9 -in end, financial institution seem choice reinforce financialstrength enhance competitiveness survive tough competition. i strongly expect financialinstitutions japan strengthen competitiveness effort reform themselves,and i convince remain full determination respect. another concern japan deregulation proceed further, many thesmall medium-sized financial institution find business base take largerinstitutions. look situation europe unite states, however, i feel atendency financial institution become specialize present financial environment. while istrue financial institution might seek provide comprehensive financial services, notbe able survive severe competition merely expand scale scope operations.those institution also develop area niche competitive securethe base existence. it thus strongly expect financial institution advance itsknow-how expertise particular area strength provide quality financial services.while market reform japan thus intensify competition among financial institutions, i theview directly cause small medium-sized financial institution lose businessbases.v. conclusionthe reform financial market involve numerous issue besides relaxation andremoval exist regulation improvement institutional framework legal, tax, andaccounting systems. review public finance adequate regulation supervision, example,are important considerations. the revision bank japan law also perceive part ofthe process reform japanese financial market financial system. with regard revision bank japan law, bill amend entire law wassubmitted diet march follow intense deliberation central bank study group, anadvisory panel prime minister, financial system research council, advisorycommittee minister finance. the bill aim establish new central bank system found onthe two basic principle independence transparency. underlie amendment proposal theperception order improve efficacy flexibility monetary policy amid changesoccurring global environment surround japanese financial markets, i discussedtoday, legislation base bank japan operate must appropriate central bankin new age. i strongly hope bill smooth passage follow diet deliberations. atthe time, bank japan determine strengthen effort reform bank toensure appropriate policy operational management. in closing, i would like ask continue understand cooperation.bis review 61/1997 bank japan present summary article publish

pour la suisseexposé présenté par m. jean-pierre roth, vice-président de la direction générale de la banquenationale suisse, à l’assemblée générale de l’association suisse d’assurances à genève, le27/5/97.1. introductionselon le calendrier du traité de maastricht, le processus d’intégration monétaireen europe entre maintenant dans sa dernière ligne droite. d’ici moins d’un an, la liste de paysqui participeront à la première phase d’intégration serum arrêtée et, au 1 janvier 1999, lesystème européen de banques centrales (sebc) prendra la conduite de opérations monétaires.l’euro deviendra alors réalité.le projet est très ambitieux, non seulement sur le plan politique, mais aussi sur leplan technique. le pay membres de l’union européenne (ue) travaillent d’arrache-pieddepuis le début de années nonante. leurs effort visent non seulement à mettre en place unemonnaie unique de qualité qui pourra dignement succéder aux devise européennes le plussaines actuellement, mais aussi à donner à l’europe le moyens de mener une politiquecommune générant confiance et stabilité.mon propos, aujourd’hui, ne serum pa de discuter le avantages et lesinconvénients d’une unification monétaire en europe. ce ne serum pa non plus de tenter dedéfinir le contour géographique de la future zone euro. sur ce points, suffisamment été dit etécrit. vous êtes en possession de éléments du problème.je souhaite consacrer le temp que vous m’accordez à faire d’abord le point despréparatifs techniques, puis à m’interroger sur le conséquences de l’apparition de la monnaieunique pour le européens et pour la suisse.2. l’état de préparatifsles travaux préparatoires en vue de la première phase d’intégration monétairesont de deux ordres: d’une part, de effort considérables sont déployés au niveau national envue de remplir le critères de convergence fixés par le traité de maastricht. d’autre part, destravaux importants de planification sont nécessaires préalablement à l’introduction de lamonnaie unique et à la conduite de la politique monétaire commune.si le question relative aux critères de convergence sont largement connues dupublic, celles qui se rapportent aux préparatifs monétaires opérationnels le sont moins. elles sontpourtant d’une importance vitale, car si elles ne sont pa résolues la zone euro ne pourra pasfonctionner correctement. par ailleurs, pour ceux qui, comme nous, resteront à l’écart duprocessus, le éléments technique comportent une dimension pratique évidente.je m’arrêterai sur le travaux préparatoires relatifs:- à la politique monétaire commune,- aux opérations du sebc,- au système de paiements,- aux relation avec le tiers.2.1. la politique communel’objectif de l’uem est de substituer aux monnaies européennesactuelles - généralement mi en place au 19e siècle - une monnaie unique gérée en commun.bis review 57/1997 - 2 -aucun projet monétaire d’une telle envergure n’a été réalisé au cours de ce siècleen europe. le projet est d’une extraordinaire ambition car il s’agit d’un pari sur l’avenir. depuisque l’étalon-or n’est plus à la base de no systèmes monétaires, la monnaie est avant tout uneaffaire de confiance dans la capacité de autorités à la gérer de telle sorte que son pouvoird’achat ne s’érode pas. la grande audace de l’ue est de confier le destin de sa monnaie à uneautorité qui n’existe pa encore, donc qui n’a pa de crédibilité acquise à l’épreuve de combatspassés. le risque est ici d’autant plus grand que la révolution monétaire, qui se déroulera sousnos yeux, ne serum pa accompagnée d’une révolution politique qui serait en mesure, d’ores etdéjà, de rendre claires le ax de développement et le priorités futurs.conscients de cette déficience de crédibilité, le européens ont fixé trèsprécisément le objectifs de l’action du sebc. ce dernier devra assurer la stabilité de prix, unmandat qu’il aura à remplir en toute indépendance par rapport aux pouvoirs politiques. de plus,grâce aux critères de maastricht, seuls de pay ayant démontré leur stabilité financière pourrontfaire partie de l’union, ce qui doit donner un avant-goût de la culture qui existera au sein duconseil de gouverneurs de la future autorité monétaire européenne.tout donc été prévu pour donner au sebc la crédibilité indispensable àl’application d’une politique visant à la stabilité de prix. evidemment, cette question n’est passeulement théorique, elle est également d’une grande portée économique pour le pay quientreront dans l’union. si la crédibilité de autorités européennes est inférieure à celle desautorités monétaires nationales actuelles, le taux d’intérêt européen aura tendance à êtresupérieur aux taux que l’europe connaît aujourd’hui, ce qui pourrait avoir un impact négatif surle développement de la conjoncture. le maintien d’un processus cohérent d’intégration est donccrucial pour le “standing” futur de la monnaie européenne, mais surtout pour le condition definancement et d’investissement dans le pay qui passeront à la fusion monétaire.2.2. la planification opérationnelleau-delà de question essentielles liées à la politique monétaire, le européensdoivent également régler nombre de détails technique pour être en mesure de gérer en communle nouvel ensemble monétaire. il ont dû s’entendre sur la stratégie et le cadre opérationnel quiseront ceux du sebc à partir du 1 janvier 1999.comme déjà indiqué, l’objectif de la politique monétaire du sebc serum lastabilité de prix. pour l’atteindre, le autorités monétaires suivront une stratégie qui se situera àmi-chemin entre le monétarisme traditionnel - à l’allemande - et la fixation - àl’anglaise - d’objectifs d’inflation. ce réflexions ont été faites au sein de l’institut monétaireeuropéen (ime), le précurseur de la banque centrale européenne. il est naturel que l’ime n’aitpas été en mesure d’arrêter une stratégie unique pour l’instant. bien de éléments d’appréciationlui échappent encore: une approche à l’allemande ne pourra être suivie que si la future demanded’euros est suffisamment stable. si celle-ci ne peut être mise en rapport direct avec l’activitééconomique dans l’union monétaire, une stratégie alternative, comme une stratégie basée surdes objectifs d’inflation, pourrait devenir une bonne solution de rechange.on notera au passage qu’une stratégie de cours de change été écartée d’emblée.par une stratégie de change, le européens pourraient décider de li le sort de l’euro à celuid’une autre monnaie - le dollar dans notre cas. ici de éléments politiques et psychologiques meparaissent importants: si l’europe veut mettre en place une monnaie commune qui puisse fairecontrepoids - à terme - au billet vert, il lui est difficile de la faire tenir sur le fonds baptismauxpar un parrain américain. par ailleurs, comme la politique de change ne relèvera pa de lacompétence du sebc mais du conseil européen, l’autonomie de autorités monétaires seraitbis review 57/1997 - 3 -d’entrée gravement compromise; en effet, leur marge de manoeuvre dans la gestion de laliquidité du marché de l’euro serait sou la coupe de fluctuation du dollar.au-delà de question stratégiques, l’ime dû régler une foule de détailstechniques afin de permettre au sebc de mener son action monétaire. ainsi, est-il déjà clair quela liquidité du marché serum gérée par voie d’open-market, que deux taux d’intérêt officiels serontpubliés, l’un - un taux de dépôt - constituera une sorte de plancher pour le taux du marchémonétaire, l’autre - une forme de taux lombard - jouera le rôle de plafond. la gestion desfacilités de crédit et de dépôt relèvera de compétences nationales, alors que l’open-market seramené par la banque centrale européenne.une particularité du dispositif européen serum la présence de réserves obligatoiresou, plus précisément, la possibilité d’imposer de tell réserves. la question de l’utilité d’un telinstrument ne fait pa l’unanimité dans le banques centrales de l’ue, le sebc pourra en faireusage s’il s’avère nécessaire de régulariser la demande de liquidité de banques.2.3. le système de paiementun volet très important de travaux préparatoires est celui de la mise en placed’un système européen de paiements interbancaires par voie électronique.pourquoi est-ce si important? parce qu’il est nécessaire que le marchés nationauxsoient de véritables vas communicants. si la banque centrale européenne injecte de la liquiditédans un marché, celle-ci doit pouvoir se distribuer ensuite - très rapidement - dans le autres.de même, si un marché recherche de la liquidité, l’appoint devra pouvoir être immédiatementfourni par le autres grâce à de opérations d’arbitrage. il n’existera alors qu’un seul tauxd’intérêt pour de transaction devant être exécutées en “valeur le même jour”.dans ce domaine c’est également une révolution qui se prépare car, actuellement,chaque pay de l’ue possède son propre système de paiement interbancaire. une harmonisationet une coordination sont donc nécessaires. au plan de l’harmonisation, il est prévu que lessystèmes fonctionneront selon de principe de règlement analogues. au plan de la coordination,il s’agit de connecter ce systèmes afin qu’ils puissent ensuite permettre aux paiements depasser, sans obstacle ni perte de temps, d’un pay à l’autre. ce domaines sont extrêmementtechniques et réclament de investissements considérables.on ne peut s’arrêter sur le question de paiement sans parler de préparatifs enmatière de billet de banque. ici, l’objectif est plus lointain puisque le billet libellés en eurosn’apparaîtront pa avant 2002. un concours été organisé, un graphiste choisi. le travaux definalisation, puis d’impression, de coupures occuperont largement le trois années quisépareront 1999 de 2002.2.4. le relation avec le pay extérieursa côté de préparatifs de politique monétaire et de la mise en place du cadretechnique, le européens ont dû arrêter également une stratégie pour leurs relation extérieures.peu de choses sont connues pour l’instant. il est déjà clair, toutefois, que lesrelations entre la zone euro et le reste de l’ue - ceux que l’on appelle le “outs” -, seront d’uneimportance primordiale. n’oublions pa que l’union monétaire se déroulera en phases, si bienque la nature de relation entre le membres de l’union et le pay qui n’ont pa encorevoulu - ou pu - adhérer à la zone euro est particulièrement importante, non seulement pour lespays candidats, mais aussi pour le membres de l’union. a ce stade, une seule choose semblebis review 57/1997 - 4 -claire: le pay ne participant pa à la première phase d’intégration ne pourront bénéficier desfacilités de crédit du sebc; le privilège de la liquidité en euro serum réservé aux pay membres.mais c’est bien entendu dans le domaine de change que de dispositionsspéciales devront être prises. aujourd’hui, la majeure partie de pay de l’ue font partie dusystème monétaire européen (sme) et de son mécanisme de change (mce). demain, lorsquecertains membres auront décidé de li définitivement leurs monnaie, le condition defonctionnement du mce devront être révisées. il s’agira de mettre la zone euro à l’abri demanipulations monétaires extérieures et d’aider le pay en attente d’intégration à réaliser à leurtour la fusion monétaire.enfin, la banque centrale européenne devra également considérer que d’autrespays européens, non-membres de l’ue, souhaiteront établir de relation particulières entre leurmonnaie et l’euro. certains pay d’europe centrale ont déjà indiqué qu’ils pourraient envisagerde li leur monnaie à l’euro. qu’en est-il de notre pays, lui qui pourrait se trouver, demain, aucoeur de la zone monétaire européenne?3. le implication pour la suisseque pouvons-nous attendre de l’union monétaire?je l’ai déjà indiqué, c’est une révolution qui se prépare à notre porte. avecl’union monétaire, le paysage macro-économique européen va être profondément modifié. d’unespace à devise multiples, à marchés financier fragmentés, va passer à une zone uniformedont la dimension potentielle est comparable à celle de etats-unis. le bouleversement serum siprofond que chacun d’entre nous, même dans sa vie courante, en percevra le conséquences.quelles sont le évolutions qui peuvent être pressenties:- au niveau de entreprises,- au niveau macro-économique?3.1. l’impact de l’euro au niveau de entreprisesavec l’apparition de l’euro, le terme “grand marché” appliqué souvent au marchéeuropéen aura pris toute sa signification. au sein de la zone euro, le risques de change aurontdisparu, le coûts et le prix seront formulés dans une unité commune, le coût du capital seraidentique.de cette constatation banale découleront d’importantes conséquencesindustrielles:en premier lieu, l’unification monétaire encouragera le entreprises européennes àaller encore plus loin dans leurs investissements transfrontières. la localisation de lieux deproduction s’effectuera plus rationnellement qu’aujourd’hui en fonction de conditions-cadrelocales. un rôle essentiel joueront ainsi de facteurs comme le coût du travail, la situationfiscale, l’état de communication et la proximité de marchés. le barrières monétairesdisparaîtront: plus d’incertitudes monétaires sur le marges, plus d’incertitudes monétaires sur lerendement de investissements; tous le bilans seront aisément consolidables en euros.nous allons donc assister à l’apparition d’entreprises à profil plus européen quefrançais ou allemand. elles seront peut-être multiculturelles dans la langue - pour autant quel’anglais ne devienne pa la langue véhiculaire de l’europe continentale - mais très “grandmarché” dans leur organisation. il en résultera forcément une unification progressive destechniques et de procédures; peu à peu, s’installera une mentalité de marché intérieur qui,bis review 57/1997 - 5 -comme l’observe aux etats-unis, débouchera sur une inflexibilité, une incompréhension àl’égard de marchés extérieurs de faible taille.pour la suisse, cela signifie que le règles du jeu commercial deviendront plusdifficiles. le pratiques européennes en matière de contrats, de conditions, de normes,s’imposeront à nous. il serum toujours plus difficile d’utiliser le franc suisse comme base defacturation, c’est l’euro qui deviendra la référence pour no exportateurs. sur le plan interne, letouriste européen qui transitera par notre pay souhaitera payer en euro dans le commerces,plutôt que devoir passer par le franc suisse. nous devon donc nous préparer à vivre avec unensemble européen monolithique alors qu’aujourd’hui nous somme confrontés à une mosaïqueaux couleurs très variées. jusqu’ici le commerce transfrontière était une tradition européenne,demain il le serum moins.en second lieu, la création de la zone euro stimulera la concurrence dans lesmarchés de produits financiers. c’est certainement dans ce secteur que la suppression desrisques de change aura l’impact le plus marqué. le marché financier européen gagnera enprofondeur, il attirera aussi le opérateurs étrangers. la compétition entre le établissements decrédit, entre tous le établissements financiers, s’accentuera même si de particularités nationalessubsisteront en matière de surveillance ou dans le domaine fiscal.il faut donc s’attendre à ce que l’apparition de l’euro entraîne une accélération desajustements de structure financières. ici également, le cadre de référence ne pourra plus êtrenational; il deviendra supranational.cet ajustement de structure est déjà largement engagé dans notre pays. enraison de l’étroitesse de notre marché, no principaux établissements financier - banques etassurances - ont déjà été conduit à adopter de stratégies globales. je crois donc que nous seronsainsi bien en mesure de saisir le chance qui nous seront offertes par le “grand marchéfinancier” de l’euro.pour conclure cette section sur le service financiers, il convient de parler desservices de paiement. dans ce domaine, notre situation est semblable à celle de pay européensqui ne participeront pa à la première phase d’intégration monétaire. nous disposons en suissed’un système de paiement électronique et de transfert de titre très performant et totalementconforme aux principe retenus par le européens. il conviendra d’établir le ponts nécessairespour que ce système puisse “dialoguer” avec le système européen. sur ce plan, la situation de lasuisse n’est pa très différente de celle du royaume-uni. le européens n’ont pa encore définidans le détail le règles de collaboration dans ce domaine entre le “ins” et le “outs”, lesmembres et le non-membres de l’union monétaire. lorsque cela serum fait, nous verrons quellessont le variantes qui peuvent être envisagées.il est indéniable que la monnaie unique créera, dans le relation entre la suisse etl’union européenne, un nouveau rapport de forces. je ne doute pa que nous puissions le gérer,même que nous puissions en exploiter le éléments positifs. cela réclamera toutefois de prisesde risques dans de domaines où nous avon bénéficié de situation fort confortables par lepassé. cela réclamera aussi une volonté de s’adapter à un environnement nouveau, une remise enquestion de notre manière de commercer avec no voisins. il faudra chercher à innover plutôtqu’à optimiser.3.2. l’impact de l’euro au niveau macro-économiquel’apparition de l’euro modifiera aussi l’environnement macro-économique danslequel opère notre pays.arrêtons-nous tout d’abord sur le effets de long terme.bis review 57/1997 - 6 -fondamentalement, si le européens gagnent leur pari, si l’euro s’avère être unemonnaie saine, la suisse bénéficiera d’un environnement européen beaucoup plus stable que parle passé. jusqu’ici, notre économie souvent dû s’adapter douloureusement aux distorsionscréées par le désordres monétaires extérieurs. a titre d’exemple, rappelons-nous lesmouvements spectaculaires de la lira italienne au cours de quinze dernières années. dans lesannées quatre-vingt, la lire, intégrée au sme, ne cessait de s’apprécier en term réels face aufranc suisse, ce qui ne pouvait que plaire à no entreprises qui se trouvaient en concurrence avecdes entreprises italiennes. au fil de années, la capacité exportatrice de l’italie s’est trouvée sifortement entravée que la lira dû quitter le sme en 1993. elle alors rapidement perdu près dela moitié de sa valeur, éliminant en quelques mois le excès de poids accumulés pendant le dixannées précédentes. de tels mouvements de yo-yo échappent à no moyens de contrôle; il sontdramatiques pour no entreprises exportatrices. si, demain - ou peut-être après-demain -, detelles situation ne survenaient plus grâce aux progrès de la stabilité monétaire en europe, c’estl’économie suisse tout entière, comme lieu de production, qui en profiterait.le second effet de long terme que l’on peut attendre de l’unificationmonétaire - et c’est peut-être un paradoxe aux yeux de certains d’entre vous -, c’est uneintégration accélérée de l’économie suisse dans l’économie d’europe continentale.déjà aujourd’hui, la conjoncture de notre pay dépend étroitement de ce qui sepasse chez no voisins. depuis le début de années nonante, tous no retournements de cycleconjoncturel ont coïncidé avec ceux que l’on observait en france et en allemagne. aujourd’hui,notre atmosphère conjoncturelle est semblable à celle de no voisins. si, à l’avenir, le pulsionsde l’activité économique en europe devenaient beaucoup plus uniformes, je ne doute pa quenotre rythme de production serait encore plus dépendant de ce qui se passe sur le continent.lorsque le grand marché gagnera en homogénéité, la suisse aura de plus en plus un profileuropéen. il en résultera une synchronisation croissante de décisions de politique économique,des mouvements de taux d’intérêt et de la conjoncture. dans le domaine monétaire, lesdécisions de la future banque centrale européenne seront de première importance pour labanque nationale suisse.mais, au-delà de la conjoncture, si l’euro se révèle être une monnaie forte, commeles européens le souhaitent, deux phénomènes, essentiels pour nous, se manifesteront sur lesmarchés financiers. d’une part, nous assisterons à une diminution de incertitudes, donc à unebaisse du niveau de taux d’intérêt sur l’euro; d’autre part, dès l’instant où le marchésréaliseront que le éléments sous-jacents à l’euro et au franc sont fort semblables, ilsconsidéreront notre monnaie comme une monnaie parente de la monnaie unique: no tauxd’intérêt pourraient ainsi être progressivement attirés par ceux de l’euro. je ne serais donc passurpris si, tendanciellement, nous observions ce prochaines années un rapprochement gradueldes taux d’intérêt suisse et européens. comme indiqué tout à l’heure, je ne pense pa quel’ajustement s’opérera de notre côté seulement, car une fois terminée la phase d’introduction del’euro, le condition de financement devraient se détendre en france comme en allemagne.si cette évolution intervient, c’est-à-dire si le marchés considèrent le franc etl’euro comme de monnaies de qualité semblable, l’écart entre taux suisse et européensdiminuera et une intégration à terme du franc dans la zone euro ne devrait pa poser deproblèmes. je vous rappelle ici que l’objectif à long terme du conseil fédéral est une intégrationde la suisse dans l’édifice européen en construction.3.3. le incertitudesmais bien entendu, le évolutions que je vous ai décrites présupposent que l’eurobis review 57/1997 - 7 -devienne une monnaie stable. certains en doutent et craignent que la monnaie unique ne soit pasle digne successeur du mark allemand.on ne peut écarter totalement cette hypothèse car l’intégration monétaire est uneopération délicate. toutefois, je reste confiant car le européens ont reconnu ce dernièresannées l’importance de la stabilité de prix; il ont aussi vu qu’une monnaie saine permetd’abaisser durablement le coût du capital, d’allouer efficacement le ressources productives et destimuler la croissance. j’ai donc le sentiment que le sebc veillera avec grand soin à remplir lemandat qui lui est assigné par s statuts.pour nous, suisses, le incertitude portent moins sur la qualité future de l’euroque sur le condition de son introduction. a cet égard, cette année et l’année prochaine jouentun rôle crucial. au-delà de 1999, le sebc serum jugé par sa politique et il aura le moyens demaîtriser la situation.jusque-là, le choses seront plus délicates car le marchés vont essayer, à l’aided’informations fragmentaires et de suppositions, de mesurer la qualité de la future monnaieeuropéenne. une grande volatilité peut être crainte, volatilité dommageable pour notreéconomie.je reste toutefois confiant. ma confiance n’est pa du “wishful thinking”, maisrepose sur de faits objectifs:en premier lieu, je crois qu’il n’est pa dans l’intérêt de européens de procéder àl’intégration monétaire dans le désordre. certains pay - et je pense ici à l’allemagne - verraientcertainement d’un mauvais oeil que l’introduction de l’euro entraîne une dégradation marquéede leur stabilité monétaire. il paraît évident que la bundesbank prendrait de contre-mesuressi une spéculation contre le mark devait se déclencher. le allemands sont intéressés à un eurofort.en deuxième lieu, le européens ont tout fait jusqu’ici pour convaincre lesmarchés que l’intégration monétaire serum ordonnée. le critères de convergence et le pacte destabilité sont autant de signaux indiquant que seuls de pay financièrement sains pourrontaccéder à la monnaie unique. je crois qu’il se tiendront à cette ligne de conduite jusqu’à ladécision finale.en troisième lieu, en dépit de évolutions récentes, c’est le dollar - non le francsuisse - qui absorbe le incertitude de la construction européenne. la monnaie américaine estvue par le placeurs comme la principale alternative, non notre monnaie qui, elle, se trouveratoujours dans le sillage de monnaies européennes.quoi qu’il en soit, de risques de perturbation existent. en ca d’agitation desmarchés, nous ne serions pa sans moyens pour nous défendre. notre principale arme est lapolitique monétaire qui peut tenir compte de turbulence extérieures. un assouplissement denotre politique en ca d’appréciation du franc est possible - nous venons de le démontrer il aun peu plus d’une semaine. en cette matière, il convient toutefois de rester réaliste: la banquenationale n’a pa le moyens de mettre la suisse totalement à l’abri de perturbation extérieures.comme je vous l’indiquais tout à l’heure, l’économie suisse souvent souffert de chocsmonétaires provenant de l’étranger; la politique monétaire ne peut - au mieux - qu’en atténuerles effets négatifs. nous nous efforcerons de lutter contre le mouvements irréalistes du franc.faudrait-il, dans ce conditions, souhaiter purement et simplement un accrochagedu franc à l’euro? par une opération de ce type, pourrait-on éliminer le risques d’un envol dufranc sur le marchés? malheureusement, il n’existe pa de solution miracle. tant que la suissene serum pa membre de institution européennes, il ne serum pa possible de convaincre lesmarchés que le franc est lié irrémédiablement à l’euro. si nous définissions unilatéralement unebis review 57/1997 - 8 -parité du franc par rapport à l’euro, le marchés la testeraient. nous attiserions plus que nouscalmerions le mouvements de fonds spéculatifs. l’arrimage unilatéral du franc à la monnaieeuropéenne ne tiendrait donc pa longtemps.4. conclusionsles travaux préparatoires à l’union monétaire vont donc bon train. au cours desprochains mois, un certain nombre de détails technique seront encore éclaircis, c’est auprintemps prochain que serum connue la liste de pay prêts à la fusion monétaire.nous n’en serons pas. mais nous n’en ressentirons pa moins le conséquences.j’utilise ici le terme “nous” afin de couvrir tous le acteurs de la vie économiquecar le changement du paysage monétaire européen serum si profond que chacun d’entre nous seraaffecté, directement ou indirectement. ce sont bien entendu ceux qui sont au front du commerceextérieur - de biens ou de service - qui verront l’environnement changer le plus rapidement.le poids de l’euro se fera sentir; le marché européen - considéré comme international par lepassé - deviendra un grand marché intérieur avec sa dimension, bien sûr, mais aussi avec sestendances protectionnistes et dominatrices.pour la banque nationale également, l’euro ouvre un nouveau chapitre desrelations monétaires en europe. nous avon confiance que le processus d’intégration sedéroulera sans déclencher de vagues sur le marché de changes. nous espérons aussi ques’installeront en europe de condition de stabilité qui permettront aux trajectoires du francsuisse et de l’euro de se rejoindre un jour.bis review 57/1997 mr. heikensten give review recent development swedisheconomy monetary policy speech deputy governor bank sweden,mr. lars heikensten, give

programme hong kong 8/5/97.“a state good govern laws, law strictlyobserved”...rené descartes (1596-1650)introductionfinancial market today big market world. the foreignexchange market turn us$ 1.2 trillion daily, roughly one quarter annual world exports.the regulation financial market therefore concern u all. this paper cover what, why,who how financial regulation.financial market engage exchange property rights. financial asset arederivatives physical real assets, derivative property right property right arenot “lumpy” asset specific, transaction cost low transaction realassets.the first thing remember financial product define bythe law. therefore, financial transaction transaction legal products, underprocedures regulate rule laws. even financial institution are, strictly speaking, legalconstructs. to paraphrase another french philosopher: man bear free, isbound law.what financial regulation?the dictionary finance define regulation action ‘command andcontrol’ individual decision firms, effort prevent private decision-making thatwould take inadequate account ’public interest’. regulation may self-imposed, or, isusual, third party. the government may intervene market industry form oflaw, administrative rules, taxation moral suasion. self-regulation could impose throughindustry association code conduct.the regulatory framework shape market behaviour. therefore, design andpractice regulatory framework determine efficiency performance regulatedmarket.why regulations?there theory attempt explain existence form ofregulation, including:- competition regulation theory suggest exist market forregulation, consumer producer compete. regulation serve interest ofthose will offer regulation. since regulation regard apublic good, free-rider problem suggest benefit individual consumer likelyto small relative producer. therefore, producer incentive try andobtain favourable regulation industry associations. a countervail force thereforethe consumer lobby; capture theory suggest producer capture regulatory agency andcontrol interests. vest interest reinforce regulatory framework tobis review 55/1997 - 2 -support interests, danger behaviour would result non-competitivenessin international market, lead long-run social loss.if believe theories, assume regulation impose ultimately acost consumer taxpayer, may public interest remove regulation andallow great competition. this primary drive force behind current market deregulationpolicies prevalent oecd markets.a recent example deregulation drive “make market work better” thereport australian financial system inquiry (wallis report), whose recommendation seekto:-create flexible regulatory structure responsive forcesfor change operate financial system;clarify regulatory goals;increase accountability agency charge meet goals;ensure regulation similar financial product consistent andpromote competition improve comparability;introduce great competitive neutrality across financial system;establish contestable, efficient fair financial markets, result inreduced cost consumers;provide effective regulation financial conglomerate alsofacilitate competition efficiency; andfacilitate international competitiveness australian financial system.on hand, market without regulation also work. free bankingand frontier capitalism result control mafia, huge loss inflict innocentand unwary. the public interest theory argue regulation attempt correct marketfailures, monopoly, externality lack information. for example, social cost ofthe failure financial institution may much high private cost institutionitself. therefore, financial institution leave accept risk optimalfrom systemic point view, thus form basic case government regulation bankingactivity establishment capital requirement (martin feldstein, quote dale, 1996).on basis, justify case external regulation private sectorbehaviour four broad grind relate market failure:-first, moral hazard argument. if market participant belief state willunderwrite losses, behaviour change. a good example deposit insuranceencourages depositor banker engage risky behaviour force state pay theend, thus undermine market discipline entail regulation.second, widow orphan argument. these regulation provide protectionto poorly (asymmetrically) inform clients, base view small depositor andinvestors cannot ass properly riskiness financial institution deal with.third, public policy argument. in free market economies, public policyarguments call competition free trade. an example would anti-trust law somecountries prevent monopolisation certain markets.fourth, systemic risk issue, allow state prevent failure oneparticipant destabilize whole system. this justify regulation, example, thepayment system bank sector.bis review 55/1997 - 3 -regulation therefore two important dimension must always bear inmind. first, regulation cost like taxation: someone bear cost regulation. thepublic must always ask whether benefit outweigh costs. second, regulation timeelement - regulation must change times. old regulation may prevent impedemarket growth. a market change, must regulations. third, regulation prevent theeffective work market forces. for example, avoid bank failures, preventall bank failures. chairman alan greenspan u feed (1997), say “our goal supervisorsshould prevent bank failures, maintain sufficient prudential standard thatbanking problem occur become widespread.”what regulating?we regulate products, function institution combination three.problems arise overlap regulatory terrain, compete regulatory agency andconfused regulatory objectives. there also argument concentration andcompetition regulatory agencies. a good example one-stop regulatory agency themonetary authority singapore, combine regulation bank system, thesecurities market insurance industry one institution. at end spectrum,the u bank sector regulate least four different agencies, federal reservesystem, office comptroller currency (occ), federal deposit insurancecorporation (fdic) state bank commissioners. since u bank increasinglyengaged security areas, function also subject security exchangecommission (sec) consumer lobbies. regulation may base product type thateach regulatory authority specialise one financial product. under framework, securitiesregulator concentrate oversight security activities, irrespective type offinancial institution carry business.functional regulation generally conduct two separate regulatory bodies,an investor protection arm systemic stability arm. the investor protection arm deal withretail depositor small investor ensure fair conduct, equitable competition customerprotection.the systemic stability agency, hand, look large player andwholesale activities. it would also responsible safety, structure function allpayment system financial markets. preventive measure include capital adequacyrequirements; constraint connect lend rule aim prevent insolvency;and official safety net lender last resort deposit insurance.this approach follow goodhart (1995) model, suggest thedifference focus function investor protection systemic stability large enough tojustify two separate regulatory body country share regulatory responsibilities.according goodhart, formulation rule safety system theresponsibility systemic stability arm. on hand, monitor operation ofthe system divide two arm basis size, e.g. balance sheet.another regulatory framework, develop historically, take form ofinstitutional regulation. it reflect institutional segmentation within country, insurancecompanies, security houses, mortgage lend company bank become concern ofdiffering regulatory bodies. institutional regulation become le practicable barriersbetween operate differ functional geographical financial market eroded.bis review 55/1997 - 4 -in between, regulatory system may organise along mixedfunctional/institutional lines. a banks, security house insurance company compete ineach other’s turf, le meaningful difference institution functions.one model, colloquially know “twin peaks”, consist financial stability commission,with responsibility systemic risk, prudential supervision major institutions, andconduct business regulation wholesale activities, consumer protection commission,which could charge conduct business regulation retail markets, well detectingmarket manipulation insider dealing. it would also carry prudential supervision thosestock broke fund manager deal private clients, independentintermediaries. this essentially model adopt wallis commission.approaches regulationthe late mantra financial regulation international monetary fund’sapproach, call “internal governance, official oversight, marketincentives”(lindgren, 1996). to this, i would add, “robust financial infrastructure”.the first line protection bank failure must internal management’sown risk controls. the grow complexity variety bank business suggest neitherthe authority inform customer prevent internal management make mistakesif internal control work. the best defense mistake fraud proper internalgovernance, check balances. internal dual controls, together internal andexternal auditors, plus proper disclosure policy would give best incentive internalmanagement perform accord proper rule behaviour.public disclosure rather private channel information would cheaperand reduce unwarranted expectation regulator supervisor actually achieve.however, difficult, impossible, guarantee full disclosure. it doubtful whether freemarkets work well enough condition information partial asymmetricallydistributed externality exist. thus, really possible authority shiftentirely reliance disclosure abandon specialise supervisory function.increasingly, therefore, public oversight function one monitor andsurveillance, ensure systemic risk incur excessive public costs. when bestpractices market standard applied, behaviour regulate deviate thenorm would subject public scrutiny. there therefore great pressure establishinginternational norm performance, capital adequacy standard risk managementtools. the basle committee recently establish “core principles” guide regulation ofbanks.the application certain regulatory tools, require capital ratios,exposure limits, constraint self-dealing camel rat design ensure thatmarket participant comply minimal standard capital risk exposures. it beemphasised effective regulation require proper compliance enforcement. thisembodies idea “bark versus bite”. teeth must also include sound exit policy - non-exitimplies enforcement, case state-owned enterprise mainland china.however, increasingly recognize rule keep simple broad-brushed,in order allow rule-based environment function. too many rule impose heavy aregulatory cost, redundant excessive information burdens.bis review 55/1997 - 5 -however, give rapidly change market conditions, degree ofdiscretion practical rigid rules. on hand, excessive discretion leadto systematic forbearance (time inconsistency) undermine rule could even subject tocorruption abuse. therefore, time inconsistency problem solve authoritiespre-committing sequence automatic, graduate responses, give markettime adjust rule change rule application.however, must true incentive pay-off structure one mustnot overlooked. one main reason agent abide establish controlprocedures perceive interest (goodhart, 1996). thebest way control risk market incentive so. for market work, must beadequate information transparency, adequate pay (or penalty) structure cause theprivate sector market regulate itself. for example, excessive bonus may cause thebarings management overlook risk assume leeson. low pay internal auditorsrelative dealer may prevent raise alarm bell. internal audit committee offinancial institution signify consider implication riskpreferences key personnel pay structures.it good recognize robust financial infrastructure also form ofregulator market participant behaviour. modern financial infrastructure, automatedpayment systems, impose market participant certain minimum standard performance,such time compliance payments. failure one participant perform would immediatelyexpose participant market discipline. there therefore peer pressure marketparticipants comply standard demand international payment systems.costs regulationregulation without costs. the u estimate regulation cost theconsumer roughly 7% gdp annually, directly indirectly. bank regulation belikened deposit insurance - high regulation safety, high insurancepremium. one theory suggest bank elect one three categories: super-safebanks, safe normal. super-safe bank allow hold super-safe assets, returnhave 100% deposit insurance. normal bank allow hold asset, depositor get noprotection all. but super-safe asset offer low yield normal assets, safe thebank low interest rate offer depositors.the cost regulation lie cost prevent bank failure, alsothe opportunity cost forego innovation. excessive outmode regulation result loss ofinternational competitiveness, thus impose future adjustment cost economy. hence,there need review regulation constantly de-regulate re-regulate.why deregulating?there four major reason deregulation occurring:globalisationfinancial innovation disintermediationchanging consumer behaviour, e.g. age populationexcessive costsbis review 55/1997 - 6 -the globalisation financial market demonstrate tremendousincrease cross-border transactions. for instance, end 1994 stock cross-borderbank asset 4.5 time level 15 year earlier, represent increasefrom 20% combine gdp oecd country 1980 around 35% 1994. between1980 1994 cross-border security

originate poorly regulate financial centres. a alangreenspan (1997) mentioned, ’the efficiency global financial markets, engender therapid proliferation financial products, capability transmit mistake

control.besides, co- existence uneven national regulation global market may severelydistort competition financial institutions.the grow integration market call international cooperation amongsupervisors. accordingly, basle committee bank supervision establish 1974and involve establish common regulatory framework. the basle committee theinternational organisation security commission (iosco) issue coordinate guidelineson risk management otc derivative business. iosco also adopt so-called windsordeclaration co-operation supervisor future option markets. industryinitiatives also aim strengthen prudential standard international financial markets.the group thirty propose minimum standard relate net arrangements,settlement procedure managerial oversight derivative risks. the international securitiesdealers association (isda) establish good practice guideline management ofderivatives fx business globally broker-dealers. and early 1996, 49 exchange andclearing house

furthermore, widespread consensuswithin u glass-steagall repealed. in japan, financial system reformlaw come effect 1993 allow commercial bank security firm expand intoeach others’ business territory establish separate subsidiaries. in european union, thecapital adequacy directive’s trading-book approach permit bank engage freely securitiesactivities.bis review 55/1997 - 7 -the revolution

contribution marshall plan – distinguish fact fictionmarshall aid lifeline unite state europe time when,economically, europe bring knees. between 1948–1951 programannually transfer roughly 1% american gdp, around $ 13 billion aid, 16european countries. in net present value term amount roughly $ 80 billion. by 1951, sixyears war effective end marshall plan, national income per caput weremore 10 percent pre-war levels, economic growth rate next twodecades reach level twice high comparable period since.this temporal coincidence extension marshall aid the“miraculous” recovery europe induce inferral causal relationship. it benoted, however, that, even extensive academic research, root europe’s economicmiracle yet adequately understood. thus, difficult isolate contribution themarshall plan. economically, strong post-war growth performance large part explainedby so-called solow residual – is, traditional factor capital labour.this economist’s way say fully understand go on.a first observation regard reconstruction europe startin 1948 – year first marshall aid disburse – 1945. at time theus already channel large amount aid europe unite nation reliefbis review 54/1997 - 2 -and

in fact, country major aid recipient saw thegovernment spend share national income fall relative nations, opposite whatone would expect fact shortage public investment capital.so marshall aid matter? recently, shift amongacademics might term “revisionist” analysis contribution marshallplan european recovery. accord view, plan’s main contribution alter theenvironment economic policy made, tilt balance qualitative mannerrather quantitatively.as recall, 1947, two year war, europe still characterisedby macroeconomic instability, inflation increasingly tight balance payment constraint.the initial response government counter inflation retain controls, therebyprompting growth black market discourage transaction official prices. bydistorting allocative mechanism market, save initiative discouraged. theappropriate response prescribe economic theory would decontrol price toinduce producer bring good market. in addition, fiscal discipline monetaryrestraint necessary, order reduce inflationary pressures. such policies, however, requirepolitical compromise sacrifice everyone time, need europewere greatest, necessarily forthcoming. the marshall plan may play criticalrole ease

marshallplan contribute conditionality, u able exercise significantinfluence economic policy marshall aid recipients. although year planhas become synonymous substantial aid flow transfer u europe, isuseful recall receive aid recipient country sign bilateral pactwith us. in pact, country agree balance budgets, restore financial stability,stabilise exchange rate realistic level enhance mutual

contribute significantly european integration process. the importantinstitutional innovation regard establishment european payment union in1950, product marshall plan. the marshall plan thus think large andhighly successful structural adjustment program.at stage, i believe useful draw two preliminary lessons:–the first lesson draw marshall plan central elementin post-war europe’s economic success sound economic policy.–the second lesson even aid flow order magnitude thoseunder marshall plan likely small compare resource generateddomestically. nevertheless aid flow likely facilitate adoptionof otherwise painful economic policies.a new marshall plan eastern europe?an interest question extent apply lesson currenttransformation process central eastern europe, i refer eastern

post-world war ii europe also present several transitioneconomies. a europe 50 year ago, important precondition growth take thestabilisation price and, initial adjustment, exchange rate. this thepurview imf adjustment programs, extension credit hassomewhat facilitate adoption painful economic policies.second, europe 1948 eastern europe present experience aperiod intensive government intervention, albeit different reasons. this create habitof control regulation along certain unease work market, similar tothe mistrust market post-war europe follow failure market mechanismsduring great depression. in periods, myriad restriction need abolished,and structural reform need take hold.but also important difference transformation process andpost-war recovery. the marshall plan effective least part europe hadexperience markets. it possess institution need operation. property rights,bankruptcy codes, court system enforce market contract – mention entrepreneurialskills – place. this institutional basis lack eastern europe. moreover,the physical allocation mechanism absence meaningful price much extremethan wartime rationing.second, scale enterprise eastern europe need

down. in addition, post-war experiencedoes teach u implement mass privatisation, put huge sector largestate enterprise commercial basis, simultaneously.third, transition economy liberalise economy already highlyliberalised international environment highly develop international capital markets. insuch context, policy mistake lack market confidence easily lead large andrapid outflow capital, thus drain away much-needed savings. these problem areexacerbated weak financial system experience expertise in, instance, creditallocation lacking.so eastern europe need?this lead believe need eastern europe different thoseof post-war europe marshall plan. at conference several year ago, reformprocess eastern europe compare first post-war reconstruction thereconversion region industry decline.1 of latter, plenty examples, forinstance, shipbuilding industry europe coal, steel textile sectors. generallyspeaking, transformation industry slow painful process, usually highcost. whereas post-war reconstruction process build upon existed,reconversion, nature, imply change perhaps destroy exist structure, notbuilding upon it. this much hard achieve. which experience relevant foreastern europe? in opinion: reconversion. the discussion eastern europe much 1blanchard o. “panel discussion: lesson eastern europe today”, postwar economic reconstructionand lesson east today, mit press, cambridge

transferringcomparable amount money towards eastern europe marshall plan. transferringthe equivalent 2.5% national income recipient countries, estimate costroughly $ 20 billion year. the bretton wood institution course extendingcredits small scale. by comparison, annual flow total official finance toeastern europe around $ 15 billion, 25% transfer underthe marshall plan. total flows, however, include private financing, reach $ 36 billionin 1996. from recipient’s perspective, therefore, amount finance transfer toeastern europe quite significant. from donor’s perspective, hand, presenteffort still pale somewhat compare tremendous display solidarity u afterworld war ii. in regard, remember u finance entire marshall planby itself. if industrial country make similar effort transfer 1% gdp toeastern europe, aid flow region would amount $ 170 billion year, muchmore current $ 15 billion. this illustrate unique nature post-war uscontribution. it uncertain whether increase amount official

critical whatever program adopted, aid provide onthe basis action take rather need.the achievement marshall plan suggest transformation process ineastern europe would significantly enhance intensify

monetary policy south africa, south african reserve bank adopt moneysupply target anchor monetary policy model 1986. after money supply increasedby 27 per cent 1988, rate inflation one stage rise 20 per cent, new monetarypolicy model reserve bank implement vigour, rate increase themoney supply gradually reduce 10 per cent 1992. for two year succession, them3 money supply rise 8 per cent.almost magic, rate inflation also decline 10 per cent 1993,and stay single- digit next four years. in 1996, average rate inflation 7.4per cent, low level calendar year since 1972.the reserve bank seem lose tight grip money supplyover past three years, rate increase m3 accelerate level 15 per centduring year 1994, 1995 1996. these were, however, extremely difficult year withmajor political social reform gradual reintegration south africa globaleconomy. the liberalisation foreign exchange market south africa, access thanfifty foreign bank south african financial market, easy access south africanbanks foreign source liquidity, bring major change pattern financial flow andbanking activities. the consequence change monetary policy must still digest andanalysed detail, adjustment monetary policy model apply reservebank may necessary.initially, acceleration rate increase money supply little effecton inflation. the rate inflation indeed continue decline reach low turn point 5.5 percent twelve month april 1996.a sharp depreciation exchange rate rand february 1996 provide anew shock stimulus inflation south africa and, assist continuous excessive rate ofincrease money supply, rate increase overall consumer price accelerate 9.8 percent twelve month february 1997.the reserve bank greatly concern late trend rate increasein money supply, rate increase bank credit extension, rate inflation. it isaccepted depreciation rand last year must inevitably lead price rises, thereis real danger price adjustment (of internationally tradable versus non-tradable good andservices) become embed permanently high rate inflation.3. the monetary policy modelthe south african experience “monetarist” approach apply since 1986 wasrelatively successful. the present threat new surge inflation see failure ofthe policy approach, rather result external shock -- currency depreciation -- asevere test monetary policy model light change macroeconomic environment.central banker may concur general main objective monetary policy,namely protect value currency, follow strategy pursuingbis review 49/1997 - 3 -this objective. the south african model, also use many countries, primarilylinked growth m3 money supply, predetermine guideline acceptable rate ofgrowth m3 see intermediate objective monetary policy. it base theassumption that, time, link rate expansion money supply andinflation. if real economy, example, expand 3 per cent per annum, current rate ofinflation 7 per cent, continuous increase nominal money supply rate 10 percent per annum eventually exert upward pressure inflation. increase money supply ofless 10 per cent drag inflation downwards.over past years, reserve bank indicate appropriate rate ofincrease south african money supply would 6 10 per cent. the realise ratesof increase were, however, around level 15 per cent year 1994, 1995 and1996. initially, bank le concern excessive rate increase moneysupply, particularly also light relatively low rate increase well 10 per centestablished 1992 1993. inflation also remain downward path april 1996. it isonly past twelve month therefore inflation start move again, trigger thedepreciation rand last year.the persistently high rate increase m3 partly cause structural changesin south african economy. more people absorb market economy, earn regularincomes, open bank account first time. more bank establish south africa,particularly foreign banks, offer bank service south african public. southafrican bank find easy access foreign source credit, make conventional reservebank instrument control overall liquidity

monetary policy model base control increase inthe money supply, require effective control amount bank credit extension, becausethis main source money creation south african market-oriented economy.control bank credit extension require restriction amount ofliquidity available bank sector, also acceptance realistic interest rates. despite themaintenance relatively high interest rate south

recent trend money supply bank credit extension beg question,however, whether monetary policy juncture restrictive enough whether even morestringent measure may require reduce overall liquidity further, could, course,lead even high interest rate hopefully also decline demand credit.4. other function central bankrestricting function central bank monetary objective create astable overall

regulation financial market remark chairman ofthe u federal reserve system, mr. alan greenspan, spring meet institute ofinternational finance washington 29/4/97.i take occasion offer think relate upcoming g-7economic summit meeting, hold denver le two months. one theme inrecent summit meet -- start halifax 1995 continue lyon last year -- hasbeen promotion stability international financial markets. my purpose today todescribe effort make regard, relate primarily supervisionand regulation. rather, i would like step back bite offer framework think aboutthose efforts.to begin with, lose sight fact government regulation, ifnot carefully designed, undermine effectiveness private market regulation canitself ineffective protect public interest. no market ever truly unregulated thatthe self-interest participant generate private market regulation. counterparties thoroughlyscrutinize other, often require collateral special legal protections; self-regulatedclearing house exchange set margin capital requirement protect interest themembers. thus, real question whether market regulated. rather, iswhether government intervention strengthen weaken private regulation, cost. atworst, introduction government rule may actually weaken effectiveness regulationif government regulation ineffective or, importantly, undermine incentive forprivate market regulation. regulation government unavoidably involve element ofperverse incentives, is, moral hazard. if private market participant believe governmentis protect interests, effort diminish.at time, society judge sufficient rely exclusivelyon private sector ensure adequacy management risk financial systems.there perceive need supervision regulation public sector, well. a i willpoint shortly, need arise largely counter potential moral hazard arise aconsequence development large safety net financial systems.many benefit bank provide modern society derive theirwillingness take risk use relatively high degree financial leverage.through leverage, form principally take deposits, bank perform critical role thefinancial intermediation process; provide saver additional investment choice andborrowers great range source credit, thereby facilitate efficientallocation resource contribute importantly great economic growth. indeed, hasbeen evident value intermediation leverage shape development ourfinancial system early time -- certainly since renaissance goldsmith discoveredthat lend deposit gold feasible profitable.central bank provision mechanism convert highly illiquid portfoliosinto liquid one extraordinary circumstance -- key element safety net -- lead agreater degree leverage bank market force alone would support. traditionallythese mechanism involve make discount lombard facility available,

stock market around world inbis review 46/1997 - 2 -1987, satisfy increase need liquidity system whole otherwise could feedcumulative, self-reinforcing contraction across many financial markets.of course, leverage risk-taking also greatly increase possibilityof bank failures. without leverage, loss risk-taking would absorb bank’sowners, virtually eliminate chance bank would unable meet obligation inthe case “failure.” some failure bank’s making, resulting, example,from poor credit judgments. for part, failure normal important part ofthe market process provide discipline information participant regard thelevel business risks. however, important role bank financialintermediaries play financial systems, failure could large ripple effect thatspread throughout business financial

would necessarywithout existence safety net. that is, regulator compel act surrogate formarket discipline since market signal usually accompany excessive risk-taking aresubstantially muted, price bank

intermediaries, burden manage risk thefinancial system lie private sector alone. with leverage alwaysexist remote possibility chain reaction, cascade sequence default willculminate financial implosion proceed unchecked. only modern central bank, itsunlimited power create money, high probability thwart process itbecomes destructive. hence, central bank necessity draw become lender oflast resort. but implicit existence role form ofallocation public private sector burden risk extreme outcomes.thus, central bank lead provide essentially amount catastrophic financialinsurance coverage. such public subsidy reserve rare disasters. ifthe owner manager private financial institution anticipate prop upfrequently government support, would encourage reckless irresponsible practices.in theory, allocation responsibility risk-bearing privatesector central bank depend upon evaluation private cost capital. in order toattract, least retain, capital, private financial institution must earn minimum overalleconomy’s rate return, adjust risk. in competitive financial markets, great theleverage, high rate return, adjustment risk. if private financial institutionshave absorb financial risk, degree leverage limited, thefinancial sector smaller, contribution economy limited. on hand, ifcentral bank effectively insulate private institution large potential losses, howeverincurred, increase laxity could threaten major drain taxpayer produce inflationaryinstability consequence excess money creation.bis review 46/1997 - 3 -thus, governments, include central banks, give

tableau de la politique monétaire et de la conjonctureéconomique en suisse allocution de m. jean-pierre roth, vice-président de la directiongénérale de la banque nationale suisse, au centre international d’etudes monétaires etbancaires, (cimb), à genève, le 22/4/97.mesdames et messieurs,c’est avec de sentiment bien particuliers que je m’adresse à vous aujourd’hui.certes, le thème de mon exposé - politique monétaire et reprise: où en sommes-nous ? - estd’une grande actualité alors que notre pay connaît sa septième année de stagnation économique.mais au-delà de cette constatation - et avant d’entrer dans le vif du sujet -, j’aimerais rendrehommage à la maison qui nous accueille ce soir - l’institut universitaire de hautes etudesinternationales-, où j’ai eu le privilège de pouvoir faire me études de doctorat au début desannées septante. par son enseignement dans le domaines de l’histoire, de la politique et del’économie, l’institut hei formé de générations de diplomates, de hauts fonctionnaires, dechefs d’entreprises, en suisse et à l’étranger. sans ne rien ôter aux mérites de hei dans lesautres domaines, je voudrais souligner le rôle éminent que l’institut joué et joue encore dans ledomaine monétaire. le plus grand noms de la théorie monétaire sont venus ici, faisant de heiun centre privilégié d’enseignement sur le plan suisse. le travaux de recherche de l’institut ontun renom qui dépasse largement no frontières. tout ceci est dû aux effort du corp professoralet de la direction de hei, soutenus par le autorités fédérales et genevoises. je forme le voeuque ce centre d’excellence dans le domaine de la monnaie et de relation internationalescontinue à fournir à notre pay le service qu’il nous rendus jusqu’ici.je ferme cette parenthèse pour en venir à cette question qui nous préoccupe tous:qu’en est-il de la conjoncture? sommes-nous au terme de la phase de stagnation qui frappe sidurement la suisse depuis 1990? pourquoi cette traversée du désert si douloureuse sur le plansocial? quels sont no moyens pour gérer la situation?j’aborderai le problème en trois phases: en premier lieu, je ferai le point sur laconjoncture internationale et mettrai en évidence la situation particulière dans laquelle se trouvel’europe continentale dont notre pay dépend si étroitement. ensuite, je ferai une rétrospectivedes événements conjoncturels de années nonante et m’attarderai sur le problèmes spécifiquesrencontrés par notre pays. enfin, je tirerai de ce survol quelques enseignements pour la conduitede la politique économique dans ce pays.1.un survol conjoncturelcommençons par faire le point de la situation conjoncturelle. comment ne pasêtre frappé par la césure qui existe, aujourd’hui, dans le pay de l’ocde entre le mondeanglo-saxon, d’une part, et l’europe continentale, de l’autre.les etats-unis font preuve d’une bonne santé conjoncturelle, qui semble résister àl’usure du temps. après avoir stagné, puis reculé à la fin de années quatre-vingt, l’économieaméricaine retrouvé le chemin de la croissance. l’emploi global n’a pa cessé d’augmenter etle taux de chômage de baisser. la croissance de l’économie se poursuit sans discontinuer depuis1992 et aucun ralentissement notable n’est attendu pour l’instant. le risque d’une pressionexcessive sur le ressources ne peut même plus être écarté, aussi la réserve fédérale a-t-ellerécemment décidé de relever d’un quart de point le taux de fonds fédéraux. le perspective enmatière d’inflation restent toutefois bonnes, avec une progression modeste de coûts salariaux.bis review 45/1997 - 2 -un scénario analogue pu être observé au royaume-uni. là aussi une stagnationconjoncturelle pu être observée à la fin de années quatre-vingt. la reprise s’est manifestée unpeu plus tard qu’outre-atlantique, au début de 1993, soit avec douze mois de retard par rapportau cycle américain. au royaume-uni, comme aux etats-unis, la croissance s’est maintenuedepuis lors, entraînant une réduction du chômage sans créer de menace sérieuses pour lastabilité de prix.force est de constater que l’atmosphère est bien différente sur le continenteuropéen. d’une part, en raison de la réunification allemande, le creux conjoncturel s’y estmanifesté plus tard que dans le économies anglo-saxonnes, la croissance tombant à son niveaule plus ba en 1993 seulement, et, d’autre part, la remontée d’activité ne s’est jamaisvéritablement matérialisée. après une légère embellie à la fin de 1994 et au début de 1995, leciel conjoncturel européen s’est à nouveau assombri pour déboucher sur une année 1996franchement morose contrairement aux attentes. parallèlement, le chômage augmenté demanière spectaculaire, atteignant de taux record pour le quinze dernières années.pour clore ce tour d’horizon, quelques mot sur l’asie, l’autre pôle dedéveloppement de l’économie mondiale. je ne m’y arrêterai que brièvement car le faits sontlargement connus. en asie, constate également une opposition entre deux type de situationéconomique bien différents. le nouveaux pay industrialisés, qui, dans le sillage de etats-unis,ont réalisé d’importants progrès économiques, et ont vu leur croissance, ce dernières années, sesituer au-dessus de la moyenne de dix années précédentes. de son côté, le japon, le championde la croissance par le passé, de la peine à retrouver un sentier d’expansion comparable à celuiqui était le sien dans le années quatre-vingt. a s problèmes de compétitivité s’ajoute unesituation financière interne chancelante.qu’en est-il de la suisse?2.la situation en suisseun survol de dix dernières années nous indique que le destin conjoncturel de lasuisse été étroitement lié à celui de l’europe continentale. comme chez no voisins immédiats,le cycle conjoncturel s’est retourné en 1993 seulement et, après une amélioration passagère en1994, de nouveaux sign de faiblesse de la demande sont intervenus en 1995 et 1996. laséquence de no épisodes conjoncturels donc parfaitement coïncidé avec ce qui se passait enfrance et en allemagne. mais, contrairement à ce deux pay qui ont pu malgré tout enregistrerdes taux de croissance de l’ordre de 1 à 2%, le nôtres sont restés proche de zéro. dans uneeurope continentale croissant à un rythme modeste, la suisse connu de années de stagnation.que s’est-il passé dans notre pay pour qu’il connaisse de élans conjoncturelsinsignifiants?ma réponse est relativement simple: la suisse connu avec une acuité touteparticulière un certain nombre de difficultés rencontrées également par no voisins. elle s’esttrouvée dans leur mouvance mais occupé l’inconfortable situation d’être placéecontinuellement une peu plus que le autres à l’écart de pressions de la demande.quels sont ce facteurs négatifs?bis review 45/1997 - 3 -2.1.le renforcement du francle premier facteur qui contribué à marginaliser la suisse sur le planconjoncturel été l’évolution du franc. alors que le monnaies européennes étaient déjà fortespar rapport au dollar, le franc se renforçait à leur égard.l’histoire devra juger si, à la suite de la réunification allemande et dans laperspective de l’union monétaire, le pay de l’union européenne n’ont pa été amenés àappliquer une politique monétaire trop restrictive en regard de leur situation économique. lesfaits sont là: du début à la fin de 1994, le mark s’apprécie de 10% face au dollar, entraînant lefranc français et le autres monnaies du sme dans son sillage. le raisons de cette correctiondes change ne se situent pa que du côté européen. il faut se souvenir que, durant le annéesprécédentes, le etats-unis avaient poursuivi une politique monétaire résolument expansive. desstratégies monétaires opposées de part et d’autre de l’atlantique créèrent un potentield’ajustement de change. la perte de compétitivité qui s’en est suivi fait jouer au commerceextérieur européen, en 1995, un rôle de frein alors qu’il aurait dû soutenir la croissance.les choses ne se sont pa manifestées différemment dans notre pays, mais avecune intensité particulière. le franc s’est non seulement renforcé face au dollar, mais aussi faceaux monnaies européennes. le coup de frein conjoncturel donc été encore plus fort chez nousque chez no voisins. de plus, l’atmosphère conjoncturelle s’effritant en europe, la suisse voyaitsa demande extérieure perdre rapidement du dynamisme.les raisons de cette réaction excessive du franc sont vraisemblablement doubles.d’une part, notre monnaie tendance à “surréagir” en ca de faiblesse du dollar; d’autre part, ladiscussion sur l’intégration monétaire en europe peut-être terni l’image du mark allemand etprovoqué le report sur le franc suisse de capitaux spéculatifs.2.2.l ’héritage de la surchauffe de années quatre-vingtle second facteur qui mi en difficulté l’économie suisse dans le annéesnonante été la gestion de l’héritage de années quatre-vingt. nous le savons maintenant, lerythme de croissance de l’économie suisse durant la seconde moitié de années quatre-vingt allaitau-delà de ce qui était soutenable en durée. avant même le krach boursier et le injection deliquidité qui lui furent liées, le crédits augmentaient à un rythme de 8 à 9%. de sign desurchauffe étaient apparus dans l’immobilier d’abord, dans l’ensemble de l’économie ensuite. lerecours aux ressources productives était excessif.la fin de la période inflationniste de années quatre-vingt entraîna d’importantsajustements structurels, notamment dans l’immobilier. de situation analogue ont pu êtreobservées en allemagne et en france, mais le phénomène avait pris chez nous une grandeampleur en raison du rôle du marché hypothécaire. l’assainissement du secteur immobilier, audébut de années nonante, pesé ainsi de manière toute particulière sur la demande globale ensuisse, non seulement sur la demande de construction, mais également sur la demande desménages, ceux-ci étant souvent confrontés à la nécessité de consacrer une part plus importanteque souhaitée de leur revenu disponible au service de leur dette hypothécaire ou de leur loyer.enfin, après de années de plein-emploi, voire de “suremploi”, la montée duchômage provoqué beaucoup d’inquiétude et d’insécurité dans le public. cette situationnouvelle forcément pesé négativement sur le climat de la consommation.bis review 45/1997 - 4 -2.3.la libéralisation du marché intérieurle troisième facteur qui influencé la conjoncture helvétique par rapport à cellede s voisins est la difficile libéralisation de notre marché intérieur.i1 ne fait pa de doute que le années de haute conjoncture avaient conduit à unecartellisation excessive du marché intérieur en suisse. le exemples ici sont multiples. avecl’isolement de notre pay face aux mouvements européens d’intégration, nous avon dû nousatteler nous-mêmes à la libéralisation de notre marché intérieur. le processus dedéréglementation est engagé. sur la courte période, ce vent nouveau de concurrence crée desincertitudes, laisse de trace en term de croissance et d’emploi. ici aussi, nous nous attaquonsà de problèmes que no voisins connaissent également. il est probable que la faible dimensionde notre marché intérieur, s cloisonnements culturels et politiques font de cette libéralisationun exercice particulièrement difficile.3.la politique monétaire 1990 -1997comment la banque nationale a-t-elle intégré cette situation économique dans sastratégie monétaire au cours de dernières années?comme je l’indiquais tout à l’heure, le début de années nonante correspondu àla fin d’une phase inflationniste. on l’a oublié aujourd’hui, mais en 1991 notre taux d’inflationavait franchi la barre de 6%. une certaine accélération de la hausse de prix s’était égalementmanifestée dans le pay qui nous entourent, mais le phénomène avait pris chez nous uneampleur inaccoutumée. même l’allemagne, qui vivait alors sa réunification, n’affichait pa destaux d’inflation aussi élevés. la politique monétaire de l’époque visait donc la restauration de lastabilité de prix, en suisse comme chez no voisins.le caractère restrictif de notre politique monétaire du début de années nonantepeut être illustré par le fait - et cela était inhabituel - que le taux d’intérêt à court terme dansnotre pay se situaient au niveau de taux allemands.la fin de la phase restrictive de la politique de la bns peut être située au milieude l’année 1992. l’inflation était encore de l’ordre de 4%, mais no projection nous indiquaientqu’un ralentissement graduel de la hausse de prix allait intervenir. par ailleurs, le tauxeuropéens, anormalement tirés vers le haut par le conséquences de la réunification allemande,ne nous paraissaient plus correspondre aux perspective de l’économie suisse.en 1992, la banque nationale été la première banque centrale de l’europecontinentale à baisser s taux d’intérêt. le différentiel de taux d’intérêt avec l’allemagne s’estrapidement creusé pour atteindre deux point de pourcentage douze mois plus tard. cettecorrection n’a toutefois pa pu corriger le tendances récessives qui existaient déjà chez nous etchez no voisins européens. comme je vous l’indiquais tout à l’heure, l’économie suisse entraiten récession au début de 1993 et cette situation dura durant la majeure partie de l’année.la bns aurait-elle pu assouplir sa politique plus tôt? cette question souvent étéévoquée dans le public. le jugements posteriori sont toujours dangereux car il se basentforcément sur une connaissance de choses qui n’était pa celle de décideurs de l’époque. jeconstate simplement que le franc était orienté à la baisse durant le premier mois de 1992, etque l’inflation se situait encore entre 4 et 5%, aussi je comprends que la banque nationale aitbis review 45/1997 - 5 -considéré que le moment n’était pa propice à donner de sign de relâchement monétaire. lerisque aurait été d’affaiblir le franc et de relancer une pression inflationniste qui était encore viveà ce moment-là.une fois la politique monétaire assouplie en suisse à la moitié de l’année 1992,un relâchement prudent est intervenu en france et en allemagne, je dis prudent car la décrue destaux dans ce pay s’est toujours située en retrait de ce qui se passait chez nous. parallèlement, lacroissance monétaire reprenait dans notre pays, si bien que de condition favorables à unereprise apparaissaient progressivement. pour 1994, une croissance de l’ordre de 1,5% étaitattendue par l’institut de prévision de l’epfz, avec une perspective d’accélération à 2% pour1995.le réveil conjoncturel eut bien lieu, non seulement chez nous, mais égalementchez no partenaires européens, mais il ne dura pas. de nouvelles difficultés surgirent. en février1994, la réserve fédérale américaine décida, après avoir maintenu longtemps une orientationexpansive à sa politique, de tirer à nouveau sur le rênes monétaires. en l’espace de douze mois,les taux à court terme sur l’eurodollar passaient ainsi de 3 à 6%, mettant un terme à la baisse destaux en europe. le taux long montèrent sur un large front et le dollar fléchit. le recul dudollar se poursuivit pendant deux ans, entraînant une appréciation de monnaies européennes,particulièrement du franc suisse qui toujours tendance à surréagir dans de pareillescirconstances.l’année 1994 joua donc un rôle crucial dans le déroulement de événementsconjoncturels de ce dernières années car elle vit une très forte détérioration de conditionsmonétaires en europe continentale. la reprise se fragilisa partout sans que le spécialistes s’enrendent compte; leurs prévisions conjoncturelles demeurant franchement optimistes. a la fin de1994, une accélération de la croissance était encore envisagée pour l’année suivante et uneconsolidation de ce mouvement en 1996. on le sait, le événements se déroulèrentdifféremment: le dollar continuum de fléchir; la suisse, comme s voisins, sombra une nouvellefois en récession. la banque nationale provoqua bien de nouvelles réductions de taux d’intérêtet un élargissement de l’écart entre le taux suisse et allemands, mais la croissance économiquedans notre pay se ralentit, puis stagna purement et simplement.au milieu de l’année dernière, il nous est apparu évident qu’un retournement desituation conjoncturel était improbable et que le risques déflationnistes augmentaient. c’estpour cette raison que nous avon donné un accent nouveau à notre politique monétaire,provoquant une baisse de taux d’intérêt sur le marché monétaire. parallèlement, le dollar, quiavait commencé à se redresser en début d’année, faisait un bond en avant sur le marché deschanges et le franc fléchissait par rapport aux monnaies européennes. dans leur ensemble, labaisse de taux d’intérêt en suisse et la baisse du franc ont corrigé le condition monétairespour le rendre plus favorables à la reprise conjoncturelle. mais une nouvelle fois nous nesommes pa seuls. une amélioration semblable du cadre monétaire est aussi intervenue chez nosvoisins allemands et français. au niveau du continent européen, le condition monétaires ontrarement été aussi bonnes pour assurer une reprise économique.bis review 45/1997 - 6 -4.le bout du tunnel?si tel est le cas, peut-on maintenant être optimiste? sommes-nous au bout dutunnel puisque chez no partenaires comme chez nous le ingrédients sont là pour permettre unredressement conjoncturel?je ne doute pa que, la machine économique européenne repartie, nous voyionsles choses rapidement bouger chez nous. no entreprises ont fait ce dernières années de effortsconsidérables d’ajustement afin de devenir plus compétitives, d’assurer la qualité de leur produitet de mieux répondre aux besoins de leurs clients. le mesures de restructuration qui ont étéprises - avec leur impact douloureux sur le chômage - révèlent leur prise de conscience et leurvolonté d’aller de l’avant. par ailleurs, il existe suffisamment de ressources disponibles pourqu’une réaction rapide de la production soit possible, et ceci sans pressions inflationnistes .je m’associe toutefois à ceux qui ne pensent pa que la reprise se manifestera en1997 avec vigueur. en effet, tout porte à croire que si l’environnement européen serum porteur,ses impulsion demeureront modestes.pourquoi?(a) en premier lieu, le problèmes de l’europe continentale - comme lieu deproduction - ne sont pa encore réglés. le term libéralisation, déréglementation,flexibilisation sont souvent évoqués, mais le ajustements sont loin d’avoir été pleinementopérés. un marché du travail plus efficace, de condition plus stimulantes pour ledéveloppement technologique et la création d’emplois sont le ax de développement surlesquels tous le européens doivent s’engager plus fermement. i1 est frappant de constater quedepuis le début de années nonante, l’europe occidentale détruit environ 4% de s place detravail alors que le etats-unis en ont gagné 8%. le condition monétaires seules n’expliquentpas le déclin de la compétitivité européenne. en arrière-plan se trouvent de facteurs plus lourdsde formation, de recherche, d’incitation à la création de valeur plutôt qu’à la gestion de l’acquis.ces problèmes sont difficiles à aborder car il sont de nature politique, économique et sociale.le débat sur ce sujets est largement engagé chez nous, il l’est aussi chez no voisins. mais nosdémocraties européennes ne progressent qu’avec peine dans ce terrain difficiles.(b) en second lieu, la probabilité est grande que nous observions, ce prochainsmois, un redressement de taux d’intérêt aux etats-unis. l’exemple de 1994 revient alors àl’esprit. si l’europe est entraînée dans un mouvement de hausse de taux alors que saconjoncture est encore fragile, le redressement pourrait être compromis ou, du moins, sedéployer à un rythme ralenti. au coeur du problème se situera bien entendu la position du dollar.si celui-ci reste orienté à la hausse, le condition de la reprise resteront favorables. si un nouvelaccident devait intervenir, une hypothèque supplémentaire - bien lourde celle-là - pèserait sur lecycle européen, donc sur notre pays.(c) enfin, il faut craindre que le incertitude qui entourent le projet d’unificationmonétaire pèsent encore sur le décisions de entrepreneurs, voire créent un biais restrictif dansle cours de la politique monétaire européenne, avant tout allemande et française. peut-onimaginer - avec de marchés continuellement à l’affût de ce qui pourrait être un signebis review 45/1997 - 7 -avant-coureur de la qualité future de l’euro - que le autorités monétaires européennes prennentle moindre risque en matière d’expansion monétaire? je ne le pense pas.il faut toutefois souligner un point positif: l’incertitude européenne sembleprofiter avant tout au dollar américain. il se peut donc que la situation de dollar fort que nousconnaissons maintenant se maintienne au cours de prochains mois, ce qui fait égalementpenser que le franc suisse ne serum pa forcément au coeur de la tourmente si le processusd’intégration monétaire européenne devait connaître de difficultés.5.les enseignementsquels enseignements devons-nous tirer de ce survol de la politique monétaire desdernières années?5.1.la suisse: un pay d’europe continentalele premier enseignement est une évidence, la situation conjoncturelle de la suissedépend étroitement de ce qui se passe à l’étranger, notamment dans le pay qui nous entourent.c’est là que se trouvent no premier marchés d’exportation. depuis le début de annéesnonante, tous no retournements conjoncturels ont coïncidé avec ceux de no grand voisins.c’est une illusion de penser que nous disposons de moyens de nous dégager de cetenvironnement pour vivre à notre propre rythme économique. je crois que ceux qui songentsurestiment notre marge de manoeuvre et aussi notre capacité de mettre correctement en coursnos instrument de politique macro-économique.la réalité semble tout autre: la suisse est une économie dont la structure, lesressources, le orientation sont proches de autres économies du continent. nous avon bienentendu no spécificités, mais plus de point nous lient que nous séparent de no voisins.je tire tout naturellement une conclusion intermédiaire de cette constatation: notreambition dans le domaine macro-économique ne doit pa être de vouloir donner à la suisse unautre destin conjoncturel que celui de l’europe, mais d’essayer de la placer au mieux dans lesillage du grand navire qu’est l’économie d’europe continentale.5.2.la nécessaire autonomie monétairele deuxième enseignement se réfère à la politique monétaire: pour tenter de tirerle meilleur parti de notre situation dans la mouvance de l’économie de no voisins, nous devonschercher à jouer le plus souvent possible la carte de notre autonomie monétaire. cetteconclusion, un peu surprenante étant donné notre intégration économique, vient du fait que, auxyeux de marchés, le franc suisse n’est pa perçu comme une monnaie européenne typique. lesréactions du franc aux variation du dollar sont plus exacerbées que celles du dm ou du francfrançais. i1 en résulte une volatilité qui peut entraver l’activité économique, peser sur laconjoncture.a première vue, pourrait penser que si tel est le cas, ce n’est pa l’autonomiemonétaire, mais bien plus l’alignement qui serait la réponse stratégique appropriée. je ne lepense pas. tant que la suisse ne fera pa partie de institution européennes, le franc suissebis review 45/1997 - 8 -continuera d’être considéré comme un élément particulier sur le marché. dans ce cas,l’alignement de notre politique monétaire sur celle de l’europe - aujourd’hui celle de labundesbank, demain celle de la banque centrale européenne - nous priverait de no possibilitésde réactions en ca de perturbation de marchés. l’autonomie monétaire paraît donc être labonne stratégie tant que l’intégration économique et politique de la suisse en europe n’est pasdéfinitive.5.3.apprécier le condition monétaires élargiesle troisième enseignement se rapporte à la stratégie monétaire. dans un paysplacé aussi fortement sou l’influence de humeurs de marchés de change que le nôtre, lapolitique monétaire ne peut être rigide mais doit essayer de tenir compte. au mieux, desdifférents type de choc auxquels il est soumis. un certain dogmatisme est évidemmentnécessaire. pour le banquiers centraux, le lien entre l’évolution tendancielle de la liquidité et leniveau général de prix est une relation fondamentale qu’ils ne peuvent pa perdre de vue sur ladurée. mais dans la conduite de opérations de court terme, ce que l’on appelle le “conditionsmonétaires”, c’est-à-dire un juste équilibre entre le condition de taux d’intérêt et de cours dechange, se révèlent être un guide opérationnel utile. dans notre cas, c’est bien dans le butd’améliorer ce “conditions monétaires” que nous avon relâché notre politique au milieu del’année dernière. je ne vous cacherai pa que ce relâchement est allé au-delà de ce que nousattendions car nous avon bénéficié également d’une phase de redressement du dollar. si latendance du dollar avait été différente, notre action n’aurait certainement pa produit de effetscomparables.5.4.disposer de structure efficacesle dernier enseignement que je tire de événements conjoncturels de ce dernièresannées est que, dans l’incertitude financière et monétaire qui caractérise l’europe d’aujourd’huiet qui continuera de la caractériser dans le années à venir, nous devon absolument jouer à bonescient le carte “structurelles” que nous avon dans notre jeu. l’environnement international trop contraignant pour que nous puissions nous permettre de ne pa créer sur le plan interneun cadre conduisant à une gestion efficace de no ressources. je sors ici évidemment de lapolitique monétaire pour rappeler l’importance essentielle de no effort en matière deformation, de recherche, d’intégration de l’innovation dans le processus de production, maisaussi de flexibilisation de conditions-cadre au niveau du marché du travail et de la créationd’entreprises.6.conclusionpolitique monétaire et reprise: où en sommes-nous?au cours de derniers mois, d’importants point positifs sont apparus, qui fontespérer un réchauffement prochain de l’activité économique. la baisse de taux d’intérêt, lacorrection du franc et de monnaies d’europe continentale face au dollar ont créé desconditions-cadre propices au développement de l’activité économique. par ailleurs, le fait que lapolitique monétaire soit expansive depuis près de deux ans, que de effort considérables aientété consentis en matière de restructuration d’entreprise, nous incite à un certain optimisme.bis review 45/1997 - 9 -mais, j’ai essayé de vous le montrer, notre destin économique dépend étroitementde celui de no voisins européens. ce pays, comme le nôtre, sortent d’une période de croissanceinsuffisante, marquée par une augmentation du chômage et par une morosité ambiante. chez euxaussi, l’atmosphère est plus à la délocalisation qu’à l’investissement. nous connaissons desproblèmes conjoncturels et structurels analogue aux leurs.ce qui nous sépare de no voisins, c’est notre relative ouverture vers le monde, ladensité de notre production dans de secteurs de pointe, mais aussi notre absence du processuseuropéen d’intégration économique et monétaire. dans de nombreux cas, nous devon relever,de no propres forces, le défis qu’ils affrontent ensemble. c’est peut-être une chance, mais lesobjectifs à atteindre sont très ambitieux; il réclament tout no énergies.sans aucun doute - nous le sentons déjà maintenant -, la conjoncture seréchauffera et s’améliorera ce prochains mois. il faut s’en réjouir, mais ne pa crier victoire. nenous laissons pa bercer d’illusion. la suisse ne retrouvera un sentier de croissance durable etpourra résorber son chômage que si elle est capable de préserver s avantages et mêmeaugmenter s attraits. cela lui demandera non seulement de bonnes condition monétaires - surla durée, la stabilité de prix -, mais également de ajustements en profondeur de s structureset, au-delà, peut-être une nouvelle manière de gérer s affaires.* * *nb

morning, i would like highlight recentdevelopments foreign exchange market share view, central banker,of drive trend we’ve observing. we hear lot talk theforeign exchange market 1996 “end volatility.” a market performance ofthe last week demonstrated, commentary bite exaggerated. however, evenwith spike volatility we’ve see recent weeks, question havewitnessed remarkable period relative stability foreign exchange rate past sixquarters so.what account relative stability foreign exchange market since late1995? economic fundamental certainly one factor -- period relative pricestability major world economies, general absence severe market shocks.however, i would argue we’ve observe also, part, by-product ofcontinuously great transparency characterize foreign exchange market thepast several years. moreover, i convince increase transparency foreignexchange market beneficial: foreign exchange community, financial market ingeneral, global economy whole.before explain i mean great transparency i believe sobeneficial, i would like take quick look record itself. be talk decliningvolatility reflect hard evidence? yes, largely is. thirty-day dollar-mark dollar-yenhistorical volatility remain 10 percent throughout 1996 first quarter of1997, and, even price action saw may, spike thirty-day historical volatilitywe’ve observe particularly dramatic compare similar period past

constantly evolving. none u cansay certainty whether we’re observe begin trend anomalous periodbis review 60/1997 - 2 -that ultimately view brief lull volatility. however, i don’t think many youwould disagree i say foreign exchange market past six quartersor change significantly 1994 1992. for who, like me, wereinvolved business 1970s 1980s follow collapse bretton woodssystem, contrast dramatic.given realities, must ask change alter wayforeign exchange rate fluctuate global marketplace? it obvious case ofdeclining volume. the foreign exchange survey recently publish bank forinternational settlement 1996 show daily volume foreign exchange grow almost50 percent 1992 1995, reason think anything changedsince alter trend.what changed, however, new, high level transparency hasbeen introduce recent year foreign exchange market. when i speak transparency,i actually refer combination several factors. broadly speaking, i definetransparency market degree participant equal simultaneousaccess input necessary price asset associate risk accurately. by reducingguesswork uncertainty, transparency help smooth price adjustment eliminate someof shock result market participant discover “priced in”assumptions inaccurate. in view, current move toward great markettransparency reflect four broad categories: policy, information, pricing, riskmanagement.the increase transparency central bank policy -- product ofdeliberate step take policymakers -- important aspect move toward moretransparent overall market condition we’ve observing. over past several years,central bank number countries, notably canada, new zealand, australia, theunited kingdom, become increasingly convince value make publiccommitment articulate transparent policy standard, usually price stability. by settingclear policy objectives, maker monetary policy eliminate much guesswork thatcentral bank watcher must engage figure central bank next. in sodoing, help anchor inflation expectation long term, thereby fostereconomic growth ensure stable price environment.many central bank also increasingly come realize much thesecrecy cautious signal characterize monetary policy decision is, someextent, counterproductive. in recent years, number central bank take measure tofurther open policy process public. for example, prior february 1994,changes monetary policy unite state signal market openmarket operations. since time, federal reserve publicly announce change inpolicy, typically follow meet federal open market committee, fomc.some policymakers concern shift procedure communicate policydecisions might create additional market volatility. in fact, recent study mycolleagues federal reserve bank st. louis find opposite -- announcingpolicy change lead increase volatility federal fund rate. by makinginformation monetary policy decision available quickly broadly, federalreserve help level play field and, i believe, contribute smooth processby new information fomc policy incorporate quickly efficiently assetprices.bis review 60/1997 - 3 -other central bank similarly increase transparency monetarypolicy processes. one example bank england’s move publish minute themonthly policy meet chancellor bank england governor, practicethat continue new monetary policy council. the bank canada, too, takensteps increase level transparency markets. it publish semiannualmonetary policy report set explicit level bank rate.national government also contribute great transparency monetarypolicy increasingly recognize value endow central bank greaterindependence. move sort occur several western european country andmany emerge market economies, especially latin america, past several years.a second area recent development result improve transparencyin foreign exchange market information technology. easy inexpensive access vastarray information change way financial market absorb new data. most u thisroom sit office trade room keyboard access data, analysis, news oncetook huge resource manage. and, neither banker trader monopoly thiscapacity -- corporate treasurer institutional investor pull screenswe can. at one time, presence local market access early newspaper could provide atrading advantage large market maker. today, news market availableelectronically worldwide almost lag. information cheap easy come thanever before. the result? a global market react quickly efficiently new data, andparticipants time analyze information need spend le timegathering it. one consequence improve transparency information technology thatinformation get reflect asset price quickly smoothly ever before.a closely relate development also contribute increase transparencyin foreign exchange market rapid evolution price discovery process thepast several years. electronic brokerage electronic interbank deal system evolvedthat smooth dissemination current price improve market liquidity. whereastruly competitive price province large market makers, smallerinterbank dealer -- even foreign exchange end-users -- also access tonarrow bid-ask spreads. the result far deep market and, again, levelplaying field market participants, price long dominate largeplayers.the final area recent innovation improve market transparency isrisk management. while far able rest laurels, deny thefact financial institutions, customers, investor become moresophisticated past several year evaluating, monitoring, control market risk.if market participant good understand risk position put books, aremore able react effectively efficiently assumption challenge unwound.although crucial rapid innovation trade risk management practice continue,most institution represent already make important progress along linesin recent years.what need stressed, however, enough firm todevelop - internal purpose alone -- sophisticate new technique assess, price, andmanage increasingly refine component financial risk. if financial market functionmost efficiently, shareholders, creditors, counterparties firm also must able tobis review 60/1997 - 4 -assess risk make evaluations. in order this, meaningfulinformation risk risk management performance must available.the federal reserve bank new york actively involve inencouraging evolution disclosure practice improve function financialmarkets. a may know, peter fisher, executive vice president new york fed,chaired work group euro-currency stand committee g-10 central banks,which publish discussion paper “public disclosure market credit risk byfinancial intermediaries” september 1994. this so-called fisher report describe tradingand financial risk management practice develop far beyond public disclosure offinancial information, create gap precision firm’s managementcould ass adjust firm’s risk exposure information available outsidersto help ass riskiness firm’s activities.recognizing asymmetry available information could cause themisallocation capital among firm amplify market disturbances, fisher reportrecommended financial intermediary -- regulate unregulated -- move thedirection publicly disclose periodic quantitative information. the information requestedwould provide

risk managementactivities.by large, propose measure report risk adoptedvoluntarily many major bank institution around world, many others move inthat direction. a such, contribute importantly improve transparency financialmarkets.the federal reserve bank new york also deeply involve effortsto reduce foreign exchange settlement risk -- effort serve improve marketefficiency overall financial stability. in october 1994, new york fed-sponsored foreignexchange committee issue major report “reducing foreign exchange settlement risk.”the bank also work actively area central bank g-10central

manage, control, net bilateral settlement exposures, theyplan push effort even next year. while encouragingbeginning, can’t ignore fact work must do individual banks. with thisin mind, cps continue closely monitor progress next year sign ofslippage.bis review 60/1997 - 5 -the search individual bank efficient way reduce foreignexchange settlement risk bring important progress industry-group level aswell. the allsopp report note effort fxnet, s.w.i.f.t, echo, multinet, thegroup 20 bank offer various type risk-reducing services, ongoing effort arevery encouraging. some bank also explore elimination settlement risk altogether byshifting market trade simply settle gain loss associate exchange ratemovements -- call “contracts difference” -- instead require delivery underlyingcurrencies.we well aware many market participant currently debate whatconstitutes efficient multi-currency net settlement services. while bepotential winner losers, i believe market whole ultimately benefit fromthis rigorous competition. at time, settlement risk reduction use tojustify concentration market power. the g-10 central bank governor long onrecord favor fair open access service permit participation broad range ofinstitutions, consistent prudent management risk. such access formally adoptedas requirement multilateral net systems, i convince g-10 central bankswould apply similar standard evaluate start-up major multi-currencysettlement service.in sum, evolution toward transparent foreign exchange market thatwe’ve observe past several year largely product technological progress inthe private sector conscious policy decision public sector. none policydecisions, i stress, take explicit implicit intention reduce marketvolatility. on contrary, policy community view move toward increasedtransparency desirable end number reasons.for one, transparency promote level play field marketparticipants. in words, transparent market tend dominate

uncertainty hence excessivevolatility rates. i would stress, particular, uncertainty future course ofmonetary fiscal policies, make difficult financial market cope themacroeconomic pressure day.what force i talk about? in 1970s, two oil shocks, one atthe begin one end decade. these may precipitate politicaldevelopments middle east, initial shock encourage pursuit, among themajor industrial

earlierperiods, observe trend explain different cyclical position ofcountries, different monetary fiscal responses, change world commodityprices.exchange rate movement have, times, appear contribute tradeimbalances exacerbate exist ones. but interpret evidence thatmarkets push rate wrong direction. indeed, imbalance often reflect fact thateconomies different point business cycle. for example, japan has, veryrecently, see value currency decline, balance, u.s. dollar, even thoughthe country run large grow trade surplus. it obvious much recentmovement u.s. dollar/yen exchange rate drive

canadian dollar stronger? the explanation liesmainly different cyclical position canadian u.s. economies. the moreaccommodative monetary condition pursue canada past two year beenconsistent need economy characterize considerable excess capacity aninflation rate tend low half current 1 3 per cent target range.thus, low interest rate relatively low canadian dollar temporarilyappropriate economic reasons.while central bank ever wish weak currency, since late 1995, thebank canada encourage easy monetary condition -- condition that, times, havetaken form low interest rate somewhat soft

credit small business. the part play bank small business finance anew topic federal reserve. in fact, many year devote substantialresources collect analyze data small business finance generally, creditsupplied bank particular. we collect data small business obtainfinancing -- case fail obtain finance -- use national survey smallbusiness finance survey consumer finances. we also gather information directly onthe small business credit extend individual commercial banks. we collectedinformation contract term bank loan small large business since 1977through survey term bank lend

small firms. small business rely bank areliable supply credit, transaction deposit service well. because needsfor bank service asset liability side balance sheets, small businessestypically enter relationship nearby banks. the data show, example, 85 percentof small business use service commercial bank within 30 mile firm, thatsmall business typically obtain multiple different service local

relationship, use information help make price creditdecisions. the financial condition small firm usually rather opaque investors, thecosts issue security directly public prohibitive small firms. thus,without financial intermediary like bank would simply costly investor tolearn information need provide credit, costly small firm issue thecredit itself. banks, perform classic function financial intermediaries, solve theseproblems produce information borrower monitor time, settingloan contract term improve borrower incentives, renegotiate term theborrower financial difficulty, diversify risk across many small businesscredits.some recent empirical research suggest characterization thebank-small business borrower relationship accurate. for example, relationship matures,banks typically reduce interest rate charge often drop collateral requirement onsmall business loans. in short, bank-borrower relationship appear efficient meansfor overcome information cost problem small firm finance, allowingfundamentally creditworthy small firm finance sound project might otherwise gounfunded.one implication importance bank-small business relationship thatit may impose limit migration small business finance bank sector. overthe last two decades, many large business loan leave bank sector improvement ininformation technology, increase use statistical technique apply finance, theglobalization financial market allow nonbank foreign bank competitor gainmarket share u.s. banks. for example, 1980s first half 1990s, shareof total u.s. nonfarm, nonfinancial corporate debt hold u.s. bank fell one-quarterfrom 19.6 percent 14.5 percent. bank compensate somewhat on-balance sheetreductions variety ways. many bank expand participation off-balance sheetback-up line credit, standby

smallbusiness lend proceed rather slowly present, may accelerate future.improvements analytical information technology credit score may decreasethe cost lend small business make easy nonbank lender enter thismarket. these development already contribute competition small businessloans within bank industry bank nonbank lenders. similarly, asignificant secondary market securitization loan small business may develop inthe future. those small business among current bank borrower whose information problemsare least severe -- is, least informationally opaque -- would presumablybe likely fund outside bank system.nevertheless, matter many advance information processingand matter sophisticate financial market may become, likely remain asignificant role bank-borrower relationship lend solve information otherbis review 57/1997 - 3 -financing problem small businesses. that is, foreseeable future seem likelythat remain many small business borrower sufficient problem bankinformation gathering, monitoring, finance overcome, although group ofborrowers almost surely differ somewhat current relationship borrowers. astechnology market improve point relatively transparent small businessborrowers finance outside bank, other, opaque potential borrower thatpreviously information problem serious even bank loan enter thebank intermediation process. put another way, relationship lend process fund smallbusiness borrower increasingly difficult information problem technology forresolving problem improves. in view, increase efficiency thecompetitiveness small business finance. for example, improve ability bank lend tomore opaque borrower provide increase competition venture capitalistsand angel financier discuss conference yesterday.the value gather information relationship bank andsmall business also bode well survival small community-based bank tend tospecialize relationships. most forecast future u.s. bank industry predictthat thousand small bank survive. i hasten point personalforecasts. i stick predict interest rates, gdp growth, inflation -- item ihave control inside information -- i leave bank forecast others! but theforecast thousand small bank continue operate well make sense me. theyhave information advantages, knowhow, local community orientation hard toduplicate large organizations.the importance relationship lend small business also raise prudentialconcerns bank risk taking. when bank fails, loss society exceed book valuesinvolved loss value bank’s customer relationships. even smallbusiness borrower able find finance bank fails, may high interestrate additional collateral requirement new bank chance learnabout borrower’s condition prospects. when many bank fail crisis, cancreate credit crunch significant reduction supply credit bank-dependent smallbusiness borrowers. for example, research great depression suggest loss ofbank-borrower relationship 1930s may deepen prolong economicdownturn. more recently, appear weak capital

alternative source fund isconsiderably great today 1930s, likely even great future itwas early 1990s, argument reinforce importance connection betweenmacroeconomic bank supervisory policy.financial modernization bank small business lendingin remainder remarks, i touch three additional concern aboutthe potential effect financial modernization supply bank credit small business. iwill first discus effect increase market concentration create bank merger andacquisitions within local market; second, effect consolidation bank industry asa whole; third, possible impact increase complexity financial service firm inwhich bank organization may provide multitude traditional bank andnonbanking services.bis review 57/1997 - 4 -at outset, i would emphasize override public policy concernregarding issue quantity small business lending, rather economicefficiency. if bank issue loan finance negative net present value projects, thensuch loan discouraged. if consolidation bank industry increasedcomplexity financial service firm reduce lending, economic efficiency ispromoted free resource invest elsewhere, even though supply ofsmall business credit borrower reduced. similarly, lack competition poorcorporate control may currently keep positive net present value loan beingmade. if modernization increase supply loan creditworthy small business borrowersto pursue financially sound projects, economic efficiency also raise supply ofcredit small business rises.antitrust analysis bank typically base concentration ofbank deposit local market like metropolitan statistical area (msas) non-msa ruralcounties. under traditional “cluster approach,” small business loan product areassumed competitive approximately basis bank deposit local markets.while on-going technological institutional change seem likely erode usefulness ofthis assumption time, evidence continue generally support assumption. a i notedearlier, small business typically get loan financial service local bank.additional research find concentration local bank market key determinantof rate charge small business loans. for example, estimate smallbusiness borrower concentrate market pay rate 50 150 basis pointshigher least concentrate markets. this exceed estimate effect localmarket concentration retail deposit rate 50 basis points.research also suggest high local-market deposit concentration maylead reduce managerial efficiency, price cushion provide market power allow a“quiet life” manager relatively little effort require profitable. manager inthese concentrate market may choose work le hard pursue personal interestsbecause low rate deposit high rate small business loan raise profit enoughto cover inefficient self-serving practices.these find support need maintain competition local bank marketsto deter exercise market power price consumer deposit small business loans, andto ensure local bank sufficient competitive pressure operate areasonably efficient way.when bank merger acquisition involve bank operate different localmarkets, issue raise typically quite different i discussed. since thelate 1970s, state liberalize law previously restrict merger acquisitionsbetween bank different local markets, include allow hold company acquisitionsacross state lines. the u.s. bank industry respond strongly consolidatingat rapid rate last 15 years. consolidation pick even first half ofthe 1990s -- year bank merger involve 20 percent industry assets. thistrend likely continue accelerate riegle-neal act, already allowedincreased interstate banking, allow interstate branch almost state thissummer.importantly, increase local market concentration major issue mostof merger acquisitions, primarily market-extension type. a such,these consolidations, sometimes merely threat actions, may pro-competitivebis review 57/1997 - 5 -and reduce market power local bank depositor small business borrower themarkets invaded. they may also improve diversification efficiency theconsolidating institutions. research generally suggest merger acquisitions, byimproving diversification, allow consolidate institution make loan improvetheir profit efficiency.mostly result merger acquisitions, mean size bankingorganizations approximately double real term last 15 years. a i mentionedearlier, frequently voice concern consolidation whether supply credit tosmall business may decreased, since large bank institution tend devote smallerproportions asset small business lending. to illustrate, bank $100 millionin asset devote 9 percent asset small business lend average, whereasbanks $10 billion asset invest 2 percent asset loans.while simplistic analysis may sound appeal surface, clearlyincomplete. it neglect fundamental nature merger acquisition dynamic eventsthat may involve significant change business focus consolidate institutions. thatis, bank get involve merger acquisition want something different,not simply behave like large bank.the simplistic comparison lend pattern large small bank alsoignores reaction lender local markets. other exist even new localbanks nonbank lender might pick profitable loan long supply theconsolidated bank institutions. these institution may also react m&as theirown dynamic change focus could either increase decrease supply smallbusiness loans. thus, even merge institution reduce supply small businessloans substantially, total supply loan local market need decline.there number recent study dynamic effect bankmergers acquisitions, hear morning. the result suggest thatthe dynamic effect merger acquisition much complex heterogenous thanwould suggest increase size consolidate institution alone. for example,mergers small medium-sized bank appear associate increase smallbusiness lend merge banks, whereas merger large bank may associate withdecreases small business lend participants.on average, merger appear reduce small business lend participants,but decline appear offset part whole increase lend banksin local market. these bank may pick profitable loan drop bymerging institutions, otherwise dynamic reaction increase supply smallbusiness lending. moreover, result include potential increase lend bynonbank firms. the bottom line small business loan market seem work quite well.creditworthy borrower financially sound project seem receive financing, although theysometimes bear short-term switch costs, temporarily high loan rate andcollateral requirements, change bank institution merge. on-going technologicalchange small business lend help improve efficiency process.again, i would emphasize quantity small business loanssupplied important, rather economic efficiency marketchooses small business receive credit. to extent merger acquisition arepro-competitive improve corporate control efficiency, supply credit somebis review 57/1997 - 6 -borrowers negative net present value project may reduced, be. that is, theprotection competition provide interstate intrastate barrier may allowedsome firm market power inefficient make uneconomic loans. similarly, anyimprovement competition efficiency may increase supply credit borrower withpositive net present value project inefficient lender previously fund. in either ofthese cases, economic efficiency improved.as promised, final issue i discus aspect modernization offinancial market financial service firm likely become complex, providingmore type financial service within organization. at present time, notknow glass-steagall act repealed, whether nontraditional activity willbe provide bank subsidiary bank hold company affiliates, activitiesbanking organization allow engage choose engage. however, similar thearguments regard consolidation bank industry, concern sometimes express thatsmall business borrower may receive le credit larger, complex financialinstitutions.there much le research evidence available regard potential effect onsmall business lend type financial modernization theconsolidation bank industry, remark substantially speculative.however, i believe several reason optimism regard adequate supply ofservices creditworthy small businesses. first, limit amount research suggest thereis little effect current organizational complexity u.s. bank treatment ofsmall businesses, thing equal. in particular, bank organization multiple layer ofmanagement, operate multiple states, section 20 security affiliates, andthose organizational complexity tend charge much small businesscredit bank size. second, research result consolidation ofbanks alone suggest profitable loan drop new universal-like banks, othersmall bank nonbank firm stand pick loans. finally, additionalinsurance, security underwriting, financial service provide new institutionsshould provide great opportunity small business access nontraditionalservices.i want leave time questions, let conclude summarycomments. it gratify see attention pay finance smallbusiness, vital part economy, federal reserve work actively tostay abreast issue data collection research efforts. small business tend torely bank credit need financial services, relationship banksand small business important efficient mean distribute services. whiletechnological institutional change undoubtedly future affect theserelationships, seem unlikely core bank-small business relationship replaced.the continue heavy dependence small business local bank also suggest on-goingneed bank supervisor sensitive antitrust issue consider merger andacquisitions bank local market. in contrast, cross-market merger rarely raiseantitrust concerns; indeed, merger quite pro-competitive. finally, someobservers argue bank consolidation aspect modernization thebanking industry financial market raise concern supply credit smallbusiness,

that:hong kong shall retain status international financial centre. thegovernment hong kong shall responsible monetary policy practice hong kongand regulation financial market institutions. there shall

framework apply practice. i think anumber good reason believe be. in first place, institutionalarrangements hong kong put financial sector provision basic law practice.in particular, hong kong monetary authority, i represent, legal powers,monetary instrument financial resource - include us$ 63 billion foreign currencyreserves - fulfill role central bank hong kong maintain value hkdollar. during four year existence, hkma build good workingrelationship people’s bank china make clear public nottake role monetary authority hong kong 1997. the separate role forhong kong 1997 underscore

hong kong political risk largely seem havedisappeared issue. we see exodus bank hong kong; rather, haveseen increase appetite among foreign bank take long-term hk dollar assets,including residential

standardswe anticipate radical change hong kong’s system bankingsupervision 1997, attitude entry foreign banks. no doubt, however, thesewill evolve line trend global regulation. this reflect guide principle oursupervision hong kong follow international standards. there number ofpractical reason want so. first, keep hong kong’s role aninternational financial centre. reputable foreign bank want business marketwhere rule game familiar credible. their home supervisor certainly feelthe way. there thus absolutely advantage centre hong kong competeon laxity market place dubious transaction conduct andconcealed. second, try enforce new supervisory guideline rule localbanks, one first question ask do elsewhere. it thus veryhelpful able point relevant international standard order confer legitimacy onwhat try achieve.of course, presuppose international standard relevant individualcountries territories. the basle committee bank supervision play major rolein set standard relevance. in particular, basle capital adequacy ratio,which still call “cooke ratio” part asia deference chairman today,has become de facto capital standard supervisory system around world despitethe fact originally intend apply internationally active banks. despite thisenormous achievement, however, argue subsequent work committeedid become somewhat narrowly focus issue principal interest

dominate inrecent year formulation recommendation extend capital adequacy regime tocover market risk arise trade derivative financial instruments. i amnot deny capital regime cover market risk necessary, particularly thosecountries like unite state whose bank heavily involve trade activities. we areintending introduce regime hong kong end year, number ofcountries asian region intend same. however, largely tobe see adhere international standards, rather bank runningsubstantial trade risks. even hong kong, fifth large foreign exchangebis review 55/1997 - 3 -market world seventh large

encourage fact basle committee recently intensify itsefforts reach beyond g-10 country take proactive leadership role inhelping strengthen bank supervision countries. in particular, recently

asiathese initiative supplement asia regional cooperation botha bilateral multilateral basis. there number factor drive this. theaftermath mexican crisis january 1995, saw speculative attack number ofasian currencies, encourage view need country region tostrengthen defence area. we thus see arrangement interlockingseries bilateral repo agreement use u treasury asian central banks, includingthe hong kong monetary authority. these agreement intend provide additionalliquidity exchange rate stability purposes.more generally, also perhaps feel among asian countriesthat exist arrangement central bank cooperation somewhat “euro-centric” anddid take adequate account grow importance asian region 40% ofthe world’s foreign currency reserve held. this feel extent beenaddressed participative approach adopt basle committee andthe bis. but nonetheless view great regional cooperation among asian centralbanks necessary desirable. this sum concept “asianbis”, though somewhat mislead immediate plan move towards thebis review 55/1997 - 4 -institutional structure name would imply. rather, current emphasis onpromoting informal group central bank call emeap (“executives’ meet eastasia pacific central banks) explore opportunity cooperation area suchas payment systems, reserve management bank supervision. among things, thismay provide opportunity time develop distinctive focus regional voiceon international supervisory issues.consolidated supervisioni return topic i raise begin speech, whichis view consolidate supervision receive end. i suppose go withoutsaying favour concept consolidate supervision. a internationalfinancial centre, vulnerable adverse development bank abroad rely heavilyon consolidate supervision supervisor banks. the ability conductconsolidated supervision key factor whether regard home supervision aparticular bank adequate - one criterion grant bank licence hongkong. within legal framework hong kong try cooperate overseas regulator toensure

host supervisor. a mention above, core principle effective bankingsupervision provide useful checklist respect, still problem ofwhether principle effectively implemented. a active monitor role

review 53/1997prudent, conservative assumption rather wishful think - iron-clad limit togrowth short-term “targets”.there number reason make sense specify particularnumber “speed limit” come year. among reason following:(a) even clear idea long-term average rate growth, economycan clearly grow fast take excess capacity. this wouldbe case come year growth bite soft side (aswas 1996, example) inflation well contained.(b) it possible “fine-tune” economy grow rate want thespace one year. neither forecast accuracy, monetary policy process,permits degree accuracy. even good economic policy,

direction.i hope i make clear regard economic growth excessivebecause breach particular figure - say, 3½ per cent. we would regard excessive ifit push wage price way would cause medium-term target beexceeded. obviously, fast growth particular period, thing equal, thehigher risk problem becomes. but have, sensible have, adoctrinaire view particular growth threshold which, breached, assume

critical challenge isto develop approach implement umbrella supervision effective limitingsystemic risk without distort economic incentive unduly burdensome bankingorganizations.innovation, uncertainty, bank supervisionif history guide, market innovation -- without supportinglegislation -- continue stimulate financial modernization. a process unfolds, canexpect bank organization

uncertainty inherent creative process, nathan rosenberg ofstanford suggest even innovation’s technical feasibility clearlyestablished, ultimate effect society often highly unpredictable. he note least

future path ofinnovation, effect new regulation may innovation. there several aspect tothis interaction government policy market innovation. first, bankingorganizations may develop new product innovation exploit regulatory “loopholes”, orbis review 50/1997 - 6 -they may decline develop new product whose likely regulatory treatment view asburdensome unclear. another unintended consequence policy action may establish aninappropriate unofficial government standard certain activity conducted. incontrast government standards, extremely difficult change, privatesector adopt standard subsequently become outmoded, market force generally beexpected remedy situation.the history retail electronic payment provide useful illustration. in the1970s, many herald advent “cashless society”,

concentration risk evolve rapidlythat regulatory standard would quickly become outmode or, worse, inhibit private marketinnovations. largely reasons, ultimately choose address relationship betweenthese risk capital adequacy supervisory process.i believe many cases, policymakers reduce potential distortion bystructuring policy “incentive-compatible” -- is, work with, rather thanaround, profit-maximizing goal investor firm managers. in light underlyinguncertainties illustrate early examples, i readily acknowledge often easy saidthan done. nevertheless, i believe useful guide

regulation.today, become possible, judicious use derivative instruments, financialfirm engage primarily one kind financial activity mimic risk return otherfinancial activity. banking, investment banking, insurance long viewed, arisk-return perspective, separate distinct line business. to cite one example, bank areprohibited underwrite insurance, yet write put option -- form derivative activityengaged widely large bank -- is, economic substance, form insurance underwriting.other derivative markets, include emerge credit derivative instruments, permit bank todiversify credit market risk permit merge investment banksor insurance companies. thus, long-sought-after economic benefit result therepeal legislative barrier among different “types” financial firm already beenachieved creativity marketplace. nevertheless, able engage directlyin impermissible activity, bank company cannot achieve production marketingsynergies, therefore cost reductions, may flow joint operation may benefita bank’s shareholder well customers.in addition action marketplace, bank regulator acted, within theconstraints statute, facilitate economic combination bank nonbanking financialactivities. specifically, federal reserve adopt liberalization section 20 activitiesand expedite procedure process application regulation y. the occ, meanwhile, hasbis review 49/1997 - 2 -generated controversy liberalize banks’ insurance agency power well proceduresgenerally establish operate subsidiary national bank may engage activity notpermitted bank.this say financial reform legislation marginal benefit.clearly, addition benefit low costs, much remain accomplish form ofimproved management efficiency. these benefits, accrue bank generalpublic, probably maximize within context clear legislative authority forcombining financial firm various types. we must careful, however, effort achieve thebenefits financial reform, violate tenet good public policy. in regard, federalreserve belief financial reform consistent four basic objectives:(1) continue safety soundness bank system; (2) limit systemic risk;(3) contribute macroeconomic stability; (4) limit spread moral hazard andthe subsidy implicit federal safety net. i spend good deal time late fourthobjective. therefore, today i concentrate first three how, particular, financialreform must careful preserve role state-chartered bank meet economy’smacroeconomic objective concern regard systemic risk.the importance state-chartered banksome erroneously dismiss state-chartered bank represent down-scaleend bank market and, therefore, particularly worthy careful policyconsideration. state-chartered bank indeed small average national banks, aredisproportionately represent within small size class. nevertheless, state-chartered banksaccount third superregionals, mention state bank among thevery large money center institutions. even preponderance small, state-chartered banks,however, play critical role within financial system, several reasons.first, large number community-sized banks, state-chartered ornational banks, major contribution stability bank system well-being themacroeconomy. just highly diversify loan portfolio reduce risk individual bank, amore highly diversify bank structure reduce risk bank system whole. indeed, ourdecentralized diverse bank structure arguably key weather financial crisis ofthe late 1980s. during dark days, system able absorb thousand u.s.bank failures. and yet are, le decade later, loan loss reserve bank capitalat high level almost half century, insurance fund restore maximumcoverage ratio -- without cost taxpayer. of course, bank failure past decade,combined current wave merger acquisitions, serve reduce significantly thetotal number bank organization u.s. but 7,000 separate bankingcompanies remain sufficient maintain highly decentralize flexiblebanking structure.large number small bank go hand hand macroeconomy characterizedby large number small, entrepreneurial nonfinancial businesses. small bank traditionally havebeen major source capital small business may access security markets. inturn, small business account major portion new employment new ideas, therebyplaying major role fuel economic growth.this connection run small banks, small business, macroeconomy-- indeed role bank generally fund business expansion -- important must besensitive tradeoff risk-taking bank solvency. risk-taking -- prudent risk-taking tobe sure -- primary economic function banking. all wealth measure perceivedability produce good service value future. since future fundamentallybis review 49/1997 - 3 -unknown, endeavor create wealth imply uncertain expectation future willunfold. that is, create wealth risky.hence banking, primary economic purpose finance economy,cannot avoid prudent risk-taking. bank supervisors, turn, need recognize theoptimal bank failure rate zero. a zero failure rate time imply either extraordinary insightby bankers, notion i readily dismiss, undue unhelpful degree conservatism bankingpractice. in take risk, course, mistake made, bank fail. even abank well-managed, simply become unlucky. failure occur, indeed occur, aspart natural process within competitive economy. it view flaw ourfinancial system, certainly attempt eliminate it. only failure ratethreatens breach prudent threshold become concerned.just large number small bank key robustness economy,the state charter key robustness bank structure. the dual bank system hasfostered steady stream bank innovation benefit consumer bank shareholdersalike. for example, now account, i like point out, invent state-chartered bank;and now account open shoot campaign remove national deposit interest ratecontrols allow bank compete common grind nonbank institution moneyfunds. the 1994 interstate branch statute likewise origin state law permittedcross-border banking, begin rewrite maine bank laws. adjustable ratemortgages another innovation begin state level, course, national bankingact origin states’ “free banking” law nineteenth century.the dual bank system foster preserve innovation alsoconstitutes main protection overly zealous rigid federal regulation supervision. abank must choice one federal regulator, must permit change charters, toprotect arbitrary capricious regulatory behavior. naturally, observer areconcerned two federal agency engage “competition laxity”, mustguard that; great danger, i believe, single federal regulator would becomerigid insensitive need marketplace. thus, long federal guarantee ofdeposits, federal reserve guarantee intraday payment fedwire, element thesafety net -- and, therefore, long need federal regulation bank -- suchregulation entail choice regulator federal level.as well aware, federal reserve long strong supporter thedual bank system context efficient supervision. that we, along fdic,have seek examination partnership state bank regulators. currently, feed hascooperative agreement three dozen states, call either joint examination oralternate year exams. overall, experience program quite positive, partbecause quality state supervision state cooperative agreements. indeed, theevidence suggest safety soundness state bank compare quite favorably nationalbanks, possibly reflect benefit state federal supervision. for example,during bank crisis late 1980s, failure rate measure breach prudentthreshold i mention earlier, national bank failure rate considerably great statebanks. while bank failure determine supervision process, datanevertheless speak well quality state supervisory process ability state andfederal regulator function together efficiently.the dual bank system, however, despite advantage achievements, underattack. this attack neither particularly intentional particularly coordinated, rather consistsof unintended consequence statutory regulatory change aim achieve broaderpolicy objectives. i refer primarily consequence 1994 interstate branchingbis review 49/1997 - 4 -legislation, couple occ’s recent liberalization regulatory procedure operatingsubsidiaries national banks. these event may serve tip balance favor nationalbanks, speak, manner weaken banks’ ability switch federal regulator withoutincurring prohibitive real economic costs. in particular, state-chartered bank willcontinue operate intrastate basis local markets, regional nationwide bank may findthat state charter burdensome extent bank force operate varyingregulatory rule procedure across multiple states. if burden become excessive,banks interstate operation -- especially interstate retail operation -- would likely turn thenational charter grind simple expediency. for example, i strike fact verylargest state-chartered bank among money center institution without significant retailoperations without announce intention expand retail bank beyond home states. therest large state-chartered banks, asset $10 billion, consist mainly lead banksin multi-bank, multi-state hold companies. it seem likely institution seekto consolidate interstate retail operation national bank charter interstate branchingbecomes fully operational, unless countervail force emerge.the evident superiority national charter forego conclusion, however.for example, federal reserve past month approve application superregional bankingcompany consolidate retail branch four state single state-chartered bankheadquartered alabama. the consolidation would become effective june 1, 1997, whenthe riegle-neal interstate bank act become operational. another positive indication theresiliency state charter establishment state-federal work group. thiscooperative effort involve states, csbs, federal reserve, fdic contributingimportantly strengthen supervision state-chartered institution number ofinitiatives, include adoption state/federal protocol. the protocol nationwidesupervisory agreement 1996 spell principle specific action would lead aseamless

uniquely decentralize bank system, itsreliance large number relatively small institutions, desirability retain dualbanking system, implicit choice regulator. let conclude turn another importantfacet debate financial reform -- role federal reserve contain systemic risk.it critical guard diminution role yet another unintended consequence offinancial reform.the risk systemwide disruptions, good

propose transfer national fiscalcompetences community. delors’ plan sequel june 1989, agree thatan intergovernmental conference would hold decide necessary amendment tothe treaty rome. six month later, french-german proposal hold conference aboutpolitical cooperation accept dublin. at conferences, preparation make thatled treaty european union (eu) end 1991, good know maastrichttreaty.from tension characterise em early 1990s, seem beclear first stage emu go entirely planned. the uncertainty countriessuch denmark unite kingdom hesitate sign maastricht treaty, theinterest-increasing

hedgethe fear german supremacy new europe. be may, treaty officially enteredinto effect november 1993, harbour prospect single european currency. on 1stjanuary 1994, europe step second stage emu european monetaryinstitute (emi), forerunner ecb, establish frankfurt. the emi’s primarytask strengthen coordination monetary policy eu member state - inearly 1995, finland, austria sweden join eu - prepare third stage emu. a mentioned, emu cannot see separate wish establish, thelonger term, politically unify europe well. in order prevent economic reality beingsubordinated honourable wish, stringent entry requirement set. these socalled convergence criterion pertain permissible value inflation rates, interest rates, publicdeficits public debts. the maastricht treaty hold ultimate wisdom. economictheory yet advance level objectively accurately determine theoptimal size public deficit debts. it probably never will. the maastricht budgetarycriteria, criticise various side - argue entry requirement aretoo stringent, others believe lenient - base practical experience and, putin long historical perspective, lenient rather overly stringent. this anotherreason criterion must

could well transform amsterdam treaty. it isworth mention foreign guest present afternoon that, geographicalperspective, maastricht last real mountain conquer road toamsterdam. in words, journey maastricht amsterdam free obstacles. ihope apply last stage emu. the likelihood obstacle beenreduced considerably because, i explained, stringent entry requirement set inmaastricht. gradually, group country emerge europe may able meetthese criteria. in spring 1998, formally appoint emu participants. inorder give sufficient weight core group, participation france germany -forming axis western european cooperation - prerequisite. but viewbis review 42/1997 - 5 -to credibility emu, france germany, particular, strictly observe theconditions accession.the creation core group give rise

across whole europe. onthe hand, one worry recur discussion much, treaty isrock-solid regard prohibition exert political influence ecb governingcouncil. obviously, independence european central bank confusedwith lack democratic legitimacy. after all, democratic legitimacy ecb beensafeguarded many ways. for example, designate ecb-president question theeuropean parliament chairman council minister plus member theeuropean commission may participate meet ecb executive board without, istrue, vote rights. but apart this, keep mind masstricht treaty hasbeen ratify national parliaments. in words,

ofamsterdam realised, switch definitively turn signal clear thefinal stage emu, lead frankfurt complete beat track thehigh-speed train.bis review 42/1997 mr. matsushita discus payment settlement system regard tocurrent issue japan speech governor bank japan, mr. yasuo matsushita,held japan center economic research 28/2/97.i. introduction i greatly honor invite japan center economicresearch address distinguish audience. i wish take opportunity first brieflydiscuss recent monetary economic conditions, address current issuesregarding payment settlement system japan. there many opportunity discus payment settlement onoccasions this, despite fact important economic activity ofhouseholds firms, central bank, much involve thedevelopments area. i address area partly due technical nature, butrecently several development attract much attention payment settlementissues japan, countries: specifically, pilot project electronic money productsand bank’s plan abolish designated-time settlement mode make real-time grosssettlement way settlement bank japan financial network system(boj-net). the role central bank ensure smooth stable operation paymentand settlement system become clearly recognize deliberation revisionof bank japan law take place since last year. the “report therevision bank japan law,” release recently financial system researchcouncil, advisory committee minister finance, state one objective thebank japan “to ensure smooth fund settlement among financial institutions, therebycontributing maintenance orderly financial system." i wish therefore discus today current issue regard payment andsettlement system japan also refer role central bank systems,bearing mind domestic overseas trend areas.ii. domestic monetary economic condition i would like start review recent economic condition thinkingbehind bank’s current monetary policy management. with regard domestic economic condition, bank japan judge amoderate economic recovery continue recovery gradually become firmer. a notable change economic condition since latter half 1996 thatthe decline external demand, factor constrain economic recovery,halted autumn 1996 follow depreciation yen. recently upwardtrend external demand. in addition, inventory adjustment raw material andsemiconductor industry almost reach completion end 1996. a result,production start grow accelerate pace, reflect fully increase finaldemand. personal consumption continue grow moderately steadily, support thebuoyant sale passenger cars, recovery business fix investment spread awider range industry small firm previously observed, reflectingimprovements corporate sale profits. bi review 43/1997 - 2 -it bear mind increase demand ahead rise theconsumption tax rate schedule fiscal 1997 contribute recent improvement ineconomic indicators, house investment, improvement need see thislight. however, despite gradual decrease public-sector investment latter half of1996, virtuous circle - increase production lead recovery business fixedinvestment personal consumption improve corporate profit employmentincome - gradually become apparent. this improvement encouraging. in contrast recent improvement economic indicators, begin ofthe year saw significant fall stock price this, together decline long-terminterest rate financial markets, indicate confidence market participant inthe economic outlook still slow improve. various cause consider market’s uncertainty futuredevelopments economy. while renew concern nonperforming-loanproblem financial institution may one important factor, strong awareness effectsof anticipate fiscal tighten next fiscal year also significant. from spring summer year, temporary slowdown economic recoveryseems inevitable due reaction boost demand occur ahead rise inthe consumption tax rate. however, give strengthen virtuous circle, morelikely recovery trend economy sustained. in addition, stockprices appear stabilized. therefore, consider whether economy overcomethe effect fiscal tighten sustain trend recovery, important examine macro-and micro-economic data, include economic indicator release future,signals financial markets, firms’ business plan next fiscal year. i turn environment surround domestic prices. the depreciationof yen continue since begin year, rise consumption tax rate isplanned april. the raise tax rate pass product prices, push theprice index accordingly. however, long price hike surpass increase causedby raise consumption tax rate, price rise reflect single priceadjustment, indicate fundamental change situation underlie prices.therefore would appropriate formulate monetary policy counter superficialchanges price indexes. from viewpoint monetary policy management, is, viewpoint ofensuring stable economic development price stability, issue concern whetherthe rise tax rate trigger price hike take advantage increase lead toinflationary expectations, turn might bring price rise beyond immediateeffects tax rate increase. whether general price increase occur depend onvarious factors, include prevail domestic supply demand condition consumerconfidence. it thus necessary pay attention inflationary expectation possiblenegative developments, include overreaction consumers, result rise theconsumption tax rate, rather focus attention superficial hike prices. although decline price begin slow end 1996, alimited possibility domestic price take clear upward path give improvement inthe supply demand condition domestic economy expect remain moderate fornow. however, view accelerate rise import price reflect yen’s depreciationand high crude oil price since latter half 1996, together strengthen thebis review 43/1997 - 3 -recovery private demand, remain necessary pay careful attention development indomestic prices. in management current monetary policy, bank japan continue tomonitor economic development closely, place emphasis strengthen thefoundation economic recovery.iii. current issue regard payment settlement system japana. payment settlement system japan i would like move main theme today’s speech: payment andsettlement systems. the expression “payment settlement systems” may sound somewhattechnical may indeed unfamiliar you. in market economy, however, every economicactivity conduct firm household - production consumption - concludedwith settlement. payment settlement systems, mechanism clear settlingpayments, therefore use directly indirectly every economic entity. people may beconscious function system operate smoothly efficiently. however,once problem arises, great difficulty encountered. the mean payment use firm household vary cash - is,banknotes coin - check bills, fund transfer bank accounts, creditcards. when payment make cash, settlement final then. however, whenpayment make mean check bills, mere hand checksand bill complete settlement transaction. when check drawn, forexample, settlement final check collect state amount money istransferred deposit money bank account payer bank account thepayee. if transfer effect account reason, example, thereare insufficient fund payer’s account, transaction remain unsettled. when thepayer payee hold account different banks, interbank settlement needed, andsettlement complete correspond debit credit entry make tothe current account hold bank bank japan. although various mean payment available firm households,settlement ultimately make either hand cash issue bank japan bya transfer fund bank account use deposit money, liability privatefinancial institutions. “money” modern society therefore comprise cash depositmoney, reliant confidence public bank deposit convert intocash time. when large number relatively small-value payments, usingchecks bills, need settle banks, settle one time theaccounts hold bank bank japan. rather, payment instrument checksand bill collect exchange clear houses, credit debit position ofeach bank calculated, net position settle boj accounts. thiscalculation process call clearing, operate private institutions. specifically, thereare three major private clear system japan: bill check-clearing system; zengindata telecommunication system (zengin system) fund transfer bank accountsand credit card payments; foreign exchange yen clear system yen paymentsarising foreign exchange euro-yen transactions. bi review 43/1997 - 4 -boj account use settle net position result various clearingsystems, well directly settle large-value interbank fund transactions, call-moneytransactions, go clear processes. the value fund transfer thebank japan total approximately ¥300 trillion per day, equivalent approximately60 percent japan’s annual gdp.b. the role central bank payment settlement system bank japan thus play important role settlement make cashand settlement make deposit money. the duty central bank issue controlmoney - is, ensure public’s confidence hold use money. to end, two condition must satisfied: (1) value money must bestable - is, price stability must maintained; (2) circulation money thefunctioning payment settlement system must stable efficient. if notpossible use cash deposit desire settlements, people would able holdmoney confidence. the mission central banks, therefore, make currency theyissue convenient use thereby enable firm household confidently engagein daily transaction fund settlements. bank japan thus play vital role thesettlement process japan whole. bank japan serf two specific function secure stability andefficiency country’s payment settlement systems: (1) provide mean ofsettlement public; (2) attend smooth execution payment settlementsin japan. a provider mean settlement, bank issue bank japan note andensures smooth circulation. a i mention earlier, cash payment immediately completethe settlement transaction deliver mean payment directly counterparty.this on-the-spot completion settlement, whereby payee able secure monetaryvalue received, describe “settlement finality.” in order maintain finality cash payments, essential secure theconfidence people soundness central bank’s assets, underpin valueof banknotes. the bank thus pay close attention soundness assets.furthermore, circulation counterfeit note would undermine people’s confidence inholding money. to prevent occurrence, bank examine authenticity largevolumes banknote return bank japan every day financialinstitutions. careful attention also pay cleanness banknote incirculation. the bank also exert utmost improve anti-counterfeiting measures,and recently engage joint research overseas central bank prevention ofbanknote counterfeit use color copiers. through efforts, bank aim precludethe circulation counterfeits. the bank also provide current account bank another mean ofsettlement. the bank offer account private financial institutions, fund theseaccounts, deposit money, equivalent banknote function mean ofsettlement finality. in order improve safety efficiency settlement use theseboj accounts, bank make various efforts, include introduction boj-net -the bank japan financial network system, on-line system fund transfersamong current account hold private financial institution bank japan. thebis review 43/1997 - 5 -bank intend improve system cooperation concern make real-time gross settlement settlement mode, i shall discus detail later. the second function bank japan regard payment andsettlement system attend safety efficiency payment settlement injapan, provide adequate liquidity necessary. a i mention earlier, importanttasks bank include ensure smooth supply banknote throughout country, andmonitoring stability daily settlement across boj accounts.in addition, bank, coordination operator private clearingsystems bill check clearing, play important role prevent trouble inthe system participant jeopardize entire payment settlement system injapan. in settlement system, risk failure one bank meet itsobligations trigger chain reaction defaults, eventually paralyze entire system. inaddition, payment settlement system individual bank constitute system aresupported market’s confidence. a confidence large part psychological factor,a failure single bank could lead run deposit banks. such risk refer toas systemic risk. materialization systemic risk disrupt settlement betweenbanks also firm households, profound impact economyand society whole. such systemic risk inherent network settlement whatdifferentiates bank sector industrial sectors. the role central bank constantly monitor institutional frameworkand operation payment settlement systems, work coordination partiesconcerned thereby prevent materialization systemic risk. the central bank must alsoensure system provide fund break chain reaction default shouldsome emergency occur. another important task central bank attend soundnessof private financial institutions, participant payment settlementsystems settle payment firm households. to summarize theseroles, important mission central bank maintain safety efficiency theentire settlement process, process involve (1) private financial institution acceptthe deposit firm households; (2) private clear organization process interbankpayments; (3) central bank discharge interbank settlement obligation resultingfrom private-sector clear systems.c. measure improve safety payment settlement system payment settlement system necessarily issue publicinterest reflect general perception system mechanical process unit fordischarging obligation inputting transaction data. the fact financialinstitution failure recently payment settle safely may supportedthis perception. however, financial institution actually fail speed whichsystemic risk transmit within beyond international border increase significantlyowing technological innovation finance telecommunications, financialglobalization. under circumstances, inappropriate view payment settlementsystems merely mechanical process units. these system must resilient againstsystemic risk, establish system extremely important challenge boththe private financial institution central bank. it become apparent variousincidents study raise awareness need improve safety payment andsettlement system among private financial institution central bank japan andabroad. bi review 43/1997 - 6 -in various countries, new safety standard apply private clearingsystems. these standard include limit participant’s net debit position collateralrequirements ensure provision adequate backup liquidity event inability tosettle participant large single net-debit position. these standard weredevised central bank group ten country minimum standard satisfiedby cross-border multi-currency net schemes, refer lamfalussystandards, chairman committee study. a standard apply todomestic clear systems, use recently many country guideline forimproving integrity private clear systems. in japan, recently decide enhance safety measure theforeign exchange yen clear system satisfy lamfalussy standards. the bankwill continue actively support initiative improve safety payment andsettlement systems.d.improving safety central bank’s settlement system -real-time gross settlement the need improve safety apply private clear system also tothe settlement system operate central banks. in regard, increase number centralbanks adopt real-time gross settlement current account settlement thecentral bank. real-time gross settlement - call rtgs short - system thecentral bank process effect every payment instruction send private financial institutionsin real time order-by-order basis. most central banks, include bank japan, typically conductedinterbank settlement designated-time basis rather rtgs. in conventionaldesignated-time settlement, payment instruction accumulate designate settlementtimes instead one settle immediately. at designate time - present, 9 a.m.,1 p.m., 3 p.m., 5 p.m. japan - net settlement position financial institution iscomputed account credit debit simultaneously. in designated-time settlement, financial institution need fundsequivalent net debit position time settlement, thus, efficient systemfrom viewpoint fund management. however, single financial institution systemwere fail meet obligations, payment would inevitably suspended, order allthe payment instruction send receive financial institution could revoke torecompute settlement obligation financial institution. in addition, failure couldcreate shortage fund financial institution plan make payment withthe fund expect receive fail financial institution. this may lead aseries liquidity shortage default - is, materialization systemic risk. the effectsof risk could grave, consider amount fund handle central bank’ssettlement system substantial. with rtgs, smooth execution settlement solely depend ability ofthe party concern meet obligations, every payment instruction process realtime order-by-order basis. therefore, even bank suddenly become unable tosettle, disruption system would limited: suspension operation entiresettlement system, occur designated-time settlement, avoided. thebis review 43/1997 - 7 -introduction rtgs many country around world, include asian countries, aresult effort central bank improve settlement system contain systemic risk. against background, bank japan also decide end 1996 tomake rtgs mode settlement via boj accounts. specifically, end year2000, bank plan abolish designated-time settlement make fund transfer thebasis rtgs. this may require market participant establish new transaction settlementpractices. to ensure smooth operation rtgs, bank intend directly supplyintraday liquidity, indispensable smooth settlements, cover liquidity shortagesthat might arise system despite effort participant financial institutions. last december, bank announce policy realize rtgs onlysettlement mode boj-net specific proposal design feature andrequested comment public. the bank fortunate receive many valuablecomments recognize increase awareness settlement risk among marketparticipants. the bank belief able gain strong support privatefinancial institution rtgs, plan publish near future policy along thecomments received. the bank strongly hope receive constructive opinion suggestionsin decide detail design system. the bank also solicit view abroad range market participant whenever make major change operation thebank’s settlement system, change system could significant impact themarket practice daily business financial institution participate system. it note realization rtgs necessarily mean theelimination risk payment settlement systems. moreover, rtgs boj-net produce desire effect safety private clear systemsconnected bank’s system ensured. to illustrate point, suppose privatefinancial institutions, reason, switch direct settlement via boj account toindirect settlement use private clear system give introduction rtgs. the totalamount risk payment settlement system whole would decrease therewere inadequate management risk private systems. in respect, indispensablefor private financial institutions, private clear organizations, central bank towork together enhance efficiency safety payment settlement system injapan. such effort private sector central bank improve theinfrastructure settlement also contribute strengthen globalcompetitiveness japan’s financial markets, indeed aim japanese “bigbang” deregulation package propose prime minister hashimoto.e. improvement security settlement system in addition safety fund settlements, much attention paidglobally safety settlement security government security stocks. although i enough time today discus issue detail, theestablished guideline risk management security settlement recommendation setout 1989 group thirty, international group expert finance. in accordance recommendations, significant progress maderecently japan toward improve settlement system securities. for settlement ofbis review 43/1997 - 8 -japanese government security (jgs), example, on-line network delivery-versus-payment system established. delivery versus payment, know dvp, amechanism link delivery jgs correspond fund transfer bothare execute simultaneously. in way, failure collect payment receive securitiescan avoided. in addition, roll settlement introduce october 1996. here,settlements make every business day contract agree specificnumber business day previous settlement date (currently seven days). this replacesthe prior arrangement contract make certain period accumulate theywere settle one six designate settlement day month (the 5th, 10th, 15th,20th, 25th, last day month). the system improve april 1997 tocomplete settlement third business day date contract. regard settlement corporate bonds, may familiar many youhere, delivery bond conventionally make document call registrationcertificate correspond payment settle separately clear bills.at end 1997, however, on-line delivery corporate bond bring effect. adelivery-versus-payment service also envision future connect settlementsystem corporate bond boj-net. various effort thus way japan enhance safety securitiessettlements. however, much remain improved. a large volume stock othersecurities continue deliver physically, dvp system yet establish forsuch securities. furthermore, lag contract settlement, is, finaltransfers security funds, need shorten various securities. in respect, thebank intend contribute actively expect effort part private sector.f. development electronic money i would like briefly discus development electronic money, whichmight become popular mean settlement future. the term electronic money use refer payment mechanism whichelectronic record fund store device ic card - microprocessor chip(integrated circuits) embed - computer network transfer safely onecustomer another. many pilot project way various countries, make use therecent technological innovation ic card computer network well securityfeatures encryption. in japan well, financial institution firm begin variousprojects individually jointly. for example, bank individually use ic-card basedelectronic money trial within certain build tokyo. a joint project credit cardcompany several bank card-based electronic money also plan summer1998 certain area tokyo. it say large one kind world,involving approximately 1,000 store 100,000 cards. when electronic money product become prevalent, may use newmeans settlement replace cash deposits. people may settle various retail transaction bytransferring electronic value ic card network instead banknote andcoins. to prepare possibility, central bank keenly interest soundness andthe implication electronic money developments. from viewpoint, central bank ofthe group ten country study various aspect electronic money: securityfeatures prevent fraud counterfeiting, implication effectiveness centralbank’s monetary policy, stability payment settlement systems. bi review 43/1997 - 9 -at present, however, difficult project electronic moneytechnology develop, extent electronic money product use public asa substitute cash deposit money, pace development proceed. thepace development depend reliability electronic money product issecured conveniently product utilized. under circumstances, noteasy reach verdict various relevant issues, would appropriate jump toconclusions. developer operator electronic money scheme expect exerciseingenuity aspect security legal matters, innovative capability theprivate sector discouraged. the basic stance bank maintain atpresent flexible various possibility concern future course developmentin electronic money. regard implication development electronic money monetarypolicy, monetary policy will, theory, continue effective, provide situation doesnot become one electronic money extensively substitute cash mean ofretail payment also deposit money large-value transfers. although spread ofelectronic money product might affect stability monetary indicators, beadequately manage identify amount outstanding electronic money issue bydevising monetary policy management. therefore, i wish state bank japan doesnot intend put brake development introduction electronic money inconsideration effect monetary policy. maintain stance, bank intend continue research electronicmoney observe development private sector japan abroad. it willrelease result research, do past, wish support effort theprivate sector.g. the necessity risk management individual financial institution i far discuss development regard payment settlementsystems contain systemic risk. it obvious, however, establish appropriate systemstructure alone enough secure safety systems. it also important thesystem participants, individual financial institutions, improve risk control measure byestablishing system identify manage settlement risk. in modern society, monetary systems, mention earlier, base thepublic’s confidence in: (1) cash issue central bank; (2) deposit money offer byprivate financial institutions. in order monetary system function smoothly, necessaryfor financial system whole function stability and, end, financialinstitutions need responsible secure sound management, includingmanagement settlement risk. it evident financial institution manage risk rigorously.compared credit interest rate risks, settlement risk tend cause great loss anddisruptions materializes, yet difficult identify manage. in fact,settlement risk constantly fluctuate significantly, thus identification management therisk require comprehensive understand technical detail relate processing. forexample, necessary know payment settlement system different currencieswork, risk arise time lags. such information skill cannot acquiredovernight. however, view impact settlement risk could financial institutions, itbis review 43/1997 - 10 -is indispensable establish system make possible identification measurementof settlement risk immediate reduction risk follow decision management. i would like emphasize financial institution equip efficientrisk management system able acquire new business opportunity area ofpayment settlement services. in fact, many european u.s. financial institution arecreating offer new business settlement operations. they put largeamounts resource establish adequate internal risk management, develop safeand efficient settlement service provide financial institution customers. thefact operation viable business indication european u.s. financialinstitutions firm actively use new innovative payment settlement service realize safeand efficient settlements.iv. conclusion in summarize today’s discussion payment settlement systems, i wouldlike address basic issue somewhat different point view. firstly, payment settlement system play extremely important role theeconomy infrastructure support economic activities, although rarelyacknowledged daily lives. when firm purchase raw material sell products, whenhouseholds receive wage salaries, purchase goods, remit money, activity arebased assumption payment settlement money effect smoothly - amanner people would even conscious it. to satisfy requirement, modernsociety develop complex precise mechanism comprise central bank theprivate sector. the expression “financial institutions” “financial system” may generallybring mind function intermediate save investment borrow andlending money. provide safe efficient settlement services, however, equallyimportant function central bank private financial institution serve. secondly, effort improve utility safety settlementsystems become important economic transaction become increasinglycomplex globalize technological innovation finance include payment andsettlement system progress. the lamfalussy standards, rtgs, recommendation thegroup thirty indeed part efforts. a technology continue progress, however, final goal thedevelopment payment settlement systems. in addition, financial globalization isintensifying cross-border linkages, settlement trouble one country affect thesettlement system countries. it therefore important private sector centralbanks work together improve payment settlement system review safetystandards necessary global perspective. we bank japan shall continue ourefforts enhance safety efficiency boj-net, shall support effort theprivate sector improve systems. thirdly, important ensure soundness financial system abroad sense. a i mention repeatedly, function modern monetary system itsfoundations public’s confidence central bank private financial institutions.in order monetary system function properly, entire financial system need operatewith stability. sound management found responsibility financial institution isfundamental establish confidence private financial institutions. it necessary forbis review 43/1997 - 11 -the central bank function lender last resort trouble emerge onepart settlement system anticipate spread throughout entire system - although itis important contain risk advance, sometimes may unfortunately becomeimpossible prevent incident impact entire system - people’severyday life seriously affected. in order prevent materialization systemicrisk, essential central bank assess, regular on-site examination dailymonitoring, whether soundness individual financial institution secured, whether thereis excessive concentration risk financial system whole, whether series oftransactions financial institution settle smoothly. in summary, payment settlement system vital every economic entityincluding firm individual represent here. a central bank, one whosemissions secure soundness financial system, bank japan continue itsefforts improve safety efficiency japan’s payment settlement systems. in thisregard, suggestion comment extremely valuable. thank much kind attention.this article excerpt translate speech give yasuo matsushita, governor ofthe bank japan, japan center

experience approach regulation beenthe subject profound misconceptions. specifically, many seem believe free bank wasbanking free government regulation result series debacles. they conclude thatbis review 44/1997 - 3 -the experience free bank demonstrate market force cannot effectively constrain bankrisktaking. in fact, “free” free bank mean free entry term general law ofincorporation rather specific legislative act. the public, especially new york, hadbecome painfully aware restriction entry charter system produce numberof adverse effects. for one thing, absence competition, access bank credit perceive tohave become politicized--banks’ board director seem regard share politicalconvictions creditworthy borrowers. in addition, bank charter promise monopolyprofits, bank promoter will pay handsomely privilege legislator apparentlyeagerly accept payment, often form allocation bank stock below-market prices. if free bank actually free commonly perceived, also nearly asunstable. the perception free bank era era “wildcat" bank mark financialinstability and, particular, widespread significant loss noteholders also turn wide ofthe mark. recent scholarship demonstrate free bank failure common resultinglosses noteholders severe early historian claimed. in addition, failure rate andloss rate differ significantly across states, suggest whatever instability experience wasnot inherent free bank per se. in particular, widely cite loss holder note issue freebanks indiana, illinois, wisconsin appear result bank state forcedto hold portfolio risky state bond well-diversified, especially liquid, toooften defaulted. it was, short, state regulation cause high failure rates. during free bank era private market regulation also mature several respects.particularly panic 1837, public acutely aware possibility bank wouldprove unable redeem notes. discount bank note widespread. indeed, 1838and civil war quite note broke begin publish monthly biweekly periodical call banknote reporter list prevail discount thousand individual banks. research base datafrom publication show note new entrant bank tend trade atsignificant discounts. if bank demonstrate ability redeem notes,

another element maturation private market regulation bank theemergence full-fledged bank clear houses, begin establishment new yorkclearing house 1853. the primary impetus development clear house

these crisis see inpart consequence inelastic currency engender national bank act. even theadvent federal reserve 1913, monetary policy 1920s largely govern goldstandard rules. fiscal policy also

but i think must skeptical here, admittedly weak literature oneconomies scope bank hard press find strong evidence significant synergieseven financial activities, although i think believe some.the argument need combine bank commerce attract capital tobanking seems, well, pretty silly. in market economy, capital flow profit opportunities. ifbanking view vibrant grow industry, hard see capital

associate topic subtle complex, ibelieve basic issue regard safety net subsidy understand usingstraightforward economic reasoning. unfortunately, much debate thus far tend bemore obscure need be.take, example, question whether subsidy exists. most observer agree thatthere gross subsidy, real issue whether subsidy net regulatory costs.but discussion often seem get confused. to me, critical point distinguishclearly concept total benefits, total costs, marginal benefit marginal costs.we know, least u train economics know, profitmaximizing firm equate marginal benefit marginal costs. apply subsidy debate,this principle imply equilibrium profit maximize bank set marginal benefit ofthe subsidy equal marginal costs. in words, rational firm drive net marginalbenefit subsidy zero. importantly, imply that, margin, may difficult toactually observe subsidy. i suspect go long way toward explain effort toestimate marginal value subsidy have, date, prove le successful.even though rational firm equate marginal benefit marginal costs, clearlydo equate total benefit total costs. indeed, standard microeconomic theory say acompetitive equilibrium total benefit exceed total costs. again apply concept thesubsidy debate, individual, profit maximize bank total benefit subsidy shouldexceed subsidy’s total costs, even though subsidy’s marginal net benefit zero. this total netbenefit allow bank industry larger, perhaps riskier, would otherwise be. thefact observe bank voluntarily give charter suggest may well thatthe safety net’s total benefit exceed total costs, even value net marginal subsidy iszero.consider another point derive distinction total marginalbenefits. today, would expect bank maximize total net benefit subsidyusing activity capable engaging. now consider rational bankwill give new opportunity, say expand security powers, maximize profit. wouldn’t weexpect bank equate marginal benefit marginal costs, include marginalbenefits cost safety net subsidy? but resultant new equilibrium, value ofthe net marginal subsidy zero, would total net benefit subsidy inthe previous, constrain equilibrium? clearly answer no. we would expect total netbenefits larger, bank industry larger, rationally seek fully exploit thenew opportunity make profit exploit subsidy. rather focus measure largethe net subsidy today, perhaps appropriate focus discussion

limit economy achieve. second, assessingthe current environment implication monetary policy, uncertainty require u balancehistorical regularity new possibilities.expansions, important degree, common properties, i shall refer asregularities. both forecaster policymakers rely these. forecaster make prediction futuredevelopments base regularities. the regularity allow policymakers act pre-emptively --changing policy today anticipation development tomorrow. yet expansion ownsignature reflect specific set transitory influence longer-lasting structural change playat time.the current episode feature follow players. cyclical regularity clearly inevidence include accelerator effects, change tolerance risk, cyclical swing theunemployment rate profits. two regularity i especially want focus today thephillips curve trend growth output. the latter regularity define limit - limit thesustainable level output, moment, and, level capacity reached, growth ofoutput time. if limit exceeded, typically happen cyclical expansion, theeconomy eventually overheats, inflation increases, expansion undermine policy force torein demand. transitory influences, clearly among star current episode, feature acoincidence favorable supply shock restrain inflation. finally, structural adjustments, inthis episode, hint decline nairu and/or increase trend growth. the central question ininterpreting recent experience whether old limit economic performance longerbinding, replace new possibilities, temporarily overrule transitoryinfluences.before move substance talk, let remind remark theoutlook monetary policy, today always, views. i speak fomc.near-term prospect good news economybefore address challenge develop themes, let briefly review thesurprisingly favorable feature recent economic performance comment near-term outlook.for audience, i summarize recent performance single sentence. we recentlyblessed relatively strong cyclical growth, low unemployment rate 24 years, lowestbis review 85/1997 -

termmay crosscurrent appear likely moderate output growth keep inflation relatively wellcontained.in case output growth, crosscurrent continue strength demand andthe expect slow inventory investment. in second quarter, economy slow upwardrevised 3.6% rate, 4.9% rate first quarter, much modest slow originallyreported widely anticipate quarter. this, way, recur pattern theexpansion -- every time i think economy slow trend, surprise itscontinued strength.the fundamental continue look positive. in particular, household group arewealthy optimistic, business profitable confront dramatic technologicalopportunities, financial condition remain supportive. there appear imbalance athreat continue expansion. a result, demand expect remain strong second half theyear, pace rebound consumer spend complement continue strength businessfixed investment.forecasters know, however, composition mix output one quarter --specifically mix final demand inventory investment -- often provide important hintof come. while i interpret strength inventory investment first half -- include theupward revise rate $78 billion second quarter -- largely voluntary, principallyreflecting response strength past prospective sales, flow rate accumulation thesecond quarter almost certainly unsustainable. that is, stock may equilibrium, flow ratewill slow keep there. the result slowdown inventory investment likely,therefore, significant drag production second half year, offsetting, least part,the expect rebound final demand.on inflation side, also important crosscurrent work. i beenconcerned two consideration suggest inflation may well rise time: possibilitythat economy operate today beyond sustainable capacity likelihood transitoryfactors have, balance, restrain inflation diminish importance time. however,three influence that, view, gradually become significant considerations, likelyto moderate tendency inflation rise near term. first, lower-than-expected overall coreinflation continue modest pace wage change year encourage restrainedincreases wage price come year. low inflation lead low inflation expectations,reinforcing prospect low inflation ahead. in case, inertia friend result avirtuous wage-price spiral, least while. second, transitory factors, especially theappreciation dollar result decline import prices, appear long leg likelyto contribute toward restraint inflation come quarter early appear likely. third, theupward adjustment profit july nipa revision suggest profit cushion thatcould delay pass-through high compensation price increases.while crosscurrent suggest moderation output growth inflation,crosscurrents don’t necessarily balance. with respect output growth, crosscurrent point towardslower growth second half compare first half, important whether slow growthturns near trend, hold utilization rate constant, trend, push utilization rate stillhigher. at least, slowdown inventory investment likely accommodate withminimal disturbance continue expansion. but risk growth continue abovetrend, push utilization rate up, already high levels.bis review 85/1997 - 3 -with respect inflation, net crosscurrent suggest modest increase ininflation 1998, albeit steadily downward-revised low rate 1997. i pay veryclose attention source rebound inflation, specifically degree reflectssimply dissipation favorable supply shock contribute lowinflation year degree reflect persistent effect high utilization rates.as result, i focus core overall inflation rate pay particularly closeattention labor costs, give labor market appear tight product market therefore morelikely source increase inflation pressures. still, increase inflation would beginfrom low base may modest previously appear likely.the bottom line past performance, several important dimensions, beenextraordinary prospect look favorable continue expansion relatively low inflation.still, monetary policy must alert potential develop upward trend inflation aneconomy may already operate beyond sustainable capacity possibly still grow anabove-trend rate. and, always, challenges, even good news economy.limits what monetary policy can dothe first challenge avoid become complacent. even good reason forcelebrating recent economic performance, good reason avoid complacency. specifically,there dimension economic performance le stellar, slow

pressure entitlement programs. andthere remain linger social strain associate gradual increase income inequality, interactingwith low average growth rate productivity produce long period relatively

traditionalresponsibilities well, accommodate maximum sustainable growth achieve maximumsustainable level employment. but cannot more.regularitiesthe second challenge explain performance favorable, least interms inflation unemployment. before explore explanation puzzle, i want focus oncommon feature cyclical expansions. in so, i focus cyclical expansion notbeen dominate dramatic external shocks, two episode mark steeply risingworld oil price -- first early 1970s late 1970s early 1980s. while even theseexpansions share many pattern i emphasize later, end dominate effect thepowerful supply shock policy response shocks.expansions, definition, begin considerable economic slack, inherit theprevious recession. the economy typically make rapid transition decline output (the definitionof recession) above-trend growth. in loose way, trend growth refer growth economy’sproductive capacity. when growth trend, production expand fast economy’sbis review 85/1997 - 4 -productive capacity and, result, resource utilization rate rise. rise capacity utilization rate andfalling unemployment rate thus typical feature expansion period.the natural dynamic expansion above-trend growth continue demandovertakes capacity, despite best effort policy avoid cyclical excesses. the end story isparticularly important. expansion die old age lethargy, spontaneous weaken ofaggregate demand, rather accumulation imbalances, specifically demand outstrippingthe limit sustainable level input utilization growth output. the result rise inflationbecomes threat continue expansion. preventive medicine therefore best course oftreatment.in story, nairu set limit far economy expand overheatingsets inflation rises, phillips curve trace important part dynamic ofinflation, fast respond excess demand. of course, phillips curve framework alwaysbeen much easy describe implement, give uncertainty estimate nairu, giventhe fact empirical regularity inflation unemployment always leave much variationin

curve, prove important guide forecaster andmonetary policymakers past.transitory influencesthe consensus estimate nairu expansion begin -- 6% -- notprepare u recent surprisingly favorable performance. it possible phillips curve andnairu simply wrong analytical framework, i doubt aware another model ofinflation dynamic ready take place. so response update estimate nairu andadd explanation consistent framework, abandon concept.one possible explanation one transitory factors, moment, areyielding favorable usual outcome. a coincidence favorable supply shock clearly, myjudgment, important part answer puzzle. i won’t talk length factors, ihave do previous talks. i would note favorable supply shock include anappreciation dollar consequent decline import prices; slow rate increase inbenefit costs, concentrate slowdown cost health care insurance; fast rate decline incomputer price earlier, reflect quick pace innovation; recently, decline oilprices slow rate increase food prices.a cyclical anomalylet include list explanation current favorable economic performancean intrigue cyclical anomaly. one regularity past expansion close relationship betweentwo widely use measure resource utilization -- capacity utilization unemployment rates.they traditionally move together cycle tend mirror one another. in case, didnot matter one use proxy excess demand; unemployment rate could usedinterchangeably measure labor market demand pressure overall economy-wide demandpressures. in current episode, however, two measure send different signals. theunemployment rate flash warn tight labor market. the capacity utilization rate, incontrast, suggest reasonably balance configuration production capacity product market,at least manufacture sector.why divergence develop implication relationshipbetween inflation unemployment? the divergence mirror one define feature thisexpansion -- boom business fix investment. the result high level net investment, morerapid rate increase capital stock hence industrial capacity.bis review 85/1997 - 5 -the result absence excess demand product market is, view, animportant factor explain frequently report absence price leverage firms. nothing give afirm price leverage like excess demand. in addition, result inability firm pas highercosts high price likely alter way firm operate labor market, make morereluctant bid aggressively workers, contribute slow rate increase wage wewould otherwise expect prevail labor utilization rates. it possible gap hasopened unemployment capacity utilization rate may factor has, effect,lowered nairu expansion. this explanation potential, historical precedent andit is, therefore, difficult judge importance.possibilitiesthe intrigue explanation recent favorable performance structuralchanges, may relax capacity constraint core cyclical regularitiesstory, make constraint flexible past, temper ability and/or willingnessof firm respond excess demand raise wage prices. i refer collectively as“possibilities,” suggest optimistic period improve economic performance, contrast withboth pessimism previously perceive limit cyclical regularity story grudging“for moment” concession explanation rely transitory influences. there two possibilitiesthat widely discussed: economy sustain low unemployment rate withoutrising inflation (i.e., nairu declined) that, capacity reached, economy isnow capable fast growth, compare estimate trend growth report earlier. a lot thediscussion episode focus sort relative importance two possibility --specifically, whether recent favorable performance due labor market structural change, asreflected low nairu, product market structural change, reflect high rate ofgrowth productivity.has decline nairu?time vary parameter estimate phillips curve casual eye bothsuggest decline nairu. robert gordon’s work, example, suggest decline nairu, from6% decade prior 1994, 5½% end 1995, nairu stabilize levelsince time.one possible explanation moderate rate increase compensation perhour would expect historical experience increase worker insecurity aconsequence rapid pace technological change and/or rapid pace restructure anddownsizing. a result, worker may will trade real wage increasedsecurity, result modest increase compensation per hour otherwise would beenexpected. the result slow rate increase compensation give level unemployment,equivalent decline nairu. another possible explanation divergence theunemployment capacity utilization rate expansion i discuss earlier.although decline nairu story relax limits, worker insecurityexplanation optimistic story. some workers, sure, gain, opportunity foremployment otherwise would denied. but broad group worker suffer slowerincrease live standards, relative otherwise would “possible.”has increase trend productivity?another possibility trend rate increase productivity -- hence theeconomy’s sustainable rate growth gdp -- recently increased.there confusion many discussion productivity growth theimplications measurement bias. it widely accept downward bias measuredbis review 85/1997 - 6 -productivity growth, mirror image upward bias measure inflation. but also widelyaccepted similar bias present entire postwar period. the measurement issue isrelevant explain inflation-unemployment experience current episode bias hasrecently become serious. an increase measurement bias could way, perhaps relate toan acceleration technical change, long time able establish areasonable degree certainty. note also measurement bias increased, would implythat actual potential output growth high reported, obvious implication thegap actual potential output, hence inflation pressures.sources high productivity growth, show measuredproductivity, include return year corporate restructure increase

many feature current experience increase trend productivity.technological change, accord view, result new profit opportunity turn haveresulted investment boom (heavily concentrate high technology equipment), increase corporateearnings, soar stock market. in addition, explanation consistent many anecdotesfrom business efficiency gain new technology put place.there are, however, problem story principal explanation thefavorable inflation performance. first, productivity explanation would resonate good puzzle werewhy high wage change pass high prices. but great puzzle slow paceof increase compensation per hour prevail unemployment rates. this clearly caseafter downward revision compensation july nipa revisions, bring measure ofcompensation per hour line employment cost index. give rate increase incompensation, unchanged trend growth productivity 1.1%, example, seem quite consistentwith recent price performance.although without serious shortcomings, publish productivity dataprovide little encouragement view significant improvement underlyingproductivity growth. the growth measure productivity expansion has, fact, beendisappointing. over 1994 1995, particular, measure productivity nearly flat. although hasaccelerated last two years, consistent another cyclical regularity, tendency forproductivity accelerate economic activity. and rate growth last year, even thesharp upward revision second quarter, 1.2%, 1.1% average rate increase overthe period early 1970s begin expansion.still, piece data interpretation publish data providesome support optimistic assessment. for example, acceleration productivity 1.2%rate last year, time unemployment rate drop level would suggestless productive worker draw on, leaf open possibility productivity trend

comparison isjustified least two reasons: first, cause traffic accident essentially samearound world, like cause bank crises. it therefore surprise almostall country adopt type rules, like speed limit case traffic, kind oflimitation risk exposure case banking. a second similarity bank systemsand traffic increase cross-border activity, air traffic, need forharmonisation national regulation grown. the minimum requirement bankingsupervision basle committee recently develop conjunction supervisorsin emerge market important step direction. today, i would like discus withyou background, advantage implementation core principles.backgroundl.banking crisis country new phenomenon all. in part worlda number country experience severe bank problem early 1980s. in westerncountries, notably scandinavian, bank community also face substantialdifficulties, albeit different nature. since mexico crisis 1995, awareness amongpolicy-makers potential damage result bank problem grownsignificantly. in emerge markets, bank problem often result much deep recessionsthan industrialise countries. generally, economy vulnerable bankingproblems almost financial intermediation carry banks. most industrialisedcountries le dependent banks, function financial intermediation alsoperformed institutional investor well-developed capital markets. since mexico crisis,it also recognise frequency bank problem significantly high inemerging markets. recent research show 85% severe bank crisis haveoccurred past fifteen year concern develop transition economies. myexplanation strike fact factor cause bank crisis generally moreprevalent, essentially different emerge market industrialise countries. thisbasic idea rationale behind common set core principle i would like discus withyou today.2.but short word way principle developedbecause show important development cooperation member thebasle committee countries. the principle first draft joint work groupconsisting number basle committee member representative 15 othercountries. subsequently lively exchange view take place meet basle inmarch year representative approximately 40 countries, include thechairmen regional groups, participated. to satisfaction consultation periodfollowing meet produce large number reactions, nearly favourable.these reaction incorporate core principles. to endorse final text theprinciples, similar meet one march take place september 10th basle.two week later, conjunction annual meet hong kong, imf baslecommittee co-sponsor conference introduce principle wide possible anaudience ministry finance central banks.bis review 79/1997 - 2 -3.as i said, main rational behind core principle increasedawareness among policy-makers bank crisis aggravate recessions. another reasonfor formulation core principle increase globalisation economic activity. withthe strong growth trade financial flow national economies, bank problem inone country much potential spread part world. a specific form ofglobalisation concern increase international activity large banks. policy makersgenerally welcome cross-border banking, beneficial effect efficiency,liquidity depth financial markets. however, internationalisation bank alsoincreases risk contagion bank problems. in order reduce risk, coreprinciples pay special attention supervision cross-border banking. on subject, themost important message core principle home country supervisor shouldpractise consolidate supervision internationally-active banks. in order enable homecountry supervisor fulfil task effectively, host country supervisor must shareinformation local operation foreign banks. finally, core principlesstate bank supervisor must require local operation foreign bank meet thesame high standard require domestic institutions.advantages4.you may wonder whether core principle really able reduce theseverity frequency bank problem around world. let try answer thisquestion review main cause bank crisis way coreprinciples deal causes. one important cause bank crisis macro-economicinstability. high variable inflation rates, boom bust economic activity exchangerate volatility complicate credit assessment banks. moreover, expansion phase ofa business cycle, often tendency towards over-optimism excessive lend bybanks, turn result asset price bubbles. this factor regard maincause current fragility japanese financial sector. thus, inadequate risk managementby bank frequently crucial link macro-economic instability bank problems.macro-economic instability average great emerge markets, reflect lessdiversification great structural rigidities. unsound fiscal monetary policy addfurther problem. a consequence, risk face bank emerge market tend tobe higher.5.the core principle formulate prudential regulation requirement order topromote framework control risk inherent banking. the application frameworkcan limit negative influence macro-economic volatility soundness financialsystem. the requirement concern cover capital adequacy, loan loss reserves, assetconcentrations, liquidity, risk management internal controls. of group principles, ithink regard risk management internal control deserve special attention. forexample, core principle 12 13 state bank supervisor must satisfy bankshave place risk management system accurately identify, measure, monitor controlmarket risk material risks. furthermore, bank require hold adequateamount capital risks. these principle reflect grow recognition banksbear principal responsibility adequate risk management themselves. the main task ofsupervisors set minimum standard monitor policy procedure throughwhich bank control risks.6.i would like emphasise adequate risk management bank reduce butnot eliminate negative effect macro-economic instability soundness financialsystems. but evident sound financial sector important precondition forbis review 79/1997 - 3 -macroeconomic stability. for instance, macro-economic stabilisation call monetarytightening, concern effect high interest rate loan portfolio weak banksmay delay policy action. in mexico, delay contribute sudden reversal capital flowsand deep recession 1995. these so-called feedback effect financial tomacro-economic instability underscore need application core principles.7.the second main cause financial fragility premature financial liberalisation.it widely recognise financial liberalisation promote competition among banks, therebyimproving efficient allocation financial resource long run. however, thetransition, bank manager supervisor often lack expertise deal high risksassociated new activity institution get involved. this lack ofexperience increase probability bank crises. moreover, increase competition fromforeign bank often encourage domestic bank finance risky investment order keep uptheir earnings. this chain event unfold emerge economies, also inwell-developed nordic country unite states. policy maker draw importantlesson bank crises, namely financial liberalisation precede astrengthening risk management system banks. the core principle regard riskmanagement internal control i discuss serve guide thesupervision risk management system adopt banks.8.the third culprit government involvement banking. one way whichgovernment policy undermine soundness bank mean tax treatment offinancial institutions. for example, tax system allow deduction loan lossprovisions taxable earn reduce incentive bank recognise loss atimely basis. a perhaps damage way government involvement use statebanks finance government expenditure market rates. this channel two apparentadvantages government; one thing, cheap, least short run. in addition,bank finance show official measurement budget deficit, whichreduces possibility public scrutiny. although state-owned bank prone thiskind political exploitation, privately-owned bank also function quasi-fiscal agents, forexample force lend particular sector industries. obviously, thesefinancing practice reduce viability bank medium long term.9.i would point that, political involvement bank tend occur morefrequently develop countries, restrict them. in south korea france, forexample, recent bank problem seem link least part government involvement.however, le wealthy country pressure government fund usually larger, whichincreases temptation turn state bank funding. the risk government influence onbanks emerge market also larger, state bank tend control much biggershare bank assets.10.core principle l contain description precondition effective bankingsupervision. in context problem relate government involvement, followingelements first principle seem particularly relevant. first, explanation coreprinciple 1 say supervisory agency posse operational independence pursuea sound bank system free political pressure. a second important precondition thateach supervisory agency adequate resource meet objective set. theseresources provide term undermine autonomy independence ofthe supervisory agency. the emphasis first core principle independence ofsupervisory agency important, first independent supervisor betterposition prevent political exploitation banks. and secondly limit forbearancebis review 79/1997 - 4 -in deal problem individual banks. a number bank crisis could beenprevented alleviate supervisory authority would independence theinstruments intervene timely adequate way.in addition, appendix core principle explicitly mention need forsupervisors apply supervisory method manner government-ownedcommercial bank commercial banks. the implementation advice alsoreduce opportunity government use state bank source cheap funding.ll.a relate cause bank problem connect lending, refer loansextended banks’ managers, shareholder party connect them. just like loan togovernments, loan connect party often grant non-arm’s length basis atbelow market rates. another similarity government involvement reason tobelieve connect lend serious problem emerge advancedeconomies. the risk connect lend encompass lack objectivity credit assessmentand undue concentration credit risk. core principle 10 explicitly address problem ofconnected lending. this principle state bank supervisor must placerequirements bank lend relate company individual arm’s length basis, thatsuch extension credit effectively monitored, appropriate step take tocontrol mitigate risks. moreover, core principle 9 call prudential limit restrictbank exposure single borrower group relate borrowers. if principle areimplemented global scale, raise significant barrier connect lending.12.i turn fourth set cause bank problems, labelledinadequate corporate governance. this term refer absence right incentive structurefor bank owners, managers, depositor supervisor show prudent behaviour. perhaps thebest way throw light type problem mean well-known example,namely downfall u save loan institutions. in early 1980s, supervisoryauthorities u seek way enable save loan institutions, generallyin bad shape, continue business. the range activity institution werepermitted engage expanded, capital standard relax level depositinsurance increased. a consequence, many save loan institution try growout problem invest high-risk assets, property so-called ‘junkbonds’. the point depositor content finance risky investments, ofthe generosity u deposit insurance time. moreover, low capital standards,equity holder owner little lose. finally, bank regulation u penalisebank manager excessive risk-taking allow supervisor delay corrective measures.when property market start collapse mid-eighties, many save loansinstitutions become insolvent, eventually result loss least $150 billion theus taxpayers. in order prevent similar bank problems, bank regulation advance andemerging economy must incorporate right incentive participant bankingsystem.13.if look core principle find various sort incentive thisfield. firstly, principle 3 require license process consist of, among otherthings, assessment bank’s ownership structure well director seniormanagement. the explanation principle make clear supervisory agency doubtsthe integrity stand bank’s owner manager, authority preventa specific ownership structure appointment certain bank manager. in way, pastimprudent behaviour bank owner manager penalise exclude fromresponsible function bank sector.bis review 79/1997 - 5 -14.secondly, core principle 6 prescribe capital requirement bank shouldbe le establish so-called basle capital accord. the basle accord setsminimum capital requirement 8% risk-adjusted asset banks. bank capitalessentially serf three functions; base growth, provide cushion againstexceptional loss promote good governance. the governance function relate factthat shareholder money stake, strong incentive ensure banksare manage safe sound manner. regard loss-absorption function capital, itmust stress basle capital requirement consider minimum standard. inemerging economies, high minimum capital requirement seem appropriate, banksthere usually operate volatile therefore risky environment. i therefore welcomethe initiative supervisory authority argentina colombia, already raisedtheir minimum capital requirement 11.5 9% respectively.15.as example u thrift crisis showed, design deposit insurancedeserves special attention. the second appendix core principle contain balance viewon delicate issue, summarise follows: on one hand, deposit insuranceis desirable limit effect problem one bank might banks.this obviously increase stability financial system. however, deposit insurance canalso increase risk imprudent behaviour banks, depositor le inclinedto withdraw fund even bank pursue high-risk strategies. therefore, government shouldincorporate mechanism system depositor protection prevent excessive risk-takingby banks. this example achieve partial deposit insurance, depositor stillhave fund risk. another method withhold deposit insurance large, institutionalinvestors. the precise form program tailor specific circumstance ofeach country.16.the last item list crisis factor poor market infrastructure. it iswidely accept imperfect account systems, limit disclosure practice inadequatelegal framework hind effective bank supervision market discipline. again, thesedeficiencies pronounce develop countries, deserve continuous effort forimprovement develop country well. the first problem concern accuracy ofaccounting systems. in many countries, account standard classify bank loan asnon-performing tight enough prevent bank make bad loan look good. ifnon-performing loan systematically understate properly provide against,figures profitability bank capital become meaningless. on disclosure side, theability distinguish healthy unhealthy bank often hamper absence financialstatements consolidate basis. difference account standard across country theabsence serious penalty publish inaccurate information also obstruct meaningfulassessment banks. finally, legal system sometimes impede prudent banking, examplewhen hind bank seize collateral behind delinquent loans.17.core principle 21 relate information requirement bank organisations,which important part market infrastructure. this principle state bankingsupervisors must satisfy bank maintain adequate record draw accordancewith consistent account policy practices. this information enable supervisor toobtain true fair view financial condition profitability banks. bank shouldalso publish financial statement fairly reflect condition regular basis. moreover.the explanation principle prescribe bank provide false misleadinginformation, supervisory action criminal prosecution take individualsinvolved institution.bis review 79/1997 - 6 -18.having elaborate contribution core principle make towardsalleviating main cause bank problems, i think time overall assessment.first all, would illusion think global application core principle byitself prevent financial crisis occur future. a i already mention regard tocapital standards, core principle contain minimum requirements. individual countries,particularly emerge areas, therefore consider extent need tosupplement core principle requirement address particular risk financialsystems. moreover, bank supervision dynamic function need respond changesin marketplace. therefore, principle need periodic, necessarily frequent,refinement readjustment. finally, core principle provide guideline bank regulation.i hope description cause financial crisis make clear financial stability notonly require prudential behaviour banks, also macro-economic stability, transparentgovernment budget adequate legal framework. in areas, withgovernment policy, world bank international monetary fund make importantcontribution financial stability.implementation19.in near future, implementation core principle toppriority. of course main burden lie government individual countries.i don’t underestimate wide-ranging legal, infrastructural educational change theimplementation principle call large number countries. every country shouldput place ambitious program clear time-frames implementation. it obviousthat imf world bank lead role regard monitor theimplementation core principles. the main argument structure theinternational financial institution already send mission almost country

3 -bis review 82/1997measures prevent occurrence deflationary spiral, strengthen confidence offirms household economic outlook, thereby place japanese economy apath self-sustained recovery.as aware, japanese economy face medium long-termchallenges overcome after-effects burst economic “bubble” andreforming industrial structure. the economy therefore achieve recovery whileaddressing weighty challenges. further, since latter half 1996, measure fiscalconsolidation implemented, include reduce public-sector investment araising consumption tax rate. in order economy attain noninflationary,sustainable growth circumstances, force self-sustained recovery achievedin private sector need strengthened. it therefore bank’s judgment that, atthis point, necessary monitor economic development carefully bear mind.second, criticism that, viewpoint income distribution,the current low interest rate put general public disadvantage. the bank fullyaware difficult situation face household depend heavily interestincome. however, various type income, whether wages, interest, pensions, aredistributed total output produce economic activity. therefore, without growth ofthe total output, source income generated. if policy interest rate raisedbefore economic activity sufficiently revitalize and, result, economy adverselyaffected, long-term interest rate may actually decline. it difficult say theaverage level short long-term deposit interest rate affected. what i wish toemphasize order overall level interest rate rise, must therequisite improvement economic activity.third, concern low interest rate may encourage outflowof domestic funds. in discuss point, must remember relationship betweencross-border interest rate differential capital flow present float exchange ratesystem differ fix exchange rate system.under latter, foreign exchange risk. therefore, fund tend flowto economy high interest rates. this precisely why, system, strictregulation capital flow necessary.under float exchange rate system, however, capital flow notnecessarily occur. even one attempt profit differential domestic andoverseas interest rates, profit wipe instantly even slight shift theexchange rate. for example, overseas interest rate rise, widen interest rate differentials,capital outflow may initially occur, cause foreign currency appreciate domesticcurrency depreciate. after time, however, expectation emerge value theforeign currency start decline. at point, benefit invest foreigncurrency decrease significantly. thus, foreign exchange risk take intoconsideration, situation expect rate return foreign currency investment issubstantially high domestic investment cannot sustained.under float exchange rate system, therefore, exchange rate fluctuationswill apply brake one-sided capital flow. the long-term interest rate differentialbetween japan unite state around 2 4 percent recent years, haswidened time. it true time investment foreign bond increased. -

5 -bis review 82/1997this ultimate objective price stability, direct objective ensure price stability.price stability, together stability financial system, precondition money tosmoothly perform intrinsic functions. a issuer controller money, maintenance ofprice stability inherent role central bank.it is, however, easy define price stability. there diverse type priceindicators: example, consumer price index, wholesale price indexes, gdpdeflator. each limitation, range item cover time ofrelease. further, many study conduct recently possibility theseindicators offer substantially bias measurement prices. even perfectly reliableprice indicator, still disparate view regard specific percentage priceincreases would acceptable.thus, difficult define specifically mean price stability. we atthe bank continue study issue, include interpretation price indices. itbecomes clearer, however, matter consider viewpoint implication ofprice stability economic activity.“prices”, sometimes refer “prices general”, average level theprices individual good services, serve tool measure relative rise fall inthe price individual good services. therefore, price general fluctuatesignificantly, firm household would able conduct efficient investment andconsumption activity.for example, inflationary economy, even price firm’s productrises, firm able judge whether bring increase earn thefuture, whether merely reflect rise price general price increase offsetby increase wage cost raw materials. in economy, firm will, longterm, inevitably become cautious investments. furthermore, concernsabout inflation, people tend curtail spending. the situation may arise thecase deflationary economy. one possible example japanese economy 1995,when concern deflationary spiral.this line think lead conclusion ensure price stability meansmaintaining situation firm household need concern continuingrise fall price future plan investment consumption.2. the relationship price stability economyhaving define price stability, may still question relationshipbetween price stability important policy objective economic variables. forexample, care economy economic growth long price remainstable? what relationship price foreign exchange rate asset prices?first, regard relationship price economy, truethat short term, seem high economic growth could realize certain levelof price increase allowed. however, recently prove theoretically andempirically effect temporary.if process repeated, economy may well fall intractablesituation stagflation, economy fall back recession high inflation -

that, time, new zealand dollardid indeed seem somewhat over-valued basis, though note that, theextent productivity growth high new zealand trade partners, onewould expect see exchange rate rise somewhat fast inflation differential alonewould suggest.i difficulty acknowledge fact appreciation thenew zealand dollar floor around 53 (on trade-weighted basis) january 1993 to69.3 march 1997, increase 30 percent four years, put significant pressureon great many exporters. but four point need make qualification.first, likely exchange rate 53 trade-weighted basis wasas unsustainable exchange rate 69.3. neither represent ‘equilibrium’ level theexchange rate, measure exchange rate appreciation artificially low level riskscreating quite false impression.secondly, acknowledge pressure rise exchange rate from1993 early 1997 place exporters, i bind express degree cynicism theway producer board describe impact. to hear tell it, impactof rise exchange rate gross income farmer orchardists theimpact exchange rate net incomes, course correct. granted, ourland-based export industry heavy user imports, use diesel, usetractors, use fertilisers, heavily affect cost transport andfrom farm-gate. and net income still spend money petrol familycar, still buy clothes, still buy good imported. the new zealanddollar price item would significantly high last year itnot appreciation currency. indeed, likely wage increase wouldalso significantly high currency appreciation. so theincrease new zealand dollar recent year undoubtedly severe impact ongross farm incomes, impact farmers’ live standard rather le severe.thirdly, exchange rate appreciation clearly make matter worse, thebasic problem face land-based exporter inflation-adjusted, real, price ofmany item produce declining, long period. the newzealand meat wool boards’ economic service tell 1948 (prior thekorean war boom) 1996, inflation-adjusted price lamb fell 45 percent usmarket; price dairy product fell 55 percent; price beef fell 69 percent; andthe price wool fell 79 percent. i don’t know anybody notice price ofkiwifruit u market 1948, i still recall 1982, 15 year ago, theorchard-gate price new zealand kiwifruit $11 per tray. nobody yet know willrealise 1997, orchard-gate price year’s crop is, say, $4.30 per tray, willbe inflation-adjusted fall orchard-gate price 85 percent 15 year - - 4 -bis review 78/1997that period new zealand dollar fall quite substantially thecurrencies virtually trade partners, especially japanese yen thegerman mark, two currency direct relevance kiwifruit exports. the basic realityis market price kiwifruit fall substantially time.and case new zealand exporter feel hard do reality, rememberthat substantial fall inflation-adjusted price common commodities, andindeed great many good service well. productivity improves, andinternational competition often ensure benefit improvement pass toconsumers, rather retain producers. reflect huge fall real price ofcomputers - fall dwarf fall suffer new zealand land-based exporter - theprice television sets, motor vehicles, international air travel, long-distancetelephone calls. large price fall mean unique product new zealandexports. to remain viable, producer must constantly seek new way improveproductivity add value, successfully, maintain profitabilitydespite trend decline prices.finally, apart altogether tendency price many commodity todecline long term, commodity price tend volatile recent year volatilityhas tend swamp impact exchange rate trends. the best illustration experienceof beef farmer three year middle 1996: fall farm-gate price bullbeef period, three-quarters cause fall overseas market prices,and le one-quarter rise exchange rate. in words, fall marketprice bull beef substantially great impact farmer effect theincrease exchange rate. our land-based exporter operate inherently volatile markets,and would face major swing price even if, way, new zealand dollar could behold absolutely

depend perception andreactions great many people, abroad, indeed central bank aredoing expect do.what do? in small open economy like new zealand, impossible toignore fact monetary policy affect

trade-weighted exchange rate would average - 8 -bis review 78/1997around 67.3, 90 day interest rate would average around 7 percent. we also explicitlyrecognised mix condition changed, short-term track

the theory build around parityrelations help u understand foreign exchange market better, but, rarely give usready-made solution problem arise day-to-day, say, minute-to-minute operationsin exchange

maintain range 15.0 - 15.5 per cent keepthe inflation rate around 6.0 per cent. monetary policy would, words, continue bedirected towards maintain stable financial environment relation price, interest rate andexchange rate.6. against broad parameters, look variable abearing contemporary exchange rate management. some crucial variable thisjuncture, apart price stability money supply, always dominant, are, myview, revenue expenditure position government, oil pool deficit, buoyancyin industrial activity, progress infrastructure sector, development trade andcapital flows. besides, lead lag

economy appear slow near trend rate second quarter,after surprisingly robust growth previous quarter. the underlie fundamental theexpansion continue look quite positive. there solid momentum employment income,financial condition highly supporting, consumer confidence soar record levels.i see obstacle continuation expansion, growth near trend, through1998.there judgment two key issue outlook relate monetarypolicy focus interaction among growth, utilization rate inflation. first, willgrowth rebound above-trend rate, raise utilization rate still further? second, areprevailing utilization rate already high inflation begin rise, even growthremains trend? these question i raise first speech come - 3 -board, september 1996. they key question affect judgment theappropriate posture monetary policy last year, remain relevant today.answers questionslet briefly turn specific question raise letterof invitation subject congressman frank’s comment april 24 speech.what i think nairu concept usefulness today?nairu stand non-accelerating inflation rate unemployment. therelationship inflation unemployment, base nairu, call phillips curve.according concept, threshold level unemployment rate(nairu) supply demand balance labor market (and perhaps theproduct market well). this balance yield constant inflation rate. you ask therelationship full employment inflation. in model, relationshipbetween full employment inflation. at full employment, define rate ofunemployment equal nairu, inflation constant, constant level inflation ispossible full employment. the rate inflation long run therefore determine bythe unemployment rate all. it determine rate growth money supply. this ofcourse give monetary policy unique responsibility inflation long run.if unemployment rate fall threshold, inflation rise time,indefinitely, progressively, without limit. it process fee upon itself, onceinflation begin rise, price increase fee wage increases. the basic framework isbased supply demand. at nairu, supply demand balanced, inflation stable,matched expect inflation. the trigger increase inflation excess demand laborand goods. the unemployment rate proxy balance supply demand thelabor market, degree excess demand. historically balance supply anddemand product market -- is, final good service -- closely parallel thebalance labor market, unemployment rate effectively summarize therelationship supply demand product market labor market.it always case application nairu concept beenmore difficult practice theory. sometimes, phillips curve make large errors;occasionally equation underpredicted considerable period time. thevalue nairu also vary time, example, response change thecomposition labor force. of course, nairu move frequently without explanation, theconcept would useful, either forecast policymaking. but fact that,relative equation use forecast macroeconomic performance, phillips curve wasone reliable, reliable equation, 15 year prior 1994.during period nairu either appear relatively constant move predictably withchanging labor force composition. more recently, run over-predictions,beginning late 1994 wage last year prices. these error veryheart challenge explain recent surprisingly favorable performance thechallenge set monetary policy today. i turn possible source errorsbelow.the accompany table provide outside estimate nairu. the sourcesinclude congressional budget office (cbo), president’s council economic adviser - 4 -(cea), develops, along omb treasury, economic assumption underlyingthe administration’s budget projections; two lead model-based forecast firm -- dri andmacroeconomic advisors; estimate professor robert gordon northwesternuniversity, i consider lead academic authority nairu. all represent inthe table view nairu central important concept forecast inflation andidentifying long-run value actual unemployment rate gravitate. the range ofestimates 5.4% 5.9%. professor gordon’s work suggest that, fall coupleof years, nairu stabilized, remain unchanged past year.obviously, i alone use concept important policy work. forexample, budget projections, cbo discipline assume unemploymentrate gradually gravitate nairu. if begin unemployment rate estimateof nairu, cbo assume period below-trend growth allow unemployment rate toreturn estimate nairu prevent ongoing increase rate inflation.this model forecast upon budget deal based.outside estimate current nairu trend gdp growth(percent)organization nairu trend gdp growthmacro adviser 5.9 2.2dri 5 ¾ 2.3cea 5.5 2.1cbo 5.8

growth. but u isdedicated make discipline judgment economy.i say several occasion (1) i continue believe nairu animportant useful concept; (2) i believe nairu low recently inthe 1980s. i believe nairu decline 6% end 1980s 5 ½%currently. however, always case certainly true today, uncertaintyabout precise estimate nairu. clearly, many believe higher, reflect thistable. some also believe lower. i constantly re-evaluate estimate nairu lightof recent data.how fast economy grow?the next question ask fast economy grow. over shortrun, depend amount slack economy. once economy move tocapacity, maximum sustainable growth rate limit rate productivecapacity expand time. this limit generally refer trend growth. productivecapacity expand increase physical input (labor capital) ofimprovements technology -- people work good equipment. once fullemployment reached, labor force expand increase work age population,augmented trend labor force participation rate. the contribution growth 1nairu use cpi. current nairus pce deflator gdp deflator 5.3 5.55 percent, respectively. - 5 -capital stock technological improvement summarize growth laborproductivity.the accompany table also provide outside estimate trend growth. notethey fall within narrow range, 2% per year. there littlechange estimate recent years. about half increase trend gdp attributableto long-term trend labor force growth half long-erm trend productivitygrowth. the narrowness range estimate table suggest absence ofan important degree uncertainty trend growth i consider next sectionsome reason trend growth could turn higher.if output grow trend rate, resource utilization rate generally beconstant. if output grow fast trend rate, demand increase relative supply andresource utilization rate rise. at point, above-trend growth raise utilization ratesto point excess demand put upward pressure inflation.note trend growth cause inflation. the high trend rate ofgrowth, better, chairman greenspan note yesterday testimony. and whileabove-trend growth raise inflation, raise utilization rate which, somepoint, result high inflation. i come back think i answer yourquestion rationale march 25 policy action.how explain recent favorable performance inflation unemployment?the answer here, unfortunately, well i would like. it important, aforecaster policymaker, understand much know little know. in thisspirit, i believe recent performance economy degree puzzle. i cannotsolve puzzle completely, i quite sure factor importantand i speculate factor might important. in final analysis, wehave make monetary policy answers, though constantlyreview model light new data refine thinking.the clear perhaps important factor temporary confluence offavorable supply shock last couple years; favorable supply shocks, i refer todevelopments recently low price slow rate increase price ofspecific goods, unrelated overall balance supply demand u labor andproduct markets. the list favorable shock well know generally widely appreciated.first, non-oil import price declined, due large measure appreciation dollarfrom mid 1995 early 1997. this low price import good andconstrained price power domestic firm compete imports. second, cost ofemployee benefit rise slowly, especially cost employer-provided health care,tempering rise compensation per hour. third, recently, energy price declinedsharply year food price increase le rapidly. fourth, price computer isfalling even faster, reflecting, part, rapid pace technical change.some believe collection temporary factor fully account therecent favorable performance inflation view entirely implausible. but i donot hold view. i believe long last factor may also contributing. onepossibility intrigue anomaly current expansion. i note change inutilization rate labor good market (the unemployment rate capacityutilization rate) usually mirror one another cycle. in current episode, two - 6 -measures diverge great degree typical past. this divergence islikely relate another define feature expansion, investment boom hasraised level net investment point capital stock expand rapidly,raising capacity prevent increase demand overtake supply. theunemployment rate signal labor market tight; capacity utilization rateindicates supply demand well balanced, least industrial sector theeconomy. a result, upward pressure wages, pass-through tohigher price inflation. firm report absence price leverage nothing give firmpricing power like excess demand apparent excess demand u.s. firms,especially global market place plenty slack abroad.the intrigue explanation recent favorable performance arestructural change may expand limit productive capacity trend growth.these possibility come two forms: structural change labor market lowersnairu structural change product market, specifically high productivity growth,which, least temporarily also low nairu, push limit trendgrowth.one explanation sustain stable inflation lowerunemployment worker insecurity hypothesis. accord theory, corporaterestructuring, globalization, technological change increase workers’ insecurity abouttheir jobs. a result, worker will accept restraint real wage inorder increase prospect remain employed, lead moderate rate ofincrease wage would otherwise occur give rate unemployment.while consistent decline nairu, cannot precisely test workerinsecurity hypothesis itself. but fit fact current labor marketexperience. my conclusion nairu declined, even take account role oftemporary factors, though i cannot pin definitely source decline. i simplyadjusting estimate data. the worker insecurity hypothesis possible explanation.an example product market structural change would increase trendproductivity growth. this clearly intrigue potential explanations, becauseit tie together many puzzles. it explain midst investment boom,why profit share income rising, inflation well contained, whystock price soared. the problem data. it true productivity increasedmore rapidly recently. this clear-cut evidence shift productivity trend,however, productivity normally accelerate output growth rises, thelast year. there is, however, support view experience speed-up inthe trend rate productivity growth. for example, measure productivity incomeside rather product side national accounts, observe sharp acceleration inproductivity. this income-side measure productivity provide least tantalize hint anincrease trend productivity growth. this would also consistent considerable numberof report business realize new efficiency production, throughcorporate reorganization application new technology.what rationale march 25 tightening?the discussion rationale march 25 policy move follow mypersonal view. during period june 1996, i join board, february1997, utilization rate remain narrow range, case unemploymentrate shade estimate nairu. recall unemployment rate average - 7 -5.4% 1996. there risk utilization rate already high inflationmight increase time, risk clear enough, judgment, justify action. iviewed growth either close trend already slow trend, imply wasnegligible risk utilization rate would rise further. so, march 25, federalreserve’s posture one “watchful waiting,” asymmetric directive, base thejudgment risk weight toward high inflation.in march, view sufficient momentum growth justify aforecast utilization rate would rise materially further, absence change policy.the policy action clearly preemptive one, base inflation pressure evident thetime, inflation pressure likely emerge absence policy action. a thechairman repeatedly emphasized, lag response monetary policy make imperativethat monetary policy forward look anticipatory, backward look reactive.one principle prudent monetary policy management, judgment,is lean gently cyclical winds. this mean growth trend andutilization rate increasing, often prudent allow short-term rate rise. monetarypolicy sit interest rate wait economy blow capacity inflationtakes off. to would risk serious boom-bust cycle, would require abrupt decisiveincreases interest rate late regain control inflation. a small, cautious step early therecipe avoid necessity sharp destabilize move late on.what record show? growth much strong first quarter ihad anticipate appear slow trend second quarter. the legacy therobust first-quarter growth decline unemployment rate 5% secondquarter. i call march 25 move, result, “just-in-time” monetary policy. i believe wasprudent. i vote favor i think would help prolong expansion andcontribute goal maximum sustainable employment maximum sustainable growth. ms. rivlin report positive perfomance u economy thepolicies need sustain growth future testimony vice chairman board ofgovernors u federal reserve system, ms.

policy extremely favorablemoment economic history. all often congressional hear call something badis happening. in deteriorate situation, congress find necessary survey damage, assessresponsibility call good policy future.at moment, however, economy whole function amazingly well.employment high rising, unemployment low, income increasing, profit high, thefederal budget deficit plummeting, state local finance increasingly strong, inflation isbenign. the override economic objective -- share participant economy -- keepthe good news flowing. we want economy grow high sustainable rate, keepunemployment inflation low, all, avoid recession long possible.thoughtful people, federal reserve elsewhere, somewhat differentviews economy well best keep going. your invitation toshare view timely, constructive welcome.i would like briefly discus three questions:1.why economy perform well -- and, particular, haveso little inflation low unemployment?2.why important, especially right now, keep economy grow atits high sustainable rate avoid recession?3.what policy -- monetary economic policy -- likely tokeep economic performance high sustained?why economy well?most economist frankly surprise economy able grow fastenough push unemployment rate 5 percent without generate accelerate inflation. untilrecently, student economy think unemployment rate 5.5 - 6.0 percent(estimates differed) appreciable period would lead rise labor cost would pass onin high price start self-perpetuating wage-price spiral would hard reverse. true,unemployment low 1960s inflation remain low, structure theeconomy characteristic labor force subsequently change way seem makethe economy inflation-prone give level unemployment. the experience periodsince 1970 appear confirm inflationary pressure emerge unemployment ratesappreciably high 1960s.five year ago, economist would think federal reserveirresponsible derelict duty use monetary policy slow economy operatingat high level unemployment remain 5.5 percent short time. theinflation might appear immediately, think inevitable, allow get ahead steam act take high risk react strongly, perhaps stronglyenough bring recession.nevertheless, unemployment rate 5.5 percent year andbelow 5.0 percent 1997 inflation show sign pick -- indeed, producer pricesbis review 72/1997 - 2 -have actually falling. the federal reserve, except quarter point tighten federalfunds rate march (after month inaction), leave monetary lever alone. be federalreserve ignore risk future inflation?the answer depend whether coexistence high growth lowerunemployment benign inflation explain fundamental improvement structure ofthe economy make le inflation-prone, temporary factor might return “normal” andkick-off inflationary wage-price spiral, combination two. the honest answer is:we know yet.one surprise tight labor market result rapidincreases wage labor compensation. part explanation, chairman greenspannoted testimony july 22, may lie le aggressive behavior part workers.workers may reluctant previously bargain high compensation take drasticaction, strike quit look good job. they may reluctant areinsecure face rapidly change technology, fear may rightskills, recent memory company “downsizing,” le likelythan previous tight labor market member union. these explanation le aggressiveworker behavior plausible, likely temporary. worker likely get insecureas low unemployment continues, union strength unlikely ebb further.part explanation moderate compensation increase may also lie moreaggressive employer resistance labor cost increase previous cycles. business owner andmanagers appear believe strongly operate competitive environment --whether domestic international -- cannot pas cost increase customer inhigher price would lose customer competitor overseas street.low import price result grow international competition strong dollar reinforcethis perception. domestic market also become fiercely competitive result ofderegulation, low transportation communication costs, competitive business attitudes.these competitive forces, well know workers, may give employer plausible reason -- atleast excuse -- strong resistance wage benefit demands.the subdue inflation rate itself, moreover, dampen inflationary expectations.these low expectation contribute diminish compensation demand worker stifferemployer resistance demands. an important contribution low total compensation costshas also come slowdown rise health benefit cost associate shift tomanaged care general reduction rate health care inflation. it yet clear howmuch slowdown temporary.the surprise price show reaction moderate compensationincreases occurred. increase foreign domestic competitiveness certainly part theanswer, remarkable fact competition generally erode profit margins.persistent high profit suggest that, average, employer able increase productivityenough absorb large compensation increase without comparable price increases. whether theywill able continue crucial unanswered question face monetary policy maker atthe moment. measure productivity grow slowly two decade notaccelerate expansion economist hop would. nevertheless, output per hour seem tohave pick little recently, surprise late expansion productivity increasenormally slows. if productivity growth verge sustain acceleration, possibilitydiscussed chairman greenspan's testimony, would greatly increase chance highersustained growth without accelerate inflation. there reason optimistic, time willtell optimist right.bis review 72/1997 - 3 -why sustain growth important now?it always desirable live economy grow healthy rate. thegeneral standard live rise average people normally good off. not privateresources grow, give consumer good choices, public resource also grow, make iteasier solve public problem improve national community infrastructure. healthy growthhas sustainable, buy price environmental degradation inflationary overheatingthat turn boom bust.nevertheless, least three reason seem especially important theunited state next year everything possible keep economy grow ahealthy sustainable rate avoid recession.welfare reformrecent legislation require extremely ambitious state federal effort reducedependency channel large portion present future welfare population self-supporting jobs. for effort even moderately successful require effective skill trainingand job placement, adequate child care and, all, low unemployment rate plentiful entrylevel jobs. if economic expansion continue labor market remain tight, good chancethat many family would otherwise depend welfare acquire job skill andexperience enable live independent satisfy lives. if economy slidesinto recession welfare recipient time establish new skills, work pattern eligibilityfor unemployment benefits, welfare reform almost certain failure, outright disaster.community developmentpartnerships community development begin create

could transform many blight area viable community withdecent house economic base. recession, especially deep one, would dry public andprivate resource greatly reduce chance successful community

makethat increase future workforce productivity feasible. slow growth repeat recession couldmake burden age population far heavy policy choice contentious.what policy needed?these three challenge american economy simply reinforce need keepthe economy high sustainable growth track attainable keep recession shallow andinfrequent possible. the big problem monetary policy moment one knowswhat growth rate sustainable. it may true structure economy change waysbis review 72/1997 - 4 -that make high growth rate sustainable without inflation think possible year ago-- may true. the question turn whether productivity growth shift thedoldrums last couple decades. it's possible has, mean certain.this leaf monetary policymakers difficult job watch signs,weighing risk make new judgment call every weeks. at moment, seem tobe little risk economy slow much near term slide recession.growth already slow clearly unsustainable pace first quarter, currentsigns point continue economic expansion rest year next. the risksseem high side -- many factor hold inflationary pressure willprove temporary, rebound productivity necessary high sustainable growth notoccur prove robust durable. the federal open market committee weigh risk ofslowing economy unnecessarily risk wait long put brakeson hard later. wait long may increase possibility overheat follow recession. it'sa tough call. i can't promise make right decisions, i promise try.it important overestimate role monetary policy federalreserve. monetary policy help keep economy fall sustainable growth track ineither direction -- either overheat generate enough inflation unbalance economyand threaten growth chug along slowly excessive unemployment. but monetarypolicy cannot much determine high sustainable growth rate is. how fast economycan grow determine rapidly employ labor force increase fast theproductivity workforce growing. there two way get output: either morepeople work work people produce (or both).in 1960s 1970s, american workforce grow rapidly largebaby boom generation reach work age women, especially mothers, move theworkforce much large proportion previously. but two trend run course.the labor force likely grow

think i would saysomething monetary policy, role riksbank change status theriksbank recently gain support five political party sweden’s parliament,including centre party.1. monetary policy role riksbankwhy low inflation?in past decade grow awareness low inflation’simportance central condition proper work economy. this casenot sweden virtually throughout western world. the significance price

good example sweden’s real estate boom 1980s. the combination ofhigh inflation tax system time mean speculative capital attract theproperty market. finance productive investment become comparatively difficult. wheninflation fell back early 1990s become apparent investment real estate hadbeen found unrealistic expectation price would continue rise. the property marketcollapsed credit institution

waspublished fortnight ago.2. the economic situationactivity strengtheningin period since 1993, economic activity sweden turn upwards afterthe profound crisis, growth annual term average 2.7 per cent, high wewere accustom inflationary period 1970s 1980s. the growth also afavourable composition, come primarily export investment. this contribute toa period expansion without appreciable capacity

webelieve tend make increase relatively cautious.gdp growth 1996 hold back destocking continue fall publicconsumption investment. we envisage stock adjustment come end.together increase consumption continuation strong exports, meansthat outlook growth come year relatively bright. our assessment thatgrowth 1997 amount approximately 2 per cent, follow 3 per cent 1998.bis review 68/1997 - 4 -inflation line targetthe path inflation largely depend growth relation economy’slong-term potential output - word gap actual potential outputchanges - well inflation expectation different economic agents.the riksbank consider 5 per cent growth come year compatiblewith low inflation, mainly general economy plenty unutilised capacity. inother word output gap, affect by, example, labour market

everyone knows, positive pave wayfor low consumer prices. another consequence le evident therefore worthunderscoring that, far change affect outlook inflation, provideroom somewhat le tight monetary

expectations; newwage settlement conclude 1997 show downward shift rate wageincreases compare 1996, towards level line theriksbank’s inflation target.the riksbank’s overall assessment come two year underlyingrate inflation 1.5 2 per cent. register inflation, however, rise bydegrees disappearance transitory effect push cpi recentmonths. the register rate probably remain inflation target 1997 thenmove towards two per cent 1998. against background, inflation report theriksbank consider monetary stance well balanced.forecasting inflation couple year ahead is, everyone appreciates, verydifficult matter. so good cause humble. in inflation report highlighteda number factor may cause inflation follow different path. a weak exchange ratethan assume strong increase consumption could result high inflation. theopposite effect could come from, example, good productivity growth different pictureof resource utilisation. for riksbank therefore important continuously ass newinformation may provide guidance path inflation.3. two questionsthe picture sweden’s economy i paint thus far relatively bright. thisis warranted. the economy go deep recession policy realignment thebis review 68/1997 - 5 -early 1990s. difficult adjustment make begin see results.there many resemblance denmark country experience similarprocesses adjustment earlier. in every case take time situation become morestable household firm recover confidence.however, bright picture must blind u continue presence seriouschallenges economic policy. for one thing importance secure soundgovernment finance long run. for another situation labour market. ichoose raise two question happen fiscal policy labourmarket great consequence riksbank’s ability safeguard value money. itwould therefore almost dereliction duty place matter agenda asclearly distinctly able.fiscal policy monetary policy’s manoeuvrabilitylet begin fiscal policy. since dramatic deterioration governmentfinance early 1990s remarkable recovery. from deficit equivalent toover 12 per cent gdp 1993 government count deficit 2 per cent 1997.this consolidation, besides attract praise european union internationalorganisations, earn confidence creditors; since 1995 interest rate differentialbetween swedish german treasury bond narrow 3.5 little 1percentage point.even sek 16 billion expansionary measure fiscal 1998 thegovernment propose spring economic bill, swedish budget trend look favourablein european context.notwithstanding successes, reason comment briefly fiscalpolicy influence condition monetary policy thereby future development ofinterest rates. this influence act two ways.firstly, fiscal policy important consideration monetary policy itaffects demand situation economy. an illustration provided, example, bythe recent years’ change household disposable income. although household wage incomerose strongly 1994 1997, sector’s disposable income hardly changed. householdincome hold back increase tax decrease transfers; negativeeffects change public systems, annual level household income would 3 to4 per cent higher. the burden household income probably great 1996 even inthe come two year fiscal stance measure way tight. it accordinglyhelping low inflationary pressure.if, current situation good prospect growth, unexpected budgetimprovements use give fiscal policy expansionary turn, result might bean early need tighten monetary policy order secure objective price stability. it isthen mean certain overall effect demand would intended.secondly, fiscal trend long context “sustainability” also importantfor monetary policy. if government deficit appear grow uncontrollably, thecase year early 1990s, uncertainty may arise whether problem betackled all. this negative consequence monetary policy; exchange rate mayweaken sharply, instance, increase risk inflation. the budget consolidation hasbis review 68/1997 - 6 -naturally important respect, too. it main single explanation krona’sappreciation since crisis years, well riksbank position lowerinterest rate markedly.as result year massive general government deficits, however, from1990 1996 public sector debt grow 44 per cent gdp 78 per cent. this restrictsthe future freedom action economic policy mean risk fiscal policy inpractice destabilise effect. this particularly case that, high revenue andspending ratios, swedish budget sensitive cyclical factors. see angle thegovernment’s target 2 per cent budget surplus economic cycle appear reasonable,though academic foundation quantify level ambition. there may groundsfor strategic tax cut improve long-term growth potential. but light theexperience government finance recent decade warn issue taxcuts without parallel cut spending.weak employmentthe labour market trend recent year bleak. although annualeconomic growth since 1993 average 2.7 per cent, employment risen. this indicatesthat considerable proportion unemployment structural sense level liableto remain high even activity continue improve.the difficulty generate new job confine sweden; problemwe common much europe. but country europe succeededin turn employment curve upwards since mid 1980s. i think particular thenetherlands, employment, long period stagnation, increase 20 to25 per cent since mid 1980s. in course decade unemployment virtuallyhalved, 12 6 per cent.of course one cannot certain countries’ solution apply swedishconditions every respect. but important note gdp growth netherlands hasbeen fairly close eu average even though employment develop differently.so high demand past decade lie behind creation somany new job netherlands. most evidence suggest traditional demandmanagement capable low unemployment appreciably. instead work ofthe labour market wage formation key factor possibility turn pathof unemployment. that effort must made.such effort might make possible combine low inflation betterdevelopment employment. they could contribute increase confidence economicpolicy whole. at time seem tendency problem unemployment togenerate uncertainty economic policy’s long-term commitment. reform thefields wage formation labour market mitigate potential conflict betweeneconomic policy’s goals. that would improve condition continue fall level ofinterest rate relative rest world, even situation sweden stay outside theeuro area time being.bis review 68/1997 - 7 -4. summarytoday, future prospect swedish economy bright many respects.the consolidation government budget, accompany grow confidence andsupport low inflation policy, pave way mark reduction interest rates.this favour domestic demand. together continuation strong export favourableproductivity, point good condition growth come years, persistently lowinflation.at time major problem growth seem generatingnew job sufficient extent. this suggest high degree unemployment isstructural. measure must therefore take improve function labour market.for favourable economic

expectation fellow citizen who, whileappreciating confirmation (or renewal) price stability, look strong growthand, all, jobs. i share concern unreservedly. the current level ofunemployment majority country ethically unacceptable; lead thebis review 67/1997 - 2 -erosion social fabric and, waste represents, clear signal theeconomy function properly. reduce unemployment must prime objective ofaction authorities. but role monetary policy? in view shorttime available - plus fact cannot contradict - i shall brief. you mayperhaps feel i dogmatic: so, please bear me. i like make fourobservations.1. there doubt whatsoever monetary policy bring inflation undercontrol. when monetary policy flank appropriate budgetary policy, whenlabour market - also good service market - flexible, bring inflation undercontrol take time. it take time, also entail cost - could otherwise havebeen avoided. but even so, cost would still le (very high long-term) cost ofnot deal inflation. let u forget rich powerful protectthemselves loss purchase power money - many case evenbenefit loss - weak not-so-rich always losers. inflation hasalways major source social iniquity. in addition, prevent economy fromfunctioning properly, falsify signal give prices. the speculative boomin real estate market country end 1980s cause serious damage- still pay price.2. once inflation bring control, control beenconfirmed, monetary policy guide short-term interest rate level contribute tobalanced growth. quite number eu country situation already, short-terminterest rate around 3%. in others, inflation bring control morerecently, rate yet reach level approach gradually. the confirmationthat inflation bring control does, unfortunately, take time. finally, onemajor country see rapid growth several year unemploymenthas fall remarkably, short-term interest rate raise - apply principle ofpreventive medicine.3. now, say long-term interest rates, also animportant role play stimulate growth - perhaps even important one thanshort-term rates?monetary policy influence level rates, itsinfluence exclusive cannot even predict direction influence withcertainty. at particular point time, first group country i refer amoment ago, nominal long-term interest rate historically low level - well below6% - real long-term interest rate regarded, perhaps, still high putcontinental europe road vigorous growth.i doubtful whether ease monetary policy group ofcountries would able help move yield curve desire direction. it could actuallyhave opposite effect - investor perceive herald weak euro. in event, giventhe current level short-term interest rates, monetary policy’s margin manoeuvre isextremely limited.it possible level real long-term interest rate europe reflects,partially least, real interest rate worldwide. europe influence effect.bis review 67/1997 - 3 -europe can, however, influence effect come theconstant increase public sector indebtedness countries. a reminder, endof 1991 end 1996 general government debt rise around 56 73% ofgdp european union whole. this development, together worry itmight yet run course, likely - say least - lead fall real interestrates. nor create climate confidence necessary consumer investor tomodify current prudent behaviour. on hand, certainty government aretackling underlie cause public deficit responsible constantincrease debt burden could well bring change behaviour. “faceless”markets one look beyond immediate present future - fellowcitizens are, too. the prospect self-perpetuating, ever-increasing deficit encouragethem spend more.4. strong growth would certainly beneficial effect employment. butit would eliminate large component unemployment - structural component. thiscan do mean measure remedy labour market rigidity reduce burdenof non-wage labour costs. it latter channel link effort create job task ofbringing public expenditure control. i observe, too, country whereunemployment fall substantially, job create exist enterprise - andespecially large enterprise - setting-up large number new enterprises,which necessarily small begin with.to conclude - allow me, will, quite blunt. yes, inflation hasbeen bring properly control, monetary policy must contribute supportingbalanced growth, balance growth depend monetary policy alone. both theacceleration viability growth rely contribution make otherpolicies. first, fiscal policy crowd private investment but, rather,fosters climate confidence implement credible process reforms. second, thatof policy create favourable fiscal, financial regulatory environment theproliferation new enterprises. and, growth foster way create manyjobs, structural policy assume principal role, role monetary policywill dwindle fade away - ala - nothing.bis review

hannoun, financial time european economic monetary unionconference london 20/11/97.i delight take part discussion framework singlemonetary policy stage three. i address i consider two main category ofissues context: relate monetary policy strategy one hand, thoserelated execution monetary policy operation hand; words,strategic operational issues.1. strategic issueswhat main strategic issue relate formulation singlemonetary policy? i consider turn:•the final objective,•the intermediate target,•the role exchange rate indicator, and•the start level interest rate euro area end next year.1.1. final objective: quantify definition price stabilitythe final objective single monetary policy clearly state themaastricht treaty: accord article 105, “the primary objective escb shall tomaintain price stability”. only monetary policy gear towards objective price stabilitycan create condition durable sustainable growth. to reach objective, threeconditions need, view, fulfilled:•firstly, monetary strategy set medium-term framework. more generally,the european policy mix consist medium-term stability-oriented monetarypolicy medium-term fiscal policy aim balance budget (or “close balance”as state stability pact).1 this medium-term stability-oriented policy mix bestwe create condition durable growth euro area. and widelyagreed european union policy mix give illusion finetune economy; 1 by urge government aim fiscal position close balance surplus medium term, thestability pact enable let automatic fiscal stabilizer come play recession without exceedingthe 3% reference value. in short, allow create fiscal buff normal economic period canbe draw asymmetric shock occurs.bis review 112/1997 - 2 -•secondly, strategy pursue provide clear anchor inflation expectations.this imply public announcement quantify definition final objective ofprice stability; instance, banque de france aim inflation rate exceed 2%;•thirdly, strategy base forward-looking approach. this thetransmission monetary policy decision economy take place relatively longlags. estimate lag interest rate change effect inflation varybetween one two years. a consequence, central bank look ahead theytake monetary policy decisions. a case point recent decision severalcontinental central banks, include banque de france, raise main refinancingrates 9th october. this move justify need pre-empt inflationary pressuresearly enough, although current inflation remain low. in view important tomake public aware concept “pre-emptive strike”, heart ofcentral banking.1.2. intermediate target: argument favour monetary targeting, caveatin order provide anchor inflation expectation look ahead, centralbanks make public intermediate target commit respecting.announcing intermediate target also enhance accountability central bank. this iswhy article 12 statute ecb explicitly refer decision relate intermediatemonetary objective one main responsibility govern council ecb.two possible strategy select emi council potential candidate berecommended ecb, namely monetary target direct inflation targeting.2 in caseof direct inflation targeting, inflation forecast make central bank view asfulfilling role intermediate target.3let dwell moment choice ecb make directinflation target monetary targeting, unless choose combine element bothstrategies. inflation target stress responsibility escb achieve andmaintaining price stability. however, difficulty process forecastinginflation medium long term. a mervyn king recently stated, “such forecastcannot single number. it must present is, namely probabilitydistribution”.4 furthermore, inflation target could imply formal cooperation thegovernment since latter position influence price developments. finally, inflationtargeting admittedly prove useful progress towards price stability, experienceof unite kingdom shown. nevertheless, track record inflation target fairlyshort mostly take place context world-wide disinflation.monetary target (in concrete terms, target broad money aggregate suchas m3) clearly indicate responsibility central bank development moredirectly control would therefore correspond good independence ecb.moreover, base observe information, make transparent. finally, 2 see emi report: “the single monetary policy stage three - element monetary policy theescb”, february 1997.3 see, instance, lars e.o. svensson, “inflation forecast target : implement monitor inflationtargets”, european economic review 41 (1997), 1111-1146.4 lecture give mervyn king london school economics wednesday 29 october 1997 mark thetenth anniversary lse financial market group.bis review 112/1997 - 3 -monetary target escb would continuity strategy implement thebundesbank since 1975 banque de france since 1976. however, strategy hingeson stability money demand. preliminary research show eu-wide moneyequations often perform good comparable national equations.5 nonetheless, mayprovide safe guidance start period emu far move stage threeconstitutes change regime might lead breakdown empirical relationships.1.3. indicators: important role exchange rate long term interest rate euroit likely that, avoid “looking-at-everything” approach, escbwill closely monitor, addition intermediate objective, broad set economic andfinancial indicator help ass risk future price stability. in set indicators,emphasis probably lay exchange rate long-term interest rate ofthe euro, least three reasons.firstly, euro exchange rate long-term interest rate play importantrole shape monetary condition within euro area, together level short-terminterest rate steer escb. secondly, although degree openness theeuro area much low currently case eu member state, “foreign”trade represent roughly 9% gdp eu whole, area remain totally opento foreign capital flows. in regard, i would like stress current hold french andgerman security non-residents, include cross-holdings, amount 1,200 billion dollars.this highlight importance keep high level confidence euro. thirdly, inspite fact escb inherit credibility participate national centralbanks, ecb track record target money inflation. it thushave build reputation pay due attention indicator reflect directlythe level confidence place investor euro.of course, underline above, external value euro thestatus intermediate objective ecb’s strategy base exchange ratetargeting.6 however, depreciate trend euro would fee domestic inflation arise import price and, undermine investors’ confidence, would contribute buildingof risk premia euro yield curve. this would negative consequence investment,competitiveness, growth employment euro area. so cannot “benignneglect” respect exchange rate. a stable strong currency contribute loweringlong-term interest rates, play crucial role finance economy incontinental europe.all reason point need strong stable euro, currency thatwill credible franc, guilder deutsche mark. the euro must be, be,rock solid. therefore exchange rate euro, even target such, willundoubtedly play important role indicator conduct single monetary policy. 5see, instance, “money demand eu countries: a survey”, f.x. browne, g. fagan j. henry, emistaff paper n° 7, march 1997.6this different current stance france, stability exchange rate vis-à-vis mostcredible currency within erm one two

month now?futures contract short-term interest rate reflect market’s expectation onthis issue. but course don’t expect central banker answer question, one year inadvance. i mention banque de france view rationale behindthe determination start level euro area short-term rates.as know, currently observe interest rate differential “core”and “peripheral” currency participate exchange rate mechanism. although thesespreads dramatically reduce past two years, due remarkableconvergence inflation rate throughout european union, interest rate differentialsstill exist. they attribute partly differ position business cycle, partly todifferences credibility.cyclical difference within potential euro area overestimated.there is, all, relatively high degree synchronisation business cycle continentaleurope. the convergence criterion lay maastricht treaty certainly play animportant role foster synchronisation. moreover, future, difference cyclicaldevelopments gradually reduce policies, structure behaviour become moreand similar. lastly, persist difference may well tolerate currently thecase various region country or, instance, variousmember state usa.credibility difference “core” “peripheral” currency result fromthe different length track record term stability-oriented policies. it sameto reach inflation goal le 2% one year ten years. one thebenefits “peripheral countries” could reap participate first wave ofmonetary union achieve level interest rate credible currency withouthaving yet build long track record.i would like underline europe, converge towards kind ofaverage market interest rate potential euro area. one understand thephilosophy emu organize convergence european country towards bestpossible level monetary credibility therefore towards benchmark term interestrates. a mr. trichet recently stated, “convergence benchmarking concept”, anaveraging process. convergence mean “core” currencies’ interest rate shouldgo towards irrelevant “average levels”, interest rate “peripheral”countries progressively converge towards benchmark level.this benchmark level currently give intervention rate thebundesbank banque de france, 3.3%. but course benchmark level oneyear could different 3.3%.2. operational issueshow escb operate? a know, central bank implement policiesthrough creation destruction central bank reserves, monopolybis review 112/1997 - 5 -suppliers. this do framework domestic credit operation well foreignexchange interventions. credit operation conduct maturity extend overnight orbeyond, implement monetary policy, intraday basis, provide liquidity paymentsystems. therefore, i consider turn monetary policy operations, intraday credit operationsand foreign exchange operations. i focus follow issues:as regard monetary policy operations, single money market rate beattained degree interest rate volatility escb will toaccept? a regard intraday operations, cope risk spillover intradaycredit overnight credit? a regard domestic credit operation well foreign exchangeoperations, principle operational decentralisation apply within escb?2.1. monetary policy operations: short-term money market rate operational targetto implement single monetary policy, escb pursue operationaltarget normally short-term money-market interest rate. two issue deserve closeattention regard: singleness money market one hand, volatility ofthe interest rate target hand.2.1.1. single money market ratethe single monetary policy characterise singleness interest ratelevels interbank market: 1st january 1999 on, single money-market interest ratewill apply throughout euro area give maturity. the issue is, thus, attain thissingle interest rate level. two requirement meet purpose. the firstrequirement that, context single monetary policy implement adecentralised manner, high degree harmonisation instrument andprocedures. the emi central bank work relentlessly aim. the secondrequirement lie integration interbank market payment systems.as far interbank market concerned, two factor play key role:•the first factor relate various rule market operator abide by. these rulesapply counterparts, market makers, brokers, rat agency market enterprise asclearing houses. they take form code conduct, regulations, master agreement andmarket standards. an appropriate degree harmonisation market rule bereached aegis central bank prudential authorities;•the second factor, use single range reference interest rate would guarantee thetransparency euro money market. in respect, short-term maturity specialinterest central banks. this justify intervene extent process ofelaborating indicators. a matter fact, emi recently agree escbshould sponsor computation overnight reference rate euro area.as regard payment systems, target system also contribute therapid emergence unify money market throughout euro area. target connect thedomestic real-time gross settlement (rtgs) system operate national central banks. itwill enable participant make totally safe cross-border settlement euro, real time ata low cost, thereby facilitate interest rate arbitrage. all large-value payment relate tobis review 112/1997 - 6 -monetary policy operation process target. a common close time fordomestic rtgs harmonisation condition intraday liquidity beprovided national central bank within euro area also help prevent risk ofsegmentation single money market.2.1.2. interest rate volatilitythe emi describe various publication set monetary policyinstruments make available escb.7 this set comprise open marketoperations, stand facility minimum reserves. it fulfil two basic functions:firstly, enable escb control efficiently operational target; secondly, signal theescb monetary policy stance. it also consistent requirement lay themaastricht treaty escb act accordance principle open marketeconomy free competition, favour efficient allocation resources.in practice, concrete design use monetary policy instrument willdepend crucially degree volatility short-term rate choose operationaltarget escb will accept. this volatility turn depend severalfactors:•the width corridor define two stand facility available absorb orprovide liquidity (the deposit facility floor marginal lend facility theceiling). under normal circumstances, two facility bind overnight interestrate. they operate overnight maturity accessible discretion ofcounterparties unlimited amounts, provided, case marginal lendingfacility, counterparties supply adequate collateral. a narrow corridor, allow verylittle room function money market, would strictly line marketprinciples. on hand, broad corridor would help contain excessive marketvolatility. a consequence, width corridor likely set pragmatically(currently, around 2% central bank operate interest rate corridor similarto one plan escb);•the frequency fine tune operation could discriminate factor interestrate volatility. very frequent intervention escb money market would not, inmy view, fully consistent market principles. moreover, excessive intervention mightcomplicate extraction information movement market interest rates, especiallyat maturity escb would intervene. intensive recourse fine-tuningoperations might also deprive regular refinance operation stand facility theirsignalling effect conducive centralisation monetary policy operations;•provided set sufficient level, include average provision, reserverequirements constitute efficient buff liquidity shock ; would helpstabilize short-term interest rate maintenance period. in turn, set fairly highlevel minimum reserve might require remunerate order inducesignificant delocation disintermediation; 7 see two emi report “the single monetary policy stage three – specification operationalframework”, january 1997, “the single monetary policy stage three – general documentation escbmonetary policy instrument procedures”, september 1997.bis review 112/1997 - 7 -••enhancing signal effect main refinance operation also contributeto low interest rate volatility. this may best achieve normal conduct offixed-rate tenders, send clear signal market, rather variable-rate tenders.the latter may nevertheless useful certain circumstance escb wish togauge market sentiment;•finally, communication policy escb could also play role smooth interestrate volatility. the escb publish weekly consolidate balance sheet. it willalso publish result tender operations. it could equally wish release dailyaggregate data reserve holdings, average reserve requirement place, onthe use two stand facilities, measure case end previousday.2.2. intraday operations: spillover intraday credit overnight credit borderlinecaseto ensure smooth function target system, national centralbanks provide intraday liquidity participant real-time gross settlement systems.this do form fully collateralised intraday credit operations, sense acredit extend day fall due end day. from monetary policy pointof view, operation create risk spillover intraday credit overnight credit thatwould undermine control escb euro monetary base. in words, thespillover intraday credit overnight credit book central bank viewedas borderline case payment system monetary policy issues.within euro area, risk limit end-of-day debit position beautomatically consider request recourse marginal lend facility, i.e. anescb monetary policy instrument bear penalty interest rate.outside euro area, problem arise rtgs system non-participatingcountries connect target, whereas central bank currently give non-residentsaccess monetary policy instruments. a consequence, different mechanism beingprepared order prevent intraday credit, grant non-euro area ncbs, spillingover overnight credit. these mechanism include limitation, possibly zero, theamount intraday liquidity non-euro area ncbs could receive, system penalty andsanctions apply case overnight overdraft early close time participant inrtgs system non-euro area countries. the decision mechanism implement willbe take ecb.2.3. foreign exchange operationsforeign exchange operation include foreign reserve asset management theone hand, foreign exchange intervention hand.the escb hold manage two different type foreign reserve assets:•those transfer national central bank ecb; accord thestatute, ecb shall provide foreign reserve asset amountequivalent

important similarity anddifferences currency union exist unite state today currency unionthat process create europe.the obvious implication start emu unite state -- well asfor world community -- come existence new currency, euro, isintended function major international currency alongside u.s. dollar. i make clearat outset would mistake think unite state look prospect withconcern, introduction euro could somehow compromise ability unite statesto continue conduct trade financial transaction rest world.as well know, dollar currently use roughly 50 percent world tradetransactions least one side 80

similar take u.s. dollarand -- -- pound sterling.nevertheless, i would argue economic effect potential change ininvoicing practice likely limited. why i say this?first, large extent, re-denomination significant share world trade intoeuros mainly represent shift invoice practice use former european currenciesto euros. moreover, third-country effect unlikely major, european currency asa whole

likely tobe limited. the cannot say euro’s potential role international financial transactions.partly sheer magnitude -- estimate place volume ofinternational capital transaction 40 time volume international tradetransactions -- growth use euro currency choice global capital market willhave much significant repercussion unite state increase use euro inglobal product markets. to large extent, repercussion reflect well-known gain stemfrom increase return use currency store value. a market currencybecomes liquid, cost carry wealth denominate currency fall, raisinginvestors’ preference

i would like suggest experience unite state hadwith large, unify capital market may point way unify european capital marketbis review 109/1997 may evolve advent emu. if u.s. experience relevance, may

balance, seem fair conclude commercial positionand earn many european bank likely come pressure. this may accelerate theongoing restructure europe’s bank industry, process confined, date,primarily

would bebenefits unite state well. such development would, example, impose greatermarket-led discipline unite state and, process, help u address chroniclow-savings problem.there another indirect -- although potentially important -- way emumay affect u.s. business policymaking. this implication emu contributionbis review 109/1997 currency union likely make increase efficiency flexibility economy thatjoin it. at least since publication “one market, one money” study europeancommission 1990, observer analyst emu pay significant attention decline intransaction cost achieve unify 15 different

without think exchangerate risk.a common u.s. currency, important note, many advantage beyond simplyreducing transaction costs. it also simplify choice household corporate management,enhances efficiency financial institution payment system function, andpromotes competition across whole productive spectrum.while common currency europe expect lead similar efficiencygains, economy unite state europe differ several important dimensions, acommon currency likely work substantially different way two regions. the way inwhich europe unite state differ degree integration theirlabor market fiscal systems.the unite state enjoy mobile labor force -- across sector state --which allow job loss arise sector-specific state-specific recession rapidlyabsorbed job grow faster. this contribute aggregate unemployment keptreasonably check. this willingness american worker move family acultural characteristic people, doubt base history unite state nation ofimmigrants.to complement high degree labor

characteristic limit theability europe’s private sector shift resource response regional recessions, butalso europe’s public sector compensate rigidity. this lack flexibility widelyacknowledged one root cause high unemployment rate europe hasexperienced last decade.but, may well ask, necessarily follow great rigidity ofits labor market lack federal fiscal system, europe cannot accommodate commoncurrency instead need rely periodic exchange rate adjustment surrogate productiveflexibility? i think so. while le flexible labor market absence federal fiscalsystem certainly pose constant challenge management common european currency,a fluctuate exchange rate need optimal way respond shortcomings.the argument europe -- even core component europe -- ill afford torenounce exchange rate flexibility rest crucially view europe significantly morebis review 109/1997 - 6 -heterogeneous unite state and, therefore, vulnerable country-specific shock thatcan best correct exchange rate changes. i support view. rather, i believe inmany respect difference among european economy over-emphasized publicdebate.it possible suggest, example, economy european countrieshave common today individual state unite states, asnew york michigan california idaho. moreover, result convergence ofeconomic policy objectives, economic cycle among many european country become moresynchronized last ten years, trend likely reinforce monetary unification.furthermore, shock mainly industry level -- instance, recession hit theautomobile steel industry germany france -- german french economy wouldhardly benefit exchange rate change. such change, case, simply would affect theappropriate relative prices.by contrast, american policymakers might find helpful devalue dollarin texas oil price collapse mid-1980s dollar new england end thedefense-led growth late 1980s. these options, however, simply available. inretrospect, discipline foster absence opportunity alter regional exchangerates force firms, local governments, worker reorganize, become efficient, andgrow productive area unite states.similarly, national labor market europe become flexible efficient inthe presence common

realityof business cycle area europe -- tradition social safety net -- theunited state -- tradition flexible work arrangement -- perhaps learn something fromeach other. to date, neither u seem yet find optimal way cope theunavoidable reality business cycle enable u avoid high unemployment rate tooskewed distribution income.my last general observation implication emu unite state hasto dramatic change macroeconomic policy accompany creation ofmonetary union europe. naturally, main change concern monetary policy, thisarea similarity europe unite state ultimately greatest.the first similarity that, emu, formulation monetary policy botheurope unite state highly centralize european central bank enjoy, asthe federal reserve does, considerable degree independence. these institutional feature willreduce scope national government bend monetary policy need country’sbusiness cycle help keep focus european central bank objective pricestability.the second similarity may expect see europe unite

countries, openness europe’sunified economy -- measured, example, share export relation gdp -- likely tobe quite similar u.s. economy, order 10 percent.while conduct monetary policy europe may increasingly resemble theunited states, conduct fiscal policy continue differ significantly two regions,largely reflect different path europe unite state take monetary unification.in unite states, political union come well ahead common monetary policy. the federalreserve create 1913, political unification long place. the situationis, course, quite different europe, emu member country plan retain substantialpolitical fiscal independence.despite independence, emu may well foster fiscal coordination among themember countries. this may happen part emu country choose subscribe aset common

ithink important supervisor appropriately modest canachieve, supervision see assure remedy potential problems.establishing price stability sustainable fiscal position also criticalelements pursuit sound financial systems. while weakness financial system canhave macroeconomic implications, reverse also undoubtedly true -- unsoundmacroeconomic policy long-lasting effect lead weakness financial systems.excessive credit creation inflation obvious examples. some observer suggestedthat virtually every major financial system problem last two three decade caused,directly indirectly, unsound macroeconomic policies.some international regulatory response also sufficiently recognisethat objective bank supervision, infrastructure within supervision takesplace (for example, quality company

u averagegrowth rate 3.6 per cent per annum -- third high oecd area -- could havehoped more. i think progress make next year, although haveto accept probably slow, monetary policy part story -- inthe long run, small part. history suggest remain case.australia move 2 per cent unemployment 10 per cent decadefrom 1973 1983. the damage really do period. despite good output andemployment growth 1980s expansion, unemployment rate back 11 per centfollowing 1990 recession. so net term progress make decade.what want time good growth output employment, adifference -- want last lot longer. the six-and-a-half year previous twoeconomic expansion last good enough. although progress make reducingunemployment -- particularly second one -- lose ensue recession.this time around must make sure much long expansion, reducingthe likelihood severity future slowdown much possible. i know thatwill possible, sure way ameliorate business cycle way avoid theimbalances occur late stage expansion. the main imbalance australia,as elsewhere, always emergence inflation. the story never exactly thesame -- inflation accompany wage push, asset price boom externalimbalance -- result follow past three booms. that iswhy need medium-term focus monetary policy inflationtarget central part it. the inflation target anti-growth; low inflation anend itself, interest sustain good inflation performance

objection economy grow 4 per cent 4 percent plus.when look whole picture employment unemployment, monetarypolicy small part story, mainly concern cyclical aspect ofunemployment. if look really big change employment unemployment overdecades, rather years, monetary policy play small role. the big change inemployment performance i aware contrast unite state andcontinental europe. in unite states, unemployment rate back 1960s level,whereas europe five time high 1960s. a european countrieshave do good -- include unite kingdom -- others do worse.if try explain superior u employment result fast

thatmonetary policy play it. in words, even succeed good economic growthand sustain long period early expansions, solve ourunemployment problems. we make progress, optimistic think wewill able emulate

theeconomic situation participate country converge emu starts.the eu try achieve convergence make membership emu subjectto country’s ability satisfy so-called convergence criteria. inflation interest

credibility anti-inflationarystance -- effect still felt today. thirdly, plan realise europeanmonetary union initiate end 1960s hague summit founderedbefore real political decision taken.the initial phase world-wide flexible exchange rate thus twocrucial messages. firstly, best contribution monetary policy make last growthand employment clear anti-inflationary stance. in long term, job cannot “bought” byhigher inflation. that already true even 1970s unemployment -- least manyindustrial country -- still predominantly cyclical nature. that casetoday unemployment europe largely structural causes. the permanentanti-inflationary stance monetary union therefore essential condition europe’sfuture success create safeguard jobs.secondly, would disastrous monetary union political

sweden speech give bythe deputy governor bank sweden, mr. lars heikensten, sweden financial forum,örebro, 15/10/97.what i say base main riksbank’s late inflation report, whichwas publish le month ago. in respects, i shall develop say aboutthe outlook inflation, though assessment situation essentially unchanged. i shall begin,however, remark monetary policy construct is, objective ofsafeguarding value money.1. monetary policy’s foundationsexperience advocate stable environmentthe reason riksbank’s objective safeguard value money basicallysimple: low, stable inflation contribute good environment growth production andemployment.support view readily find pattern economic development indifferent industrialise countries. in country inflation allow accelerate,growth normally weak erratic. we see sweden. in firsttwo-to-three post-war decade swedish economic policy characterise stable rule inflationwas low. economic growth year good new job create great extent inthe past two decades, inflation shoot series devaluation cycles.there really nothing odd this. we know stable condition make easierto arrive wise economic decisions. when wage price chase unpredictable way,and interest rate exchange rate fluctuate widely result this, certain amount ofluck smartness sometimes possible good business. but people surely realise isnot best set either long-term investment live earn income os pension. the head u federal reserve, alan greenspan, formulate view whatmonetary policy’s objective roughly words: inflation low economicagents worry it.limited room employment policywhy, then, still argue high inflation would good thing? ibelieve mainly perceive conflict price stability low unemployment.this perception turn root short-run, cyclical perspective. when economic activity risingor fall account transitory demand fluctuation around long-term trend, negativerelationship exist. rise demand good service generate increase demand labour andlower unemployment; tend accompany rise wage high inflation. the oppositealso applies.but mean high inflation result permanently high employmentand lastingly low unemployment. on contrary, result economic setback normallyfollows return inflation economy, unemployment liable rise even higher. against itmight argue matter give inflation head, allow little moreinflation. nor matter systematic policy, once. once again, theswedish experience 1970s 1980s instructive representative happenedin many countries. a little inflation short period easily become inflation thatis high persistent.bis review

unemployment fact solely evenmainly cyclical, unemployment would differ greatly country inthe cyclical phase much growth rate long time.targeting inflationthe riksbank objective safeguard value money. in practice, theriksbank target inflation. the target rate 2 per cent (with tolerance interval –1 percentage point),assessed annual terms. a time lag 1 2 year interest rate adjustment itsfull effect rate price increases, riksbank work forecast inflation. when havereason fear inflation rise target rate, soon time raise instrumentalrate vice versa.assessments future inflation present riksbank four time year theseries inflation reports. the assessment publish guide economic agent owndeliberations future level interest rate likely be. the report also provide basisfor discussion monetary policy’s construction riksbank interest encouraging.simplifying somewhat, inflation determine two factors: situation concerningdemand supply economic agents’ expectation future inflation. the first factor fairlystraightforward; demand tend exceed economy capable producing, resultantshortages bottleneck normally push price wage up. the part play expectation maybe le evident. if firm employee expect increase inflation, tend raise price anddemand high wages, respectively. this may sufficient start continue inflationary process.another factor importance inflation value krona, directly affectspricing demand serve indication expect inflation.2. economic activity inflation expectationsnow assessment late inflation report. first let say something theriksbank’s appraisal economic situation.demand supplythe statistic recent month clearly point upswing great part theeconomy. this largely confirm riksbank’s assessment last spring. development date 1997have balance before. demand growth come export andinvestment, increase extent private consumption well.the growth household income hold back year programmefor fiscal consolidation. activity depress need cut spend publicactivities. the fiscal withdrawal household purchase power continue year next, sodisposable income largely unchanged 1997, rise 1998. after that, consolidationprogramme completed, fiscal policy expect restrictive households. someincrease public activity also expect come two years.after rise year rather modest rate, private consumption pick inthe past year. households’ expectation concern well national economy improvedin september minor setback august. household also optimistic outlook inthe labour market. moreover, august survey national institute economic research showsthat firm everyday infrequent trade optimistic sale trend near future.bis review 96/1997 - 3 -it disposable income determine private consumption. the appreciation ofwealth past year probably important, too. since turn 1996, house price rise 9 percent share price 28 per cent. this suggest 1997 household could realise capital gain thatmay reach equivalent 25 per cent disposable income. it would surprise anincrease wealth contribute strong consumer demand.to sum up, sign point good development demand year ahead. in anexpanding world market, export growth continue relatively high. the riksbank also countson accelerate increase private consumption least end fall public consumption.the broad increase major demand component naturally exert pressureon available resources. this imply rise capacity utilisation decrease availability ofunutilised resources. the business tendency survey manufacturing, provide information aboutcapacity there, consistently indicate unutilised resource fell first second quarter. anincreased proportion firm report output restrict production factor rather thandemand. this accompany rise shortage skilled worker salaried technicians.an important, though elusive, indicator inflationary pressure gap totaldemand total output. most indicator suggest gap become somewhat smaller. in theinflation report, however, riksbank judge supply unutilised resource still relativelygood. it least high level total unemployment indicate this. a high rate investmentand rapid increase productivity contributed, least date, expansion potential outputto meet grow demand. this ease inflationary pressure upswing.inflation expectationsanother important indicator inflationary pressure expectation economicagents future inflation. along actual inflation, expectation decline recentyears. they also show tendency converge around 2 per cent inflation target. if case, itis good sign see increase confidence inflation target. this mean agreater extent, economic agent base plan expectation low inflation, whichprovides good condition monetary policy fulfil inflation target.in recent month expectation future inflation tend move up, thisseems mainly adjustment increase register inflation. the tendency, however, must beclosely watched; clear increase inflation expectation inflation target would give cause forconcern.3. inflation come yearsin course 1996 cpi inflation decrease markedly annual level wassomewhat low limit tolerance interval. transitory factor partly explain drop.falling house mortgage interest costs, occasion part riksbank’s interest rate cuts, playeda large part low inflation figures. the trend turn rate inflation begin tomove up. but main reason transient downward factor long work thesame degree; increase underlie inflation therefore subdued.in light assessment economic activity factor affect inflation(e.g. inflation expectations), inflation report riksbank forecast annual cpi inflation wouldbe around 1 per cent 1997 around 2 per cent 1998 1999. some acceleration wasenvisaged latter two years.the assessment carry reservations. matter discuss report include therisks associate rise activity, difficulty know supply side would react thebis review 96/1997 - 4 -coming round wage negotiations. there may reason elaborate discussion somerespects.output gap close degreesin inflation report riksbank consider sweden’s gross domestic product willgrow around 2 per cent 1997 around 3 per cent 1998. in 1999 gdp growth rate isexpected rather 3 per cent.this imply 1998 1999 growth strong increase potentialoutput, annual trend estimate 2 per cent. that mean today’s surpluscapacity activate degrees. it difficult tell quickly happen. the riksbankconsiders output gap -- way attempt gauge unutilised capacity economy awhole -- currently 2 per cent gdp. with growth rate envisage above, gap wouldthen close time 1999.other information bear inflation might likely accelerate alsoincluded inflation report. estimate structural unemployment thereby, indirectly, levelof unemployment combine stable, low inflation, suggest risk inflation alsoexist le two year ahead. the rate capacity utilisation rise may likewise play part. arapid reduction unutilised resource might generate inflationary impulse even though still acapacity surplus total level.risks wage negotiationswage formation particularly relevant present settlement due inthe come six month cover large part labour market. labour shortage yet beingreported sectors, experience show domino effect substantial.the riksbank’s assessment inflation late report base assumption thatthe rate wage increase low recent years. support assumption found,for example, recent wage statistics. the report, however, envisage downward shift to, oreven below, level prevail european union recent years, shift would make iteasier sweden tackle unemployment.wage formation primarily matter labour market organisation arrange. thelevel wage increase different segment economy cope depends, example, onthe initial profit level, together development segment’s productivity, cost prices. forthe economy whole difficult avoid conclusion that, effective reduction ofunemployment feasible, rate wage increase equal inflation target plus expectedlong-term productivity growth represent ceiling. low wage increase would make labour cheaperrelative capital investment would thereby stimulate employment.it important understand today’s rule economic policy. in keep thesituation quarter century ago, sweden participate bretton wood system, whichwas functional efficient arrangement fix exchange rates, year rule thegame clear. if riksbank judge inflation rise 2 per cent target, tous raise interest rates. consequently, excessively high wage increase lead, except possibly inthe short run, high inflation. instead result weak economic activity loweremployment year ahead. in early situation fix exchange rate, excessively high wageincreases primarily affect manufacture part economy expose tointernational competition. today effect felt particular sector sensitive tointerest rates, distributive trade debt-burdened public sector.bis review 96/1997 - 5 -4. conclusion monetary

addressgiven deputy chief executive hong kong monetary authority, mr. andrew sheng, atthe asian security analyst federation conference bangkok, 17/11/97 (slightly abridged).1. i honour invite today address distinguish conference.the title paper “asset prices, capital flow risk management”. all factor havebeen main player recent market turbulence region. i therefore focus mydiscussion today lesson recent asian market turmoil also impact hongkong.the surge capital flows2. in past decade, capital flow surge within asian region globally.according imf statistics, average annual net capital inflow develop country exceededus$150 billion 1990-96, 40% actually come asia. in last two yearswe saw even capital inflow region, record net total us$107 billion 1996 asimilar growth rate first half 1997. in asian economies, net inflow averaged5-8% gdp long periods, half capital flow form foreign directinvestment.3. the growth international capital flow result great financialliberalization sophistication market around world, rise institutional investor suchas mutual pension funds, grow financial innovation intermediation, especially inderivative products. we know capital movement help growth global efficientallocation resource bring new knowledge technology emerge economies.4. on hand, international capital flow volatile nature, withthe tendency reverse direction slight hint risk, whether conductof macroeconomic policy concern fragility financial sector. capital flow nowdrive balance payment trade flows. portfolio shift operate basis marketexpectations risk, return liquidity. a high level arbitraging, borrow fundsfrom one market invest another market, lead contagion effects. loss one markettherefore result sale another. this risk address arenow process capital liberalization, also whole international community.global market mean global contagion. this long uniquely asian problem.5. let u consider recent asian market turbulence global context. untilrecently, asia enjoy benefit high global liquidity, record admirable level ofcapital inflows, drive high global liquidity g-3 economies. indeed, high global liquidityis also consequence strong productivity growth, low inflation improve governmentsavings, especially unite states, result strong growth world trade indecades.6. with well-behaved inflation, ample international liquidity result aglobal stock market boom 1990s, europe us, well emerge market inlatin america eastern europe. but also cause global compression interest ratespreads record level new issuance domestic international bond markets. suchnarrowing spread reflect potential credit market risk associate emergingmarkets. so investor finally realize emerge market carry risk thanthey assumed, risk premium measure yield spread widen sharply reflectthis.bis review 109/1997 - 2 -7. this scenario complicate fact flood global liquidity beenlargely channel bond, equity property market east asia. buoy optimism aboutthe asian miracle growth last decade, domestic foreign investor commit theclassic “fallacy composition”. initially, individual may perceive high return increasetheir investment assets, lead aggregate excess demand market overshoot. a reversalof perception lead sharp market correction, exactly happen asia,but globally. a chairman greenspan say recently, "in retrospect, clear investmentmonies flow economy could profitably employ modest risk".8. the strong asian growth would continue fact globalcompetition external trade emerge newly industrialize export-oriented economieswith cheap labour, china, india, latin american eastern europe. the failure centralplanning bring least three billion new worker consumer global market. thesenew market begin benefit grow trade liberalization inflow foreigninvestments, thus put great pressure market early “tigers” east asia, leadingto widen current account deficit continue investment infrastructureand real estate.issues asia9. if look closely situation asia, economic fundamental remainintact. asia fastest-growing region world, record growth rate around5%-9%. asian economy low inflation rate exchange rate stable recently.current account region whole broadly balance, fiscal account, excludingjapan, surplus. asia exceptionally high save rate 30% gdp. officialsavings, term foreign currency reserves, even higher. in asia, 70% inflowscontributed reserve accumulation. a result, asian central bank hold 40% ofthe world’s foreign exchange reserves. five top six foreign exchange holder world arenow asians.10. the strong fundamental -- young, educated, flexible workforce, stablegovernment, good natural resource communication infrastructure, openness trade andinnovation, high save investment rate -- basically changed. asia stilloutward-looking, open market openness technology innovation. the aspiration ofasia also real: entrepreneurial approach innovation, competition good standard ofliving rise urban population. where asian perhaps keep eye ball theneed develop service sector complementary step manufacture export sectors.delays open financial sector global competition make vulnerable real sectorexcesses imbalances, overconcentration risk certain areas, include assetmarkets.11. the momentum growth depend critically continue vigorous trade reform,fiscal prudence improvement finance, health education policies. increasingly, export arechanging labour-intensive industrial production, toward high value-added industriesand services. this pose challenge sustain productivity growth.12. the asian turmoil financial turmoil surface, let focus theinteresting way asia recycle surplus savings. a colleague joseph yam consistentlypointed out, large portion asian foreign exchange reserve invest asset oecdcountries, provide safe liquid instruments. these fund return region form offoreign direct investment foreign portfolio investment. this global recycle also expose asianeconomies volatile portfolio adjustment due policy mistake shift internationaleconomic environment. currently, deep, liquid mature debt market asia thebis review 109/1997 intermediation process function efficiently. the process begin last years, andwith build good financial infrastructure, round turmoil add great impetus togreater cooperation build good regional financial intermediation.13. a see hindsight, risk involve international capital flow areexacerbated short-term capital flow attract asset markets. this lead assetbubbles, painful consequence asset price deflation.14. but much evident asia process hedging, arbitrageand “carry trade”, whereby arbitrageur borrow one market invest another market offershigher interest rates, create regional global contagion. portfolio shift mean whenasset price change (and i would include: consumer prices, interest rates, exchange rates, debtand equity price property prices) fund flow follow “law one price”.this suggest open economy must adjust global prices. the speed adjustment isonly determine degree openness domestic economy financial markets. in otherwords, whether like not, price globally market.15. many u fully appreciate full logic this. the financial turmoilsuggests real sector cause stress global competition, financial effect isstress domestic bank systems, bank intermediate global portfolio adjustments. in anopen economy, capital inflow increase deposit base domestic bank may bechannelled credit mistake fuel domestic asset price bubbles. there twoimplications. first, asset price inflation eventually fee domestic inflation erode externalcompetitiveness. second, excessive lend concentration le productive assets, either realestate over-investment infrastructure production capacity, expose financial institutionsto huge risks.16. from viewpoint financial intermediation, three major risk asiathat underlie shock there:•first, maturity mismatch -- asian market make mistake borrow short-term capitalflows finance illiquid non-tradables, property, thus expose hugeliquidity need capital flow reversed.•second, currency mismatch -- corporation borrow foreign currency fund financeinvestments generate sufficient foreign exchange repay debt run currencymismatch.•third, credit risk -- lend investment ultimately must sound profit generatelong-term return high borrow rate prospective dividends. undue exuberance onthe part investors, price-earning ratio grow beyond fundamentals, part ofbankers fail ass impact high interest rate collateral cash flows, wouldexpose investor lender asset losses.17. specifically, bank asia, easy access fund result high globalliquidity, able expand lend much quickly and, thereby, incur high risk theirportfolios need manage soundly. ironically, domestic bank may inducedto move risky lend due increase competition form new entrant andfinancial intermediation. there question need manage new risk better.18. there also one distinguish feature asian turmoil. the debt problemshave public sector. on contrary, fiscal position asian governmentshave large quite sound. east asia, exclude japan, run fiscal surplus us$5.4 billionbis review 109/1997 - 4 -or 0.1% gdp 1996. the debt burden, fact, largely one private sectoroverborrowing. the resolution debt private sector make asian problem quitedifferent experience sovereign debt issue 1980s.19. in essence, asian problem age-old question efficient resourceallocation. asia shortage funds, high level save invest le liquidlong-term investments. thus, one press issue asia build competitive,stable financial system robust infrastructure facilitate efficient financial intermediation. thebetter risk management financial system would also assist corporation investor tomanage also risk better. ultimately, balance flexible economy sound riskmanagement good position withstand global shock avoid crisis.the need national risk management20. we aware complexity risk financial markets. aside fromcredit risks, market risk interest rate, exchange rate, legal risks, operational risk andsystemic risk managed, micro level macro level. all marketssuffer “fallacy composition”. mistake corporate bank level add tonational mistakes, may add regional international crisis contagion.traditional risk management corporate sectoral level simply shift risk one sector toanother. risk still remain economy whole. thus, increasingly 1980s, emergedthe awareness financial sector regulation national risk management.21. national risk management cover six major aspects:•credible policies, monetary fiscal policy consistent other, appliedconsistently.•capital account liberalization phase appropriately.•sound fundamental include high domestic save rate, sustainable fiscal balance ofpayments positions, high foreign exchange reserve prudent debt management.•good supervision involve maintenance solid capital adequacy liquidity requirementsfor financial sector, well regular examination monitor financial institution andmarkets. the bank system must capacity avoid excessive credit concentration andrisks, manage market risk well.•a robust financial infrastructure would encompass efficient payment settlement systemfor domestic international transactions. in essence, world move towards real timegross settlement (rtgs) system, support delivery vs. payment (dvp) payment vs.payment (pvp). rtgs reduce payment risk allow central bank monitor flow indomestic currency well exposure bank real time basis.•a non-distortive incentive structure, taxation regulatory restriction would notencourage risk concentration excessive leverage economic sectors.22. put simply, manage national risk equivalent achieve three objectives.first, low national gearing, leverage add risks, especially leverage fromexternal borrowing. the borrow abroad, become vulnerable externalshocks. second, high level domestic savings, reflect high bankcapital, low credit/gdp ratio, high fiscal surpluses, great resilience pain ofadjustment external internal shocks. third, irrespective exchange rate regime, mustbis review 109/1997 commitment stable currency, mean strong external reserves, low inflation asound bank system.asset price exchange rate regime23. the asian market turmoil also raise question whether exchange rateregime matters. i believe debate whether nominal exchange rate float orfixed miss point asia. the real issue real effective exchange rate economy,namely, underlie productivity global competitiveness.24. for example, mistake perception fix exchange rate give rise toasset bubbles. but look recent evidence asset price bubble advance economies,asset price bubble also occur 1980s country flexible exchange rates, asjapan, scandinavia unite kingdom. asset price appreciation cannot tackle alone byinterest rates, since multiple reason appreciation25. in asia, perhaps identify four main reasons:•first, asian household always look upon house ownership socialnecessity, also best hedge inflation.•second, asia young market, experience high rate urbanization. the strong demand forhousing arise demographic alone fairly quickly eliminate excess capacity manyeconomies.•third, house supply constraint also give rise high house costs. example inadequatesupply land, excessive tax burden house construction, inefficient urban planningand approval procedure delay market response rise demand housing.over-rapid liberalization supply constraint also one reason emergence excesssupply.•fourth, high global liquidity appear improve access funds, result inexcessive exuberance asset price inflation.the impact hong kong26. amidst recent attack regional currency markets, economy asiahas totally immune, least hong kong, despite strong fundamentals.27. if identify real issue asia one structural competitiveness theglobal economy, cause shift global resource rise productivity outside region, thenstructural adjustment must come change either internal price external price.with fix exchange rate regime therefore fix external price, hong kong, theadjustment come change internal prices, especially asset markets. in thoseeconomies float exchange rates, may adjustment internal externalprices. this exactly happen right now. use u dollar still benchmarkcurrency, interest see since begin year, hang seng index hasdeclined 26% last friday, singapore strait time index 32%, nikkei 225 28% andthe asean index 50-60%. thus, market adjust irrespective exchange rateregime unit account.28. be easy way avoid pain adjustment asia due risingglobal competition? the answer clearly no. a general rule, fast adjust, le pain.bis review 109/1997 - 6 -there different approach issue. there think float exchangerate regime would cushion pain, many forget hong kong try float exchangerate regime before, 1974-83. during period, growth volatile inflation muchhigher experience now. a open economy trade account 285% ofgdp, inflation would immediately import exchange rate volatility. the recentexperience asia actually show contrary theory, float exchange rate require evenhigher interest rates, high risk associate exchange rate volatility.29. here i would like correct common image hong kong’s exchangerate regime peg. the hong kong dollar fix exchange rate, peg adjustedfrom time time. the link exchange rate system hong kong operate currency boardsystem whereby issue hong kong dollar note fully back u dollar fix rateof us$1 hk$7.80. such note-issuing mechanism ensure currency issue fully back byforeign exchange. with sustain budget surplus accumulate surplus exchange fundand land fund assets, actual amount foreign reserve hong kong amount us$88.1billion end september, third large world. this seven time hongkong dollar cash circulation three time hk$ m1.30. the currency board system automatic adjustment mechanism maintainexchange rate stability. when outflow fund hong kong dollar, hongkong monetary authority (hkma) sell u dollar bank hong kong dollar. onsettlement day, hkma debit clear account bank necessary amount ofhong kong dollar return u dollar credit new york account thesame banks. since bank may sell hong kong dollar clearingaccounts hkma, obtain hong kong dollar borrow banks,by bid interbank rates, sell back u dollar hkma, is, reversingtheir short position. in fact, bank hold excess hong kong dollar aregenerally long foreign currency. the late data end july show hong kongbanking system short roughly hk$33 billion us$4 billion.31. in addition robust currency board mechanism, link exchange ratesystem underpin strong fundamental asia, world:•growth strong, 5.5%.•fiscal position consistently strong, average fiscal surplus average 2% gdpfor past decade. fiscal surplus 1997 far 4.4% gdp expect exceed 5% ofgdp.•the government external debt.•exchange fund land fund together us$100 billion assets.•corporate debt ratio amongst low asia.•the external account broadly balance.32. the free market strong fundamental mean nature shock isabsorbable. hong kong strong competitive edge, since service economy with83% service sector. a major investor integrator production region, withmanufacturing concern china southeast asia, hong kong company could adjust productionto area great export competitiveness. in addition, mainland chinese economyis still grow 8-9% per annum, low inflation, balance external account strongbis review 109/1997 commitment reform enterprise financial sectors. all auger well hong kong asthe main gateway chinese market.33. the current high interest rate reflect somewhat slightly high risk premiumin asia due currency turmoil. we admit high interest rate affect stockmarket property market. but also remember high interest rate necessary tocool overheat asset market prevail recently. give excess demandsituation hong kong economy grow 6.4% second quarter, correction wasexpected. a moderation property price help bring house affordable level tohomebuyers.34. high interest rate also bring inflation, encourage savings. onceinflation asset market correct free market regime, hong kong become muchmore competitive. in real effective exchange rate terms, competitive effect neighbouringdepreciation offset somewhat rise domestic inflation. high interest rate alsobring external account line fundamental improve trade balance. hongkong, free market economy, adjust exactly accord textbook.35. moreover, bank sector robust strongly capitalize withstandany shocks. operate profit local bank grow 18% first half 1997 thebad debt charge fell first half 1997 level classify loan 2.08%, from2.91% year earlier. the capital adequacy ratio local bank whole exceed 17%. the averageloan-to-value ratio 70%, actual measure loan-to-value ratio 53.3%, accord toour survey end september 1994. therefore, hkma’s effort build strong bank sector,including distribution maturity risk mortgage corporation creation anefficient rtgs payment system necessary effort prevent external shock affectingthe bank system. in particular, rtgs system allow hkma monitor closely banks’settlement transaction real time basis. bank would also fund settlement andprovide ample liquidity prudent basis. all line objective makingthe market efficient enable free market clear aggregate supply demand anequilibrium price quickly.36. but always remember free lunch. the fix exchangerate regime imply flexible economy adjust exchange rate. hong

we pretend say fix exchange rate theperfect system, even imf admit perfect system. but best systemfor hong kong. the link exchange rate system stay.conclusion37. a one contributor world bank study

financialmarkets conference arrange standard bank south africa limit cape town, on7/11/97.1. challenge number one - find consensus objective monetary policy bein south africain international community central bankers, widespread consensusthat primary goal monetary policy must domestic price stability. price stability,however, mean end, final goal overall macroeconomic policy. theultimate goal determine government normally link objective maximumeconomic growth, development creation employment opportunities.contemporary economic theory support view, however, financialstability, measure low rate inflation, precondition attainment optimumeconomic development. furthermore, monetary policy, one sub-elements ofoverall macroeconomic policy, task responsibility create maintain astable financial environment conducive sustainable economic growth anoptimum rate medium long term.in south africa, however, confusion remain task functionsof central bank be. the important delusion, support certain businesspeople, politician even academics, link defunct phillips curveapproach term assumption make high inflation rate produce asustained lift growth employment. world-wide experience, long

ofpolicy action immediate reaction markets, general need mostcountries raise production capacity, stimulate demand. in environment, theappropriate role monetary policy redefine responsibility creation andmaintenance stable financial condition reflect low inflation. this whatcentral bank best support governmental programme overall economic growth anddevelopment.bis review 108/1997 - 2 -in south africa, consider many attack make reserve bank policyduring past year, still major lack consensus prime objective ofmonetary policy be. unless get consensus support almost globalapproach contemporary central bank policy, unless agree pursue policiesalso south africa, road internationalisation south african economy berough difficult.2. challenge number two -- decide appropriate framework monetary policygiven objective price stability, central bank must design frameworkor consistent model within monetary policy implemented, take account thestructure financial system economy country. various model areavailable choose from, whatever model preferred, final objective monetary policyshould always protection value currency.in bretton wood system fix par values, main intermediate objectiveof monetary policy protection exchange rates, external value currency.by link global exchange rate fix gold parities, convergence ofinflation, relatively low level, least many country succeed maintainingfixed exchange rate relatively long period time. needle say, system brokedown late 1960s early 1970s expansionary monetary policy werefollowed major industrial countries, inflation escalated. today, smallercountries still attach exchange rate select major international currency, thenaccept unavoidable consequence rate inflation small country mustconverge rate inflation economy anchor currency. a good example ofthis approach provide argentina convertibility law 1 peso = 1 u dollar.a second widely-used model one monetary target importantmonetary aggregate money supply amount bank credit extension use asan anchor monetary policy. within context prime monetary policy objective ofmaintaining low inflation, monetary target (or exchange rate target) represent anintermediate objective policy.south africa one many country introduce money supply targetingas anchor monetary policy course 1980s. initially, policy serve thecountry well. it make important contribution good understand policy decisions,and also make major contribution towards successful reduction level rate ofinflation average 15 per cent twenty year 1973 1992, about8½ per cent past four years.the south african experience money supply target differentfrom comparable country canada australia -- differencethat process south africa slow lag one, mainly economicisolation country rest world 1993. australia introduce moneysupply target 1976, abandon “with reluctance” february 1985. at thetime, australia tender two reason end m3-targeting stage:“the first problem controllability. the fact target

australia go transitional period last early 1990s.during transitional period policy “monetary pragmatism” followed. there wasindeed formal strictly define framework guide monetary policy. a “check-list” anad hoc mixture intermediate objective introduce central bank allow awide degree discretion implementation monetary policy. after “rule” ofmonetary target break down, policy “to look everything”.although pragmatic approach may advantages, particularly inan environment major structural change volatile international shocks, majordisadvantage transparent. a charles goodhart put it:“supporters would describe sensible pragmatism, detractor reversion toa muddle discretion which, again, allow authority rope good them,or us”. (the conduct monetary policy, economic journal 1989.)both australia canada, grow number countries, haverecently move direct target inflation. in countries, however, centralbanks also government commit jointly central bank predeterminedtarget inflation. in unite kingdom, chancellor exchequer indeed set thetarget inflation annual budget, instruct bank england pursue thegoal monetary policy instruments. nowhere central bank decide onan inflation target.for inflation target credible, must commitment least thecentral bank government, and, possible, also business community labour, tothe achievement goal. furthermore, harm good country tointroduce formal inflation target much line rest world. of theseven country report bi annual report 1996 formal inflation targets, onehas set goal inflation 3 per cent per annum. the central bank must givensufficient operational autonomy pursue inflation target vigour without fear ofintimidation politician pressure groups. and, finally, market must free, flexibleand responsive underlie changes. inflation often symptom malfunction marketsand cure lie monetary policy, restructure markets.it big challenge south africa prepare new age directinflation target anchor monetary policy. the proposal make reserve banklast week introduction march next year flexible system providingbis review 108/1997 - 4 -accommodation bank institutions, represent important step road towardsa effective monetary policy system compatible global policies.3. challenge number three - establish effective institutional framework monetarypolicythere lot misunderstand south africa mean theindependence reserve bank. the bank never make responsible determine theoverall macroeconomic policy objective country. this prerogative government.the central bank must, however, give clear mandate government policyobjective be, give necessary autonomy pursue achieve thisobjective.taking account power influence central banks, obviousdirective government monetary

pressure group perceive interest ofprivate sector profiteers, political popularity. it inter alia reason, inrespect implementation measure may time prove unpopular, centralbanks give “independence” governments. to quote aformer governor reserve bank australia said:“the reserve bank must give freedom prison exercise yard”.(r.a. johnston - “comments professor schedvin - economic paper - 1992.)although autonomy give south african reserve bank interms constitution republic south africa, disciplinary action apply thebank pursuance mandate often challenge economists, business people andpoliticians whenever believe vest interest impede actions. many southafricans must still learn tolerable towards need painful financial disciplines,when justify adverse macroeconomic situations. these may often force u byinternational development control.apart effective institutional framework reserve bank, southafrica also need well-managed private sector bank institutions, well-functioning

convince south african one task monetary policymust protect value currency.•we must adapt monetary policy change environment tooperate. this may require u move away money supply target adopta direct focus inflation developments.•we must guard grow pressure country curtailment theautonomy central bank.•the reserve bank must continue guide south african financial market theworld financial system.

lachambre de commerce suisse en italie, à milan, le 27/10/97.1. introductionles échéances fixées par le traité de maastricht se rapprochent à grand pas. auprintemps prochain seront désignés le pay qui participeront à la première phase d’intégrationmonétaire. tout porte à penser, sur la base de indicateurs de convergence observablesactuellement, que l’union monétaire serum plus large que ce que l’on imaginait il douze moisseulement. dans moins d’un an, donc, il se pourrait que tous le pay entourant la suisse aientuni leur destin monétaire.que devons-nous attendre, en suisse, de ce profond changement d’horizonmonétaire? quell en seront le conséquences pour le franc suisse et pour la politique de labanque nationale suisse? je suis heureux de pouvoir développer ce thèmes devant vous et dem’exprimer sur sol italien et lombard, une terre si proche, géographiquement etéconomiquement, de la suisse et si proche aussi de notre coeur.2. un changement profond d’environnement2.1. .... en europesi, d’un point de vue suisse, l’union monétaire entraînera un profondbouleversement de l’environnement européen, le choc serum encore plus marqué pour lesmembres de l’union eux-mêmes. avec la monnaie unique, le marchés européens franchiront unnouveau et très important pa dans leur intégration. non seulement le biens, le capitaux et lespersonnes circuleront librement, mais il n’y aura plus qu’une seule monnaie -- l’euro -- donc uneseule politique monétaire et une seule structure de taux d’intérêt.l’apparition d’un taux d’intérêt unique et d’un marché financier intégré marquerafortement l’économie européenne du 21ème siècle. songez que, il cinq an seulement, l’écartentre le taux à long terme en allemagne et en italie était de 660 point de base. aujourd’hui, àla veille de l’union, ce différentiel est tombé à 80 points, demain, il aura disparu. laconvergence de taux d’intérêt à long terme été le signe le plus concret de progrès versl’union monétaire. l’exemple le plus frappant est celui de la parfaite coïncidence qui existemaintenant entre le taux français et allemands, la france et l’allemagne étant le deux payssans lesquels l’union ne pourra se faire.une bonne part de la convergence financière observée ce derniers mois tient àl’anticipation de progrès substantiels dans la correction de déficits public et le respect de lanorme de 3 %. le récentes estimation effectuées à ce sujet par la commission de bruxellesl’ont encore renforcée. mais il ne faut pa oublier non plus que la décrue spectaculaire de tauxd’inflation dans le pay du sud de l’europe grandement aidé à rapprocher le situation desmarchés financiers.personne ne peut dire à quel niveau se situeraient aujourd’hui le taux d’intérêtdans le différents pay européens s’ils n’étaient pa engagés dans le processus d’intégrationmonétaire. aujourd’hui déjà, certains d’entre eux bénéficient certainement d’un effetbis review 103/1997 - 2 -d’entraînement favorable, d’autres doivent compter peut-être avec une prime nouvelled’insécurité. a me yeux, l’économie italienne profite déjà et profitera encore plus demain deson ancrage plus ferme dans l’édifice européen. son dynamisme pourra s’appuyer sur desconditions de financement bien plus favorables que par le passé.la seconde révolution entraînée par la monnaie unique serum celle de l’unificationdes marchés financier européens. avec la disparition de monnaies nationales, le banques setrouveront en situation de plus grande concurrence, leurs client étant en mesure de comparerrapidement la qualité de produits offerts. le grandes manoeuvre ont déjà commencé dans lesecteur bancaire depuis l’introduction de la liberté de mouvements de capitaux; elles vont sepoursuivre et même s’intensifier. sou la pression de la monnaie unique, mais aussi sou celle dela globalisation de marchés et de progrès technologiques, l’industrie bancaire européenne vadevoir procéder à un assainissement de s structures. notre continent est clairement„over-banked“; peu de choose s’opposera encore aux ajustements structurels lorsque la monnaieunique serum en place.2.2. .... et en suisse2.2.1. un environnement plus homogèneavec l’apparition de l’euro, l’europe passera donc d’un espace à devisesmultiples, à marchés financier fragmentés, à une zone uniforme aux dimension de celles desetats-unis. si le européens gagnent leur pari de mettre en place une monnaie saine, la suissebénéficiera alors d’un environnement beaucoup plus homogène et stable que par le passé. nousavons derrière nous l’expérience de plus de vingt an de franc suisse flottant. cette expériences’est révélée positive sur de nombreux plans, notamment sur celui de la maîtrise de l’inflation etdes taux d’intérêt ba dont nous jouissons.mais le change flottants -- ou plus concrètement l’absence d’ordre monétaireinternational -- comportent aussi de inconvénients pour le petits pays. le plus grave est celuide l’absence de discipline imposée aux politiques économiques nationales. avec la monnaieunique et l’application d’une seule politique monétaire, notre environnement gagnera enhomogénéité et de source de perturbation disparaîtront. evidemment, cette situation pourraattrister quelques salles de change, mais c’est sans aucun doute un point positif pour l’économiesuisse dans son ensemble. pour illustrer ce point, permettez-moi de prendre deux exemples:considérez tout d’abord la relation entre le franc suisse et le mark allemand aucours de quinze dernières années. si le choses sont mesurées en terme réel, constate que larelation franc -- dm oscillé dans une bande de fluctuation relativement étroite, de – 5 %,autour d’un trend d’appréciation du franc de l’ordre de 0,5 % par an.vue sou cet angle, la relation entre le franc et le mark, deux monnaies quin’étaient liées par aucun accord monétaire et dont le cours n’étaient pa influencés par desinterventions sur le marchés de changes, s’est révélée être extraordinairement stable. leschanges flottants n’ont donc pa généré le cours irrationnels que certains annonçaient.bis review 103/1997 - 3 -pourquoi cette stabilité relative entre le franc et le mark? parce qu’il existait entrela suisse et l’allemagne une grande convergence de objectifs de politique économique et dessituations conjoncturelles. considérez maintenant la relation entre le franc suisse et la lireitalienne, pour la même période et sur le mêmes bases. l’image que l’on en retire est fortdifférente. la volatilité est beaucoup plus forte. la lira connaît une longue périoded’appréciation jusqu’en 1992, puis chute dans un retournement dramatique de situation, suivid’une nouvelle normalisation. vous connaissez le raisons qui se trouvent en arrière-plan de cesfluctuations de la lire. elles tiennent aux situation souvent difficiles rencontrées par la politiqueéconomique italienne durant ce années.pour l’économie suisse, de tell variation de cours sont extrêmementdouloureuses. le degré de compétitivité de son industrie d’exportation se modifiedramatiquement, et ceci dans de périodes relativement brèves. il s’ensuivit de coûts élevésd’ajustement au plan économique et social.la relation entre le franc et le mark et celle entre le franc et la lira révèlent doncdeux aspect bien différents de notre histoire financière récente. d’un côté, une relative stabilité,de l’autre, une volatilité marquée.c’est dans ce domaine qu’un progrès considérable serum réalisé grâce àl’intégration monétaire européenne. avec la fixation irrémédiable de parités, puis l’introductionde l’euro, une seule politique monétaire serum appliquée. le continent aura gagné en homogénéitéfinancière. si l’euro disposait, demain, de mêmes caractéristiques que le mark allemand, larelation entre le franc suisse et le monnaies européennes serum beaucoup plus stable que par lepassé.les progrès de la stabilité monétaire profiteront donc non seulement auxeuropéens mais aussi à ceux qui vivent à leur côté.2.2.2. une intégration accéléréeau-delà du changement de l’environnement financier, je m’attends aussi à ce quela monnaie unique accélère l’intégration de fait de l’économie suisse dans l’économieeuropéenne.aujourd’hui déjà, 80 % de no importation proviennent de l’union européenne,qui absorbe à son tour 60 % de no exportations. de par no flux commerciaux, notreconjoncture dépend fortement de ce qui se passe chez no voisins. le retournementsconjoncturels en suisse coïncident avec ceux de la france et de l’allemagne. demain, avec unepolitique macro-économique unifiée autour de nous, tout porte à croire que le pulsionséconomiques qui s’exerceront sur nous seront de plus en plus synchronisées. notre rythme deproduction deviendra ainsi encore plus dépendant de ce qui se passe sur le continent.parallèlement à l’homogénéité économique croissante de l’union européenne constatera quela suisse aura de plus en plus un profil européen. cette intégration accrue de la suisse dansl’europe nous demandera évidemment de vivre étroitement avec la future monnaie européenne.tous le secteurs de notre économie qui commercent avec l’étranger se trouveront concernés.en premier lieu, le marché européen va devenir effectivement un „grand marché“dans lequel une monnaie -- l’euro -- serum l’instrument de transaction. nous devon en tenircompte. le pratiques européennes en matière de contrats, de conditions, de normess’imposeront encore plus à nous que par le passé. il serum toujours plus difficile d’utiliser le francbis review 103/1997 - 4 -comme monnaie de facturation pour no exportation et le touristes qui passeront la frontièrecomprendront mal qu’ils ne puissent utiliser leurs euro pour effectuer leurs paiements. laréalité d’une grande zone monétaire à notre porte nous demandera de la souplesse et del’imagination. l’europe, qui jusqu’ici n’était qu’une mosaïque monétaire, deviendra unensemble monolithique. ceci ne peut rester sans conséquence sur notre manière de commercer.un autre aspect important de l’impact de l’euro sur l’économie suisse est celui dela mise en place d’un système de paiement interbancaire en euros. cette question est délicate carelle n’est pa encore résolue au sein de l’union européenne elle-même.de quoi s’agit-il?au sein de l’union monétaire, le systèmes nationaux de paiements interbancairesseront reliés entre eux. il serum aussi possible de faire un paiement, valeur du jour même, de parisà francfort alors qu’aujourd’hui une telle opération s’exécute en 48 heures. le système européendes paiements ainsi créé bénéficiera de l’appui de la banque centrale européenne s’il devait êtreen manque de liquidités. au niveau européen existera donc ce qui existe déjà au niveau national.la difficulté vient du fait qu’un certain nombre de pay de l’ue ne participeront pa à lapremière phase d’intégration monétaire. pourront-ils se connecter au système de paiements, et àquelles conditions? cette question n’est pa encore réglée au sein de l’union.dans ce conditions, la récente décision de banques suisse de créer enallemagne une banque de clear qui serum chargée d’exécuter leurs paiements mutuels en euroset d’établir un pont avec la banque centrale européenne paraît adéquate. il conviendrad’examiner si la banque nationale peut jouer un rôle utile dans ce cadre lorsque le condition decoopération entre le „ins“ et le „outs“ au sein de l’union européenne auront été arrêtées.3. le conséquences pour la banque nationalej’en viens ainsi tout naturellement à la troisième partie de cet exposé: lesconséquences de l’intégration monétaire pour la politique de la banque nationale. a mon sens,deux type de question se posent:•les implication à long terme de l’intégration monétaire sur la politique de la bns,•les influence de court terme.a long terme, l’union monétaire européenne est pour nous synonymed’imbrication accrue de l’économie suisse dans la scène monétaire européenne. la situation dumarché de changes, qui est déjà aujourd’hui un facteur important dans notre appréciation de lasituation, le serum plus encore. le fait qu’une grande partie de notre commerce s’effectuera avecla zone euro, le fait aussi que la conjoncture européenne s’imposera toujours plus à la nôtrecréeront forcément une communauté de destin entre le franc et l’euro. une trop grande volatilitéde l’euro par rapport au franc pourrait devenir extrêmement douloureuse pour l’économie suisse.nous en somme conscients.j’ai toutefois confiance, et je base confiance sur l’expérience de lacohabitation du franc suisse et du mark au cours de quinze dernières années. si le objectifs etles situation économiques convergent entre la suisse et l’union européenne, tout porte à penserque la volatilité de la relation franc -- euro se maintiendra dans de limit acceptables. cettebis review 103/1997 - 5 -convergence de option fondamentales paraît acquise puisque la banque centraleeuropéenne, tout comme la bns, fera de la stabilité de prix l’objectif prioritaire de sa politique.au fil de années, le franc et l’euro reposeront donc sur de élémentsfondamentaux fort semblables. cela aura également pour conséquence de permettre unrapprochement progressif de taux d’intérêt sur ce devises. aujourd’hui, l’écart entre le tauxsuisses et allemands (représentant le taux sur l’euro) est de plus de 200 point de base. cet écartme semble biaisé par le incertitude liées à l’introduction de la monnaie unique. une foiscelles-ci dissipées, un rapprochement devrait se manifester. ce ne seront pa seulement le tauxsuisses qui monteront mais aussi le taux sur l’euro qui baisseront. ce rapprochement n’est paspour demain, il se manifestera lorsque le marchés seront convaincus de la stabilité de lanouvelle monnaie européenne.dans le court terme, la phase d’introduction de l’euro est marquée par une forteincertitude. pourtant, tout été mi en place au niveau institutionnel comme au niveau descritères de convergence pour convaincre le marchés que l’euro serum une monnaie de qualité.mais tant que le marchés ne pourront pa juger sur pièce, une incertitude existera, incertitudequi pourrait être source d’instabilité de marchés et qui pourrait maintenir le taux d’intérêt à unniveau plus élevé que ce qui serait souhaitable d’un point de vue conjoncturel. cette volatilitépotentielle de l’euro pourrait créer de difficultés pour le franc suisse, monnaie de refuge.comment neutraliser de tell perturbation pour l’économie suisse?il n’y pa de réponse simple et évidente à cette question.certains pensent qu’il conviendrait, à l’image de ce qu’avait fait l’autriche, quela suisse décide de se li unilatéralement à l’euro afin d’éliminer le risque de change. il luisuffirait pour cela de mener une politique de taux d’intérêt appropriée, voire de la renforcer pardes intervention sur le marché de changes. ce n’est malheureusement pa si facile! si nousfixions une parité entre le franc et l’euro, nous courrions deux risques majeurs:-soit le marchés nous croiraient et nous provoquerions alors une sortie massive decapitaux qui quitteraient le franc pour se placer dans la zone euro où le rémunérations sontnettement plus élevées;-soit le marchés ne considéreraient pa cette parité comme définitive et spéculeraient à sarévision à la hausse. notre stratégie stimulerait alors la spéculation au lieu de la calmer.nous devrons donc vivre avec un franc flottant, mais nous devrons aussi nouscomporter de telle sorte que „la bataille de l’euro n’ait pa lieu“. dans ce domaine, comme dansbien d’autres, il vaut mieux prévenir une situation que la corriger. nous nous somme efforcésces douze derniers mois d’éviter une appréciation du franc suisse face au mark. nous l’avons faiten menant une politique monétaire accommodante. cette stratégie été, je crois, couronnée desuccès. la faiblesse du mark engendrée par le incertitude l’euro s’est reportée avant tout sur ledollar et la livre sterling, le franc suisse n’a été atteint que marginalement. nous devonscontinuer sur cette ligne tant que le doutes sur l’euro n’auront pa disparu.mettons-nous ainsi en danger la stabilité de prix à moyen terme? je ne le croispas. la croissance de no agrégats monétaires se ralentit maintenant et le dépassement de lamonnaie centrale -- notre indicateur principal -- par rapport à son trend d’équilibre exagèrevraisemblablement le degré d’expansion de notre action. enfin, n’oublions pa que dans unbis review 103/1997 - 6 -environnement marqué par le risque d’un franc fort, la probabilité d’une résurgence marquée del’inflation est faible.conclusionles mois qui nous séparent de la première phase d’interprétation monétairepeuvent encore comporter de surprises. le calme relatif du marché de change au cours desdouze derniers mois est rassurant, il indique que le risques de perturbation futurs sont limités.une fois la zone monétaire définie, la convergence de taux d’intérêt s’imposerad’elle-même et l’union monétaire deviendra réalité.c’est une nouvelle phase de l’histoire européenne qui commencera alors. pour lasuisse également, bien qu’elle ne participe pa à l’intégration monétaire. nous aurons à vivreavec un environnement plus homogène, dont le taux d’intérêt seront peut-être relativementélevés dans une phase initiale, tant que la monnaie unique n’aura fait preuve de s qualités. surla durée, en revanche, il apparaîtra toujours plus de manière évidente que le franc suisse et l’eurosont de monnaies comparables, ce qui entraînera une convergence de taux entre la suisse etl’europe. personne ne peut dire, aujourd’hui, à quel rythme ce ajustements s’effectueront.la révolution monétaire, comme toute révolution, comporte de nombreusesincertitudes. nous en avon déjà vécues, nous en vivrons encore jusqu’à la fin de ce siècle.cela demandera aux entreprises une grande capacité d’adaptation au nouvelenvironnement. je ne parle pa seulement de établissements financier mais aussi de tous ceuxqui commercent avec l’europe.mais sur la durée, notre industrie d’exportation pourra compter avec unenvironnement monétaire plus homogène, moins volatil que par le passé. l’union monétairedemandera aussi beaucoup de pragmatisme dans la conduite de la politique monétaire. le„pragmatisme“ est souvent attrayant mais ne nous cachons pa qu’il est synonyme de prise dedécision dans de condition particulièrement difficiles où le point de repère sont moinsévidents que d’habitude.nous avon bon espoir, madame et messieurs, que le nouvel ordre monétaireeuropéen ne créera pa de handicap majeur pour la suisse et le franc suisse. il s’agit au contraired’une chance pour notre pays, celle de clore le chapitre de vingt-cinq années de désordresmonétaires en europe, pour déboucher sur une période où le politiques seront plus convergenteset stables. nous en attendons plus de calme dans le changes, ce qui serum dans l’intérêt dudéveloppement de notre commerce extérieur et aussi dans celui d’un retour à la croissanceéconomique dans notre pays._____________________________bis review 103/1997 m. tietmeyer explique la politique de stabilité dans la future uem exposéde prof. dr. han tietmeyer, président de la deutsche bundesbank, au club de l’expansion, àparis, le 27/10/97.ia la veille d’entrer dans un nouveau millénaire, nombreux sont ceux qui eneurope attendent avec une certaine fébrilité une “nouvelle ère monétaire” qui doit commencerdébut 1999 déjà avec la monnaie européenne commune. pendant longtemps, l’uem n’areprésenté qu’une vision générale. après avoir été inscrite pour la première fois --officiellement -- dans le calendrier européen au sommet de la haye en 1969, puis avoir étéconcrétisée par le plan werner, l’union monétaire disparu de la scène politique durant le deuxdécennies suivantes.avec la signature du traité de maastricht en 1992, l’uem est toutefois devenue unobjectif obligé s’inscrivant dans un plan fixé par contrat et comportant de échéances précises.or, ce plan doit être réalisé de façon à ce que l’on puisse ériger une construction durablementstable qui ne soit pa un échafaudage fragile donnant lieu à de conflits. en effet, l’uem nepourra faire progresser l’intégration économique et politique et éviter le conflits que si ellerepose sur de fondations vraiment stable et si le lois économiques sont continuellementobservées. voilà en quoi consiste notre objectif commun. l’union monétaire est lecouronnement d’un long processus historique. la france et l’allemagne en ont été dès le débutles force motrices. depuis la fin de la deuxième guerre mondiale, ce deux pay se sont fixécomme objectif la coopération économique et politique et ont cherché à établir de base solidespermettant de garantir la prospérité et la paix en europe. il ont été le moteur de l’intégration,même si par moment leurs motivation et position étaient différentes. mais c’est surtout dansle domaine de la politique monétaire que s’est produit, durant la dernière décennie, unrapprochement fondamental.iien conformité avec la mission qui leur est assignée, le banques centrales de nosdeux pay ont, aujourd’hui, comme objectif prioritaire la stabilité monétaire. actuellement, letaux d’augmentation annuel de prix à la consommation en france et en allemagne oscille entreun peu moins de 1½% et 2%. le taux directeurs, de 3,3% dans le deux pays, sont pour lemoment au même niveau. sur le compartiment du long terme, c’est-à-dire sur le marchés descapitaux où se négocient par exemple le emprunts d’etat à long terme, le taux sont égalementplus ou moins identiques. mais ce qui est encore bien plus important dans ce contexte, c’est qu’ily ait conformité entre le position de deux pay sur le plan de la politique monétaire.ainsi, le responsables de la banque de france et de la bundesbank sontconvaincues que la stabilité de prix est la condition essentielle pour assurer la croissance, unbon niveau d’emploi et la stabilité monétaire externe. mais elles savent aussi que la stabilité desprix ne suffit pas, elle seule, à la longue. elle doit s’accompagner également d’une réorientationdes politiques financière, fiscale, sociale et salariale, qui doit stimuler le dynamisme économiqueet, partant, encourager l’emploi. la stratégie à long terme de no deux instituts, qui divergefondamentalement de la politique de réglage en finesse du processus économique pratiquéeautrefois dans le pay anglo-saxons, devrait également être adoptée, à mon avis, par la futurebanque centrale européenne. le fait que le politiques menées par la banque de france et ladeutsche bundesbank soient semblables, en théorie comme en pratique, n’est pa dû au seulbis review 102/1997 - 2 -hasard. c’est l’aboutissement d’un processus de rapprochement lancé depuis assez longtempsdéjà.le facteur décisif certainement été le fait qu’au printemps 1983 la france optépour une politique économique et financière axée sur la stabilité et qu’elle n’a pa dévié de cettevoie durant le années suivantes, malgré tout le difficultés qu’elle rencontrées. le résultatest que le taux de change se sont stabilisés dans une mesure croissante au sein du sme, toutcomme le niveau de prix en europe. avec le traité de maastricht qui prévoit que le banquescentrales nationales n’ont aucune instruction à recevoir de gouvernements, la france etl’allemagne ont délibérément recherché aussi la convergence au niveau institutionnel et, àprésent, elles ont largement réalisé cet objectif.iiietant donné que le danger menaçant la stabilité se sont accrus et que la politiquemonétaire exerce, depuis une assez longue période, de effets de plus en plus expansifs même siles taux directeurs n’ont pa bougé, la bundesbank légèrement resserré le rênes monétairesdébut octobre. plusieurs autres banques centrales européennes -- dont la banque de france -- ontelles aussi relevé quelque peu leurs taux. dans no deux pays, la loi stipule aujourd’hui que lesdécisions de politique monétaire sont du seul ressort de banques centrales et ne peuvent enaucun ca être influencées par le gouvernement et la politique.cette règle est également conforme au traité de maastricht. et l’indépendance dela future banque centrale européenne encore une fois été réaffirmée lors de la réunioninformelle de l’ecofin à mondorf-les-bains et à l’occasion du conseil économique et financierfranco-allemand de münster. cela implique également que la responsabilité serum désormaisassumée, au niveau européen, seulement à travers le rapport présenté par le président de labanque centrale européenne et non pa par le diver membres du future système européen debanques centrales.le relèvement de 0,3 point de pourcentage du troisième taux directeur vise àcontrecarrer d’éventuelles pressions inflationnistes. ainsi, la politique monétaire contribue à ceque le taux à long terme du marché -- qui sont d’une grande importance pour l’économie enallemagne tout comme en france -- continuent à se situer à un niveau aussi ba que possible.si, depuis, le taux d’intérêt à long terme ont subi une légère hausse dans nosdeux pays, c’est parce que l’évolution observée sur le marchés américains gagné notrecontinent. de nombreux analystes de milieu bancaires sont d’avis que le relèvement de tauxdirecteurs favorise aussi la convergence de taux à court terme en europe. j’estime qu’il fautfaire preuve, là, de circonspection. il est certain que le taux à court terme de pay de l’unionse rapprocheront progressivement le un de autres à partir du printemps 1998, une fois que lestaux de conversion bilatéraux auront été fixés. j’espère qu’ils le feront au niveau le plus baspossible et non pa au niveau qui constituera la moyenne de taux directeurs pratiqués jusque-làen europe. mais ce niveau dépendra bien entendu de la situation économique du moment ainsique du choix de pay qui participeront à l’uem, qui restent pour l’heure deux inconnues.ivactuellement, presque tous le pay de l’union européenne sont confrontés à unchômage record. mais ce n’est pa en pratiquant une politique monétaire laxiste qu’ils pourrontrésoudre ce problème puisque le sous-emploi essentiellement une origine structurelle, tout aubis review 102/1997 - 3 -moins en allemagne. jean-claude trichet indiqué récemment que le banques centrales nepouvaient -- et ne devaient -- fournir à l’économie que le meilleur environnement monétairepossible. mais elles ne peuvent pa “prescrire” croissance et emploi. c’est aux partenairessociaux de faire le nécessaire -- par le biais d’une plus grande flexibilité et mobilité -- pour qu’iln’y ait pa de suppression de post et que de nouveaux emplois soient créés. il est certain quela politique économique, financière et sociale de l’etat doit également renforcer la dynamique del’économie en créant de condition propices et en contribuant, surtout dans no deux pays, àréduire le chômage.récemment, le fmi exhorté, à juste titre, le européens à tout faire pour quel’euro puisse bien démarrer. il rappelé l’urgence de réformer le marchés du travail et lessystèmes d’assurance sociale et de retraite. car, de lui-même, l’euro ne pourra pa résoudre cesproblèmes. la politique de stabilité n’est pa au demeurant une invention allemande. il faudrait àce propos éliminer le préjugés qui existent encore dans no deux pays. en france aussi, il s’esttoujours trouvé quelqu’un pour réclamer une économie stable non inflationniste. rappelez-vousce qu’a écrit jacques rueff à la fin de années cinquante sur l’âge de l’inflation.pour rueff, le revendications excessives adressées à l’etat mettent en péril lastabilité de prix et le système économique et social libéral. l’histoire est riche en exemplesmontrant comment, à la longue, de comptes public non ordonnés peuvent ébranler la monnaieet l’économie. en france surtout, l’assainissement de budget public toujours revêtu unegrande importance. c’est ainsi que jusqu’au début de années quatre-vingt, le déficit budgétairea été bien inférieur à la limite de 3% fixée par le traité de maastricht. l’endettement est restéjusqu’à maintenant au-dessous du seuil de 60 % imposé par le critères de convergence.la limite de 3% n’a d’ailleurs pa été inscrite dans le traité de maastricht à lademande de allemands, mais sur l’initiative de français. il faudra aussi impérativement queles finance publiques soient durablement stable lorsque l’union monétaire européenne (et sapolitique monétaire unique) aura été mise en place. en effet, de dettes publiques élevées -- enparticulier lorsqu’elles sont financées à court terme -- peuvent sérieusement compliquer la miseen application de la politique monétaire unique et être source de conflits.vavant de conclure, j’aimerais encore parler brièvement du développement del’intégration politique dans l’union, domaine qui à vrai dire n’entre pa tout à fait dans lesattributions d’un banquier central. me référant à une phrase de voltaire qui dit que “les parolessont aux pensées ce que l’or est aux diamants; il est nécessaire pour le mettre en œuvre, mais ilen faut peu”, je résumerai pensée. la question de l’intégration monétaire à trouvé uneréponse dans le traité de maastricht. cependant, en dépit de effort déployés avant et pendant leconseil d’amsterdam, aucune solution n’a été trouvée pour une grande partie de interrogationssuscitées par la question de la finalité politique de l’intégration européenne.je suppose que pour certains point très importants comme l’organisationinstitutionnelle ou la définition exacte de compétences nationales ou supranationales dans lesdifferénts domaines politiques, ce question ne pourront pa être résolues dans l’immédiat. maistoutes le nation concernées doivent être conscientes de ce que l’union monétaire sera, dès ledépart, une communauté monétaire solidaire qui ne pourra plus être résiliée. non seulement iln’y aura plus de taux directeurs différents dans l’union monétaire, mais une importante partie dela politique cessera de relever de la compétance de pay pour être exercée à l’échelonsupranational, et ce de façon définitive. il ne serum en effet plus possible de sortir de l’unionbis review 102/1997 - 4 -monétaire. c’est pourquoi il faut qu’il ait aussi une volonté politique de s’engager durablementen formant une union politique. cela vaut en particulier à la veille de l’élargissement de l’unioneuropéenne.valéry giscard d’estaing et helmut schmidt ont rappelé, à juste titre, dans unarticle commun publié il quelques jours, que “le succès de la monnaie unique dépend, àterme, de l’accomplissement de nouveaux pa sur le plan politique. sans cela, le changementsde gouvernement intervenant dans l’un ou l’autre de pay membres risqueraient de remettre encause la solidité de l’union. (...) on aurait pu s’attendre à ce que le traité d’amsterdamcontienne de décisions prise par le pay participants, mais ceux-ci n’étaient pa capables des’accorder sur de réformes. (...) l’union monétaire est un projet fédéral qui doit êtreaccompagné et soutenu par d’autres mesures. elle n’a jamais été faite pour rester un îlot isolédans l’œil d’un cyclone d’intérêts nationaux.” pour tout ce raisons, il est nécessaire que lacoopération franco-allemande devienne encore plus intense, afin que le dynamisme del’intégration ne faiblisse pa après l’entrée dans l’union monétaire. l’unification européenne estet reste un objectif porteur.bis review 102/1997 mr. bäckström discus current situation monetary policy swedenremarks governor swedish central bank, mr. urban bäckström, standingcommittee finance, stockholm, 23/10/97.i like thank committee invitation discus swedisheconomy current situation monetary policy. in open remark today i shall begin bybriefly summarise recent years’ economic tendency consider present constructionof monetary policy. a look future conclude. what i say base latestinflation report event since published.from dual situation broad expansionsweden’s economy enter fifth year expansion since profoundcrisis begin decade. since gdp turn upwards summer 1993, annualgrowth average 2.5 per cent. annual inflation period average 2 percent. this mark contrast 1970s 1980s, annual growth averagedapproximately 2 per cent inflation 8 per cent. in one respect, however, situation dateis still dismal, namely regard labour market employment. if economy grow wellbut employment remain weak unemployment high, strong probability labourmarket affect structural problems.although growth recent year satisfactory, generation broaderupswing economy prove difficult. initially, three-quarters gdp’s increasecame manufacturing, represent 20 per cent sweden’s economy. thismeant bottleneck occur fairly quickly, accompany various type inflationaryimpulses. our relatively small industrial sector cannot expect sustain growth rate ishigher total economy achieve 1970s 1980s.the problem dual economy -- flourish export-related industrial sectorand rather weak recovery sector domestic orientation -- stem part lowconfidence economic policy’s determination ability keep inflation low long run.this turn consequence sweden’s poor record respect, couple seriousproblems government finances. long bond rate fluctuate widely 1994 1995 theyactually climb level year high inflation. the exchange rate continue along itsdepreciating path 1970s 1980s. for riksbank, lack confidence directionof economic policy leave little room manoeuvre. although instrumental rate low duringthe spring 1994, virtually market rate particularly long maturity rose.sweden approach point economic policy demonstrate focus onstability firm commitment.the monetary tighten and, perhaps even great extent, fiscalconsolidation gradually generate increase confidence sweden’s readiness ability achievelow long-term inflation. against background, 1996 possible cut repo rate toits low level since early 1960s. low inflation decrease inflation expectation alsocontributed fall bond rates, accompany appreciation krona early lows.since december 1996 repo rate unchanged 4.10 per cent.all all, condition gradually create broad economic upswing. withthe time lag generally apply economic policy, 1997 observe mood swingamong households, lead instance increase private consumption, export growth hasbis review 101/1997 -

finally, extent volume pick-up primaryauctions reduce due interest rate considerations, reduce availability float stock thesecondary market.5. what factor inhibit market clear mechanisms? there four importantissues, viz., notify auction size, type auction, element non-competitive bid frequency ofauctions treasury bills. another issue concern relate large private placement corporate debt.6. at present, pre-announced notify amount 364-day 14-day auctions.this procedure enable rbi determine either cut-off price amount accept aflexible manner. notify amount auction bring transparency auction

bids. country practice show thatnon-competitive bidder make allocation within notify amount. however, non-competitivebidders country consist essentially small, retail inexperienced investors. since themaximum bid restrict small value, competitive bid price get distorted. there aview indian market non-competitive bidder also allow competitive bidders.however, country, since state government major

future periodsof volatility. response event 1987 crash tend crisis-specific. one challengesis make public policy responsive change market condition rather let drive solely bythe recent crisis. the circuit breaker put place crash offer interest example thisphenomenon.circuit breaker trade halt coordinate across equity equity derivativesmarkets. they first suggest brady task force, one notablerecommendations report. a state report, purpose (and otherrecommendations) “[t]o help prevent repetition event mid-october provide aneffective coordinate response face market disorder.”circuit breaker widely cite today one success crash post-mortems.but i, one, question evaluation. circuit breaker never actually triggered, contrast tosome so-called “speed bumps” affect particular trade strategy trippedroutinely. (in contrast circuit breakers, coordinate across equity derivative markets,speed bump trade restriction put place individual market places.) if circuitbreakers never use halt trading, follow never experience tryingto re-start trade either. to economist myself, scary time marketcrash trade occurring. our tendency worry stop tradingthan re-start mystifying. (i realize discussion rule theresumption trade overwhelm attention halt.)recent re-assessments circuit breaker focus increase magnitude ofprice decline necessary trigger coordinate trade halts. if go continue circuitbreakers, i supportive action feel periodic evaluation circuit breaker valuableto ensure trade halt occur unusual market conditions. nonetheless, i think thatwe also broadly re-evaluate circuit breaker light current market conditions. be circuitbreakers fulfil goal articulate brady task force provide effective coordinatedresponse face market disorder?

what kind problem might domestic specialistsand market maker restart market move away halt? recentchanges shorten duration circuit breaker likely would ameliorate concern somewhat,but worry remains.bis review 96/1997 - 3 -another important change financial landscape year since crash beena great focus risk management market participant supervisors. development newinstruments, exchanges, new method evaluate risk, give marketparticipants powerful new tool allow absorb market shocks. similarly, risk management toolshave enhance clear organizations.regulators must respond new tools. to fully utilize benefits, regulator willneed approach regulation supervision different ways. a good example find theapproach bank supervisor develop capital requirement market risk. after initial fit andstarts, basle supervisors’ committee embrace concept use banks’ internal model basisfor capital requirement market risk. the federal reserve take process employ newapproaches regulation step pre-commitment proposal. pre-commitment allow banksto commit maximum loss experience next quarter trade portfolio; thiscommitment become capital requirement. the proposal give bank incentive establish thecommitment prudent fashion fine disclosure violated. economist theaudience recognize proposal application incentive-compatible approach regulation.i suspect far area regulatory structure whichincentive-compatible approach could implemented. self-regulatory organization also may find suchan approach beneficial, particularly era sros ask assume moreregulatory responsibilities. incentive-compatible regulation essentially try harness self-interest ofmarket participant achieve broad public policy goals. by use approach, overall goal isto make individual market participant resilient good able withstand shocks. this, all,is basic (and probably effective) protection firm face event the1987 crash.at macroeconomic level, public policy also ensure market theeconomy withstand shocks. while 1987 crash significant, real economiceffects, always case stock market crashes. such episode generally accompaniedby dramatic increase uncertainty increase demand liquidity safety. some thesedemands liquidity may, turn, reflect fear crisis spread broadly theeconomy. in 1987, key role play federal reserve demonstrate determination meetliquidity demands, thereby reassure market participant problem would spread beyondthe financial system. problem contain instance, policy maker cannot complacent.in lesson learn crash, lose sight potential financial crisis tohave real effect on-going need public policy direct toward mitigate theseeffects.bis review 96/1997 mr. rangarajan address special convocation indian institute ofmanagement address governor reserve bank india, dr. c. rangarajan, specialconvocation hold confer upon honorary title fellow indian institute managementat ahmedabad 3/10/97.it give immense pleasure campus indian institute management.i accept humility award title “fellow indian institute management”,ahmedabad. what great honour recognition one’s peer family?
