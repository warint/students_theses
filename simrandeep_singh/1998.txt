Mr. Meyer addresses the competitiveness of financial centres from a Swissperspective   Address by the Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, Mr. HansMeyer, at the International Bankers Club Luxembourg, held in Luxembourg on 23/3/98.Both Luxembourg and Switzerland are major financial centres in Europe. Theperformance and competitiveness of the financial services industry are thus of key economic and socialimportance to both countries. I should like to use this opportunity to say a few words on the subject fromwhat may be a somewhat unusual perspective.The factors which determine the competitiveness of an industry are basically the same asthose determining the success of the entire economy. In both cases, we are looking at a multitude of quitediverse factors with varying degrees of importance. Today, I would like to single out just three of themwhich I believe are of particular significance: economic stability, social equilibrium (i.e. politicalstability), and the human factor. Although each of these elements could be dealt with separately, theyshould ultimately be viewed in a broader context.Let’s start with economic stability. I define this as a state of balanced development acrossthe economy as a whole, characterised by steady growth, a modest inflation rate and low unemployment.One of the main prerequisites for achieving such a state is the ability not only to createbut to sustain an appropriate economic framework. This is primarily an objective for monetary policy,fiscal policy and competition policy. The main goal of monetary policy is to maintain price stability. Thisis of course not an end in itself, but a means to an end. A non-inflationary climate facilitates the free playof market forces and keeps socially damaging developments at bay. Fiscal policy must, basically, aim inthe longer term to balance the public budgets. As with monetary policy, it is a question of steady,ongoing efforts. This should be no surprise, considering that the whole spectrum of public sectoractivities is reflected in the public budgets. This in turn raises the question of what services the stateshould perform, who should pay for them and how public-services can most efficiently be provided.Where competition policy is concerned, the aim is to create conditions conducive to the free play ofmarket forces. In recent decades, it has unfortunately not always been possible to gain consensus supportfor the idea of free competition, which is still regarded with scepticism and suspicion by many people.Provided that free competition is able to develop in a stable environment, there can be little doubt that itis the best means to assure optimal use of available resources. When things go wrong, it is generally duenot to the principle of free competition itself but to the lack of a stable environment.I would like to stress once again that the task of creating a stable economic framework isa never-ending one: it is a question of constantly working towards - but never actually reaching - theintended goal. Success in this endeavour is not just a question of thinking things through in a consistentway but, above all, of adopting a persevering and workmanlike approach.Economic stability in the sense of a balanced development of the economy as a whole isthe sine qua non for a financial centre. It is essential if investors are to gain sufficient confidence in theprospect of sustainable business success. Stable prices, low interest rates, modest rates of taxation and asolid currency are the crucial factors.To what extent - if at all - is a financial centre reliant on its economic hinterland? Thisquestion is less easy to answer. Although a well-balanced interdependency might seem to be desirablehere as well, this is not necessarily confirmed by experience. In fact, there never seems to have been anyclose correlation, and with modern technology enhancing the mobility of people, goods and services, thelinks have become even looser. Our two countries at least are proof of the fact that there need not be anyclose correlation between the importance of a country’s economy and that of its financial sector.Talking about economic stability, I referred to the need for perseverance. This isprecisely where I see the link with social and political stability. The central task of any community is toprovide its members with the greatest possible degree of security, freedom and general welfare. The lastBIS Review   26/1998
- 2 -of these factors - the general welfare of the population - is dependent precisely on the creation of theappropriate economic framework I mentioned earlier. I should add that this task can only beaccomplished if a sufficient number of citizens actively help in shaping developments. This is especiallythe case in the sphere of fiscal policy.In the wake of extremely dynamic growth, public budgets have grown considerably in alldeveloped countries over the past few decades. While the original purpose of this spending was to meet apressing and legitimate need such as in the area of social security - there has been a growing disparitybetween the claims made on the public purse and the willingness to generate the necessary resources.Today, we have reached a point where this trend needs to be reversed. However, neither rules andregulations nor government ordinances can achieve this alone. Instead, we have to take small butpersistent steps to rectify the situation both from the spending and the revenues side, and - not least ofall - to improve productivity. Because such ongoing measures need the backing of the community, thechances of success tend to be greater in smaller communities than in larger ones.Our experience suggests that a federally structured society based on direct democracy iswell suited to achieving the interaction between economic and political stability I have just outlined.Here again, though, I should add that we are always on the way towards our goals and will never actuallymeet them.Even in the conditions we enjoy, it is not easy to reach the necessary consensus.This brings me to the “human factor”. The background conditions I have been talkingabout are aimed in no small measure at enabling individuals to develop their own interests as well asthose of society. This symbiosis is essential to the prosperity of the economy as a whole.Where human resources are concerned, what is needed most of all is adequate training,motivation and the right mentality. Over the course of time, the development of the economy and theassociated structural change have constantly thrown up new challenges for everyone involved. This canbe seen, for example, in the phenomenon of structural unemployment, arising from an imbalance insupply and demand for specific skills. Although the need for continuous training and retraining is nothingnew, it has now become an urgent concern. But qualifications alone are not sufficient. They only comeinto their own when the people in question are also motivated.If we were to restrict ourselves purely to economic activities, we could leave it at that.But after what I said about the correlations between the economy and society, there is clearly more to it.In a democratic community, we don’t just need “economic subjects” who contribute their skills inspecific areas and with the right mentality. We also need citizens who are willing and able to concernthemselves at all times with developments in the community and to help shape these developments.If progress is to be made towards achieving balanced - and therefore stable growth, it isespecially important that individuals should be able to identify with the community as a whole. Clearinterdependencies with the economy emerge here as a key aspect of social coexistence. Only if theindividual members of society are assimilated into a balanced and flourishing economic environment willthey identify with society to the extent that they work actively towards its goals - which in turn isessential to the successful shaping of the appropriate economic framework. The resulting socialequilibrium, i.e. political stability, creates the necessary confidence in a stable and sustainabledevelopment that is so essential to a financial centre.Today, there is a tendency for people to retreat into the role of the pure economic subject.I see this as a worrying development, and indeed as posing a threat to both the economy and society.Based on what I said earlier, the economy and society can only flourish in a balanced environment. Butthis balance can only be achieved if the citizens are aware of their dual responsibility and act accordingly.BIS Review   26/1998
- 3 -We have talked about economic stability, political stability and the human factor. Theseare the elements which define the substance of a financial centre, and the necessary symbiosis betweenthem hinges on the actions of the individual. But we should not forget the importance of other majoraspects such as a clearly defined legal system and a properly functioning technical and organisationalinfrastructure.I would also like to address another aspect that is of particular importance to a centralbank: the stability of the system. Maintaining stability in the financial sphere should not be viewed inisolation, as it is closely interlinked with the human and economic factors discussed earlier.Political and economic stability, the quality of the human contribution, a clearly definedlegal order and an efficient infrastructure are the keys to the success of a financial centre. To this, weshould add a reputation which is founded upon a sound attitude and a good track record, going beyondthe criteria we have enumerated.Stability of the financial system is a concern primarily for the market participantsthemselves. Furthermore, it comes within the remit both of the bank supervisors and of the central bank,which is responsible for monetary policy. As you know, responsibilities and powers are kept separate inmy country, the task of supervising the banks being assigned to an independent body, the FederalBanking Commission. Discussion about whether it would be preferable to unite the two institutionsunder one roof has been going on for a long time. Both solutions clearly have their advantages anddisadvantages, each of which may be weighted differently depending on the requirements of society.Consequently, the debate must be pragmatic and not dogmatic. We believe that our approach has provedits worth and do not see any need for radical change. It is clear, though, that the separation ofresponsibilities and powers can only function on a basis of close cooperation and trust.I should like to touch upon two areas in which fundamental changes are needed. First, thefinancial systems have obviously been becoming more complex with regard to the roles played by theirmajor participants. The traditional approach of focusing supervisory activities on the banks thus seemsless and less appropriate. A more comprehensive supervisory system, covering the financial markets as awhole, would be preferable, with particular attention being paid to the transparency of market activities.Moreover, bank supervision should take account of the increasingly international natureof the financial markets. There would appear to be good reason to call for a globalisation of thesupervisory system. But globalisation is one of those “in” words that has to be treated with caution. As amatter of fact, individual financial markets are still embedded in a national economic and socialenvironment. What we need is for cooperation between the national supervisory bodies to be graduallyintensified - which is in fact happening. True supranational supervision is still a long way off, as thenecessary economic and social framework is lacking.For this reason, I should now like to focus on the role that an individual central bank hasto play in helping to safeguard the stability of the financial system.I have already spoken about the general prerequisites needed for a financial market toflourish. Within the scope defined by the operating conditions mentioned, market players are basicallyresponsible themselves for what they do or don’t do. Their prime concern is to stay solvent at all timesby adopting sound business practices and putting an effective organisation in place. To prevent problemsfrom occurring, the responsible bodies at the individual banks must be able at all times, and with aminimum of delay, to accurately assess their risk situation and to take rapid and appropriate action.Of course, it is never possible to rule out the possibility of an individual bank runninginto difficulties. In such cases, a solution must first be sought through the market. Solidarity among theother market players should provide a “first line of defence”. Seeking funds from the central bank canonly be contemplated in the last instance - hence the expression “lender of last resort”. Obtaining creditfrom the central bank presupposes that the liquidity requirements are only temporary. If the solvency of aBIS Review   26/1998
- 4 -bank is in peril because of a threat to its capital, the problem is a matter for the supervisory authoritiesand possibly for the state itself. In practice, the boundary between liquidity and solvency problems can bea fluid one.In my view, it is important for everyone involved not to lose sight of these principles -which are in fact quite simple. It should not be assumed that the central bank might take action beyondthe limits outlined. But this does not mean that it cannot assist in the search for solutions, as far as theydo not involve extending further credit.If the problems of individual banks multiply, there is a danger that liquidity may dry outthroughout the entire system. In such a case, the central bank would basically be able to supply themarket with the necessary liquidity. However, it may then come into conflict with the requirements of apolicy geared to economic stability. Consequently, the short-term benefits of an easing of monetarypolicy should be weighed against the longer-term risks.I would like to sum up my thoughts as follows:1.Three factors are of prime importance to the competitiveness of a financialcentre: economic stability, political stability and the “human factor” (i.e.professionalism, motivation and mentality). Although these factors can each beviewed separately, it is the interaction between them that really counts.2.Economic stability, in the sense of a balanced development of the economy as awhole, is made possible by the existence of an appropriate economic framework.This is created first and foremost by monetary policy, fiscal policy andcompetition policy. Economic stability provides the financial services industrywith a favourable climate in terms of low inflation and interest rates, moderatetax levels and appropriate exchange rates.3.Favourable economic conditions are planned and implemented as part of theprocess of social coexistence. This can best be achieved when the largestpossible number of the community’s members are involved.4Individuals are at the same time citizens and economic subjects, thereby creatinga crucial interdependency. Proper integration into a balanced economicenvironment is an important prerequisite for developing a sense of commonpurpose - in other words, identifying with society and thus also displaying awillingness to actively help shape its progress. This ultimately means thateconomic and social development can only progress in a sustainable andbalanced way if an appropriate equilibrium can be maintained between them.5.Even at a time when global economic and social developments are becomingmore and more closely intertwined, being an integral part of a nationalcommunity still plays an important role. It is still essential that these nationalcommunities should strive first and foremost to keep their own house in order - ahouse, though, which should not just be stable but open as well.6.Ensuring the stability of the financial system is one of the core tasks of thesupervisory authorities and of the central bank in its capacity as lender of lastresort. However, the market players’ sense of individual responsibility is also ofkey importance. If a third party is to offer assistance in a system run on freemarket principles, this can and should be seen as nothing more nor less - thanhelping the others to help themselves.BIS Review   26/1998
Mr. Issing discusses the European Central Bank as a new institution and theproblem of accountability   Paper delivered by Prof. Otmar Issing, a member of the Directorate ofthe Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Symposium on “Challenges for Highly Developed Countries in theGlobal Economy” in Kiel on 20/3/98.Preliminary remarksEuropean monetary union is an important milestone on the road to Europe. The longand winding road of European integration is accurately described by Siebert and Koop (1993, p. 1)1as follows:“The road Western Europe took from the end of World War II to its current state hasbeen one with lots of steep and sometimes blind curves, with harsh speed limits and frequent detours.But still it has been one that attracted more and more traffic.”Siebert and Koop interpret the competition among governments in a fashion similar toTiebout (1956)2, as a market for institutional arrangements. In institutional competition, the nationalgovernments strive to find ever better institutional arrangements in order to keep mobile factors athome or to attract them.With the establishment of the European Central Bank (ECB), competition among theparticipating countries to have the “best central bank constitution” will be over; the introduction ofthe euro will eliminate competition to see which one has the “best currency”. The political decision infavour of this radical institutional change was taken when the Maastricht Treaty was ratified. As isshown not least by the debate on the ECB’s accountability which has just begun, the new institutionwill not find it easy to hold its own in a critical environment.I. The Bundesbank modelExactly fifty years ago, on March 1, 1948, the Bank Deutscher Länder was created asa central banking system for post-war western Germany - to be succeeded in 1957 by the DeutscheBundesbank. No one could possibly have had an inkling at the time what a success story thisinstitution would become. The D-Mark has become one of the most stable currencies in the worldand, to that extent, the Bundesbank has set a standard for monetary policy.It thus seemed fitting to investigate the reasons for this success. Time and again, it hasbeen shown to be the case that the stability of the D-Mark is founded on two factors: first, the statuteof the central bank, and second, the Germans’ especially marked aversion to inflation, consideringthat the currency had been destroyed twice within a generation.                                                       1Siebert, H. and M.J.

- 2 -IndependenceFor a long time, this marriage of statute and public support was perceived to be atypically German, and thus specific, phenomenon, no importance being attached to it as an examplefor others to follow. This assessment only changed significantly in the wake of the worldwideacceleration of inflation during the 1970s. Soon, whole libraries were full of studies on the causes andeffects of inflation and how to combat it. Finally, interest also became focused on the institutionalbackground of monetary developments. The degree of central bank independence was soon found tobe a key variable for real-life monetary policy action.The findings of a wealth of studies boil down to the following two generalities (for anoverview, see Eijffinger and de Haan, 1996):-The higher the degree of central bank independence, the lower the rate of inflationgenerally is.-The higher degree of price stability does not necessarily have to be bought at theprice of losses in economic growth or major fluctuations in output.For a long time, institutional questions were quite generally neglected. It has nowbecome evident that institutions do matter - not least in the area of monetary policy, too. In a standardvolume on this subject, the author tersely states: “Institutions such as the legal framework withinwhich policy operates are important determinants of policy outcomes. In particular the independenceof central banks from their respective political authorities can influence the degree of policy activismand the distribution of inflation.” (Cukierman, 1992, p. 5.)That realisation was already common knowledge in Germany. However, in aninternational context, central bank independence was for a long time neither widespread in practicenor popular among economists - i.e., if they were interested in the subject in the first place. There wasthus a fundamental change in the second half of the 1980s. When preliminary work on theestablishment of European Monetary Union (EMU) started, the intellectual environment for anappropriate solution had already been prepared. Very soon thereafter, attention came to be focused onthe Statute of the European Central Bank. Lest we forget, when the Conference of Maastricht tookplace in December 1991, the national central banks of most of the signatory countries wereinstitutions that were more or less dependent on their governments. Bearing that in mind, the decisionin favour of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the European Central Bank (ECB) isall the more remarkable.II. The new institutionMistrust of the currency is inevitably reflected in corresponding risk premiums in theinterest rate, and thus costs a country dearly. The Statute assumes particular significance precisely inthe case of a new currency and a new central bank - it is an important signal of what monetary policyand what money the public can expect. “Institutions reduce uncertainty by constraining humanaction. Thereby, they enable economic actors to form expectations about the actions of others.”(Streit et al., 1997, p. 688.)Will the Statute of the European Central Bank meet these requirements? Is it suited tocreating credibility for the institution even before its start?BIS Review   25/1998
- 3 -CredibilityCredibility and reputation have been developed out of a neo-classical concept ofmonetary policy-making, based on the natural rate of unemployment and rational expectations(Spahn, 1997, p. 235). Barro and Gordon (1983) argued that central banks are likely to suffer from acredibility problem. This credibility problem stems from the assumed goal of increasing employmentabove its natural rate by means of inflationary surprises. Rational private agents anticipate thisoutcome and react by increasing the expected rate of inflation. The result is an inflationary biaswithout any effect on employment.However, in a multi-period setting, precommitment of monetary policy to adhere toprice stability may be possible. If the public is decidedly averse to inflation, it would be difficult tobreak inflationary expectations after a surprise inflation had been triggered deliberately. This wouldmake the subsequent process of disinflation more costly and thereby effectively discourage monetarypolicy-makers from using the means of “surprise inflation” in the first place.Inspired by Rogoff (1985), some have suggested that credibility problems of optimalmonetary policy could be mitigated by delegating monetary policy to an independent central bank.The role of the government is then to determine the institutional framework of monetarypolicy-making with the central bank actually implementing the policy. However, Jensen (1997) hasraised the question of why delegating monetary policy should be more credible than implementingoptimal monetary policy itself. He has shown that delegation improves sub-optimal outcomes, butonly to the extent that there are important costs of “reappointment”. With reappointment costs ofdelegation the inflation bias is reduced, but not completely eliminated.The central bank gains credibility if an announced action coincides with theexpectation of market agents about this action, i.e. if the targeted money growth rate equals theexpected growth rate. Reputation is more similar to a capital good, growing slowly by means of aseries of credible actions and eroding quickly if the central bank attempts to deceive the public(Cukierman, 1992, p. 205 ff.).As a general principle, credibility facilitates interpersonal relationships. Credibility iscapable of substantially reducing transaction costs. Experience shows that those central banks whichhave a successful track record of stability are most likely to enjoy credibility. Very broadly, such asuccessful track record is characterised over the long term by low inflation with very little fluctuation.Positions supported by the Bundesbank for a long time are now widely accepted among policymakers and in the literature:   “... deliberate attempts to exploit any short-run trade-offs betweenoutput and prices are likely to result in a permanently higher and more variable rate of inflation,with significant adverse consequences for resource allocation, long-run output and productivitygrowth.” (Lamfalussy, 1997, p. 12.)When prices rise, the crucial factor is the underlying cause. A fundamentalconsideration in building up and defending an anti-inflationary track record is that the central bankshould never resort to the instrument of unanticipated inflation. If the public feels duped by thecentral bank, that central bank forfeits its credibility for many years to come. If, on the other hand,prices rise for exogenous reasons, the subsequent anti-inflationary policy course can actually enhancethe central bank’s reputation. The phase following German reunification is a case in point.Obviously, the new ECB will have no established track record to inspire confidence.To what extent the accumulated credibility of national central banks which will make up theEuropean System of Central Banks from the beginning of Stage Three can be transferred to the newBIS Review   25/1998
- 4 -institution is an open question. “Reputation has its roots in decisive and goal-oriented action; it isbound to an institution and cannot be simply bequeathed.” (SVR, 1997, p. 353, translation.) Onemust therefore resort to theoretical insights and empirical lessons in seeking to predict the level ofcredibility that will be enjoyed by the ECB. The main criteria for making this prediction are theECB’s Statute, leading personalities and strategy.The StatuteArticle 105 of the Maastricht Treaty gives the European System of Central Banks aclear mandate: “The primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability.” Its supportfor the general economic policies in the Community must be without prejudice to the objective ofprice stability. Article 107 guarantees the decision-making bodies independence in making theirdecisions. The members of the Executive Board are to be appointed for eight years, and that term ofoffice shall not be renewable (Article 109a). By contrast, the governors of the national central banks,who are to be appointed for at least five years, may be reappointed (Article 14, Protocol on theStatute of the ESCB and the ECB).Relatively long terms of office and the fact that the term of office is not renewable areintegral parts of a central bank statute based on the independence of the persons appointed. Academicstudy and research have dealt extensively with this issue and emphasised the significance of theindependence of the appointees. Seen from that viewpoint, the eight-year term of office for theMembers of the Directorate would tend to be at the lower end of the scale. For the same reason, themember states should make use of the possibility of making appointments for longer than five years.(For an analysis of the length of terms of office, see Waller and Walsh, 1996.)I think it goes without saying that an independent central bank is not free to choose itsown objectives. But the mandate of price stability has to be defined more precisely; an initialconsensus has already been reached. “While theory does not provide a precise definition of pricestability and while measurement problems exist, there has been a broad consensus among centralbanks for several years that a range of 0%-2% inflation per annum would be appropriate.” (EMI,1997, p. 12.)To this extent, therefore, the theoretical insights and empirical lessons are adequatelyreflected in the Statute. Does that mean that the credibility problem has automatically been solved?Many politicians - but also quite a few economists - think so. In Germany, for instance,commentators incessantly point out that the ECB Statute, especially as regards its constitutionalstatus, is even more rigorous than the Bundesbank Act. They conclude that the euro will be as stable -a frequently heard phrase is “at least as stable” - as the Deutsche Mark.Nevertheless, hardly anyone will expect that the ECB will be able or even want tokeep the inflation rate below 2% perpetually and under all circumstances. Additional efforts willtherefore be needed to establish credibility convincingly from the outset. This is all the morenecessary as, given the high unemployment in most European countries, pressure will be exerted onthe ECB right from the start to tone down the priority of price stability in favour of boostingemployment. This is the tenor of demands for making a relevant amendment to the Statute.Incidentally, the provision giving the power to make exchange rate arrangements islikewise a potential source of vulnerability. Pursuant to Article 109, the EC Council may, subject tocertain preconditions, conclude formal agreements on an exchange rate system in relation tonon-Community currencies. Subject to similar conditions, the Council may formulate ‘generalorientations’ for exchange rate policy in relation to non-Community currencies.BIS Review   25/1998
- 5 -This certainly opens up the risk that the ECB might have to take measures whichcould endanger its own objectives. However, action by the Council to enter into formal agreementswould require unanimity and would have to be based on a recommendation of the ECB or theCommission, in the latter case after consultation with the ECB “in an endeavour to reach a consensusconsistent with the objective of price stability.” Moreover, the ECB will not be obliged to follow any‘general orientations’ which it judges inconsistent with achieving price stability.A formal exchange rate agreement already agreed upon within the European Union is“ERM II”. Most EU countries outside the euro area participating in the new exchange ratemechanism (ERM) will have central rates for their currencies expressed in euro with 15% fluctuationmargins on either side. The ECB will be able to suspend its intervention and financing obligations ifit believes that this runs counter to its monetary policy. Moreover, the ECB will have the right toinitiate proceedings regarding currency realignments.PersonalitiesThe ECB Statute does not seek to establish a currency standard excluding all and anyscope for discretionary action. Consequently, the personalities responsible for formulating andimplementing monetary policy will play a role. That applies especially to an institution which iscompletely new.In his survey of the history of the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve Systemand the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, F. Capie (1997, p. 47) recently concluded “ ... that whateverwas on the statute book personalities almost always had a powerful part to play in practice.”Up to now, academic study and research have failed to come up with a convincingproposal for a “foolproof” institutional arrangement. All standards used in practice so far (e.g. thegold standard) have run up against criticism, as have approaches which have not left the drawingboard (for example, an index currency, or a commodity-reserve-currency). Therefore, for goodreasons, this path was not embarked on for EMU.If no standard is established which precludes all scope for action, then the personswho act also matter. An effective institutional arrangement and appointing the right persons are thuscomplementary pillars of a functional monetary system. “It is not just the case that the design ofinstitutions necessitates major personnel decisions: the functioning of even the best institutions ...always depends to a considerable degree on the persons working within the framework of thoseinstitutions. Institutions are like fortresses; they must be well-planned and well-manned.” (Popper,1957, p. 177; translation.)Public controversies about the filling of top posts damage credibility. For theforseeable future, there will be no political union in Europe to bolster monetary union. The leadingpersonalities will therefore be associated almost inevitably with their respective nation-states, yet inthe end they have to carry out a common policy, namely a single European monetary policy, and tostand up to political pressure. The same applies, incidentally, to the Governors of the national centralbanks. Misgivings are therefore called for if, for example, there are intentions to introduceaccountability to national parliaments.StrategyFor the ECB, as a new institution, it is imperative to enter into a precommitment to thegeneral public, to which its policy is bound and which makes it accountable. The preparatory workBIS Review   25/1998
- 6 -undertaken by the EMI has reduced the number of possible options to just two strategies: monetarytargeting and inflation targeting. The EMI has thus, for convincing reasons, ruled out exchange ratetargeting as a nominal anchor for monetary policy in the euro area.A monetary target emphasises the central bank’s responsibility for monetaryconditions and demarcates its responsibility vis-à-vis other policy areas and exogenous shocks.Monetary targeting informs the public about the central bank’s fundamental orientation and can thushelp to stabilise inflation expectations. By adopting such a precommitment, the ECB would exposeitself to strict discipline; it will have to justify any deviations from the target path to the public. “Amonetary target would also provide the ECB with the advantage of continuity with the frameworkused by the dominant central bank of the ERM, the Bundesbank, and it might thereby facilitate thetransfer of credibility.” (IMF, 1997, p. 54.)Empirical studies so far indicate that the money demand in the euro area should besufficiently stable for a strategy of monetary targeting (and more stable than in the individualcountries). There is thus a good chance that, from a “technical point of view”, monetary targetingmight fulfil the prerequisites. “Until the opposite is proved, the European Central Bank shouldassume that there are sufficiently stable underlying monetary relationships in the single currencyeconomic area and that unexpected instabilities can be brought under control.” (SVR, 1997, p. 356;translation.)On the other hand, we should remember that the initial phase of monetary union, inparticular, will be burdened by a number of imponderables. These could clearly have an impact onthe growth of the money stock. It is thus advisable to supplement the strategy of monetary targetingpragmatically (but not arbitrarily) by including some elements of direct inflation targeting. Themultitude of additional information could be compressed in this sense into a formal inflation forecast.Another issue regarding the prospects for successful operation of a common monetarypolicy in EMU is the extent to which there will be differences among countries in the transmissionmechanism. For example, there are differences in the use of floating-interest-rate instruments versusfixed-rate debt instruments, in the importance of bank lending relative to other form of financing, andin the households’ financing of housing investments. Such differences are likely to add to thechallenges facing the ECB in its early years.AccountabilityGreater central bank independence in many countries has also led to heightenedinterest in the accountability of a central bank. In a democracy, the independence of an executiveorgan cannot be viewed in isolation from its mandate. The independence of a central bank is not anend in itself but only a means of achieving an objective set by the legislature. The associatedpurpose-oriented transfer of responsibility implies that the central bank is to be held accountable forits decisions. In particular, it has to disclose and justify the progress it has made in attaining its finalgoal, its monetary policy strategy, and its ongoing monetary policy measures. This is designed toensure that the central bank carries out its prescribed tasks as well as possible and does not, forinstance, pursue its own agenda.For the ECB, as a new institution, a suitably designed commitment to hold itselfaccountable is crucial in order to quickly establish credibility. It is in the situation of having toacquire credibility before being able to establish a track record of policy results over a period of someyears. It is therefore in the ECB’s own best interests to convey, in a clear and convincing manner, theintentions behind the monetary policy being pursued.BIS Review   25/1998
- 7 -Hence, there is no disputing the need for a commitment to accountability. But towhom should the ECB be accountable? The Bundesbank, which has always attached greatimportance to accountability despite the absence of formal requirements, has practised continousaccountability particularly to the general public in Germany. The associated public debate on itsmonetary policy strategy and its measures has proved to be fruitful: the social consensus backing astability-oriented monetary policy has been strengthened, and the Bundesbank’s credibility has beenenhanced. In principle, this might be also an advisable course for the ECB to follow. However, it isdifficult to identify a “European public”- at least for now.Therefore, accountability at the supranational parliamentary level - which is explicitlyenshrined in the Maastricht Treaty - will be all the more important right from the outset. TheGovernor of the ECB will present an annual report to the European Parliament, on the basis of whichthe European Parliament can hold a general debate. Furthermore, the members of the ECB ExecutiveBoard can be called to speak before the responsible committees of the European Parliament. Thisensures that accountability is broadly and institutionally enshrined at the European level. By contrast,accountability at the national level, i.e. of the central bank governors to their respective nationalparliaments, would run counter to the exclusively European mandate of the European System ofCentral Banks. This European mandate applies not just to the members of the Executive Board, but toall members of the Central Bank Council. This European orientation, the responsibility for a singlemonetary policy, determines the institution’s self-identity.Besides defining obligations to provide information and explanations, the monetarypolicy strategy also has implications for the accountability of the central bank. In the academic debateon this topic, the impression is often given that inflation targeting is clearly superior to monetarytargeting in those terms (see Tabellini, 1998 and Dornbusch et al., 1998). According to theproponents of inflation targeting the difference between the two strategies is that one sets a target forinflation, the other a target for monetary growth. It is mostly argued that the “man on the street” canmake more sense of inflation, and thus of an inflation target, than he can of monetary aggregates.This line of argument is misleading, though, as it confuses two different levels of monetarypolicy - that of the final objective and that of the strategy. What is more to the point is making a cleandistinction between these two concepts.The accountability of a central bank ultimately hinges on the degree to which it hasachieved the final objective it has specified - in the case of the ECB, this means the objective of pricestability. The strictness of accountability thus hinges on the clarity of the target which has been setand the degree of the central bank’s responsibility for the actual trend in the target variables. TheEMI’s aforementioned proposal to set a narrow margin is a good idea. However, contrary to the firstimpression, such an inflation target is independent of the central bank’s monetary policy strategy.Admittedly, it is an explicit part of inflation targeting. However, in principle, it can be combined withany other strategy - it is implicitly contained in a monetary targeting strategy (King, 1997b, p. 435.)Owing to the long time lag between the deployment of monetary policy instrumentsand the achievement of the inflation rate, however, the central bank’s accountability for ongoingmonetary policy cannot focus on the current inflation rate. Rather, what is needed - on the part ofboth the central bank and the general public - is to observe variables which contain information onthe future outlook for inflation. In monetary targeting, the monetary aggregate, which is used as anintermediate target, serves as a reference point. The inflation forecast performs this function ininflation targeting.If one considers that the inflation forecast - and not the current inflation rate - is theessential focus of accountability in inflation targeting, then the viability of this strategy’s suitabilityBIS Review   25/1998
- 8 -for the general public’s assessment of monetary policy becomes a much more complex issue. Theinflation forecasts published by each central bank are an amalgam of complex econometric models,individual indicators and a healthy portion of subjective assessments.Therefore - despite careful inflation reports - the inflation forecasts are virtuallyimpossible for the general public to comprehend. It is not easy to say with any certainty how good thequality of the forecast provided by the central bank is, nor is it possible to tell to what extent thecentral bank should actually publicly reveal the problems it encounters when preparing the forecast.A solution often given by proponents of inflation targeting is that a “forecastcompetition” exists between the central bank and outsiders, which forces the central bank toformulate the best inflation forecasts it can and to publish them together with a description of theirforecasting method. This would enable the public to examine ex ante - i.e. before the inflation ratehas been achieved - the method and assumptions on which the inflation forecast is based.Furthermore, there would be inflation forecasts by third parties which the public would take intoaccount when judging the central bank’s inflation forecast. However, it is rather difficult to imaginethe public understanding such an ex ante judgement of the central bank’s inflation forecast, as it lacksexpert knowledge of possible forecasting methods and can neither judge nor compare the quality ofthe central bank’s or other agencies’ forecasts.In addition to such an ex ante comparison of the central bank’s inflation forecast withthat of alternative forecasts or forecasting methods, it is also possible to make an ex post comparisonof the achieved inflation rate with that previously forecast. However, a comparison of this kind is, byits nature, only possible after some time has elapsed. Another factor is that it involves a number ofdifficulties:  Basically, there are two ways the central bank can make its inflation forecast: it caneither take its future actions into account or not do so. In the first case, if the inflation forecast derivedin this way differs from the inflation target, the central bank will take relevant measures in line withits inflation targeting strategy. But this means its forecast will automatically turn out to be wrong. Inthe latter scenario - if the central bank adheres strictly to a strategy of inflation targeting - nodifference can arise between the inflation forecast and the inflation target.As opposed to the inflation forecast, the money stock is a clearly observable statisticalvariable. In the case of monetary targeting, the statement that the monetary target has been eitherachieved or missed thus has unequivocal credibility. For that reason, the monetary targeting strategyis transparent and is suitable for communication with the public. It therefore forms a good focus ofcentral bank accountability.However - as previously mentioned - it is precisely at the start of monetary union thatinstabilities in the demand for money, and possibly even turbulence, cannot be ruled out. If that is thecase, a comparison of monetary growth and the target value cannot be used directly to derive theprice movements to be expected nor the necessary extent of monetary policy action. The public mustadditionally base its assessment on the interpretation given by the central bank of monetary growth,of other indicators considered to be relevant, and possibly even a model-based inflation forecast. Inthis case the problems relating to the quality of the central bank analysis and the credibility of thecentral bank’s statements with the resulting implications mentioned in the preceding comments oninflation targeting also impact upon monetary targeting. Nevertheless, the advantage of the monetarytargeting strategy may lie in the fact that these problems only appear in the event of instabilities in thedemand for money, whereas they are, in a sense, inherent to the system in an inflation targetingstrategy.BIS Review   25/1998
- 9 -The stability policy systemThe step towards a common currency in Europe is viewed with scepticism on theother side of the Atlantic: “The shift to a single currency for all of Europe would be anunprecedented event. There is no sizable country anywhere that does not have its own currency. Anational currency is both a symbol of sovereignty and the key to the pursuit of an independenteconomic and budget policy.” (Feldstein, 1997, p. 3.)A special feature of European monetary union will, in fact, be that it will not have acomplementary political union - at least in the foreseeable future. The principle of “one country, onecurrency” runs like a thread throughout monetary history. In EMU, this link is being broken for thefirst time and replaced by the principle of “one market, one money”. (King, 1997a, p. 237.)From a constitutional perspective, this is certainly an unusual and historically uniqueevent. What is more: the Bundesbank’s independence was based on a simple Act - one whichtheoretically could have been amended any time by a simple one-vote majority. To that extent, theright of policy makers to intervene could be invoked at all times. The legal securing of the ECB’sindependence even goes beyond being enshrined in the national constitutions - the EU Treaty canonly be amended unanimously by all member states (see Böckenförde, 1997, p. 33 ff.). The sameapplies to the objective of giving priority to monetary stability. Hence, the reappointment costs, i.e.the costs of changing the conditions under which monetary policy operates (Jensen, 1997), seemlikely to be very high in EMU.That gives the supranational institution ECB a special standing. It is not for nothingthat there are repeated calls for a political “counterweight”. Yet the necessary coordination ofeconomic policy within the EU should not be allowed to become an instrument which undermines theEuropean Central Bank’s independence.Objections to this final and irrevocable “abdication by policy makers” are surfacingthroughout Europe. There is already talk of a future ”dictatorship” of the ECB; there are alsowarnings of “centralbankisation”, i.e.  that Europe will be shaped in the image of the central bank.However, the priority accorded to stable money is precisely what was agreed in theMaastricht Treaty, and an independent central bank has been given the mandate to keep this promise.Only now do some seem to be getting the picture that this monetary arrangement has implications formany other policy areas, too. Now it will inevitably be revealed to what extent all the other areascomply with the conditions set by the objective of “stable money”.The euro will have to demonstrate a large measure of stability if it is to contributesuccessfully towards integrating Europe and not towards dividing it. In the past, various individualshave vowed emphatically that this will indeed be the case. However, public statements in favour of astable euro hardly constitute a copper-bottomed guarantee on their own.A broad base of public support for the ECB’s clear, stability-oriented policy stancewill be a crucial factor. Unlike the Statute, the “stability culture” (Richter, 1994) of which so manyspeak cannot be established by fiat. That does not mean that both phenomena are mutuallyindependent (also noted by Neumann, 1997, p. 27). Permanent confidence in the stability of thecurrency can be instilled only within the context of a well-conceived status and its implications formonetary policy; this is confidence which, in turn, underpins monetary policy measures geared tostability.BIS Review   25/1998
- 10 -UncertaintiesThe Maastricht Treaty has largely laid the foundations for a stability-orientedmonetary policy as far as the institutional arrangements are concerned. As I have pointed out, thosefoundations need to be complemented by an appropriate strategy and a convincing decision regardingthe choice of the leading personalities.The launching of a new central bank and a new currency is accompanied byuncertainty. The associated risk premium in the interest rate can be kept down by choosing anappropriate strategy and by appointing suitable top executives. The financial markets will keep acritical eye on the ECB right from the start. The initial monetary policy course thus takes on crucialimportance. Some people are therefore already advising the ECB to pursue a particularly restrictivecourse right from the outset so as to nip any mistrust in the bud, as it were.Such an uncompromising approach would inevitably give rise to tensions within theCouncil. It is also hard to imagine that the ECB would meet with general approval for such a courseamong the people of Europe, given the high level of unemployment. At the moment we do not evenknow whether there is a stable European consensus on the acceptable or optimal rate of inflation. Thetrend towards the convergence of inflation rates at a low level is a good omen. In a monetary unionwithout a flanking political union, we shall simply have to wait and see whether this convergence ofpreferences will prove to be a lasting phenomenon.The consensus regarding the preference for stable money - the common “stabilityculture” - is all the more important as monetary union will have to survive for the foreseeable futurewithout the additional support of a political union. For this reason, the right choice of participantsbased on the convergence criteria assumes overriding importance. The public finance situation playsa particular role in this assessment. The fiscal criteria have to be met on a sustainable basis, in otherwords, not just at the beginning of Stage Three. Finally, the member states must implement the labourmarket reform which is urgently needed and, in general, significantly cut back the dense jungle ofoverregulation. Without a far higher degree of flexibility at the microeconomic level, it will not bepossible for monetary union to yield the desired benefits, nor will the ECB encounter broad andlasting acceptance for a monetary policy geared to ensuring price stability in accordance with theMaastricht Treaty.In an overall favourable assessment of the EMU Project, the IMF critically remarksthat “... the failure to recognize explicitly the importance of flexible labor markets was an importantomission from the Maastricht framework.” (IMF, 1997, p. 64) The decision on what countries areeligible to enter Stage Three will not focus on whether countries have developed sufficiently flexiblelabour and product markets to make up for the loss of the exchange rate instrument. However, “afailure to address labor market problems would prevent Europe from realizing its full growthpotential, and could also weaken the credibility of the euro if financial markets perceive thatpersistent unemployment is eroding support for prudent macroeconomic policies.” (IMF, 1997, p.68.)In a simulation using its multi-country econometric model (MULTIMOD), the IMF,in one scenario, illustrates the implications of lagging structural reforms. In this scenario real wageflexibility remains low, the natural rate of unemployment gradually increases to the level of actualunemployment in the EU and national governments attempt to offset the effects of deterioratinglabour market conditions on output and employment by additional government spending. Withinflexible labour markets and rising structural unemployment, the price level is estimated to increaseby 2.3% over the medium term, and the level of real GDP declines by 2.5% relative to the baseline.BIS Review   25/1998
- 11 -The government debt-to-GDP ratio rises by more than 10 percentage points. This worsening ofeconomic performance raises the risk premium on euro-denominated assets by 40 basis points in thesimulation.The meaningfulness of such approaches is debatable; however, at any rate thissimulation does make clear the magnitude of negative trends which are to be expected if thenecessary reforms are not implemented. It is not possible to identify the psychological damage andthe political repercussions in this manner, anyway.III. ConclusionThe Maastricht Treaty has provided the blueprint for a strong ECB, able to actindependently as a credible guardian of a stable euro. The euro will mean price transparency acrossthe board and across borders.However, the importance of legal independence may have been overstated. Not evenan independent central bank can lastingly defend monetary stability against a ‘society of excessivedemands’ - in other words, every society ultimately gets the rate of inflation it deserves and basicallywants. Of course, this statement does not mean that institutions are irrelevant or that central bankindependence is unimportant. Precisely the contrary holds true: in principle, resistance to making thecentral bank an independent institution with the single goal of price stability always reflects theintention of reserving access to influencing monetary policy whenever a currency loses value.Governments seeking re-election often have an incentive to achieve short-term benefits throughinflation without considering its long-term costs. In view of the temptations inherent in the politicalprocess, a society can signal its determination to safeguard the stability of its money only by choosingthe appropriate institutional arrangement. In this context, the independence of the central bank is anecessary, but not sufficient, condition.*       *        *BibliographyBarro, R.J. and D.B.

Mr. Meyer remarks on the strategy of monetary policy in the United States   Text ofthe Alan R. Holmes Lecture by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of the USFederal Reserve System, held at Middlebury College, Middlebury, Vermont on 16/3/98.When I was asked to deliver the Alan R. Holmes Lecture, it seemed appropriate to focuson a topic directly related to the interests and contributions of Alan Holmes. It was not hard to find sucha topic, because Alan Holmes served with distinction in a position that was at the very core of monetarypolicymaking.Monetary policy begins with a set of objectives, which identify where policymakers wantthe economy to be, a preferred or ideal state of macroeconomic performance. The heart of monetarypolicy is about designing and implementing a strategy to guide policymakers in decisions about thesetting of open market operations, the principal instrument of monetary policy, so as to contribute toachieving the objectives. This is the subject of my lecture today and it was very much the subject of AlanHolmes’ career. He was an economist for 31 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and formany years served as Executive Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and asManager of the System Open Market Account. In that position he was directly responsible forimplementing policies of the Federal Open Market Committee, the FOMC, specifically the day-to-daydecisions about open market operations.The FOMC consists of the seven members of the Board of Governors and five presidentsof the regional Federal Reserve banks. There is no official operating manual for members of thecommittee that identifies the guiding principles, no “official doctrine”. While the views I present here aremy own perspectives on strategy, my purpose in this lecture is not to articulate a singular view of thestrategy of monetary policy, but rather to shed light on some of the mystery about monetary policy.A former Alan Homes Professor of Economics at Middlebury College and good friend,Dewey Daane, co-edited a book in honor of Alan Holmes, entitled The Art of Monetary Policy. In hisforward to the book, William Simon called Alan Holmes a “monetary policy artist”. As I develop myperspective on monetary policy, I will try to blend the role of art and science, of economic theory andpractical judgments that Alan Holmes so well understood.ObjectivesMonetary policymaking naturally begins with an understanding of the objectives ofpolicy, because that is what good policy should deliver. It is widely accepted that there are threefundamental norms of macroeconomic performance, which I summarize as full employment, growth, andprice stability, and these norms are a useful point of departure to thinking about the objectives formonetary policy.Full employment can be interpreted as achieving the maximum sustainable level ofemployment and production. It basically means avoiding waste, in the sense of failing to use all theavailable productive resources. By sustainable, I mean the highest level of output that can be sustainedBy growth, I am referring to the desire to achieve both a high average level and rate ofgrowth in living standards, on average, over time. We usually measure living standards in terms of realincome per capita. We can be at full employment and yet be poor. We want to be at full employment andbe rich. And we want our living standards to be improving over time. I’ll refer to the average rate ofgrowth in output in the long run as the economy’s trend rate of growth.Price stability refers to the stability of the overall price level, measured, for example, bythe price index for overall output (the chain-weighted price index of GDP) or for consumer goods andservices (the Consumer Price Index). We often satisfy ourselves with the norm of low and stableBIS Review   23/1998
- 2 -inflation. At any rate, price stability is really more an intermediate goal than an ultimate objective. Thereason we care about price stability is that we believe that it contributes to a high and rising level ofliving standards. Indeed, it is viewed as so important in this regard that we identify it as a separate andfree-standing norm. And we will soon see we have particular reason to do so from the perspective ofmonetary policy.Implications of Economic TheoryI am going to assert some conclusions based on economic theory that help to understandthe potential for monetary policy to achieve these objectives and the consistency among them. Theseconclusions are widely though not universally shared, but they do guide my views of what monetarypolicy can and should do.First, monetary policy cannot influence real variables -- such as output andemployment -- in the long run (except via the contribution of price stability to living standards). This isoften referred to as the principle of the neutrality of money. This proposition removes “growth” as anobjective for monetary policy and also means that monetary policy cannot materially affect the level ofoutput or employment corresponding to “full employment”.Second, monetary policy is the principal determinant of inflation in the long run. Thisproposition immediately makes price stability (in some shape or form) the direct, unequivocal, andsingular long-term objective of monetary policy. No central bank around the world would argueotherwise. When it comes to price stability, the buck, literally, stops at the central bank.Third, because prices in many markets may be slow to adjust to equate supply anddemand, shocks to the economy can lead to persistent departures of the economy from fullemployment -- in both directions. This proposition offers at least the potential for monetary policy toplay a role in smoothing out business cycles.Fourth, full employment and price stability are compatible. Now, by full employment Ido not mean literally zero unemployment. Instead full employment is better thought of as the lowestpossible rate of unemployment that can be sustained without rising inflation. If unemployment remains,on average, at this level, inflation tends to remain constant. This rate -- which is often called thenon-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (or NAIRU) -- is a fact of life outside the control of theFOMC. This definition of full employment insures that the two objectives left for monetary policy -- fullemployment and price stability -- are compatible in the long run.Fifth, inflation pressures arise, in large part, in response to departures of the economyfrom full employment. If the economy moves below full employment, for example, the resulting slackresults in disinflation, that is, downward pressure on inflation. When the economy moves above thisthreshold there is continuing upward pressure on inflation. This implies that the two objectives of pricestability and full employment can conflict in the short run.This leaves us with dual objectives for monetary policy: short-run stabilization of outputrelative to potential and long-run price stability. Fortunately, this is also the legislative mandate Congresshas set for monetary policy in the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, often referred toas the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, at least by my interpretation.There are many interesting issues and controversies related to the choice and definition ofobjectives. These include the definition of an inflation target that corresponds to price stability and theestimate of the unemployment threshold that corresponds to full employment. I’ll assume that theinflation target is set to reflect the expected bias in inflation measurement or to be slightly above thisestimate. Many commentators view a 2% inflation rate as a reasonable inflation objective and manycountries with explicit inflation targets use a 1% - 3% range. As for the definition of full employment,I’ll use a consensus estimate of the unemployment threshold, which is currently around 5½%. I mightadd that there is considerable uncertainty about this estimate, particularly in light of the consistentBIS Review   23/1998
- 3 -surprise of declining inflation even as the unemployment rate has fallen well below this threshold. I havefocused a number of my speeches on this very topic, but, for today, it is mainly a reminder of theuncertainty that monetary policymakers face about the structure of the economy, especially when thestructure changes over time.InstrumentsThe next step is to identify the instruments through which monetary policy influences theeconomy. While there are, in principle, three instruments through which monetary policy affects themacroeconomy -- open market operations, the discount rate, and the reserve requirement ratio -- as AlanHolmes certainly appreciated, open market operations are the principal instrument of monetary policy,and so I will focus on open market operations.The Federal Reserve holds a portfolio of government securities. It injects or withdrawsreserves by buying for or selling from this portfolio. When it purchases securities from the private sector,it injects reserves and normally puts downward pressure on short-term market interest rates. So openmarket operations can be viewed as implementing either a path of reserves or achieving a level ofshort-term interest rates. In practice, nearly all central banks target a short-term interest rate rather thanreserves with their open market operations. This is because reserves are most useful for close control ofthe money supply and money supplies have proven to have only a loose, long-term relationship to theobjectives of monetary policy.Natural HurdlesIf we knew precisely where we were, understood precisely the relationship between ourinstruments and macroeconomic performance, had a single objective, and could instantly affect thevariable or variables associated with our target(s), implementing policy would be easy. Indeed, thislecture would be nearly over, because we would not have to worry about a strategy for monetary policy.It is precisely because none of these preconditions hold that monetary policy is so difficult and principlesare needed to guide its implementation.First, it is clearly important to know where you are in relation to where you want to be.But we do not have timely and accurate information about where we are. The data trickles in with a lag,often involves considerable noise, and is subject to revision, even after which it may remain less precisethan we would prefer. Because of the noise in economic measures, considerable effort is needed toextract the meaningful signal from the data.Second, we are working with a caricature of the economy in the form of our empiricalmodels that guide both forecasting and policy decisions. The models reflect our imperfect state ofknowledge about how the economy works. In addition, as I just noted, the relationships among thevariables in the economy shift over time and we only gradually learn and adjust to such structuralchanges.Third, monetary policy affects aggregate demand and inflation with a lag. The majoreffect of a policy action today is not felt until about a year from now. Therefore, when we are thinkingabout affecting inflation, we better be thinking about affecting inflation next year, rather than tomorrow.One implication of lags is that policy has to be forward looking. If we want to affect inflation next year,we have to act today. We therefore have to try to anticipate problems rather than simply react to them.That means that forecasting is an inherent part of the policy process and policy has to have a pre-emptivequality.Fourth, we have multiple objectives, but only a single instrument. Simple models ofpolicy normally imply that to achieve two objectives simultaneously, you need two instruments. Howcan we therefore juggle our dual targets? Fortunately, theory and evidence suggest, as I noted earlier, thatthe objectives of full employment and price stability are consistent in the long run. Short-run conflictsBIS Review   23/1998
- 4 -between the targets arise in one of two circumstances. A conflict arises if we begin with inflation aboveour objective. Unfortunately, monetary policy can reduce inflation only by temporarily imposing someslack in the economy. In this case, lowering inflation would mean departing for a while from fullemployment. Once inflation had fallen to its target level, the economy could return to full employmentand enjoy the consistency of the two objectives. A second source of conflict arises in response to asupply shock, such as an increase in oil prices. Assume we begin with full employment and pricestability and there is a sharp rise in oil prices. This will tend to both raise inflation in the short run anddepress output. What should monetary policy do? Tighten to unwind the increase in inflation? Or loosento counter the increase in unemployment?The natural hurdles make monetary policy a challenging task, requiring the application ofboth good judgment and appropriate models, art and science.Operating Strategies and the FOMC MeetingNow that we appreciate the challenging nature of monetary policy, we are ready todevelop a strategy for implementing open market operations. The first question we ask is whether policyshould be carried out according to some well-defined and precise formula, or rule, or whether it should beimplemented judgmentally. My point here is not to recall the longstanding debate about rules vs.discretion, but to emphasize that good policy should be systematic or rule-like, even when it is notformally tied to a specific rule. In addition, we can learn a lot about principles for guiding discretionarypolicy by examining rules that can be shown to have effective stabilizing properties in our models.As I noted earlier, monetary policy is implemented in the United States, as in mostcentral banks, through the control of interest rates. At each meeting, the FOMC sets an intended federalfunds rate target. The federal funds rate is the interest rate on overnight loans in the inter-bank market. Itis therefore the rate paid when reserves are borrowed and lent among banks. And it is a natural target toachieve via open market operations since these operations in effect inject or withdraw reserves.The federal funds rate is currently 5.5%. The FOMC announces any change in this targetimmediately following the conclusion of its meetings. It also explicitly incorporates this target funds ratein a “directive” to the Manager of the System Open Market Account, the position Alan Holmes held atthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This directive instructs the Manager to implement open marketoperations during the period between this and the next FOMC meeting so as to maintain the federal fundsrate as close as possible to the intended rate.Point of Departure: Constant Money Growth RuleGiven that the Federal Reserve, like most other central bank today, operates by setting anear-term interest rate target, my focus is on developing some guiding principles for setting the interestrate target, more precisely, for adjusting the interest rate target in response to changing economicconditions. I have found it useful to begin this search, perhaps surprisingly, by developing the propertiesof a constant money supply growth rule. This both helps to identify some of the essential properties of amonetary policy strategy, which will apply to interest rate targeting as well, and highlights the practicaldifficulties in carrying out monetary policy using money supply targets.Another reason for starting with a monetary aggregate strategy is that monetaryaggregates played a more significant role in the implementation of monetary policy during Holmes’service as Manager of the System Open Market Account. The directive to the Manager from the FOMCduring this period was often specified in terms of maintaining or changing “money market conditions” (acode for the federal funds rate), unless growth in the monetary aggregates departed significantly from themidpoints of their specified ranges. Sometimes the directive was specified directly in terms of the desiredcourse of the monetary aggregates, in this case typically subject to an acceptable range for the federalfunds rate. This gave money growth a more direct role in the conduct of policy than it has today.BIS Review   23/1998
- 5 -Let’s now see why money growth might be a useful target for implementing monetarypolicy. Economic theory suggests that, if the demand for money is stable, the rate of money growth willpin down the rate of growth in nominal income. Under reasonable assumptions, a constant rate of moneygrowth will yield growth of nominal income, on average, at the same rate. The rate of money growthshould be set to achieve a rate of nominal income growth that just equals the rate of trend growth in realoutput and the rate of inflation consistent with the policy objective. On average and in the long run, thisrate of money growth will achieve the Fed’s inflation objective.So the first proposition is that a money growth target provides a nominal anchor whichpins down the long-run inflation rate. This strategy immediately allows a translation of the long-run pricestability objective into a more near-term money supply growth target. And, by implication, any monetarypolicy strategy must mimic the nominal anchor property of a money supply target, if it is to be consistentwith the Federal Reserve’s mandate for price stability.Next, let’s ask what would happen if the economy was subject to a shock that moved itaway from price stability and full employment. If real output increases faster than trend and/or inflationincreases relative to the Fed’s objective, the resulting higher nominal income growth, relative to theconstant rate of money growth, would result in an increase in interest rates. The second property of amoney supply target is that it builds stability into the economy by insuring pro-cyclical movements in theinterest rate in response to demand shocks. Another way of saying this is that it insures that monetarypolicy automatically leans against the cyclical winds to stabilize the economy.The Taylor Rule as a Strategy for an Interest Rate Operating ProcedureDespite the desirable properties of a constant money growth rule, in principle, mostcentral banks implement policy by setting short-term interest rates in practice. This choice reflects at leasttwo considerations. First, instability in money demand reduces the usefulness of money supply targets.Second, interest rate targets allow the central bank to smooth out the effects of transitory shocks tofinancial markets.But how should the Fed vary its interest rate “instrument” to achieve its ultimateobjectives? The simplest answer is that interest rates should vary to imitate qualitatively the way theywould behave if the Fed were implementing a money supply target. In other words, interest rates need tobe varied systematically to effectively impose a nominal anchor and to insure that policy leans against thecyclical winds. Setting monetary policy in this manner via an interest rate target, in principle, allows theFed to achieve the best of both worlds. It can impose the same nominal anchor and short-run stabilizationproperties as would be the case with a money growth rule, but, at the same time, smooth out shorter-runvolatility in interest rates. In addition, by careful choice of the degree of response of interest rates tochanging economic conditions, the rule can, in principle, improve upon the stabilization properties of amoney supply rule.A simple specification of a strategy for varying the federal funds rate in response tochanging economic conditions is provided by the Taylor Rule, a rule developed by John Taylor, aprofessor at Stanford University.The appeal of the Taylor Rule is that it is simple and specifies how the federal funds rate(effectively the Fed’s instrument) should be varied directly in response to inflation and to deviations ofoutput and inflation from the Fed’s ultimate targets of full employment and price stability. My point hereis not to extol the virtues of the precise specification in the Taylor Rule, but to use it to highlight some ofthe central principles that should guide decisions about the setting of the funds rate.It is useful to appreciate how Taylor derived his rule and how he views its role inmonetary policy. The rule emerged from Taylor’s analysis of simulations of a variety of rules in a varietyof models. He concluded that the simple form embodied in the Taylor Rule had, based on this work,excellent stabilizing properties. The rule was therefore initially developed as a normative guide, meaningBIS Review   23/1998
- 6 -a set of principles to guide policy that, if followed, would result in relatively good economicperformance, at least compared to other rules and perhaps relative to historic US economic performance.Subsequently, Taylor found the rule described reasonably well the way policy was indeed carried outover the last decade. That is, the rule was also descriptive of recent policymaking.The Taylor Rule begins by assuming that there is some level of real federal funds rateconsistent with full employment and stable inflation. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate lesssome measure of inflation expectations (measured by Taylor as actual inflation over the last year) -- ameasure of the increase in purchasing power (rather than in dollars) associated with holding an asset.Taylor calls this the equilibrium real interest rate and assumed it was 2%. Let’s assume that the economyis initially at full employment and price stability. Then the level of real and nominal interest rates wouldbe set at 2%. I am not going to quibble with this choice, because I am focusing on general principlesrather than precise details.The economy is, of course, not always at full employment and price stability and thepurpose of the Taylor Rule is to specify how the federal funds rate should respond to shocks that push theeconomy away from price stability and/or full employment. Because both objectives are explicitlyincorporated into the rule, it provides a disciplined approach to juggling the dual mandate for monetarypolicy.The real equilibrium interest rate is viewed as consistent with full employment and anystable rate of inflation. So the first implication of this rule is that, in order to be consistent with fullemployment, nominal interest rates should be adjusted in response to inflation to maintain theequilibrium real interest rate.The next message of the rule concerns how the real federal funds rate should be adjustedin response to deviations of output and inflation from full employment and price stability. According tothe rule, when output rises relative to potential output, real interest rates should rise. When inflation risesrelative to the inflation target, real interest rates should also rise. These movements of real interest ratesin response to departures of inflation and output from their target levels can be shown to stabilize outputand inflation relative to their targets.The Dangers of an Interest Rate StrategyThere are natural dangers inherent in interest rate targeting, at least in the absence of arule that guides its adjustment to changing economic conditions. If cyclical movements in output aredominated by demand shocks, the failure to move interest rates aggressively enough in response to theshocks can result in monetary policy destabilizing rather than stabilizing the economy. For example, ifthere is a demand shock resulting in higher income and/or prices, the demand for money will increase,putting upward pressure on interest rates. If the Fed maintains an unchanged nominal interest rate target,it will have to add reserves to support a higher money supply at the initial interest rate. This means that,under a constant interest rate target, a demand shock would lead to perverse monetary policy, specificallyto stimulative open market operations, reinforcing rather than damping the demand shock.The inherent danger in interest rate targeting is reinforced by the preference for centralbankers for smoothing interest rates. This preference takes two forms. First, there is a preference forimplementing a rise in rates in a series of small changes in the same direction. Second, there is areluctance to change the direction of policy, without particularly strong rationale. Nevertheless, interestrate targets can, in principle, be implemented in a way that avoids this pitfall, and one of the values ofrules is to remind policymakers of the importance of adjusting interest rates in response to changingeconomic conditions, thereby preventing policy from becoming destabilizing.BIS Review   23/1998
- 7 -Principles to Guide the Setting of Interest RatesWe are now ready to identify a set of principles to guide decisions about the setting ofthe federal funds rate at FOMC meetings. Underlying these principles are the lessons gleaned from boththe constant money growth rule and from the Taylor Rule. Both rules highlight the importance ofimposing a nominal anchor to pin down the long-run inflation rate and of varying real interest ratespro-cyclically to lean against the cyclical winds. The Taylor Rule also highlights the critical importanceof real interest rates in the conduct of monetary policy.There is one very important difference between the constant money growth and Taylorrules that deserves comment. While a constant rate of money growth will not always be optimal, ifmoney demand is sufficiently stable, and not particularly interest sensitive, it will pin down inflation inthe long run and help smooth the business cycle in the short run. That is, under a money growth target,doing nothing (that is, maintaining an unchanged rate of money growth) may not always be the bestchoice, but, for the most part, it won’t get you into serious trouble and will in fact do some considerablegood, although it would likely involve a considerable variation in interest rates on a day-to-day basis.Under an interest rate targeting regime, on the other hand, doing nothing can potentially get you intogreat difficulty -- sometimes quite quickly. In this case, policy must constantly be prepared to adjust tochanging economic conditions, to avoid the potential for becoming a destabilizing influence on theeconomy.Rule No. 1: Vary real interest rates in response to departures of inflation from its target.For example, if inflation increases, relative to its target, the real interest rate should be increased. This isperhaps the single most important discipline for monetary policy under an interest rate regime. Wheninflation increases, nominal interest rates must first be increased just to avoid a decline in the real rate.But to counter the rise in inflation relative to its target, the real interest rate has to rise. That means thatnominal rates have to rise by more than the increase in inflation. In the Taylor Rule, for example, thenominal federal funds rate rises by 1.5 percentage points for every one percentage-point increase ininflation.Rule No. 2: Vary (nominal and real) interest rates in response to changes in resourceutilization rates. Under a money supply growth rule, interest rates rise whenever growth in real GDPexceeds the trend GDP growth assumption embedded in the money growth target. Whenever growth isabove trend, the unemployment rate falls and the capacity utilization rate rises. By adjusting real interestrates in response to such changes in utilization rates, for a given inflation rate, an interest rate regimeinsures the same qualitative stabilization property that a constant money growth rule automaticallyyields.In implementing this principle, real interest rates would rise gradually but systematicallyduring expansions, fall when growth slows to below trend, and decline sharply when the actual level ofoutput declines, at least for those cyclical episodes where supply shocks (see below) are not veryimportant. Just following this simple principle will help stabilize output relative to full employment andinflation relative to the inflation target. It is a reminder that there ought to be nothing startling ordramatic in FOMC decisions to adjust the federal funds rate. Indeed, the question that might be askedwhen nominal rates are constant for long periods is how does the FOMC justify such stability in the faceof changing economic conditions!You might, therefore, ask whether or not the near constancy of the nominal funds rateover the most recent episode has been appropriate. I believe monetary policy has, in fact, been excellentover this period. But this has been a very unusual period with remarkable crosscurrents that balanced outto allow such stable short-term rates. It should not lull us into believing that stable interest rates and goodmonetary policy naturally go together.Rule No. 3: In setting rates, be forward looking. I noted earlier that, because of lags,monetary policy has to be forward looking. There are, however, different degrees of forward lookingnessthat we could incorporate into policymaking. For example, because higher utilization rates today raise theBIS Review   23/1998
- 8 -risk of higher inflation in the future, raising interest rates today in response to observed increases inutilization rates is a forward-looking policy relative to simply responding to current inflation.Forward-looking policy is sometimes said to be pre-emptive. A movement in interestrates in response to rising utilization rates would be said to be a pre-emptive move against inflation. TheTaylor Rule thus allows for a combination of pre-emptive policy, changes in interest rates in response tochanges in utilization rates, and reactive policy, changes in interest rates in response to movements ininflation itself. So good policy can be both pre-emptive and reactive.A still more forward-looking approach would be for policymakers to respond not toactual inflation and utilization rates, as in the Taylor Rule, but to forecasts of projected inflation andutilization rates, assuming an unchanged nominal federal funds rate. A good reason for responding toforecasts of inflation is that the effects of monetary policy on the economy mostly occur about a yearfrom now. There is a considerable amount of work under way to assess the usefulness of using forecastsas opposed to past information on unemployment and inflation in the specification of interest rate rules.There are clear historical examples when a forward-looking policy would be animprovement. These episodes illustrate that simple rules are only guides and that good policy sometimesmeans following the rule and sometimes means using judgment to improve upon the rule. Judgement isespecially called for in situations where special events point to future changes in output and inflation thatwould ordinarily be viewed as unlikely. The current episode provides a good example of such a situationin which there is much to be gained from forward-looking policy. The economy entered 1998 withconsiderable forward momentum, already operating at very high utilization rates. This momentumreflected persistent strength in domestic demand, particularly consumer spending and business fixedinvestment. However, the financial and currency crises in Asia are projected to result in a sharper declinein net exports than would otherwise have occurred and this promises to slow the expansion in the absenceof any policy action, perhaps substituting for monetary tightening that otherwise might have beenjustified. In this environment, a backward-looking policy that ignored the potential drag on futuredemand from Asia could risk magnifying the effect of the shift in aggregate demand.Rule No. 4: The appropriate policy response may depend on the source and persistence ofthe shock. Let me distinguish two types of shocks to the economy. The first is a persistent demandshock -- for example, an increase in aggregate demand that results in a persistent departure from trendgrowth and persistent changes in utilization rates. This will have symmetric effects, raising both outputand inflation, and presents a relatively straightforward monetary policy problem that is well handled bythe first set of rules.A second source of shock is a supply shock, an example of which would be a one-time,permanent increase in oil prices. We have had several examples of very sharp increases in oil prices,especially in the 1970s, and, more recently, oil prices have been declining since the end of 1996. Whenthere is a sharp rise in oil prices, there will be a temporary burst of inflation. In addition, an adversesupply shock will typically result in a decline in aggregate demand and hence in output and employment.This is thus an example of a situation in which there can be a conflict between the dual objectives of fullemployment and price stability, and, as such, this represents one of the greatest challenges for monetarypolicy. The surge in inflation appears to demand a rise in real interest rates, and hence a particularlysharp increase in nominal rates; while the decline in output and employment appears to call for a declinein real interest rates.Experience suggests that supply shocks yield a sharp transitory increase in inflation,often followed by a smaller, more permanent effect, though the longer-run effect on inflation willobviously be importantly dictated by the response of monetary policy. Given the transitory nature of theinitial inflation surge, policy does well to look through it and instead focus on the more persistent (andmodest) inflation consequences of the shock. By doing so policymakers respond expeditiously to the badnews, but avoid the mistake of overreacting.BIS Review   23/1998
- 9 -One reason for this cautious approach is that policy cannot much affect inflation in thenear term, but instead has its primary effect over the coming year or two. Hence policy today shouldfocus on inflation next year. Policy should tighten, that is real interest rates should rise, to the extent thatinflation is expected to be higher next year on account of the supply shock. This might reflect the effectof a supply shock as today’s oil prices raise overall inflation, and, through the effect of inflation on wagebargaining, impact on broader measures of price change in subsequent quarters.One way to handle that within the Taylor Rule is to specify the rule using a measure ofcore inflation, meaning one that excludes oil and food prices, the price components most subject tosupply shocks. This will help policy to “look through” the initial burst of inflation, but it may fail toproduce an appropriate immediate adjustment to counter the more permanent effect of the shock oninflation in subsequent quarters. Another and perhaps better way to respond to supply shocks is to beforward looking and respond to forecasts of future inflation, rather than to the current inflation. Thisavoids both an overly aggressive response to the initial burst of overall inflation and an insufficientimmediate response because of an inappropriate focus on a measure of inflation that ignores the currentrise in oil prices.Art and ScienceWork on policy rules and experience with implementing policy in an interest rate regimehave, I believe, helped to define the set of principles I have just discussed. They are, I would remind you,only my perspective on the strategy of monetary policy, not official doctrine of the FOMC. We havemuch to learn, both about the structure of the economy and about the best way to implement policy.The role of rules is best viewed in my judgment as informing the monetary policydecision, not dictating it. No single rule will be the best policy in all circumstances, as I hope I havedemonstrated with my discussion. Sometimes responding to recent trends in the data will work well, butsometimes a forward-looking policy will be critical, as might be the case in the current environment.Sometimes an unusual circumstance will dictate a departure from what the rule might have suggested. Anexample here would be maintaining a very stimulative policy -- effectively a zero real federal fundsrate -- during 1992 and 1993, a period well into the current expansion. This turned out, in my judgment,to be very excellent policy, though a departure from the Taylor Rule, because it took account of theunusual structural drags that were restraining the expansion and justified maintaining monetary stimuluslonger than normal into an expansion. And, finally, monetary policy has to be sensitive to the potentialfor structural changes to alter fundamental relationships.Science in the form of economic theory, econometric models, and carefully designedrules can improve the conduct of monetary policy. But good policy will always be, as Alan Holmesunderstood so well, a blend of art and science. Each of us on the FOMC strive to become the monetarypolicy artist that Alan Holmes was as he participated in the FOMC during his distinguished career.BIS Review   23/1998
Mr. Ferguson looks at bank supervision from the consulting perspectiveRemarks by Mr. Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., a member of the Board of Governors of the USFederal Reserve System, before the Conference of State Bank Supervisors in Washington, DCon 9/3/98.It is my pleasure to join you today. The Federal Reserve has long enjoyed acooperative relationship with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and I expect thatrelationship to continue.As you are well aware, technological and financial innovation have become thenorm in banking and bank supervision. These innovations have accelerated the pace oftransactions and increased the complexity of transactions seen throughout the banking system.This is a pattern we can expect to continue in the years ahead. Indeed, it is this complexity andinnovation that leads us, as supervisors, toward a more risk-focused supervisory approach witha greater emphasis on sound management processes. Only by ensuring that a bank’smanagement and control processes are sound can we be confident that its risks will remaincontained throughout business and market cycles.It is not my intention today to espouse the merits of risk-focused examinations,since I trust we all recognize the value of that approach, especially in the case of larger,more-complex banking institutions. I would like to focus on a challenge that we face as wemove more toward risk-focused examinations. This challenge or conundrum is captured in acomment I heard last year at a dinner hosted by the Bank Administration Institute. A leadingbanker at dinner complimented a regulator for having supervisors and examiners who provided“consultations” at the end of examinations. Since reviewing management and control processesis very much a “consultative” activity, I suspect such comments will become morecommonplace.Being perceived as being like consultants is useful, but it is not an unalloyedblessing. As I reflected on the compliment I heard, I wondered if the consulting metaphor wasreally one we should encourage. We should all do what we can to maintain a strong and vibrantbanking system that is responsive to the needs of the public. That is part of our role assupervisors. We should also work hard to ensure that the supervision and examinationprocesses are not unduly burdensome to the banks we examine. We should be supportive offinancial modernization, a process that is overdue in the banking industry. We also want toprovide guidance to banks on sound practices and to evaluate the extent to which they conducttheir activities in prudent ways. But we should be cautious in fully adopting the label“consultants.”In my comments this morning, I would like to draw on my experience as aconsultant to banks and other financial institutions to discuss some similarities and differences,as I see them, between the role of consultant and the role of supervisor.I raise this topic today because the recent turmoil in Asia has some roots in poorbanking performance and poor banking supervision. I believe that the market is ultimately thebest regulator of financial services, but we will still need supervision and regulation to offsetthe limitations inherent in regulation from the market. The recent turmoil in Asia serves as areminder of the risks that financial institutions take and the systemic impact that can emerge ifsupervisors are not mindful of the important role that they continue to play in containing thatrisk.BIS Review   24/1998
- 2 -Why Do We Need Management Consultants and SupervisorsLet me begin with the basic question of why firms hire management consultants.Many large companies that hire management consultants have substantial talent, resources andexpertise of their own. A key reason they seek outside guidance is that the employees of thesecompanies often lack the objectivity, the cross-company and cross-industry experience, or thespecific, technical expertise that the company needs. Companies also hire consultants simplybecause they want to avoid distracting key individuals from their on-going operational duties inorder to conduct a project that an outsider can perform.Why, on the other hand, do banks hire bank supervisors? The obvious answer isthat they do not hire them at all. Supervision is found to be necessary -- not only here but alsoin virtually every country abroad -- to protect the public’s interest in the lending anddeposit-taking process. The fact that we continue to regulate banks reflects the economicconcept of “externalities” and the need to protect the safety net that most societies extend tobanks. It is not the impact of one bank’s decisions on the wealth of its owners and the jobsecurity of its workers that worries us. Bank managers must be allowed to make managerialdecisions with a minimum amount of regulatory and supervisory interference. Bank directorsand managers have strong incentives to take care in their decisions due to a natural concern forpersonal job security, personal wealth, and continuing control in the active market for bankconsolidation. Some will make wise decisions, and their institutions will thrive; others willmake decisions that prove to be incorrect and their banks will suffer.However, we know that no single bank management team, regardless of howwell intentioned, can accurately value the cost of its decisions, good or bad, on the bankingsystem and economy as a whole. Therefore, supervision is a way of forcing banks, individuallyand collectively, to recognize the broader impact that their risk-taking and risk-mediationdecisions might have on society at large. It also substitutes for some of the market disciplinelost, and attempts to offset the “moral hazard” that arises, due to the existence of the safety net.It is the possibility that poor managerial decisions by one bank will then spill over to otherbanks and eventually to the public at large that provides the rationale for supervision andregulation. That possibility is also a key factor driving the Federal Reserve’s need to remain abank supervisor. Without such active, on-site experience supervising and evaluating bankactivities, the central bank would, I believe, be less prepared to deal with financial crises thatinevitably arise. In addition, the Federal Reserve is the operator of important parts of thenation’s payment system, both wholesale and retail, and as such has a stake in the properfunctioning of banks and the banking industry.However, we should also recognize that supervision and regulation are notwithout costs to banks and, in turn, to society. Therefore, I believe that we should aspire to theminimum amount of regulation and supervision that is consistent with maintaining safety andsoundness of the banking system and with maintaining financial stability. After all, themarketplace is ultimately the best regulator, and we should look to the market for guidance andfeedback, wherever possible.Similarities between Consultants and SupervisorsGiven these fundamentally different incentives for banks to have consultants andsupervisors, why would an obviously intelligent CEO of a major bank compliment us onproviding “consultations”? The answer is that a good examiner brings some of the samestrengths to an examination that a good consultant brings to a consulting assignment, namelyBIS Review   24/1998
- 3 -objectivity, cross-firm experience and critical technical expertise. Like consultants, theindependent assessments that examiners make are becoming more dependent on statisticalsampling and on the accuracy of a bank’s internal information systems. Requiring banks tohave, on an on-going basis, sound internal procedures should reduce risks to the financialsystem and lead to fewer surprises overall.Reviewing procedures, though, entails a more subjective approach thanreviewing credits. Although analyzing credits can be complex, the potential resolutions arefew. The examiner reaches a conclusion about individual credits and the overall quality of theloan portfolio, and his findings are communicated to the bank. Some loans are charged-off,others are written down, and the results are clear. Addressing procedural problems, however, israrely so decisive because we get into judgmental areas and into a range of potentiallyacceptable -- and unacceptable -- resolutions. In this, supervision and consulting are verysimilar.One approach consultants use to resolve the challenge of dealing with moresubjective judgments is to maintain open lines of communication between consultant and topmanagement. The results of a consulting assignment are rarely a surprise when the final reportis presented, and management has had an opportunity to respond to early findings and presenttheir perspectives. Similarly, the results of a bank examination should not come as a surprise tobank leadership. Clear and frequent communication of supervisory guidance on sound practiceis of critical importance. Particularly in new or innovative activities, bankers need to hearclearly which arrangements the supervisor will accept.Another technique consultants use to analyze a subjective topic, such as bankprocesses, in which several practices might be acceptable, is to have open lines ofcommunication within the consulting team. All team members have a chance to add theirperspectives to the potential solution. Similarly, examiners from different agencies examining asingle banking entity should be able to share perspectives and findings.While both consultants and examiners may be forced to make judgmentsregarding management processes, it is essential that such judgments be made only afterreviewing the relevant facts. For consultants, those facts may encompass a wide array ofmarket or company data. For examiners, those facts may be gleaned from a credit analysis andthe review of credit files. Despite all the innovation and structural changes we have witnessedthroughout the financial system, extending credit and limiting the volume of bad loans remainthe primary business of banks. Examiners will continue to need to evaluate whether a bank’sown internal assessment of its exposures is sound, which will by necessity involve a review ofa sample of loans.In another, less appealing, way consultants and bank examiners are quite similar.In both cases the process can be obtrusive, with outsiders asking for scarce time and attentionfrom bank employees. Consultants and examiners alike must learn to adjust their professionalapproach to minimize the degree of disruption to the institution being served. In this regard, themove toward more off-site work and preparatory work is to be commended, and I am certainthat it is appreciated by banks.So in many ways, while the goals of the consultant and examiner are different,the techniques used may be quite similar. One can imagine an effective examination processresembling a good consulting process. Both rely, in part, on internal data. Both should becharacterized by frequent and candid conversations between bank leadership and the leadershipBIS Review   24/1998
- 4 -of the examination team. Both should help bank leadership to understand what is consideredsound practice. Both consultants and supervisors must at some level analyze the tangible resultsof the management processes, be that loan quality or some other measure of corporateperformance. Finally, to be successful both consulting and examination must be carried outwith the minimum of on-site disruption after careful off-site planning.Sharing Knowledge among ExaminersAnother similarity between consultants and examiners is that there is muchpractical experience gained by the professionals that must be shared with their co-workers orteam members or even more broadly among the community of professionals. For thecommunity of supervisors, these insights are the results of many years of first-hand experiencewith banks. Consultants have developed the fancy phrase of “knowledge management” for theprocess of building individual insights, sharing them with others, and finally applying thecollective knowledge through an individual professional working with a client. The challenge,of course, is how to complete this cycle of “build-share-apply” when the community spansseveral thousand people, across multiple locations and, possibly, multiple agencies. Thisgathering is an example of one possible solution to this challenge. Technology, through groupsoftware and the creation of more common, interagency tools, might prove to be anothersolution. I shall return to the need for broadly shared common technology platforms.Distinctions between Consultants and SupervisorsNow let me turn to the numerous differences between consultants andsupervisors. In adding value to the banking industry, supervisors have a major advantage overconsultants in that we have the standing and authority to influence actions industry-wide. Thatability to influence state or national policies is an important aspect of our work and one thathelps to motivate and retain our key people.This fact ties directly to the sound practice papers we provide. As supervisors,we need to share what we learn to help the industry manage and control its risk. To developindustry guidance, we do well in looking to leaders within the industry, and to institutions thatknow their business best. The knowledge we gain from our associations with so many banksalso accommodates the development of new regulatory paradigms. The recently adopted rulefor market risk that is based on the internal models of banks is a good example. Without thein-depth access to virtually all of the world’s leading trading banks and to their experiences andobservations, supervisors collectively could not have developed their own understanding andthe willingness to pursue this approach.This new approach highlights a series of significant differences betweenconsultants and supervisors.First, consultants often find themselves acting as “change leaders”, attempting toget their clients to take greater business risk based on consulting judgment. Supervisorsrecognize that banks are in the business of taking risk, but our goal is not to encourage or todiscourage risk-taking by individual banks. Our goal is to have banks recognize and managewell the risk they are taking, price the risk appropriately and avoid undue concentrations ofrisk. In that way we hope to reduce systemic risk.A second difference between consultants and supervisors is in the need forconsistency across banks. Consultants generally place little value on consistency across clients.The best consultants tailor solutions to each individual client. Therefore, two clients served byBIS Review   24/1998
- 5 -the same consulting firm on the same topic may receive different sets of recommendations.Supervisors, by comparison, properly put a premium on consistency across banks and overtime. We do not want to create an unstable market by giving inconsistent examination advice.A third difference that emerges is an appetite for novel professional approaches.Senior consultants reward younger professionals who develop new approaches. Within thefraternity of supervisors we want to maintain modern approaches to examination andsupervision, but should only adopt them widely once we are sure they lead to the desiredoutcome.Finally, you may recall that earlier I referred to the communication and feedbackrequired in order for an examination to have the impact of a good consultative process. Thechallenge in providing this feedback is in knowing just how far to go. As supervisors, we needto communicate our views, but we must avoid making operating decisions for banks.Supervisors, unlike consultants, must let banks make independent judgments. Theresponsibility for sound banking is with the banks, and it is they who must, ultimately, developand take full responsibility for their decisions. Supervisors must be free to criticize conditionsthat, if not corrected, may lead to heightened risk in the future. Unlike consultants, supervisorshave in their arsenal the power to effect change not only through examination of findings butalso through moral suasion, a strong bully pulpit and ultimately, supervisory guidance,regulations and enforcement actions.One critical area where currently we are exercising the power of moral suasionis in connection with the possible decline in credit underwriting standards that may bebecoming widespread. For more than two years now, we have heard persistent reports ofdeclines in lending terms, conditions, and standards. It is not just isolated reports from someexaminers. Leading bankers, such as John Medlin of Wachovia, and survey data, also supportthese reports.The question then becomes “what should we do?” We can certainly expect thatin the next economic downturn credit problems will rise and weaker lending standards, if theyexist, will only make matters worse. While the lending decision is ultimately that of the banks,this is an important area in which we can offer advice and general counsel. We should notcreate an artificial credit crunch, and I do not think that we are at risk of doing that, but we canand should urge caution that is based simply on our long experience in watching businesscycles. We can continue to make sure that bankers, themselves, understand their ownprocedures and the risks that they face. We all seem to be taking a more aggressive approachon this issue, and I expect that we will remain vigilant to sound the alarm when necessary.Interagency Coordination EffortsThroughout my comments I have noted a number of points that bear directly oninitiatives of state and federal supervisors to work together toward a stronger supervisoryprocess. As the US banking system becomes more entwined through interstate banking andbranching, it becomes ever more critical that we all coordinate our efforts in maintaining ahealthy, viable, and attractive dual banking system. It is also important for states to work tominimize unnecessary distinctions that slow the progress of interstate banking.I mentioned, for example, the need to modernize US banking laws, sharepractical supervisory experiences, maintain consistency, reduce intrusion during the bankexamination process and, in general, improve the overall efficiency of our staffs. These are notBIS Review   24/1998
- 6 -new challenges and, indeed, are goals that we collectively have been working towardsuccessfully for some time through the State-Federal Working Group and other forums. As weall know, state banking authorities have done much to advance interstate banking andbranching and to work together and with federal authorities toward a seamless oversightprocess. The state-federal protocol has helped greatly to bring about that seamless approachand is a crucial element in maintaining the viability of the state banking charter.Individual states and the state charter, in turn, have provided the industry withimportant flexibility to experiment in developing new banking products and delivery systems.In this and in many other ways, the state charter and the dual banking system have served thecountry well. Fortunately, the dual banking system seems healthy. Consider, for example, thatof the 207 new banking institutions chartered last year, 146 were state chartered.Adapting available technology to examinations and to sharing insights amongexaminers is another area in which significant progress has been made through our joint effortsto produce more efficient examinations. As you may know, the FDIC’s ALERT system nowpermits examiners to download bank data onto their own PCs in order to analyze exposures andprepare for upcoming examinations. It is being used widely by many states and by a number ofFederal Reserve Banks; more are likely to learn about and use it in the months ahead. TheFed’s own ELVIS program is another important advance that assists examiners through therisk-focused process for community banks that is being used by the Fed and FDIC and by moststates.Looking forward, examiners should soon be able to use the “GENESYS” systemto access a broad range of automated information contained in supervisory databases anddownload it into their examination reports. Together, these and other initiatives -- includinggreater use of analyst and examiner electronic desktops, new web pages, and expanded dataaccess techniques between state and federal supervisors -- have helped significantly to improvethe efficiency of our examiners and to create a less intrusive supervisory process. We should allbe pleased with these results and should expect the process to become even better in the monthsand years to come.ConclusionIn closing, I see many challenges ahead for us all, as we adapt the supervisoryprocess to keep pace with events in financial markets. In some respects consultants and banksupervisors have much to share and can learn from one another:1. Consultants and supervisors must have open, trust-based channels ofcommunication with bank management and among their peers. Both must add value byanalyzing both processes and the outcomes of those processes. They are both well advised tolimit their intrusiveness while not foregoing a thorough and professional inquiry.2. Both consultants and supervisors face the challenge of building, sharing andapplying professional knowledge and skills in a rapidly changing business environment. Thefailure to manage our knowledge within teams, within agencies and even across agencies willcertainly result in wasted effort and may even result in a caliber of supervision that does notkeep pace with changing financial technology and increased sophistication by banks. TheFederal-state coordination efforts that I mentioned are an example of this needed cooperation.BIS Review   24/1998
- 7 -However, while it might be quite appealing to speak of supervisors as actingmore like consultants, in many critical ways the consulting metaphor does not work very wellfor supervisors. There are at least three factors that make consulting an inappropriate model forsupervisors to follow:1. Consultants are hired by management and work to add value to theshareholders that management represents. Supervisors, in contrast, ultimately work for thepublic at large. Rather than adding shareholder value, supervisors seek to reduce or eliminateexcessive risks to the financial system and the federal safety net.2. Supervisors have much more impact in the banking industry than even themost savvy or articulate consultant. We must be willing to exercise that moral and legalauthority to forestall as best we can practices that we know might become harmful even beforethe full results of such practices become evident. In this we may not always be popular.3. Finally, consultants can be wrong with only relatively limited consequences.The caliber of their advice is rarely subject to after-the-fact scrutiny. When a consulting firmmakes a mistake, it may lose a client and that company may lose some money. When a bankingagency fails to act, the consequences can be widespread for the economy and the public atlarge.To keep the public’s trust, we need to be ever mindful of whose interests weserve. We do want to minimize the burden of supervision. We do want to foster modernization.We must stay current with the latest financial techniques. We can assist institutions byidentifying weaknesses and, at times, we can offer views toward resolution. Ultimately,however, we are forced to supervise and regulate banks in the interest of the public.BIS Review   24/1998
Mr. Greenspan gives a testimony on the global financial system   Testimonyof the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. AlanGreenspan, before the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations of the Committee onAppropriations of the US Senate on 3/3/98.The global financial system has been evolving rapidly in recent years. Newtechnology has radically reduced the costs of borrowing and lending across traditional nationalborders, facilitating the development of new instruments and drawing in new players.Information is transmitted instantaneously around the world, and huge shifts in the supply anddemand for funds naturally follow, resulting in a massive increase in capital flows.This burgeoning global system has been demonstrated to be a highly efficientstructure that has significantly facilitated cross-border trade in goods and services and,accordingly, has made a substantial contribution to standards of living worldwide. Its efficiencyexposes and punishes underlying economic imprudence swiftly and decisively. Regrettably, italso appears to have facilitated the transmission of financial disturbances far more effectivelythan ever before.Three years ago, the Mexican crisis was the first such episode associated with ournew high-tech international financial system. The current Asian crisis is the second.We do not as yet fully understand the new system’s dynamics. We are learningfast, and need to update and modify our institutions and practices to reduce the risks inherent inthe new regime. Meanwhile, we have to confront the current crisis with the institutions andtechniques we have.Many argue that the current crisis should be allowed to run its course withoutsupport from the International Monetary Fund or the bilateral financial backing of other nations.They assert that allowing this crisis to play out, while doubtless having additional negativeeffects on growth in Asia, and engendering greater spill-overs onto the rest of the world, is notlikely to have a large or lasting impact on the United States and the world economy.They may well be correct in their judgment. There is, however, a small but notnegligible probability that the upset in East Asia could have unexpectedly large negative effectson Japan, Latin America, and eastern and central Europe that, in turn, could have repercussionselsewhere, including the United States. Thus, while the probability of such an outcome may besmall, its consequences, in my judgment, should not be left solely to chance. We have observedthat global financial markets, as currently organized, do not always achieve an appropriateequilibrium, or at least require time to stabilize.Opponents of IMF support for member countries facing international financialdifficulties also argue that such substantial financial backing, by cushioning the losses ofimprudent investors, could encourage excessive risk-taking. There doubtless is some truth inthat, though arguably it has been the expectation of governments’ support of their financialsystems that has been the more obvious culprit, at least in the Asian case. In any event, anyexpectations of broad bailouts have turned out to have been disappointed. Many if not mostinvestors in Asian economies have to date suffered substantial losses. Asian equity losses,excluding Japanese companies, since June 1997, worldwide, are estimated to have exceeded$700 billion, at the end of January, of which more than $30 billion had been lost by USinvestors. Substantial further losses have been recorded in bonds and real estate.BIS Review   21/1998
- 2 -Moreover, the policy conditionality, associated principally with IMF lending,which dictates economic and financial discipline and structural change, helps to mitigate some ofthe inappropriate risk-taking. Such conditionality is also critical to the success of the overallstabilization effort. At the root of the problems is poor public policy that has resulted inmisguided investments and very weak financial sectors. Convincing a sovereign nation to alterdestructive policies that impair its own performance and threaten contagion to its neighbors isbest handled by an international financial institution, such as the IMF. What we have in placetoday to respond to crises should be supported even as we work to improve those mechanismsand institutions.Some observers have also expressed concern about whether we can be confidentthat IMF programs for countries, in particular the countries of East Asia, are likely to alter theireconomies significantly and permanently. My sense is that one consequence of this Asian crisisis an increasing awareness in the region that market capitalism, as practiced in the West,especially in the United States, is the superior model; that is, it provides greater promise ofproducing rising standards of living and continuous growth.Although East Asian economies have exhibited considerable adherence to manyaspects of free-market capitalism, there has, nonetheless, been a pronounced tendency towardgovernment-directed investment, using the banking system to finance that investment. Given arecord of real growth rates of close to 10 percent per annum over an extended period of time, itis not surprising that it has been difficult to convince anyone that the economic system practicedin East Asia could not continue to produce positive results indefinitely. Following thebreakdown, an increasing awareness, bordering in some cases on shock, that their economicmodel was incomplete, or worse, has arguably emerged in the region.As a consequence, many of the leaders of these countries and their economicadvisors are endeavoring to move their economies much more rapidly toward the type ofeconomic system that we have in the United States. The IMF, whatever one might say about itspolicy advice in the past, is trying to play a critical role in this process, providing advice andincentives that promote sound money and long-term stability. The IMF’s current approach inAsia is fully supportive of the views of those in the West who understand the importance ofgreater reliance on market forces, reduced government controls, scaling back ofgovernment-directed investment, and embracing greater transparency -- the publication of all thedata that are relevant to the activities of the central bank, the government, financial institutions,and private companies.It is a reasonable question to ask how long this conversion to embracing marketcapitalism in all its details will last in countries once temporary IMF support is no longernecessary. We are, after all, dealing with sovereign nations with long traditions, not alwaysconsonant with market capitalism. There can be no guarantees, but my sense is that there is agrowing understanding and appreciation of the benefits of market capitalism as we practice it --that what is being prescribed in IMF programs fosters their own interests.The just-inaugurated president of Korea, from what I can judge, is unquestionablyaware of the faults of the Korean system that contributed to his country’s crisis; he appears to bevery strenuously endeavoring to move his economy and society in the direction of freer marketsand a more flexible economy. In these efforts, he and other leaders in the region with similarviews, have the support of many younger people, a large proportion educated in the West, thatsee the advantages of market capitalism and who will soon assume the mantle of leadership.BIS Review   21/1998
- 3 -Accordingly, I fully back the Administration’s request to augment the financialresources of the IMF by approving as quickly as possible US participation in the NewArrangements to Borrow and an increase in the US quota in the IMF. Hopefully, neither willturn out to be needed, and no funds will be drawn. But it is better to have it available if that turnsout not to be the case and quick response to a pending crisis is essential.BIS Review   21/1998
Mr. Tietmeyer reviews the Central Bank Council of the Deutsche Bundesbank on its 50thanniversary   Address delivered by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof. Hans Tietmeyer, during theceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the first meeting of the Central Bank Council at the Land Central Bank ofHesse in Frankfurt/Main on 5/3/98.On March 8, 1948, eleven men gathered next door in the building of the then Land Central Bank ofHesse.The Central Bank Council - which at that time was still “provisional” - of the Bank deutscher Länder,which had been established on March 1, was meeting for the first time. An American officer of the Allied BankingCommission (appropriately named Mr. Freeman) convened the first meeting at 10.30 a.m.There will be quite a few fiftieth anniversaries in the coming weeks and months occasioned by theflood of major events relating to Germany which took place in 1948 and 1949.Many of these events were certainly more dramatic and spectacular than the first meeting of theCentral Bank Council. Yet, if we remember this meeting now, it is because a crucial decision for the future began to takeshape at that time.  If that which was begun on March 8, 1948 had not met with success, the history of the D-Mark (andperhaps also the history of our country) would have taken a different course.It is true that the preparations for the introduction of the D-Mark were carried out elsewhere and byothers, particularly by the Allies themselves. Yet, with monetary reform on June 20, when the first D-Mark banknotescame into circulation, the fate of the new currency began to be linked to the viability and the stability orientation of theGerman Central Bank Council.It is also true that the Central Bank Council did not act alone in achieving and safeguarding the D-Mark’s subsequent success and high level of stability. However, it acted in an exposed position, i.e. particularlywherever the scarcity of money was and is the issue.IIThe first Central Bank Council meeting was preceded by fundamental differences of opinion amongthe Allies on the shape of the future German central banking system.The Americans wanted to start again from scratch. They saw a highly concentrated and largelycentralised economy as an environment in which the totalitarian regime in Germany had been able to thrive. Theytherefore wanted the structures to be as pluralistic as possible. Incidentally, that was also why they favoured a centralbank which was independent of instructions by German agencies. Their reasoning was not so much based on scholarlyeconomic arguments, nor solely on the model of the Federal Reserve Bank back in America. Rather, they wereparticularly anxious not to allow any new excessively dominant political structures in Germany.Above all, decentralised structures were to be created. Independent Land Central Banks wereestablished in Bavaria, Württemberg-Baden, Hesse and Bremen, which were linked relatively loosely to begin with.They were headed by new people who were to introduce a different, “new way of thinking”.The British had other priorities. They wanted a functional and efficient central banking system asquickly as possible. Initially they adhered to the old centralist Reichsbank structure and created a central agency inHamburg, making use of experts with Reichsbank experience in many cases. Only in 1948 did they dissolve theReichsbank organisation and create Land Central Banks in Düsseldorf, Hanover, Hamburg and Kiel.BIS Review   20/1998
- 2 -French intra-zonal central banking policy was closer to the decentralised approach of the Americans.As early as 1947, the French created Land Central Banks for Württemberg-Hohenzollern, Baden and Rhineland-Palatinate. Admittedly, they were less than enthusiastic about the plan to link Land Central Banks across the borders ofthe occupation zones, not least because they were much less interested in a currency reform than the Americans and theBritish.The list of participants (and, to a nearly greater extent, the list of non-participants) in the first CentralBank Council meeting is very revealing.Firstly, there were the two representatives of the Allied Banking Commission, an American and aBriton. The Americans and British were the architects of the Bank deutscher Länder.Secondly, there were the already appointed “proper” Presidents (or Vice Presidents) of Land CentralBanks that were already firmly established. They came from the American zone.Thirdly, there were the representatives of the “embryonic” Land Central Banks which were still in theprocess of being established; these representatives were separately commissioned by the Länder governments. Theycame from the British zone.Fourthly, the representatives of the Land Central Banks from the French zone were absent. They werenot to join until a few weeks later, with retroactive effect as of March 25. The files reveal that an important motivationfor the French joining quickly was their overriding interest in gaining influence on the initial decisions on staffing in thenew central bank.Fifthly, no representative of Berlin was present. The Western Powers excluded Berlin from the plansconcerning currency reform. This also drew sharp criticism from the conclave of Rothwesten. As late as the autumn of1957, the President of the Berlin Central Bank attended the meetings only as a guest, having what was termed an“advisory vote”.Sixthly, and finally, representatives from the Soviet zone of occupation were absent. This ismentioned not merely for the sake of completeness.After all, in early March 1948, negotiations were still taking place on a four-zone currency reform - atleast in a formal sense. On March 20, the Soviets left the negotiating table for good. The die had probably been castbeforehand, though. And therein lies a sort of tragedy of that time. Currency reform perpetuated the division ofGermany which to all intents all practical purposes had already been under way. The Bank deutscher Länder becamethe first institution of “Trizonesia”.Much has been written, and speculation has abounded, regarding the events of that period and thereasons for them. One thing is sure: currency reform was certainly not the cause of the subsequent forty-year division ofGermany. However, it undoubtedly made the separation of both parts of Germany more obvious than it already was.And it is certainly not completely accidental that the introduction of the D-Mark in eastern Germany in 1990 also pavedthe way for political reunification. On November 12, 1992 - following the reorganisation of the Bundesbank’sstructure - representatives of Land Central Banks with responsibility for the east German Länder became members ofthe Central Bank Council for the first time.IIIThe Central Bank Council of March 8, 1948 thus also mirrored the conflicts of that period. But that isonly one aspect.BIS Review   20/1998
- 3 -The first Central Bank Council meeting was, at the same time, a reflection of the compromisebetween the American approach, which tended to be federalist, and the British approach, which was more centralised,and this included those issues which remained controversial to the end: Is the Board allowed to be operationally active?And: What is the composition of the Central Bank Council?Since that time, the institution of the Central Bank Council has had, on the one hand, a centralistelement - as the name says. In particular, it is responsible for a single monetary policy. The Land Central Banks do nothave any discretionary scope in that respect; their task is to implement that policy. On the other hand, though, the CentralBank Council has an inherent decentralised element owing to its composition.Besides the Presidents of the Land Central Banks, the Central Bank Council of the Bank deutscherLänder had only two other members: its chairman and the President of the Board. The members of the Board did notjoin the Central Bank Council until the Bundesbank Act became law in 1957. However, the decentralised element waspreserved in the process by which Land Central Bank Presidents are appointed.The Central Bank Council thus has a sort of “dual character”. Even today, it is at the same time acentralised body in terms of its function and partly decentralised in its composition. This dual nature has not always beenwithout problems. It could have torn the Central Bank Council apart.There were also fears at the beginning that the Presidents of the Land Central Banks were merelyservants of their Land governments, and that they would be unable to resist requests by the Länder for loans, inparticular. Fortunately, things transpired differently. Even in the more decentralised composition of the Bank deutscherLänder, the dual character proved not to be a predetermined breaking point but rather its strength.Why? Particularly because it was possible for a collegial principle to develop and consolidate up to thepresent day. The members came more and more to feel themselves part of a joint body with a common responsibilityfor the stability of the D-Mark. This principle of collegiality prevents exaggerated centralism - both on the Board and interms of the President. At the same time it prevents fragmentation. There is no horse trading, no coalitions geared tospecial interests. Despite all the differences in the detailed judgements, the common orientation towards the goal ofmonetary stability predominates.Two institutional factors played a crucial role in encouraging the development of the collegialprinciple. Firstly, the role of the President. He is primus inter pares - no more and no less. As opposed to some othercountries, we do not have a hierarchical presidential constitution. Yes, even the President can be outvoted. Secondly, thecollegial principle is also strengthened by the fact that only the members are present at the meetings.The decision-makers are by themselves. Everyone - including the President - is thus compelled tobecome personally involved and to state his own arguments. And this, it should be noted, in a body whose decentralisedcomposition entails a high degree of plurality, and diversity in terms of professional careers, personal experiences andeven policy judgements, in some cases.The collegial principle makes the Central Bank Council a sort of specialist parliament. Daily issues,and party political interests, too, are to be left outside.Karl Schiller coined the term Frankfurt Areopagus - a term which has often been quoted since. Thefact that this sometimes carries a slightly mocking undertone does not bother me too much, either.This collective responsibility, subject only to the legal mandate, and the Central Bank Council’sconcept of its own role as a specialist parliament are crucial preconditions of the Bank’s independence. Collectiveresponsibility is, at the same time, a protection against external political influences. The specialist judgement,BIS Review   20/1998
- 4 -unencumbered by tactical and political considerations, is the basis of the legitimacy in taking decisions on interest ratesand the money stock independently of political bodies.Pointing to great individual achievements does not by any means discount the significance of theCentral Bank Council as a body. The authority of a specialist body always needs minds and personalities who alsoensure the necessary continuity.I should like to mention two of my predecessors, both of whom are present here today: Karl OttoPöhl and Helmut Schlesinger. And I would also like to bring to mind some great personalities of the 1950s, 1960s and1970s. Their names are inseparably linked with the post-war history of the German central bank: Wilhelm Vocke, KarlBernard, Otto Veit, Otto Pfleiderer, Karl Klasen, Karl Blessing, Otmar Emminger.The history of a central bank is not only contained behind glass cases, in file folders, ceremonialspeeches, or the like. No, more importantly, the history of a central bank lies in its reputation, or in its “capital stock”, soto speak. And it also lies in its “institutional memory”.By the way, five of the above-named personalities - Vocke, Bernard, Veit, Pfleiderer andKlasen - played a key role when the Bank deutscher Länder withstood its first serious clash with the FederalGovernment in October 1950. At that time, the Central Bank Council raised official interest rates by 2%, contrary to theinsistent urgings of Adenauer and Schäffer.That was a milestone on the road to a truly independent German central bank and to a stable D-Mark.The legendary meeting took place in the Chancellery in Bonn, by the way. To that extent - for thatmeeting, it should be noted - geographical proximity to policy makers has not done any harm.On the whole, though, the logic behind an unpolitical monetary and financial system impliesprotecting oneself from the all-too-hearty embrace of politics by not being too close to the policy makers.IVWithout a doubt, the year 1998 is a special one for the Central Bank Council.It will hold its thousandth meeting in the autumn. Incidentally, we have not pulled any tricks in orderto reach the 1000 figure in time before the end of the year.At the end of the year, as you all know, the Central Bank Council of the Deutsche Bundesbank willsurrender its monetary policy decision making powers to the ECB Governing Council, in accordance with theMaastricht Treaty. (The place where the ECB Governing Council’s meetings are to be held is only a few hundredmetres from here, by the way.)It is occasionally said that the European Central Bank is a copy, a clone, of the Deutsche Bundesbank.In actual fact, there are major features which the future European and the present German central banking systems havein common - particularly independence and the combination of centralised and decentralised elements, of course.Nevertheless, it is precisely in the decentralised elements that differences exist which cannot be overlooked.Admittedly, the fleshing out of the structures defined in the Treaty, the practical handling of monetarypolicy powers, are not things that can be xeroxed and thrown into the European Central Bank’s mailbox. These arethings which have to evolve there themselves, much as they evolved in the Bank deutscher Länder and then in theBundesbank.BIS Review   20/1998
- 5 -The ECB Governing Council should also soon arrive at a truly collegial principle. In that way, theEuropean general public will be able to recognise it as a credible, completely objectively-oriented specialist body withresponsibility for all aspects of the single currency.The accountability of individual members of the ECB Governing Council to national bodies or theEuropean Parliament must not aim at sowing the seeds of division among the members or gearing monetary policy tospecial interests. That would jeopardise the collegial principle, and thus actual independence.Within the European Parliament, too, there are obviously those who feel that there should be regularconsultations on monetary policy decisions with the ECB Executive Board.That surely exceeds the necessary scope of accountability. This is evidently a matter of subjectingmonetary policy to, or at least involving it in, political plans and objectives. Yet the Treaty consciously envisages notonly a supranational but also an unpolitical currency.Some may find a parallel between the forthcoming establishment of the European Central Bank andthe beginnings of the Bank deutscher Länder fifty years ago. Then, as now, the primary objective was to rapidlyestablish confidence in the new currency. However, the conditions are not comparable - thank goodness!The conversion of national currencies to the euro is not a currency reform. No one is going to loseanything because of the conversion. And the European Central Bank is not starting from scratch. It can carry on thelegacy of the past, with all its different facets in the participating countries.In particular, it can - and hopefully will - build on the international reputation and the weight of the D-Mark as the present anchor currency in Europe. Hans Roeper gave us the much-quoted saying “From a child ofoccupation to a world star”.I do not wish to lapse into adulation. However, I do believe that the Central Bank Council of theDeutsche Bundesbank has played its due part in this development.All in all, Germany’s currency has had conscientious stability guardians for fifty years. And thegeneral public has a right to expect that this will remain so when our money is no longer the D-Mark but the euro.BIS Review   20/1998
Bank of Japan presents summaries of articles in the February edition of itsQuarterly Bulletin   BANK OF JAPAN, COMMUNICATION, 27/2/98.Response to the Disclosure Framework for Securities Settlement Systems: The-BOJ-NET JGBServicesIntroductionThis document provides answers to the “Disclosure Framework for SecuritiesSettlement Systems”, a survey questionnaire drawn up by a joint working group of the Committee onPayment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the Bank for International Settlements, and theInternational Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).The Securities Settlement System (SSS) here is the “Bank of Japan FinancialNetwork System (BOJ-NET) JGB Services”, which is the Japanese government bonds (JGB)settlement system in Japan. The answers as prepared by the operator of the system, the Bank ofJapan, are intended to help current and future participants in the settlement system to appropriatelyunderstand and assess the risks associated with it.The answers provide basic information about the BOJ-NET JGB Services as theywere in October 1997 (when the answers were prepared). The BOJ-NET funds transfer system is alsoreferred to where necessary.Please note that the answers are intended to provide a general explanation, and theinformation may not apply to every individual case.Utilization of Financial Institutions’ Self-Assessment in Enhancing Credit Risk ManagementSummaryThe government’s Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) measures to be implementedfrom April 1998 require financial institutions to conduct adequate assessment of their assets and tocalculate appropriate ”loan-loss write-offs and provisions” based on their own internal rules andreferring to guidelines of the authorities. The Japanese “Big Bang” reform package is expected to beconducted by the year 2001. Given these situations, large financial institutions in Japan are makinggreat efforts to enhance credit risk management. Medium and small-sized financial institutions are ontheir way to establish basic credit risk management systems under the PCA measures. Sinceinformation derived from self-assessment can be useful in a wide range of activities fromstrengthening risk management systems to formulating business strategy large differentials inbusiness management are likely to arise among financial institutions depending on the utilization ofthis valuable information.The Bank of Japan introduced the Tracing Method of asset assessment and loanlosses in order to support financial institutions to maximize the use of their own assessments as amanagement tool. The Tracing Method is used to observe changes in the condition of individualassets in a time series and is one way to utilize financial institutions’ self-assessment of assets. TheBank conducted a follow-up analysis in the recent on-site examination to analyze how many of theloans classified in the previous examination (1993-94) were later “written off and others” in relationto financial losses (“others” are defined as specific loan-loss provisions, losses from support byBIS Review   20/1998
- 2 -renunciation of claims, and losses from sales of nonperforming loans to the Cooperative CreditPurchasing Company [CCPC]).These empirical studies using the Tracing Method suggest the following four pointsof importance for enhancing credit risk management.(1) Importance of strengthening the early warning functionsIt is vital to control loans classified as “substandard” (S) because the likelihood of loan losses interms of “write-offs and others” reaching a substantial size in the long term may varysubstantially depending on the adequacy of the long-term management of this classification ofloans.(2) Importance of utilizing statistical methods which cover the life-span of loansFor example, for loans classified as (S), there is a tendency for the loan-loss ratio to rise after thethird year following the assessment.(3) Importance of avoiding loan concentrationFinancial institutions with highly concentrated loans in terms of industry had higher loan-lossratios, while institutions with diversified loan portfolios had relatively low ratios.(4) Importance of gathering financial institutions’ own default data for risk quantificationThe estimated losses may be understated when only publicly disclosed bankruptcy data are usedsince losses incurred through loans against “de facto bankrupt borrowers” and recipients offinancial support are not covered in such data. The latter type of losses accounts for a significantshare of outstanding losses. The Tracing Method covers all these data and enhances establishmentof financial institutions’ own default data for credit risk quantification.On our part, the Bank of Japan will continue to check and monitor the credit riskmanagement systems at financial institutions on the off-site basis and also during the on-siteexamination in a more risk-focused, seamless and flexible manner, taking individual institutions’circumstances into consideration. In addition, the Bank will continue to research methods ofquantifying credit risks as well as conducting follow-up analysis of the Tracing Method, in line withthe worldwide trend to further enhance credit risk management.Revision of the Wholesale Price Indexes to 1995 BaseIntroductionThe Wholesale Price Indexes (WPI) system is one of the three sets of price indexstatistics presently compiled by the Bank of Japan, along with the Corporate Service Price Index(CSPI) and the Input-Output Price Indexes of Manufacturing Industry by Sector (IOPI). Each hasdifferent coverage and purposes. The WPI provides a measure of average changes in the prices ofgoods in inter-enterprise transactions. It functions as (1) an economic indicator; (2) a barometer of thepurchasing power of the currency; and (3) a deflator.A base-year revision of the WPI from the 1990 base to 1995 has been conducted toincorporate changes in Japan’s economic and trade structures.1 While the basic framework of theBIS Review   20/1998
- 3 -index system remains unchanged by the revision, the selected commodities (i.e., the smallest unit ofcommodities for which indexes, calculated based on sample prices, are published) have been revisedand expanded in order to further increase the precision of the index. This paper outlines the detailsinvolved in the revision of the WPI to the 1995 base, figures on the new base having been released inDecember 1997.______________________1 A base-year revision of the WPI, involving the updating of the base year for both indexes and weight calculation, isconducted every five years based on a recommendation made by the Statistics Council in March 1981. In the revisionto the 1995 base, indexes were recalculated from the 1990 average = 100 base to the 1995 average = 100 base, and theweights used in the calculation of indexes were updated based on 1995 data from such sources as the Census ofManufactures” of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Trade Statistics of the Ministry of Finance.The framework of the index system is also reviewed as necessary at the time of the base-year revision.BIS Review   20/1998
Mr. Meister asks whether supervisory capital standards should be modernisedor redesigned   Luncheon speech by Mr. Edgar Meister, a member of the Board of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the Conference entitled “Financial Services at the Crossroads: Capital Regulation inthe 21st Century” orrganised by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in New York on26-27/2/98.II am delighted to have been given the opportunity of speaking to such a highlyqualified audience at this major conference on capital regulation.If you see a banker jump out of the window, jump after him - there is sure to be profitin it, said Voltaire, the 18th century French philosopher. Looking at the situation in South-East Asia,I am not entirely convinced that it would always be wise to follow Voltaire’s advice. Even if allbanks do the same thing, that does not necessarily mean that it is appropriate.It is also becoming clear, however, that the Asian crisis has lent new points ofemphasis to the already important topic of capital adequacy; in other words, risk and capital. In thatrespect, this conference has come at a very opportune moment.What we have to consider is whether the concept of the capital accord, which datesfrom 1988, is still appropriate for meeting the challenges of the 21st century in terms of a goodprudential supervisory standard? Or do we need an alternative system, and which alternative systemof capital requirements might be superior to the present one?There are divergences of opinion on this matter not only between the supervisedinstitutions and the supervisors but also, in some cases, among the supervisors themselves.In order to assess both courses of action (modernise or redesign), it would appear tobe the obvious approach to use current, accepted criteria in the field of prudential supervision. Theseinclude: The security level of the individual institution, i.e. its capacity and expertise in managingrisk and its cushion of capital against losses. And closely linked to that: the overallstability of the banking system. I assume nobody wants a level of financial marketstability that is lower than now.as well as The regulatory burden and level playing field aspects. Streamlining supervision andderegulation are important additional conditions for avoiding competitivedisadvantages caused by banking regulation and for optimising the supervisorysystem on cost-effectiveness criteria. The regulatory burden cannot be the maindeciding criterion, however. Furthermore, prudential measures should not themselvescreate competitive discrepancies between different groups of banks.IIIn terms of considerations of risk, an ideal capital standard should be designed to fullyreflect an institution’s risks and to derive a capital base which takes due account of risk. At the sametime, it would be desirable if this standard raised market discipline. In reality, we are still too faraway from that theoretical ideal.BIS Review   18/1998
- 2 -There are differences in the measurability and hence also in the controllability of themain risks to which banks and other financial intermediaries are exposed. With the risk controllingtechniques that have now been developed and on account of the availability of the input data, marketrisks, for example, can be measured quite accurately in most cases.By contrast, in what is still the main risk area for banks, credit risk, a purelyquantitative determination of risk - comparable to market-risk modelling - is much more difficult andhas not yet been achieved. For that reason, assessment of the credit risk is still strongly marked bytraditional methods, i.e. the judgement of the banks’ credit officers.As we have heard before, the efforts to improve the quantification of credit risks (byusing models) are mainly hampered by the inadequate availability of data or their poor quality. Forthat reason, the recent survey on data sources by the ISDA to develop a reference and liquidityassessment for credit risk modelling is to be welcomed. It remains to be seen, however, whether thequality of the data in major market segments will be adequate.Operational risks, too, including - for example - inadequate segregation of duties,fraud and errors in the field of data processing, are very difficult to model on account of the evengreater problems concerning data. Measuring these risks is therefore rather a combination of estimateand guess; in other words, a „guestimate“ which is largely based on data not objectively observable.IIIThe difficulties in risk measurement are a problem for the institutions, but also forprudential supervision for which it is difficult to define capital requirements.Our existing regulatory framework aims, not least, to ensure that the institutions havean adequate cushion of capital as a protection against unavoidable losses. Although this “shield” ofcapital is supposed to cover all risk factors without them being broken down in greater detail (foroperational and legal risks, too, for instance), the calculation of the required supervisory capital isessentially geared to a single risk factor: the default risk (and, to a lesser extent, the market risk, fromJanuary 1998 onwards).Bankers and some supervisors have recently called the Capital Accord into question,not least because of its inexact categorisation of risks. It is pointed out that exposures to OECDcountries are uniformly assigned a risk weighting of 0%, for instance, although there are considerabledifferences in terms of risk within that group of countries. The same applies to exposures tonon-banks with a weighting of 100%, including blue chips that are known worldwide. Additionally, itis claimed that the degree of diversification in the loan book is not taken into account. This is said toresult in a misallocation of funds since they are not used in the most productive way.IVThis is the backdrop against which more sophisticated methods of credit riskmeasurement are discussed, ranging from a subtly differentiated prudential weighting scheme, the useof external or internal rating, the inclusion of portfolio effects and credit risk models to new conceptscompletely different from the Capital Accord. It is my assessment that the supervisors arefundamentally open-minded about these discussions. The new concepts include, in particular, thepre-commitment approach and more self-regulation, as proposed by the Group of Thirty.BIS Review   18/1998
- 3 -Pre-commitment implies that a bank decides itself how much capital it will holdwithin a given period to cover the risks arising from its trading book. Sanctions will apply if theaccumulated losses exceed that amount. This idea is tempting in many respects. It could make thingseasier for the supervisors and the regulatory burden would be lower for the institutions. Moreoverthis approach is highly market-oriented.There are a number of fundamental difficulties, however. The pre-commitmentapproach involves a purely ex-post analysis of a bank’s risk and capital situation. This perspectiveresults in supervisory authorities reacting rather than specifying a given level of capital for theinstitution in a preventive manner. Without wishing to pre-empt this afternoon’s discussion, Iperceive the danger of an institution accepting additional risks if there is a threat of thepre-commitment being infringed and hence of regulatory sanctions. If there is a danger of the amountof capital being exceeded, some traders will attempt to change course abruptly in accordance with thedictum “If you are in trouble, double”.A key problem also consists in finding a consistent penalising mechanism. Assumingthat the risks taken result in the institution suffering losses higher than the earmarked reserved capital,banking supervisors would have to impose penalties which would lead to the financial difficultiesbeing even bigger.Furthermore, the market is to be informed of this for the purpose of strengtheningmarket discipline. It is, above all, this envisaged sanction - so it seems to me - which meets withconsiderable reservations on the part of many institutions and supervisory authorities. I am quitedoubtful whether institutions would be prepared to go that far in terms of disclosure.At the risk of exaggeration, and relating to the concept of the bank as a whole, thepre-commitment approach represents a bank’s promise that it will not become insolvent. If thatpromise cannot be kept, it will remain an open question - at least in critical cases - whether thesupervisors can or will impose sanctions.A proposal by the G-30, which goes further than the pre-commitment approach,amounts to leaving supervision and the development of regulatory strategies basically to the marketor to a small group of major international financial institutions. The involvement of supervisedinstitutions in the development of regulatory standards is not new in principle. It has been tried andtested. Whenever certain methods have become state of the art, supervisors have always been readyto adopt such standards as binding - as was latterly the case for the recognition of internal models formarket risks.Nevertheless, there may be problems, for example, if there are no administrativesanctions to enforce the standards. How binding would they be? Trusting solely in an effectivemarket control, pre-supposes a comparatively high degree of transparency. As in the case of thepre-commitment approach, it appears to be questionable whether all the market players would beprepared to disclose their risk positions and losses to the market, for example. That wouldsimultaneously mean them revealing market expectations, trading strategies and other businesssecrets.Furthermore, it would not be greatly surprising if the interests of this select group ofinstitutions were not identical with the general interests of the financial industry. In particular, there isthe possibility of competitive distortions at the expense of smaller institutions. As mentioned above,the possibility of supervisory standards, including voluntary self-regulatory standards in the privatesector, causing new competitive problems should at all events be avoided.BIS Review   18/1998
- 4 -VAs concepts, the pre-commitment approach and self-regulation as proposed by theG-30 can indeed supply important and thought-provoking ideas. Given the present prudentialstandard, the advantages of these alternative concepts consist, for example, in a reduction of theregulatory burden and banks having even greater freedom in their risk management by virtue of apronounced market orientation.At the same time - in addition to the reservations already mentioned - I perceive thedanger of a decline in the overall security level of the individual credit institution and the bankingsystem. Existing risks might be covered by less capital than hitherto under the Capital Accord.Self-regulation aiming at greater market discipline would be welcome. The alternativeconcepts that have been referred to here would probably not be able to achieve that on a lasting basisor especially if a bank or a banking system were in a difficult situation, and would not be able tomake up for the disadvantages of institutions having a lower capital base.What should also be given consideration is that pre-commitment and self-regulation -as advocated by G-30 - is intended to apply mainly to large, internationally operating banks. Theseare precisely the players who have an especially prominent role in terms of the stability of thefinancial markets.At the same time, we know that the world of risk has become more complex duringthe last few years and that the risks which the institutions have to bear under the pressure to performhave increased. Risky high-yield transactions in emerging markets, for example, are likely to becomeincreasingly significant in future despite the recent turmoil in Asia.Precisely the events in South-East Asia demonstrate how difficult it is to determinebank-specific risks with sufficient accuracy. Even leading rating agencies have tended to run behindthe markets in line with the maxim: “Please follow me, I am right behind you.”VICapital is therefore still a modern prudential requirement. The Basle Capital Accordis, in this context, a rough and comparatively simple approach.This standard, which has now been put into practice virtually worldwide, undoubtedlyhas some weaknesses. It has however demonstrated its suitability under changing conditions in thealmost ten years since its introduction. In my view, the empirical findings are definitely positive.However, the Capital Accord has not worked where the calculated capital was notactually in place. I am referring to credit institutions in many countries which have experiencedcrises. In such cases, some institutions only formally fulfilled the norm of 8% minimum capital.Actually, an evaluation of assets and liabilities in line with market conditions would have shown thatthe capital had been used up long beforehand.As the Capital Accord sets the capital requirements more conservatively than thealternative approaches mentioned, there remains a buffer for cushioning the risks which are difficultto measure - operational and legal risks, for instance. To that extent, an adequate cushion of capitalcan to a certain extent make up for shortcomings in risk identification, measurement and control.BIS Review   18/1998
- 5 -VIITo come back to the original question: I am in favour of an evolutionary solution. TheBasle Accord should be modernised and not - at present - be replaced by other concepts. There areindeed other approaches which are worth discussing, but at present I cannot identify any convincingalternative concept among them which would be operationally viable, practicable and superior to theCapital Accord.The Capital Accord itself is adaptable enough for new developments in the markets tobe integrated into its system in a meaningful manner - as occurred in the case of market risk, forexample. This also applies to all currently impending topics for discussion, such as on-balance-sheetnetting, credit derivatives, credit risk models and new capital elements.In return, this also implies capital buffers becoming necessary for risks that have sofar not been covered: given an easing of capital requirements in other areas, buffers for operationalrisks, for valuation risks and for concentration risks, for instance, must no longer be a “no-go” area.Generally speaking, further qualitative requirements may also help to curb risks andhence have a stabilising impact in micro and macro-prudential terms. In that respect, the BasleCommittee’s “Framework for the Evaluation of Internal Control Systems” is especially important.Quantitative and qualitative minimum standards for the use of credit risk models based on a widelyused and convincing practice would also have to be specified in due course.In my view, self-regulation can have a stimulating effect, but it cannot replace anadministrative supervision of banks and other financial intermediaries. To that extent, self-regulationis an approach which complements prudential supervision. I believe that this assessment is reinforcedby the various bank crises that have occurred in the past and has been borne out yet again by theAsian crisis.A basic stance of this kind virtually necessitates supervisors working closely with theinstitutions. That is very helpful for finding regulations which are up-to-date and compatible with themarket and, at the same time, strengthen market discipline and do not lose sight of the stability of theoverall system.BIS Review   18/1998
Mr. Meyer discusses financial globalization and efficient banking regulationRemarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, before the Annual Washington Conference of the Institute of InternationalBankers in Washington, DC on 2/3/98.The highly publicized recent events in the world’s financial system have served tomake certain things abundantly clear. In particular, we now have further evidence that there is alarge and growing disparity between the risk management practices of what might be called the“best practice” financial institutions and those of their competitors around the globe. Thisdisparity, moreover, runs much more deeply than the weaknesses exposed during the Asianfinancial crisis. In that event, bankers were seen to make the kinds of basic mistakes that havebeen oft repeated at other times and in other places. For example, loans were made togovernment-supported enterprises, either at the behest of the government itself or under theassumption that official support would be provided if the loans turned bad. At times, these loanswere made to highly leveraged companies whose underlying financial ratios did not justify theorigination of the loans on the terms under which they were made. To add insult to injury, theoffending banks sometimes borrowed in dollars and lent in their home currencies, withouthedging, believing that their government could and would continue to stabilize exchange rates.While these practices are troublesome, I am much more concerned with what Ibelieve is both an exciting and disturbing aspect of the evolution of financial markets. Spurredby improvements in computer technology and advances in financial theory -- most notably inoption-theoretic models -- new financial products, as well as the markets supporting traditionalbanking products, are becoming ever more sophisticated and ever more global in nature. Whilefinancial innovation and globalization can only be applauded for their salutary impact on marketefficiency, they present some difficult problems for market practitioners and, where thepractitioners are regulated entities, their supervisors.Today, I should like to concentrate on three themes, or principles, related to theevolution of financial markets: First, there exists a significant and dynamic connection runningbetween market innovation and market regulation. Financial innovation often occurs in responseto regulation, especially when such regulation does not make economic sense. Conversely, theevolution of regulation often is spurred by advances in the market. Second, the globalization offinancial markets means that mistakes in risk management made by one or more significantplayers in world markets can result in real losses not only to the entity making the mistake, butalso to other participants and to other countries’ banking systems. Third, the economicefficiencies that are potentially associated with financial innovation can be negated by inefficientbanking regulation. Efficient banking regulation, by contrast, not only provides the backgroundagainst which financial advances can occur, but also permits governments to achieve socialobjectives where otherwise they might not, or might achieve them only at higher cost.To demonstrate these three principles, we need discuss only one aspect of bankingregulation, albeit the most important -- namely prudential regulation as currently embodiedwithin the international capital standard for banks. The Basle Accord of 1988, while it wascritical to reversing the decades-long decline in bank capital ratios, has come under frequent andstrong attack in recent years, both by regulators and those that are regulated. In particular, thereis considerable concern that technological advances and rapid evolution in financial products arereducing the meaningfulness and effectiveness of the capital standards, at least for the largest,most sophisticated institutions.BIS Review  17/1998
- 2 -The deficiencies of the Accord are well known, but bear repeating here: First,while intended to be “risk-based”, the formal capital ratio requirements nevertheless lump mostbank risk positions into a single “bucket” corresponding to a rather arbitrary, minimum totalcapital requirement of 8 percent against the book value of the position. Second, the capital rulesdo not explicitly account for certain risks that may be important, such as operating risk. Finally,portfolio composition, hedging, and general portfolio management techniques are explicitlyconsidered only within the market risk requirements for trading account activities, not for thecredit or other risks that dominate within the banking book.This arbitrary, one-size-fits-all minimum capital ratio has spurred what can onlybe termed an avalanche of financial innovations aimed at either evading or taking advantage ofthe capital standard. Such regulatory capital arbitrage, as we call it, currently is carried outprimarily via the securitization markets. While securitization may serve useful economicpurposes having nothing to do with regulatory arbitrage, a properly structured securitizationconduit can assist the sponsoring bank in lowering its effective regulatory capital requirementagainst a group of assets or other risk positions. In many cases, the securitization results in thebank retaining essentially all of the risk of the underlying assets, through the provision of creditenhancements to the conduit, but at lower capital requirements than if the assets remained on thebank’s books. This is accomplished, for example, by having the conduit “remotely originate”credits, thus allowing the bank to circumvent recourse capital requirements that apply only toassets sold to the conduit. Alternatively, the bank can provide indirect credit enhancement to theconduit by, for example, supplying backup lines of credit to the obligors that use the conduit toraise funds.To a significant degree, the growth in securitization and other forms of regulatoryarbitrage has been spurred by the inadequacies of the international capital standard. This hasoccurred largely because, over the last decade, many of the larger banks have developed fairlysophisticated internal models for formally quantifying risk, including credit risk within thebanking book. These models are used to calculate internal economic capital allocations forvarious sub-portfolios of the bank, and it is because these internal capital allocations often differsubstantially from the 8 percent regulatory standard that the problems arise.In the typical case, the bank attempts to formally measure each major type of riskassociated with a product or business line -- credit risk, market risk, and operating risk. In thecredit risk arena, for example, risk is measured as the estimated shape of a loss probabilitydistribution over a particular horizon, generally one year. Economic, as opposed to regulatory,capital is then allocated against this loss distribution in an amount necessary to meet somecorporate goal for insolvency probability. For example, several large banks allocate enoughcapital internally for credit risk so as to reduce to 0.03 percent the probability that credit losseswill exceed allocated capital. Why is this 3 basis point standard chosen? Because that is thehistorical average default probability, over a one-year horizon, for double-A rated corporateinstruments. In other words, the banking firm wants to hold enough capital so that the chances ofit becoming insolvent are low enough to win a double-A rating on the bank’s own liabilities.The problem is that, when these economic capital calculations are made, theyresult in a very wide range of internal capital allocations for individual positions orsub-portfolios -- as low as several basis points up to more than 30 percent of the carrying valueof the risk position. When a group of loans is assigned an internal capital requirement that isvery low compared with the 8 percent regulatory standard, the bank has a strong incentive torestructure the positions to allow them to be reclassified into a lower regulatory risk category, byBIS Review  17/1998
- 3 -using securitization or other devices. If the bank doesn’t do this, it cannot make a market rate ofreturn on the regulatory capital of 8 percent on the loans.Regulatory arbitrage, from the perspective of proper resource allocation, can be agood thing. If there were no way for the bank to avoid the uneconomically high regulatoryrequirement, it would need eventually to exit its low risk businesses because of insufficientreturns to equity. In the long run, this would serve no purpose other than causing the regulatedentity to shrink in size relative to its unregulated competitor. At the extreme, the one-size-fits-allcapital standard, if there were no arbitrage safety valve, would cause the bank to engage in onlythose activities for which the economic capital requirement is greater than the 8 percentregulatory standard. That is, the regulatory standard would induce risk-taking -- perhapsexcessive risk-taking.While regulatory arbitrage can be useful in negating improperly high regulatorycapital requirements, it can also be used to mask the true riskiness of the bank. In the UnitedStates, for example, the top 50 bank holding companies have a mean total risk-based capitalratio of 12.1 percent. The standard deviation of this ratio across the 50 institutions is only 0.8percent. In other words, everyone seems to be holding about the same amount of capital. Indeed,since a bank is declared to be “well-capitalized” when its total risk-based capital ratio is over 10percent, it is not surprising that we see no top-50 banking company with its ratio less than 10percent. But do all these banks have equally low insolvency probabilities? One simply can nottell much of anything by looking at capital ratios. It is perfectly possible that a bank may hold 12percent capital when a more carefully constructed internal risk model would call for holding 15percent, or even 18 percent, capital to meet the bank’s internal insolvency standard. Or, the bankcould have a great model, but simply have a preference for risk that is unacceptable toregulators. Such a bank may be holding risky positions for which even its own model would callfor more capital, if the bank were to adhere to a lower insolvency probability standard. For sucha bank, the regulatory “well-capitalized” designation may provide little comfort to supervisors orto the taxpayers we are supposed to protect. That is why, in this country, we have placed a greatemphasis on the bank-by-bank supervisory process, as opposed to the formal capital regulationsthat apply to all banks.Just as the most sophisticated large banks have gone through a rapid evolution oftheir risk measurement, management, and pricing systems, so must supervisors follow suit. Atthe Federal Reserve we have ongoing projects aimed at providing supervisors with better tools toassess banks’ internal risk systems and, ultimately, to make determinations regarding the realadequacy of bank capital on a case-by-case basis. Among these efforts is a review of the creditrisk aspects of asset securitization at our major banking companies. Also, we are studying thepossible uses within the supervisory process for the internal rating systems used by almost alllarge banks. In the past, supervisors made risk distinctions only among and between classifiedassets, not pass assets. Now, we are studying the possibility that future deterioration in assetquality can be foreseen to some extent by changes in the average rating, or the distribution ofratings, in a bank’s pass assets.We are also spending considerable effort in tracking and understanding thedevelopments in risk modelling, including the modelling of credit risk. At last week’sconference on bank capital, hosted by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Bankof Japan, our economists discussed the prospects of moving to a full-fledged, models-basedapproach to bank capital standards for the largest banks. In my personal view, moving from aratio-based capital standard to an internal models based standard for our most complexinstitutions, should be high on our agenda. For the first time, we would be setting a maximumBIS Review  17/1998
- 4 -insolvency probability standard rather than simply a minimum capital ratio. This may be theonly avenue before us if we wish to achieve an efficient regulatory system. In the absence of athorough revamping of the international capital standard, we will continue to be plagued byregulatory capital ratios that, on the one hand, say little about insolvency probability, while onthe other hand induce banks to engage in sometimes inefficient regulatory arbitrage simply toavoid an inherently uneconomic capital rule.Please do not misinterpret my remarks. I believe, like almost all risk practitioners,that there is no substitute for good human judgment and experience when making creditdecisions. Total reliance on models is neither feasible nor desirable. But failure to use the bestpossible tools at hand is to fall further and further behind the best-practice techniques of theindustry, with a resulting decline in risk-adjusted profitability and, inevitably, an increase ininsolvency probability. We must remember that any improvement in the accuracy with whichrisk is measured is tantamount to a reduction in risk. Continual improvements in riskmeasurement techniques, therefore, should be the norm for all banks that intend to play in theglobal financial marketplace. Institutions, and entire banking systems, that do not adhere to thisprinciple are doomed to repeat the blunders of the past.In this new world of financial complexity and globalization, it is extremelyimportant that the large institutions among the developed nations all strive to keep up with thebest-practice frontier. These institutions are the ones that are the price-leaders, the drivers ofmarkets locally and internationally. If a group of important institutions in only one or twocountries fails to keep pace with risk measurement practices, all banking systems are placed atrisk. This risk, moreover, is not simply that a large bank failure in one country can causecounterparty failures in other countries. Systematic under-pricing of credit and other risks can bedamaging to all players, not only to the bank making the pricing errors.Fortunately, the free-market mechanism for the dissemination of best-practicesappears to be functioning reasonably smoothly, at least in the global sense. No single developednation appears to have a monopoly on best-practice risk measurement techniques, if innovationsin complex financial products are any indication. For example, European banks were marketleaders in introducing CLOs, or collateralized loan obligations. In the field of asset-backedcommercial paper facilities, US banks were the initiators, but now European and Japaneseinstitutions are significant players. And the ubiquitous consulting firms around the world can berelied upon to spread the word of worthwhile advances in risk techniques.Still, the individual bank in each country must face the proper incentives to keepup with the most cost-effective risk techniques. Lax supervisory practices -- or, worse,government support of banks with poor risk practices -- do not provide these proper incentives.Thus, each supervisory authority in each developed nation must be ever vigilant that thedisparity between the world’s best-practice institutions and those large banks that are “inside”the best-practice frontier does not grow wider. Indeed, an important function of supervisors is toact as something of a clearinghouse for best practices. If the supervisor perceives a deficiency inpractice, it is his responsibility to engage the bank manager in a discussion as to whether theshortcoming really exists and, if so, how to fix it.I will conclude by reiterating the three points I made at the beginning. First, thereis a strong and dynamic thread running between regulation and market innovation. While theBasle Accord of 1988 was entirely appropriate to its time and circumstances, it is now clearly indanger of becoming outmoded by the pace of financial innovation. Conversely, the regulationBIS Review  17/1998
- 5 -has contributed to some market innovations that appear to be driven, if not solely, at leastprimarily by the need to engage in regulatory capital arbitrage.Second, the reality of globalization must be accounted for in designing andimplementing our regulatory and supervisory systems. Especially among developed nations, wecannot afford a growing disparity in the quality of risk practices at our important institutions, nora disparity in the quality of supervision of those institutions. As bankers like to say, the worstcompetitor is an uninformed competitor -- and that goes doubly for the competitor’s supervisor.Third, given that financial markets are constantly evolving, this means that ourregulatory framework must also continually evolve. The international capital standard has notchanged in basic form for almost a decade -- it is still a ratio-based rule. While it may still beadequate for the vast bulk of banking institutions, it clearly is inadequate for the world’s mostcomplex banks. For these institutions, high capital ratios do not necessarily equate with lowinsolvency probabilities. Thus, the ratio-based standard is inefficient in achieving thesupervisors’ objective of limiting bank failure to acceptable levels. Worse, it may be fosteringother inefficiencies in the banking system, to the extent the capital standard encouragesregulatory arbitrage that entails significant transaction costs.In the absence of any viable alternatives, it is my view that we should begin nowto plan for a models-based successor to the Accord. Inevitably, this will take a tremendouseffort, given the complexity of the subject and the differences across institutions and betweencountries. Moreover, a models-based system of capital regulation would require a degree ofcooperation among supervisors, quite apart from having similar written rules, that isunprecedented. But I believe the effort will be worth it.Thank you for the opportunity to air these concerns and I am looking forward tocontinuing the dialogue on this subject.BIS Review  17/1998
Mr. Greenspan discusses the role of capital in optimal banking supervision andregulation   Remarks by the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan,before the Conference on Capital Regulation in the 21st Century, held at the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York on 26/2/98.It is my pleasure to join President McDonough and our colleagues from the Bank ofJapan and the Bank of England in hosting this timely conference. Capital, of course, is a topic ofnever-ending importance to bankers and their counterparties, not to mention the regulators and centralbankers whose job it is to oversee the stability of the financial system. Moreover, this conferencecomes at a most critical and opportune time. As you are aware, the current structure of regulatorybank capital standards is under the most intense scrutiny since the deliberations leading to thewatershed Basle Accord of 1988 and the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991.In this tenth anniversary year of the Accord, its architects can look back with pride at therole played by the regulation in reversing the decades-long decline in bank capital cushions. At thetime the Accord was drafted, the use of differential risk weights to distinguish among broad assetcategories represented a truly innovative and, I believe, effective approach to formulating prudentialregulations. The risk-based capital rules also set the stage for the emergence of more generalrisk-based policies within the supervisory process.Of course, the focus of this conference is on the future of prudential capital standards. Inour deliberations we must therefore take note that observers both within the regulatory agencies andthe banking industry itself are raising warning flags about the current standard. These concernspertain to the rapid technological, financial, and institutional changes that are rendering the regulatorycapital framework less effectual, if not on the verge of becoming outmoded, with respect to ourlargest, most complex banking organizations. In particular, it is argued that the heightenedcomplexity of these large banks’ risk-taking activities, along with the expanding scope of regulatorycapital arbitrage, may cause capital ratios as calculated under the existing rules to becomeincreasingly misleading.I, too, share these concerns. In my remarks this evening, however, I would like to stepback from the technical discourse of the conference’s sessions and place these concerns within theirbroad historical and policy contexts. Specifically, I would like to highlight the evolutionary nature ofcapital regulation and then discuss the policy concerns that have arisen with respect to the currentcapital structure. I will end with some suggestions regarding basic principles for assessing possiblefuture changes to our system of prudential supervision and regulation.To begin, financial innovation is nothing new, and the rapidity of financial evolution isitself a relative concept -- what is “rapid” must be judged in the context of the degree of developmentof the economic and banking structure. Prior to World War II, banks in this country did not makecommercial real estate mortgages or auto loans. Prior to the 1960s, securitization, as an alternative tothe traditional “buy and hold” strategy of commercial banks, did not exist. Now, banks haveexpanded their securitization activities well beyond the mortgage programs of the 1970s and 1980s,to include almost all asset types, including corporate loans. And most recently, credit derivatives havebeen added to the growing list of financial products. Many of these products, which would have beenperceived as too risky for banks in earlier periods, are now judged to be safe owing to today’s moresophisticated risk measurement and containment systems. Both banking and regulation arecontinuously evolving disciplines, with the latter, of course, continuously adjusting to the former.Technological advances in computers and in telecommunications, together withtheoretical advances -- principally in option-pricing models -- have contributed to this proliferation ofever-more complex financial products. The increased product complexity, in turn, is often cited as theprimary reason why the Basle standard is in need of periodic restructuring. Indeed, the BasleBIS Review   16/1998
- 2 -standard, like the industry for which it is intended, has not stood still over the past ten years. Since itsinception, significant changes have been made on a regular basis to the Accord, including, mostvisibly, the use of banks’ internal models for assessing capital charges for market risk within tradingaccounts. All of these changes have been incorporated within a document that is now quite lengthy --and written in appropriately dense, regulatory style.While no one is in favor of regulatory complexity, we should be aware that capitalregulation will necessarily evolve over time as the banking and financial sectors themselves evolve.Thus, it should not be surprising that we constantly need to assess possible new approaches to oldproblems, even as new problems become apparent. Nor should the continual search for newregulatory procedures be construed as suggesting that existing policies were ill-suited to the times forwhich they were developed or will be ill-suited for those banking systems at an earlier stage ofdevelopment.Indeed, so long as we adhere in principle to a common prudential standard, it isappropriate that differing regulatory regimes may exist side by side at any point in time, respondingto differing conditions between banking systems or across individual banks within a single system.Perhaps the appropriate analogy is with computer-chip manufacturers. Even as the next generation ofchip is being planned, two or three generations of chip -- for example, Pentium IIs, Pentium Pros, andPentium MMXs -- are being marketed, while, at the same time, older generations of chip continue toperform yeoman duty within specific applications. Given evolving financial markets, the question isnot whether the Basle standard will be changed, but how and why each new round of change willoccur, and to which market segment it will apply.In overseeing this necessary evolution of the Accord, as it applies to the more advancedbanking systems, it would be helpful to address some of the basic issues that, in my view, have notbeen adequately addressed by the regulatory community. In so doing, perhaps we can shed some lighton the source of our present concerns with the existing capital standard. There really are only twoquestions here: First, how should bank “soundness” be defined and measured? Second, what shouldbe the minimum level of soundness set by regulators?When the Accord was being crafted, many supervisors may have had an implicit notionof what they meant by soundness -- they probably meant the likelihood of a bank becominginsolvent. While by no means the only one, this is a perfectly reasonable definition of soundness.Indeed, insolvency probability is the standard explicitly used within the internal risk measurementand capital allocation systems of our major banks. That is, many of the large banks explicitlycalculate the amount of capital they need in order to reduce to a targeted percentage the probability,over a given time horizon, that losses would exceed the allocated capital and drive the bank intoinsolvency.But whereas our largest banks have explicitly set their own, internal soundnessstandards, regulators really have not. Rather, the Basle Accord set a minimum capital ratio, not amaximum insolvency probability. Capital, being the difference between assets and liabilities, is ofcourse an abstraction. Thus, it was well understood at the time that the likelihood of insolvency isdetermined by the level of capital a bank holds, the maturities of its assets and liabilities, and theriskiness of its portfolio. In an attempt to relate capital requirements to risk, the Accord divided assetsinto four risk “buckets”, corresponding to minimum total capital requirements of zero percent, 1.6percent, 4.0 percent, and 8.0 percent, respectively. Indeed, much of the complexity of the formalcapital requirements arises from rules stipulating which risk positions fit into which of the fourcapital “buckets”.Despite the attempt to make capital requirements at least somewhat risk-based, the maincriticisms of the Accord, at least as applied to the activities of our largest, most complex bankingBIS Review   16/1998
- 3 -organizations, appear to be warranted. In particular, I would note three: First, the formal capital ratiorequirements, because they do not flow from any particular insolvency probability standard, are, forthe most part, arbitrary. All corporate loans, for example, are placed into a single 8 percent “bucket”.Second, the requirements account for credit risk and market risk, but not explicitly for operating andother forms of risk that may also be important. Third, except for trading account activities, the capitalstandards do not take account of hedging, diversification, and differences in risk managementtechniques, especially portfolio management.These deficiencies were understood even as the Accord was being crafted. Indeed, it wasin response to these concerns that, for much of the 1990s, regulatory agencies have focused onimproving supervisory oversight of capital adequacy on a bank-by-bank basis. In recent years, thefocus of supervisory efforts in the United States has been on the internal risk measurement andmanagement processes of banks. This emphasis on internal processes has been driven partly by theneed to make supervisory policies more risk-focused in light of the increasing complexity of bankingactivities. In addition, this approach reinforces market incentives that have prompted banksthemselves to invest heavily in recent years to improve their management information systems andinternal systems for quantifying, pricing, and managing risk.While it is appropriate that supervisory procedures evolve to encompass the changes inindustry practices, we must also be sure that improvements in both the form and content of the formalcapital regulations keep pace. Inappropriate regulatory capital standards, whether too low or too highin specific circumstances, can entail significant economic costs. This resource allocation effect ofcapital regulations is seen most clearly by comparing the Basle standard with the internal “economiccapital” allocation processes of some of our largest banking companies. For internal purposes, theselarge institutions attempt explicitly to quantify their credit, market, and operating risks, by estimatingloss probability distributions for various risk positions. Enough economic, as distinct from regulatory,capital is then allocated to each risk position to satisfy the institution’s own standard for insolvencyprobability. Within credit risk models, for example, capital for internal purposes often is allocated soas to hypothetically “cover” 99.9 percent or more of the estimated loss probability distribution.These internal capital allocation models have much to teach the supervisor, and arecritical to understanding the possible misallocative effects of inappropriate capital rules. For example,while the Basle standard lumps all corporate loans into the 8 percent capital “bucket”, the banks’internal capital allocations for individual loans vary considerably -- from less than 1 percent to wellover 30 percent -- depending on the estimated riskiness of the position in question. In the case wherea group of loans attracts an internal capital charge that is very low compared to the Basle eightpercent standard, the bank has a strong incentive to undertake regulatory capital arbitrage to structurethe risk position in a manner that allows it to be reclassified into a lower regulatory risk category. Atpresent, securitization is, without a doubt, the major tool used by large U.S. banks to engage in sucharbitrage.Regulatory capital arbitrage, I should emphasize, is not necessarily undesirable. In manycases, regulatory capital arbitrage acts as a safety-valve for attenuating the adverse effects of thoseregulatory capital requirements that are well in excess of the levels warranted by a specific activity’sunderlying economic risk. Absent such arbitrage, a regulatory capital requirement that isinappropriately high for the economic risk of a particular activity, could cause a bank to exit thatrelatively low-risk business, by preventing the bank from earning an acceptable rate of return on itscapital. That is, arbitrage may appropriately lower the effective capital requirements against somesafe activities that banks would otherwise be forced to drop by the effects of regulation.It is clear that our major banks have become quite efficient at engaging in such desirableforms of regulatory capital arbitrage, through securitization and other devices. However, sucharbitrage is not costless and therefore not without implications for resource allocation. Interestingly,BIS Review   16/1998
- 4 -one reason why the formal capital standards do not include very many risk “buckets” is thatregulators did not want to influence how banks make resource allocation decisions. Ironically, the“one-size-fits-all” standard does just that, by forcing the bank into expending effort to negate thecapital standard, or to exploit it, whenever there is a significant disparity between the relativelyarbitrary standard and internal, economic capital requirements.The inconsistencies between internally required economic capital and the regulatorycapital standard create another type of problem -- nominally high regulatory capital ratios can be usedto mask the true level of insolvency probability. For example, consider the case where the bank’sown risk analysis calls for a 15 percent internal economic capital assessment against its portfolio. Ifthe bank actually holds 12 percent capital, it would, in all likelihood, be deemed to be“well-capitalized” in a regulatory sense, even though it might be undercapitalized in the economicsense.The possibility that regulatory capital ratios may mask true insolvency probabilitybecomes more acute as banks arbitrage away inappropriately high capital requirements on their safestassets, by removing these assets from the balance sheet via securitization. The issue is not solelywhether capital requirements on the bank’s residual risk in the securitized assets are appropriate. Weshould also be concerned with the sufficiency of regulatory capital requirements on the assetsremaining on the book. In the extreme, such “cherry-picking” would result in only those assets left onthe balance sheet for which economic capital allocations are greater than the 8 percent regulatorystandard.Given these difficulties with the one-size-fits-all nature of our current capital regulations,it is understandable that calls have arisen for reform of the Basle standard. It is, however, prematureto try to predict exactly how the next generation of prudential standards will evolve. One set ofpossibilities revolves around market-based tools and incentives. Indeed, as banks’ internal riskmeasurement and management technologies improve, and as the depth and sophistication of financialmarkets increase, bank supervisors should continually find ways to incorporate market advances intotheir prudential policies, where appropriate. Two potentially promising applications of this principlehave been discussed at this conference. One is the use of internal credit risk models as a possiblesubstitute for, or complement to, the current structure of ratio-based capital regulations. Anotherapproach goes one step further and uses market-like incentives to reward and encourageimprovements in internal risk measurement and management practices. A primary example is theproposed pre-commitment approach to setting capital requirements for bank trading activities. I mightadd that pre-commitment of capital is designed to work only for the trading account, not the bankingbook, and then only for strong, well-managed organizations.Proponents of an internal-models-based approach to capital regulations may be on theright track, but at this moment of regulatory development it would seem that a full-fledged,bank-wide, internal-models approach could require a very substantial amount of time and effort todevelop. In a paper given earlier today by Federal Reserve Board economists David Jones and JohnMingo, the authors enumerate their concerns over the reliability of the current generation of creditrisk models. They go on to suggest, however, that these models may, over time, provide a basis forsetting future regulatory capital requirements. Even in the shorter term, they argue, elements ofinternal credit risk models may prove useful within the supervisory process.Still other approaches are of course possible, including some combination ofmarket-based and traditional, ratio-based approaches to prudential regulation. But regardless of whathappens in this next stage, as I noted earlier, any new capital standard is itself likely to be supercededwithin a continuing process of evolving prudential regulations. Just as manufacturing companiesfollow a product planning cycle, bank regulators can expect to begin working on still anotherBIS Review   16/1998
- 5 -generation of prudential policies even as proposed modifications to the current standard are beingreleased for public comment.In looking ahead, supervisors should, at a minimum, be aware of the increasingsophistication with which banks are responding to the existing regulatory framework and should nowbegin active discussions on the necessary modifications. In anticipation of such discussions, I wouldlike to conclude by focusing on what I believe should be several core principles underlying anyproposed changes to our current system of prudential regulation and supervision.First, a reasonable principle for setting regulatory soundness standards is to act much asthe market would if there were no safety net and all market participants were fully informed. Forexample, requiring all of our regulated financial institutions to maintain insolvency probabilities thatare equivalent to a triple-A rating standard would be demonstrably too stringent, because there arevery few such entities among unregulated financial institutions not subject to the safety net. That is,the markets are telling us that the value of the financial firm is not, in general, maximized at defaultprobabilities reflected in triple-A ratings. This suggests, in turn, that regulated financialintermediaries can not maximize their value to the overall economy if they are forced to operate atunreasonably high soundness levels.Nor should we require individual banks to hold capital in amounts sufficient to fullyprotect against those rare systemic events which, in any event, may render standard probabilityevaluation moot. The management of systemic risk is properly the job of the central banks. Individualbanks should not be required to hold capital against the possibility of overall financial breakdown.Indeed, central banks, by their existence, appropriately offer a form of catastrophe insurance to banksagainst such events.Conversely, permitting regulated institutions that benefit from the safety net to take riskypositions that, in the absence of the net, would earn them junk-bond ratings for their liabilities, isclearly inappropriate. In such a world, our goals of protecting taxpayers and reducing themisallocative effects of the safety net simply would not be realized. Ultimately, the setting ofsoundness standards should achieve a complex balance -- remembering that the goals of prudentialregulation should be weighed against the need to permit banks to perform their essential risk-takingactivities. Thus, capital standards should be structured to reflect the lines of business and degree ofrisk-taking in which the individual bank chooses to engage.A second principle should be to continue linking strong supervisory analysis andjudgment with rational regulatory standards. In a banking environment characterized by continuingtechnological advances, this means placing an emphasis on constantly improving our supervisorytechniques. In the context of bank capital adequacy, supervisors increasingly must be able to assesssophisticated internal credit risk measurement systems, as well as gauge the impact of the continueddevelopment in securitization and credit derivative markets. It is critical that supervisors incorporate,where practical, the risk analysis tools being developed and used on a daily basis within the bankingindustry itself. If we do not use the best analytical tools available, and place these tools in the handsof highly trained and motivated supervisory personnel, then we cannot hope to supervise under ourbasic principle -- supervision as if there were no safety net.Third, we have no choice but to continue to plan for a successor to the simplerisk-weighting approach to capital requirements embodied within the current regulatory standard.While it is unclear at present exactly what that successor might be, it seems clear that adding moreand more layers of arbitrary regulation would be counter productive. We should, rather, look forways to harness market tools and market-like incentives wherever possible, by using banks’ ownpolicies, behaviors, and technologies in improving the supervisory process.BIS Review   16/1998
- 6 -Finally, we should always remind ourselves that supervision and regulation are neitherinfallible nor likely to prove sufficient to meet all our intended goals. Put another way, the Baslestandard and the bank examination process, even if both are structured in optimal fashion, are asecond line of support for bank soundness. Supervision and regulation can never be a substitute for abank’s own internal scrutiny of its counterparties, as well as the market’s scrutiny of the bank.Therefore, we should not, for example, abandon efforts to contain the scope of the safety net, or topress for increases in the quantity and quality of financial disclosures by regulated institutions.If we follow these basic prescriptions, I suspect that history will look favorably on ourattempts at crafting regulatory policy.BIS Review   16/1998
Mr. Greenspan presents the Federal Reserve’s semi-annual Humphrey Hawkinsmonetary policy testimony and report to the US Congress   Testimony of the Chairman of theBoard of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the US Congress on 24/2/98.Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee,I welcome this opportunity to present the Federal Reserve’s semi-annual report oneconomic conditions and the conduct of monetary policy.The US Economy in 1997The US economy delivered another exemplary performance in 1997. Over the fourquarters of last year, real GDP expanded close to 4 percent, its fastest annual increase in ten years. Toproduce that higher output, about 3 million Americans joined the nation’s payrolls, in the processcontributing to a reduction in the unemployment rate to 4¾ percent, its lowest sustained level sincethe late 1960s. And our factories were working more intensively too: Industrial production increased5¾ percent last year, exceeding robust additions to capacity.Those gains were shared widely. The hourly wage and salary structure rose about 4percent, fueling impressive increases in personal incomes. Unlike some prior episodes when fasterwage rate increases mainly reflected attempts to make up for more rapidly rising prices of goods andservices, the fatter paychecks that workers brought home represented real increments to purchasingpower. Measured consumer price inflation came in at 1¾ percent over the twelve months of 1997,down about 1½ percentage points from the pace of the prior year. While swings in the prices of foodand fuel contributed to this decline, both narrower price indexes excluding those items and broaderones including all goods and services produced in the United States also paint a portrait of continuedprogress toward price stability. Businesses, for the most part, were able to pay these higher realwages while still increasing their earnings. Although aggregate data on profits for all of 1997 are notyet available, corporate profit margins most likely remained in an elevated range not seen consistentlysince the 1960s. These healthy gains in earnings and the expectations of more to come providedimportant support to the equity market, with most major stock price indexes gaining more than 20percent over the year.The strong growth of the real income of workers and corporations is not unrelated tothe economy’s continued good performance on inflation. Taken together, recent evidence supportsthe view that such low inflation, as closely approaching price stability as we have known in theUnited States in three decades, engenders many benefits. When changes in the general price level aresmall and predictable, households and firms can plan more securely for the future. The perception ofreduced risk encourages investment. Low inflation also exerts a discipline on costs, fostering effortsto enhance productivity. Productivity is the ultimate source of rising standards of living, and wewitnessed a notable pickup in this measure in the past two years.The robust economy has facilitated the efforts of the Congress and the Administrationto restore balance in the unified federal budget. As I have indicated to the Congress on numerousoccasions, moving beyond this point and putting the budget in significant surplus would be the surestand most direct way of increasing national saving. In turn, higher national saving, by promotinglower real long-term interest rates, helps spur spending to outfit American firms and their workerswith the modern equipment they need to compete successfully on world markets. We have seen apartial down payment of the benefits of better budget balance already: It seems reasonable to assumethat the decline in longer-term Treasury yields last year owed, in part, to reduced competition --current and prospective -- from the federal government for scarce private saving. However, additionaleffort remains to be exerted to address the effects on federal entitlement spending of the looming shiftwithin the next decade in the nation’s retirement demographics.BIS Review   15/1998
- 2 -As I noted earlier, our nation has been experiencing a higher growth rate ofproductivity -- output per hour worked -- in recent years. The dramatic improvements in computingpower and communication and information technology appear to have been a major force behind thisbeneficial trend. Those innovations, together with fierce competitive pressures in our high-techindustries to make them available to as many homes, offices, stores, and shop floors as possible, haveproduced double-digit annual reductions in prices of capital goods embodying new technologies.Indeed, many products considered to be at the cutting edge of technology as recently as two to threeyears ago have become so standardized and inexpensive that they have achieved near “ commodity”status, a development that has allowed businesses to accelerate their accumulation of more and bettercapital.Critical to this process has been the rapidly increasing efficiency of our financialmarkets -- itself a product of the new technologies and of significant market deregulation over theyears. Capital now flows with relatively little friction to projects embodying new ideas. SiliconValley is a tribute both to American ingenuity and to the financial system’s ever-increasing ability tosupply venture capital to the entrepreneurs who are such a dynamic force in our economy.With new high-tech tools, American businesses have shaved transportation costs,managed their production and use of inventories more efficiently, and broadened marketopportunities. The threat of rising costs in tight labor markets has imparted a substantial impetus toefforts to take advantage of possible efficiencies. In my Humphrey-Hawkins testimony last July, Idiscussed the likelihood that the sharp acceleration in capital investment in advanced technologiesbeginning in 1993 reflected synergies of new ideas, embodied in increasingly inexpensive newequipment, that have elevated expected returns and have broadened investment opportunities.More recent evidence remains consistent with the view that this capital spending hascontributed to a noticeable pickup in productivity -- and probably by more than can be explained byusual business cycle forces. For one, the combination of continued low inflation and stable to risingdomestic profit margins implies quite subdued growth in total consolidated unit business costs. Withlabor costs constituting more than two-thirds of those costs and labor compensation per houraccelerating, productivity must be growing faster, and that step-up must be roughly in line with theincrease in compensation growth. For another, our more direct observations on output per hourroughly tend to confirm that productivity has picked up significantly in recent years, although howmuch the ongoing trend of productivity has risen remains an open question.The acceleration in productivity, however, has been exceeded by the strengthening ofdemand for goods and services. As a consequence, employers had to expand payrolls at a pace wellin excess of the growth of the working age population that profess a desire for a job, including newimmigrants. As I pointed out last year in testimony before the Congress, that gap has beenaccommodated by declines in both the officially unemployed and those not actively seeking work butdesirous of working. The number of people in those two categories decreased at a rate of about onemillion per year on average over the last four years. By December 1997, the sum had declined to aseasonally adjusted 10½ million, or 6 percent of the working age population, the lowest ratio sincedetailed information on this series first became available in 1970. Anecdotal information fromsurveys of our twelve Reserve Banks attests to our ever tightening labor markets.Rapidly rising demand for labor has had enormous beneficial effects on our workforce. Previously low- or unskilled workers have been drawn into the job market and have obtainedtraining and experience that will help them even if they later change jobs. Large numbers ofunderemployed have been moved up the career ladder to match their underlying skills, and manywelfare recipients have been added to payrolls as well, to the benefit of their long-term job prospects.BIS Review   15/1998
- 3 -The recent acceleration of wages likely has owed in part to the ever-tightening labormarket and in part to rising productivity growth, which, through competition, induces firms to granthigher wages. It is difficult at this time, however, to disentangle the relative contributions of thesefactors. What is clear is that, unless demand growth softens or productivity growth accelerates evenmore, we will gradually run out of new workers who can be profitably employed. It is not possible totell how many more of the 6 percent of the working-age population who want to work but do nothave jobs can be added to payrolls. A significant number are so-called frictionally unemployed, asthey have left one job but not yet chosen to accept another. Still others have chosen to work in only alimited geographic area where their skills may not be needed.Should demand for new workers continue to exceed new supply, we would expectwage gains increasingly to exceed productivity growth, squeezing profit margins and eventuallyleading to a pickup in inflation. Were a substantial pickup in inflation to occur, it could, by stuntingeconomic growth, reverse much of the remarkable labor market progress of recent years. I will bediscussing our assessment of these and other possibilities and their bearing on the outlook for 1998shortly.Monetary Policy in 1997History teaches us that monetary policy has been its most effective when it has beenpre-emptive. The lagging relationship between the Federal Reserve’s policy instrument and spending,and, even further removed, inflation, implies that if policy actions are delayed until prices begin topick up, they will be too late to fend off at least some persistent price acceleration and attendanteconomic instabilities. Preemptive policymaking is keyed to judging how widespread are emerginginflationary forces, and when, and to what degree, those forces will be reflected in actual inflation.For most of last year, the evident strains on resources were sufficiently severe to steer the FederalOpen Market Committee (FOMC) toward being more inclined to tighten than to ease monetarypolicy. Indeed, in March, when it became apparent that strains on resources seemed to beintensifying, the FOMC imposed modest incremental restraint, raising its intended federal funds rate¼ percentage point, to 5½ percent.We did not increase the federal funds rate again during the summer and fall, despitefurther tightening of the labor market. Even though the labor market heated up and laborcompensation rose, measured inflation fell, owing to the appreciation of the dollar, weakness ininternational commodity prices, and faster productivity growth. Those restraining forces were moreevident in goods-price inflation, which in the CPI slowed substantially to only about ½ percent in1997, than on service-price inflation, which moderated much less -- to around 3 percent. Providers ofservices appeared to be more pressed by mounting strains in labor markets. Hourly wages andsalaries in service-producing sectors rose 4½ percent last year, up considerably from the prior yearand almost 1½ percentage points faster than in goods-producing sectors. However, a significantportion of that differential, but by no means all, traced to commissions in the financial and real estateservices sector related to one-off increases in transactions prices and in volumes of activity, ratherthan to increases in the underlying wage structure.Although the nominal federal funds rate was maintained after March, the apparentdrop in inflation expectations over the balance of 1997 induced some firming in the stance ofmonetary policy by one important measure -- the real federal funds rate, or the nominal federal fundsrate less a proxy for inflation expectations. Some analysts have dubbed the contribution of thereduction in inflation expectations to raising the real federal funds rate a “ passive”  tightening, in thatit increased the amount of monetary policy restraint in place without an explicit vote by the FOMC.While the tightening may have been passive in that sense, it was by no means inadvertent. Membersof the FOMC took some comfort in the upward trend of the real federal funds rate over the year andthe rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar because such additional restraint was viewed asBIS Review   15/1998
- 4 -appropriate given the strength of spending and building strains on labor resources. They alsorecognized that in virtually all other respects financial markets remained quite accommodative and,indeed, judging by the rise in equity prices, were providing additional impetus to domestic spending.The Outlook for 1998There can be no doubt that domestic demand retained considerable momentum at theoutset of this year. Production and employment have been on a strong uptrend in recent months.Confident households, enjoying gains in income and wealth and benefitting from the reductions inintermediate- and longer-term interest rates to date, should continue to increase their spending. Firmsshould find financing available on relatively attractive terms to fund profitable opportunities toenhance efficiency by investing in new capital equipment. By itself, this strength in spending wouldseem to presage intensifying pressures in labor markets and on prices. Yet, the outlook for totalspending on goods and services produced in the United States is less assured of late because of stormclouds massing over the Western Pacific and heading our way.This is not the place to examine in detail what triggered the initial problems in Asianfinancial markets and why the subsequent deterioration has been so extreme. I covered that subjectrecently before several committees of the Congress. Rather, I shall confine my discussion thismorning to the likely consequences of the Asian crisis for demand and inflation in the United States.With the crisis curtailing the financing available in foreign currencies, many Asianeconomies have had no choice but to cut back their imports sharply. Disruptions to their financialsystems and economies more generally will further damp demands for our exports of goods andservices. American exports should be held down as well by the appreciation of the dollar, which willmake the prices of competing goods produced abroad more attractive, just as foreign-produced goodswill be relatively more attractive to buyers here at home. As a result, we can expect a worsening netexport position to exert a discernible drag on total output in the United States. For a time, suchrestraint might be reinforced by a reduced willingness of US firms to accumulate inventories as theyforesee weaker demand ahead.The forces of Asian restraint could well be providing another, more direct offset toinflationary impulses arising domestically in the United States. In the wake of weakness in Asianeconomies and of lagged effects of the appreciation of the dollar more generally, the dollar prices ofour non-oil imports are likely to decline further in the months ahead. These lower import prices areapparently already making domestic producers hesitant to raise their own prices for fear of losingmarket share, further contributing to the restraint on overall prices. Lesser demands for raw materialson the part of Asian economies as their activity slows should help to keep world commodity pricesdenominated in dollars in check. Import and commodity prices, however, will restrain US inflationonly as long as they continue to fall, or to rise at a slower rate than the pace of overall domesticproduct prices.The key question going forward is whether the restraint building from the turmoil inAsia will be sufficient to check inflationary tendencies that might otherwise result from the strengthof domestic spending and tightening labor markets. The depth of the adjustment abroad will dependon the extent of weakness in the financial sectors of Asian economies and the speed with whichstructural inefficiencies in the financial and nonfinancial sectors of those economies are corrected. If,as we suspect, the restraint coming from Asia is sufficient to bring the demand for American laborback into line with the growth of the working-age population desirous of working, labor markets willremain unusually tight, but any intensification of inflation should be delayed, very gradual, andreadily reversible. However, we cannot rule out two other, more worrisome possibilities. On the onehand, should the momentum to domestic spending not be offset significantly by Asian or otherdevelopments, the US economy would be on a track along which spending could press too stronglyBIS Review   15/1998
- 5 -against available resources to be consistent with contained inflation. On the other, we also need to bealert to the possibility that the forces from Asia might damp activity and prices by more than isdesirable by exerting a particularly forceful drag on the volume of net exports and the prices ofimports.When confronted at the beginning of this month with these, for the moment, finelybalanced, though powerful forces, the members of the Federal Open Market Committee decided thatmonetary policy should most appropriately be kept on hold. With the continuation of a remarkableseven-year expansion at stake and so little precedent to go by, the range of our intelligence gatheringin the weeks ahead must be wide and especially inclusive of international developments.The Forecasts of the Governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the Presidents of the FederalReserve Banks.In these circumstances, the forecasts of the governors of the Federal Reserve Boardand presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks for the performance of the US economy over this yearare more tentative than usual. Based on information available through the first week of February,monetary policymakers were generally of the view that moderate economic growth is likely in store.The growth rate of real GDP is most commonly seen as between 2 and 2¾ percent over the fourquarters of 1998. Given the strong performance of real GDP, these projections envisage theunemployment rate remaining in the low range of the past half year. Inflation, as measured by thefour-quarter percent change in the consumer price index, is expected to be 1¾ to 2¼ percent in1998 -- near the low rate recorded in 1997. This outlook embodies the expectation that the effects ofcontinuing tightness in labor markets will be largely offset by technical adjustments shaving a coupletenths from the published CPI, healthy productivity growth, flat or declining import prices, and littlepressure in commodity markets. But the policymakers’ forecasts also reflect their determination tohold the line on inflation.The Ranges for the Debt and Monetary AggregatesThe FOMC affirmed the provisional ranges for the monetary aggregates in 1998 thatit had selected last July, which, once again, encompass the growth rates associated with conditions ofapproximate price stability, provided that these aggregates act in accord with their pre-1990shistorical relationships with nominal income and interest rates. These ranges are identical to thosethat had prevailed for 1997 -- 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 2 to 6 percent for M3. The FOMC alsoreaffirmed its range of 3 to 7 percent for the debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors for this year. Ishould caution, though, that the expectations of the governors and Reserve Bank presidents for theexpansion of nominal GDP in 1998 suggest that growth of M2 in the upper half of its benchmarkrange is a distinct possibility this year. Given the continuing strength of bank credit, M3 might evenbe above its range as depositories use liabilities in this aggregate to fund loan growth and securitiesacquisitions. Nonfinancial debt should come in around the middle portion of its range. In the first partof the 1990s, money growth diverged from historical relationships with income and interest rates, inpart as savers diversified into bond and stock mutual funds, which had become more readily availableand whose returns were considerably more attractive than those on deposits. This anomalousbehavior of velocity severely set back most analysts’ confidence in the usefulness of M2 as anindicator of economic developments. In recent years, there have been tentative signs that thehistorical relationship linking the velocity of M2 -- measured as the ratio of nominal GDP to themoney stock -- to the cost of holding M2 assets was reasserting itself. However, a persistent residualupward drift in velocity over the past few years and its apparent cessation very recently underscoresour ongoing uncertainty about the stability of this relationship. The FOMC will continue to observethe evolution of the monetary and credit aggregates carefully, integrating information about thesevariables with a wide variety of other information in determining its policy stance.BIS Review   15/1998
- 6 -Uncertainty about the OutlookWith the current situation reflecting a balance of strong countervailing forces, eventsin the months ahead are not likely to unfold smoothly. In that regard, I would like to flag a few areasof concern about the economy beyond those mentioned already regarding Asian developments.Without doubt, lenders have provided important support to spending in the past fewyears by their willingness to transact at historically small margins and in large volumes. Equityinvestors have contributed as well by apparently pricing in the expectation of substantial earningsgains and requiring modest compensation for the risk that those expectations could be mistaken.Approaching the eighth year of the economic expansion, this is understandable in an economicenvironment that, contrary to historical experience, has become increasingly benign. Businesses havebeen meeting obligations readily and generating high profits, putting them in outstanding financialhealth.But we must be concerned about becoming too complacent about evaluatingrepayment risks. All too often at this stage of the business cycle, the loans that banks extend latermake up a disproportionate share of total nonperforming loans. In addition, quite possibly, twelve oreighteen months hence, some of the securities purchased on the market could be looked upon withsome regret by investors. As one of the nation’s bank supervisors, the Federal Reserve will makeevery effort to encourage banks to apply sound underwriting standards in their lending. Prudentlenders should consider a wide range of economic situations in evaluating credit; to do otherwisewould risk contributing to potentially disruptive financial problems down the road.A second area of concern involves our nation’s continuing role in the new high-techinternational financial system. By joining with our major trading partners and international financialinstitutions in helping to stabilize the economies of Asia and promoting needed structural changes,we are also encouraging the continued expansion of world trade and global economic and financialstability on which the ongoing increase of our own standards of living depends. If we were to cedeour role as a world leader, or backslide into protectionist policies, we would threaten the source ofmuch of our own sustained economic growth.A third risk is complacency about inflation prospects. The combination andinteraction of significant increases in productivity-improving technologies, sharp declines in budgetdeficits, and disciplined monetary policy has damped product price changes, bringing them to nearstability. While part of this result owes to good policy, part is the product of the fortuitous emergenceof new technologies and of some favorable price developments in imported goods. However, ashistory counsels, it is unwise to count on any string of good fortune to continue indefinitely. At thesame time, though, it is also instructive to remember the words of an old sage that “luck is the residueof design”. He meant that to some degree we can deliberately put ourselves in position to experiencegood fortune and be better prepared when misfortune strikes. For example, the 1970s were marked bytwo major oil-price shocks and a significant depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar. Butthose misfortunes were, in part, the result of allowing imbalances to build over the decade aspolicymakers lost hold of the anchor provided by price stability. Some of what we now see helpingrein in inflation pressures is more likely to occur in an environment of stable prices and priceexpectations that thwarts producers from indiscriminately passing on higher costs, puts a premium onproductivity enhancement, and rewards more effectively investment in physical and human capital.Simply put, while the pursuit of price stability does not rule out misfortune, it lowersits probability. If firms are convinced that the general price level will remain stable, they will reserveincreases in their sales prices of goods and services as a last resort, for fear that such increases couldmean loss of market share. Similarly, if households are convinced of price stability, they will not seevariations in relative prices as reasons to change their long-run inflation expectations. Thus,BIS Review   15/1998

Mr. Heikensten answers eight questions on monetary policy in SwedenSpeech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at The EconomicsAssociation in Umeå on 19/2/98.IntroductionDuring the 1990s monetary policy has been the subject of intensive discussion.This is not surprising, given the serious crisis in the Swedish economy at the beginning of thedecade and the role that monetary policy played both then and as the crisis was building up.Since that time, monetary policy has had an explicit role to safeguard independently the value ofmoney – a role that is new in Sweden in the post-war period. With a floating exchange rate, thedecisions currently made by the Riksbank on its instrumental rate are very real and important tothe behaviour of households and businesses and to economic growth.The monetary policy discussion has evolved over time. Questions and statementsabout monetary policy’s basic objective of price stability that were very frequent a couple ofyears ago are less so today. Understanding of the Riksbank’s actions seems to have increased.We are presently trying to evaluate this by asking the public how it views the Riksbank’s workand by following the media and newsletters written by the market’s players. It is also possible toform an opinion based on the market’s reactions to changes in the instrumental rates as towhether the policy is understandable.In spite of the fact that knowledge and understanding of the Riksbank’s policyhave gradually increased, I believe that from time to time there is a need to explain the basis forthe policy and some of the principles that guide it today. The purpose of today’s speech is justthat. I will endeavour to answer seven of the questions that I have encountered most often inrecent years at meetings and in editorials and commentaries and that seem to permeate thediscussion of monetary policy continually. By way of conclusion I will comment on an eighthquestion.Question 1:  Why is low inflation good?The experiences of previous decades in Sweden and a number of internationalexamples show that high inflation is associated with economic costs.  Moreover significant costsensue when one is compelled to gear down from high to low inflation – something that sooner orlater always happens.It has been shown that high inflation is often associated with sharp fluctuations inthe relative prices of goods. Rapid and abrupt price changes create uncertainty about the futurefor all the actors in the economy.  It simply becomes more difficult to make long-rangedecisions. Households and businesses are compelled in practice to take greater risks and boththen demand higher interest and profits. This reasoning is supported by research, which indicatesthat the growth rate of the economy may be lower, because the increased uncertainty reducesinvestment activity.  In addition the risk of making erroneous investments increases.(Diagram 1. CPI and Growth)That Sweden in the 1970s and 1980s lost so much ground in terms of prosperityin relation to many other European countries is certainly due in part to the stabilisation policythen being conducted. Prices and wages were allowed to drive each other up, while budgetpolicy was far too weak.

- 2 -High inflation also leads to arbitrary changes in the distribution of income andwealth in society. Wages and profits normally rise at the same rate as inflation. The value of realestate and some financial investments rises even faster.  At the same time nominal fixed interestrates and transfers lag behind. The high profits made by the owners of houses and co-operativesin the 1970s and 1980s occurred in practice at the expense of tenants and those with banksavings. Between 1971 and 1974, for example, house prices rose by 50 per cent and agriculturalproperty by 80 per cent. In contrast those who had their savings in bonds or in the bank saw theirassets shrink by about a third in real terms.CPI and Growth Index: 1970=100Growth 1997-1998 OECD forecastGermanySwedenAustriaNetherlands50150250350450550650707274767880828486889092949650150250350450550650GermanySwedenAustriaNetherlandsSources: Statistics Sweden and OECD9011013015017019021070727476788082848688909294969890110130150170190210The problems are amplified by a regime of taxes and subsidies that are wholly orpartly indexed.

- 3 -behaviour of businesses and households is negatively affected by taxes and subsidies incombination with a high rate of inflation. Many good examples of this can be found in theSweden of the 1970s and 1980s. The American economist Martin Feldstein has estimated that ifinflation increases from 0 to 2 per cent, then the economic costs in the United States will amountto the equivalent of 1 per cent of GDP, principally as a consequence of the disruption caused bythe interaction between the tax regime and inflation.Let me conclude the answer to this first question by emphasising that myreasoning is anything but new, even if some of the examples are, and there is new empiricalresearch to rely on. The Swedish Trade Union economist Gösta Rehn argued in the 1950s and1960s that full-employment policies must be combined with a tight demand policy. Wageformation could function well only if demand was restrained and the rules of the game wereobvious. He also waged a battle for many decades against inflation for reasons of distributionunder the slogan, “Hate inflation”. Substantial, arbitrary changes in income and wealth pose athreat to “the cement” in our society and thereby to the democratic system.Question 2:  Why has inflation been allowed?Average inflation in Sweden has been low over a very long-term perspective.That changed after the Second World War, both in Sweden and in the majority of otherindustrial countries. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, inflation was on a rising trend and atthe same time fluctuated considerably. Not until the 1980s was the growth in prices stabilised inmany parts of the western world. In Sweden, this stabilisation has come about in the 1990s.(Diagram 2.

Whywas there not a tighter policy all along the line to restrain inflation? Developments in otherBIS Review   14/1998
- 4 -countries of the western world appear about the same. This indicates that there is a commonexplanation.It is clear that economic thought has shifted in recent decades and the shift in theprice level trends that coincided with the Keynesian approach (which was not infrequently agrossly exaggerated interpretation of what Keynes himself had written or said) had a dominantinfluence on economic policy. The ambition to stabilise the economy and create fullemployment using economic policy tools grew stronger and stronger. For a long time it wasbelieved that by allowing inflation to rise a little higher, less unemployment could be ‘bought’.Both actual developments up until the 1970s and the theory then prevalent supported thisapproach.This picture of how the economy functioned was modified in the 1970s. Theeconomies in many western countries at that time evinced both high inflation and highunemployment. In fairness it should also be mentioned however that the oil price shocks alsocontributed to the high inflation that decade; not all problems were a consequence of the failuresof stabilisation policy.Now most economists and political decision-makers accept that only in the shortterm is there a trade-off between inflation and employment. Real wages can be reduced owing tounexpected inflation and employment will thereby be stimulated. But when this pattern isrecognised – as will very likely happen after a while – inflation expectations adjust to the new,higher inflation rate. Then the positive effect on growth disappears and employment reverts toits previous level. All that remains is a higher rate of inflation. In other words, in the long termthere is normally no positive relationship between employment and inflation. Insteademployment in the long term is decided by such conditions in the real economy as technologicaland population developments or labour market efficiency.However the temptation to use monetary policy to stimulate employment stillexists. Even for a government that knows that the long-term effects of increasing demand a littletoo much are undesirable, it can be tempting in the short run. The very fact that this possibilityexists has made it more difficult to instil confidence in a policy of low inflation. Even incountries in which the governments and the central banks have clearly switched to a policydirected at achieving price stability, concern about a recurrence may persist.  Such a concern isnot without costs to the economy. Households and businesses will reckon that there is a risk ofan increase in inflation. Consequently the interest rate level may be higher and economicdevelopment in general may be worse than what would have been possible if all the actors in theeconomy had had complete confidence in the anti-inflation policy.Question 3:  Why should central banks be independent?This problem of building confidence in the anti-inflation policy may explain whyin recent years many western countries have changed their legislation or in other ways havemade their central banks more independent. There are basically two problems: the temptation toresort to stimulating the economy in the short term may be too strong and inflation expectationsbecome built into the system and make the policy less effective. By giving the central bank anindependent status, the political decision-makers can demonstrate that they are serious abouttheir ambition to let monetary policy be conducted with a view to long-term goals.  In such away price stability can be combined with better economic development.BIS Review   14/1998
- 5 -There have been a good many studies showing that an independent position forthe central bank tends to have a favourable impact on inflation. In countries with relativelyindependent central banks – that is, in which the political regime has only limited possibilities toinfluence monetary policy immediately – the fight against inflation has been more successful.However this should not be over-interpreted; the problem of inflation neither can nor should besolved solely by a few simple changes in the law. The central bank’s position certainly dependson what the attitude to inflation is among the general public. It may very well be that incountries with a strong aversion to inflation, they have elected to give the central bank acomparatively independent position. (Diagram 3. The Relation Between a Central Bank’sDegree of Independence and Inflation)In Sweden the Riksbank has, in practice, had a very independent standing inrecent years, which compares quite favourably with that in other countries. This policy has alsohad a successful impact on price stability. This practice that has been developed has nowreceived support in the form of a broad multi-party agreement to strengthen the position of theRiksbank. The agreement has led to a bill, which the Government introduced last November.This bill provides, inter alia, for the price stability objective to be confirmed by law and for theRiksbank to have a management that can formulate monetary policy independently.The Relation Between a CentralBank’s Degree of Independenceand InflationDegree of  independenceSource: SOU (Govt official reports) 1993:20SWZGERJPNUSANLDBELCDADENFRAUKAUSNZLDSPITASWE02468101214012345It should be stressed that an independent position for the Riksbank is not the samething as a monetary policy conducted without democratic control. The monetary policy objectivehas been made law by those who are popularly elected. It is making the objective operationalBIS Review   14/1998
- 6 -and the ongoing work to secure the goal decided by the Riksdag that has been delegated to theRiksbank.Question 4:  Why 2 per cent?The question of how the monetary policy objective should be made operationalhas several dimensions. By selecting a clear objective for monetary policy, it is possible tomonitor and evaluate it in an effective way. This is especially important when the Riksbank isbeing given an independent status. A clearly defined inflation objective also has the advantage ofbeing able to function as an “anchor” for households’ and businesses’ expectations. Thisfunction alone can be an important feature, not least when a regime of low inflation is beingestablished.The objective for the Riksbank’s monetary policy is inflation of 2 per centannually, as measured by the consumer price index. We have a stated tolerance interval of plusor minus 1 percentage point that will catch deviations from the target.Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has said words to thiseffect: Inflation should be so low that the actors in the economy do not need to concernthemselves with it when they make economic decisions. This seems reasonable, but what does itmean in more concrete terms?Most likely it is not advisable to aim at price stability defined as zero-inflation.Some studies indicate that inflation as measured by the consumer price index is overestimated.There are many arguments for that being the case, one being that goods may increase in pricebecause the quality has been improved and another that the items in the valuation basket whoseprices are measured may be obsolete. This is a problem of methodology and measurement.Estimates for the American economy show that owing to errors in measurement, inflation tendsto be overestimated by up to 2 per cent. Estimates by Statistics Sweden for the Swedisheconomy indicate a smaller error in measurement.A very low inflation may also cause problems if the nominal wages are inflexibledownwards, which is often the case. Some degree of inflation can then function like oil in theeconomic machinery. However price and wage rigidity do not follow any natural law,independently of how, for example, economic policy is formulated. After a period of low andstable inflation, it normally becomes more common and more generally accepted that prices andwages not only can be raised, but also can be lowered.In addition striving after absolute price stability with margins of error that are inall likelihood valid will sometimes lead to price increase rates that may be negative. Such asituation is not entirely free of risk, since it may be difficult to get out of a deflationary situation.Should inflation then not be allowed to be higher than 2 per cent? The basicargument against this assertion is that the disruption in the economy will be greater the higherinflation is allowed to rise. In practice the fact that other countries in Europe, especiallyGermany, have a criterion of 2 per cent for price stability has understandably had a decisiveinfluence in Sweden. Moreover corresponding assessments have also been made by the majorityof the countries outside Europe that work with explicit inflation objectives.BIS Review   14/1998
- 7 -Question 5:  Can’t the Riksbank do something about unemployment?Sometimes the view is expressed that low inflation is indeed good, but that itleads to a very one-sided direction for monetary policy; the Riksbank should also have anobjective for employment.From what I have said thus far, I hope that it has been clear that there is nolong-term conflict of interests between inflation and employment. On the contrary, there aremany indications that low inflation is a prerequisite for stable and high growth and forfavourable employment developments. Therefore, low inflation is the best contribution thatmonetary policy can make to the fight against unemployment.It is only in the short term that high inflation may lead to lower unemployment.However to utilise such a trade-off has its risks, as the experiences from the 1970s and 1980sthat I spoke about earlier indicated. The mere concern that policy will be too expansionary andthat inflation may sprint ahead can push up a country’s interest rates and results not in higher butin weaker growth and employment developments. Therefore it is crucial for monetary policythat confidence in the low inflation regime be preserved.The very construction of the inflation objective implies that economic growth istaken into account in a certain way. A weaker growth, which creates excess capacity in theeconomy, normally means that inflationary pressures from the demand side will decrease. Thisin turn produces room for a more expansive monetary policy – interest rates will be lowered anddemand will be stimulated. Conversely a very high demand signifies that production capacityrisks hitting the ceiling. Prices and wages will then be pushed up. In order to prevent suchoccurrences, monetary policy must be tightened again and interest rates raised.The time horizon over which the Riksbank strives to achieve the inflation targetalso has an effect on growth and employment in the short term. A quite short time horizonmeans that substantial changes in the interest rate are required in order to achieve the objective.Such substantial changes may in turn result both in monetary policy appearing abrupt and inundesirable and significant fluctuations in growth and employment. In contrast a very long timehorizon will bring greater short-term stability to growth and employment, but at the same timelead to considerable fluctuations in inflation. These fluctuations may weaken confidence in theprice stability policy and lead to higher instrumental rates over time. Here monetary policy isobviously faced with a balancing problem. The more credible the policy is, the more room thereis to manoeuvre in practice.There may be reasons for completely abstaining from reacting to certaininflationary impulses of a one-time nature. An example of such “one-time inflation” is indirecttax hikes. If price disruptions are judged to have merely temporary effects on inflation and donot affect expectations of future inflation, it would imply unnecessary real economic instabilityto prevent the price increases from having an impact on the consumer price index.Question 6:  Doesn’t the Riksbank itself “talk up” inflation?Now and then the criticism is made that the Riksbank stresses the risks ofinflation in the economy and is thereby guilty of “talking up” inflation. When this is carefullydone the Riksbank – say some of the critics – can use the expected higher inflation (that weourselves have created) as an argument for making the interest rate increases we have wanted tomake all along. This type of criticism was common last autumn, for example, when theBIS Review   14/1998
- 8 -Riksbank spoke in various connections about its inflation outlook and explained that interest rateincreases might be necessary.I have the following answer to these criticisms. To begin with, the Riksbank’sfocus on inflation developments is entirely natural. It is undoubtedly our task to show clearly thereasons for our decisions. Without a candid accounting of monetary policy from the Riksbank’sperspective it would be more difficult for the political decision-makers and the general public toevaluate monetary policy and our fulfilment of our objective. Think what type of debate wewould have and how monetary policy would be seen if the Riksbank only made its decisionswithout commenting at all on the outlook for inflation and without giving reasons for itspolicies.Thus the need for the Riksbank to speak about inflation is obvious. Naturally itcannot be ruled out that in doing so it will influence households and businesses in their views onprice developments, however our influence should not be exaggerated. The cause-and-effectrelationship is rather the reverse: the Riksbank reacts to inflationary developments, which in turnare determined by a great number of decisions by businesses and households. However, ofcourse the Riksbank does not react in a mechanical manner to a measured change in inflationexpectations. The Riksbank currently monitors a number of indicators of future inflationdevelopments and, responses to its surveys about inflation expectations are just one of many.By way of conclusion there is reason to call attention to the fact that inflationexpectations to an ever greater degree are being guided by the inflation objective and not by ouror others’ discussions of the risks of inflation. The signs of this are clear. The expected inflationhas crept down markedly and has now been stabilised in the vicinity of the objective for most ofthe groups currently monitored by the Riksbank. This is a profoundly positive development,which actually facilitates the monetary policy task. (Diagram 4.

- 9 -Question 7:  Is the policy asymmetrical?It takes time before a change in the instrumental rate affects the economy andinflation. Therefore monetary policy always has to be formulated with the aid of forecasts offuture inflation. When the Riksbank formulates monetary policy it is done with the aid of aforecast one or two years into the future. A simple rule of thumb should be able to describemonetary policy: if our overall assessment of inflation – assuming that the instrumental rateremains unchanged – indicates that inflation will deviate from the objective for two consecutiveyears, the instrumental rate must be changed in the corresponding direction.Monetary policy is always adjusted with the aim of achieving the 2 per centobjective. Occasionally the argument has been presented that the Riksbank should accept thatinflation has risen to the upper range of the interval around the objective. This argument isdifficult to reconcile with the conduct of monetary policy in general. To begin with, it is clearthat if the Riksbank did so, inflation would more often be outside the tolerance interval. In thesecond place the rate of inflation would on average be higher than 2 per cent unless the Riksbankhad the same tolerance for inflation staying at the lower edge of the band in an economicdownturn. However such a policy would instead reinforce the real swings in the economy, incontrast to a policy that is always focused on the objective. In upswings the Riksbank wouldallow more growth and inflation and in downturns we would do the opposite.There is not any asymmetry in monetary policy and there should not be anyeither. One of the purposes of a clearly formulated objective is simply to inform what the policyaims at. In such a way the inflation objective may anchor the price expectations in the economy.The Riksbank should be evaluated in light of this objective. If the Riksbank systematicallyaimed below the objective or always overestimated the risks of inflation, it would be manifestedover time by too low inflation on average.That the Riksbank always aims at the objective of 2 per cent unfortunately doesnot mean that the price increases will always be limited to 2 per cent. First knowledge of thepath leading from interest rate changes to their impact on inflation is insufficient to enable usalways to expect to be able to achieve the objective. Second price increases as measured by theconsumer price index will continually be affected by various kinds of temporary factors. Theremay be, for example, changes in indirect taxes or external shocks in the form of changed oilprices. Often such disruptions should not be counteracted (as long as they do not risk affectingthe long-term inflation process). In addition, there is a continuous flow of new information thatcan change the inflation outlook. These factors can make the consumer price index diverge fromthe target ex post, so to speak. This insight is the reason for the Riksbank’s decision to establisha tolerance interval around the inflation objective. (Diagram 5. CPI and Underlying Inflation)In the Inflation Report of December, the assessment was that economic growthwould be around 3 per cent in 1998 and somewhat more in 1999. The rise in demand wasexpected to result in a gradual reduction of the output gap in the coming years and in increasinginflationary pressure. Given an unchanged repo rate, inflation was expected to rise gradually to2.5 per cent during 1999. In order to avoid more drastic changes in monetary policy at a laterstage, we chose to adjust monetary policy in a somewhat less expansionary direction. The reporate was raised in December from 4.10 to 4.35 per cent. (Diagram 6. Inflation ForecastDecember 1997)BIS Review   14/1998

A smallreduction in the growth of exports was made in the main forecast. But it was primarily a possibledeepening of the crisis compared with the situation in December that, it was deemed, might havesubstantial effects on economic and price developments in Sweden. Thus the Asian crisis wastaken into account in our risk assessment.Since then the crisis in Asia has worsened, both in terms of its effects on thefinancial markets and its likely consequences for real economic growth. For Sweden’s economyit means that the negative effects of the Asian crisis probably will be somewhat more extensiveand prolonged than we expected in December.All in all, the prospects for inflation from the demand side look a bit better thanthey did when the repo rate was last raised. Another positive sign is that the wage agreementsthat have been concluded so far in 1998 indicate a rate of wage increases that is somewhat lowerthan in the main scenario described in December. However the recent weakening of the krona isa cause for concern. If it turns out to be permanent, it could affect inflation prospects.In the Riksbank we are now finalising the next Inflation Report, in which we willpresent an inflation forecast reaching into the first quarter of the year 2000. There, factors suchas the Asian crisis, the wage negotiations and the exchange rate developments will be weighedand put into a larger context. The view of the inflation prospects that will result from thisprocess will form the basis for future monetary policy.BIS Review   14/1998

Mr. Matsushita reports on recent financial and economic conditions in JapanSpeech by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr. Yasuo Matsushita, to the Japan National Press Club inTokyo on 12/12/97.I. IntroductionI truly appreciate this opportunity to address this distinguished audience at the JapanNational Press Club.The circumstances of the Japanese economy and financial system have increased inseverity in the past six months. The economy has not shown any definite signs of recovery since itsreaction to the rise in the consumption tax rate in April 1997. Rather, economic recovery appears to bedecelerating. The currencies and financial markets of South-East Asian countries, which have been thehigh-growth area, have been in turmoil since summer of 1997, and an adverse impact on the Japaneseeconomy has been anticipated. In addition, recent successive failures of large Japanese financialinstitutions have once again aroused concern about the stability of Japan’s financial system in Japan andabroad. Thus, it is not easy to judge where the Japanese economy is headed and to draw up a prescriptionfor each problem.In such a situation, it is important that the circumstances be analyzed carefully so as toperceive the underlying mechanism. This is because developments in the economy and the markets --even, or particularly, when they suggest confusion or disruption -- often provide important indications orwarnings that lead to a better solution of the problem.Today, I would like to discuss and explain the Bank’s thinking on three topics: issuesconcerning Japan’s financial system, the turmoil in the Asian currencies and financial markets, and thedomestic economic situation. These are three independent issues that in a way are closely correlated. Iwould like to explain them with a view to clarifying the underlying mechanism.II. Issues Regarding Japan’s Financial SystemA. Resolution of Failed Financial InstitutionsI would like to start with issues regarding Japan’s financial system.The successive failures of Japanese financial institutions since the fall of 1997 have onceagain emphasized domestically and internationally the severity of the situation facing the Japanesefinancial system, temporarily increasing the tension in the financial markets.First, I would like to explain the measures the Bank has taken to deal with this situationand the thinking behind them.When a financial institution fails, the most important task is to contain systemic risk. Inother words, it is crucial to prevent the failure from affecting other financial institutions or the markets asa whole, disrupting the entire financial system, through widespread anxiety of depositors and marketparticipants or through a chain reaction of defaults.In order to contain systemic risk, two requirements must be satisfied. First, it must beensured that smooth repayment of deposits be made by the failed financial institution. Second, it isimportant to avert liquidity contraction to ensure the stability of the entire financial system. Failure offinancial institutions causes market participants to become overly cautious, making it difficult fortransactions to come to terms. As a result, upward pressures tend to be placed on interest rates. Therefore,BIS Review   12/1998
- 2 -in order for these two requirements to be satisfied, the Bank took decisive measures in response to thefinancial institution failures.To meet the first requirement, the Bank extended special loans as necessary to severalfailed institutions -- for example, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Yamaichi Securities -- under Article 25of the Bank of Japan Law, without requiring the usual collateral.The Bank has committed itself to providing funds for the purpose of ensuring thestability of the financial system only in cases where all of the following four conditions are met: (1) thereis a strong possibility that systemic risk -- a risk that failure of one financial institution to settletransactions with another may trigger a chain reaction of defaults -- will materialize, and that as a result,confidence in other sound financial institutions will be undermined, or that runs on deposits will occur;(2) credit extension by the Bank is indispensable, as there are no other sources of funds; (3) measures aretaken to prevent moral hazard; and (4) the financial soundness of the Bank will not be threatened.In the cases of the recent financial institution failures, the Bank judged it appropriate toextend special loans after thoroughly examining these four points.While the Bank had previously extended special loans to depository institutions, the loanextension to Yamaichi Securities should be regarded as an extraordinary measure. This is because thefailure of a non-depository financial institution such as a securities company differs in several ways fromthe failure of a depository institution. Customers of a securities company conduct stock and bondtransactions through the securities company, and are not in a creditor-debtor relationship with thecompany. They do deposit money and securities with a securities company, but unlike bank deposits,these are not means of payment. Accordingly, it is usually unlikely that the failure of a securitiescompany would directly give rise to systemic risk.Yamaichi Securities’ decision to close down its business, however, is significant in thatthe company is one of Japan’s four largest securities companies. Furthermore, considering the fact thatthe Japanese financial system is being viewed more critically and that Yamaichi conducted a wide rangeof business in domestic and overseas markets and had a large number of customers, any difficulties inreturning customers’ assets or in settling outstanding transactions in the process of closing down thecompany were quite likely to lead to withdrawal of customer assets from other securities companies ordisrupt market transactions. If no measures had been taken to prevent such a situation, the credibility ofthe Japanese financial system could have been seriously eroded and disruptions could have been causedin domestic and overseas financial markets, in the end seriously affecting overall economic activity inJapan. Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to provide Yamaichi with necessary liquidity underArticle 25 of the Bank of Japan Law in order to minimize the adverse impact of the closing down of thecompany’s business on the domestic and overseas financial markets as well as the Japanese economy.The Bank’s measures had their intended effect: payment and settlement were executedsmoothly by the failed institutions, and thus the materialization of systemic risk was avoided. However,the failures of large depository institutions and a securities company made the behavior of marketparticipants very cautious, and as a result, it became difficult for transactions to come to terms, placingupward pressures on market interest rates.Therefore, to fulfil the second requirement in containing systemic risk, the Bank exerteditself to its utmost to avoid declines in market liquidity through market operations. The Bank utilizedvarious market operations means to provide sufficient liquidity in the markets, to thereby support smoothmarket transactions and stable formation of market interest rates.BIS Review   12/1998
- 3 -Since September 1995, the Bank has conducted market operations in order to maintainthe uncollateralized overnight call money rate at a level on average slightly below the official discountrate. However, demand for funds in the market heightened following the series of financial institutionfailures, and at the end of November 1997, the call money rate rose far above this targeted level. TheBank therefore made continuous efforts to supply sufficient liquidity to the market, and as a result therate has recently declined to the targeted level.Rates on longer-term money market instruments, however, especially 1-month rates onend-of-year funds, remain high due to a rise in the “Japan premium” -- the extra funding cost thatJapanese banks have to pay compared to leading U.S. and European banks due to a decline in theircreditworthiness in international markets. The Bank would like to emphasize that it will continue to takea firm stance in its market operations toward the end of the year to ensure the stability of money marketrates.The Bank, in cooperation with the government, will continue to commit itself tomaintaining the stability of the financial system, and strongly hopes that the public and marketparticipants will act calmly.B. The Implications of Recent Financial Institution FailuresSignificant progress has been made toward the solution of the nonperforming-loanproblem, and it can be said that the recent failures of financial institutions occurred amid this notableprogress. Therefore, these failures can be considered to have important implications for the strengtheningof Japan’s financial system and for the restoring of domestic and international confidence in the system.The disclosed amount of total nonperforming loans held by the Japanese depositoryinstitutions decreased from ¥38 trillion as of the end of March 1995 to ¥28 trillion as of the end of March1997. Of this, the amount that needs to be disposed of, or those not covered by collateral or loan lossreserves, has been reduced from the ¥18 trillion in 1993 to ¥4.5 trillion. While this amount is stillsubstantial, it is fair to say that there has been steady progress in the disposal of nonperforming loans.A matter of concern is that the pace of disposal differs among financial institutions. Forexample, some financial institutions have completed removal of nonperforming loans from their balancesheets. Many other institutions seem to be planning to record net losses for the accounting term ending inMarch 1998 to dispose of a considerable amount of nonperforming loans. The overall progress in solvingthe nonperforming-loan problem, together with enhanced disclosure practices, has sharpened the contrastbetween institutions that are being prompt in dealing with their problem and those that lag behind.Under such circumstances, there seem to be two requirements in restoring confidence inJapan’s financial system at home and abroad.First, it is necessary for financial institutions to further improve disclosure and therebyenhance the transparency of their management. Depositors, creditors, and other market participants arescrutinizing the financial conditions of Japanese financial institutions with increasing severity, and thescheduled introduction of Prompt Corrective Action in April 1998 and the implementation of theJapanese “Big Bang” deregulation measures are likely to encourage such tendency. Therefore, it is vitalthat individual financial institutions accelerate the disposal of nonperforming loans and theimplementation of restructuring measures to ensure the market’s confidence.As for the disclosure of nonperforming loans held by financial institutions, a uniformstandard has been established based on a recommendation by the Financial System Research Council toallow comparison between financial institutions, and the range of disclosure has been expanded in lineBIS Review   12/1998
- 4 -with this standard. To increase the transparency of financial institution management and to therebystrengthen the market’s confidence, however, it is essential that institutions expand the range ofdisclosure on their own initiative, not only with respect to nonperforming loans but also to theimplementation of their restructuring measures, and thereby provide the market with a convincingexplanation of how they intend to improve, or how they have improved, their financial strength.Second, the recent series of financial institution failures has highlighted the importanceof preventing the surfacing of systemic risk and of thereby ensuring the stability of the entire financialsystem. It must be remembered that in the financial system, an appropriate balance must be struckbetween the need to draw out the dynamism of the market mechanism and the need to ensure the stabilityof the system.As I stated earlier, the financial strength of financial institutions is being more severelyexamined in anticipation of the implementation of the Japanese “Big Bang”. To maintain the stability ofthe financial system under these circumstances, it is extremely important to ensure that even if the marketwere to pass a hard judgment on an institution, this would not shake the entire financial system.In this regard, the provision of emergency liquidity for preventing any seriousdisturbance from occurring in the system, which I mentioned earlier, is the responsibility of the centralbank as the “lender of last resort”.When the failed institution has a negative net worth, there is the problem of how todispose of the ultimate losses. However, credit extension by the Bank is aimed solely at providingtemporary liquidity, and not at making up for losses. Therefore, it is required that a loss-covering schemebe in place before swift repayment of deposits can be made and resolution of the failed institution becarried out smoothly.The deposit insurance system is one of the frameworks made available for such schemes,and various measures have been taken to enhance the functions of the Deposit Insurance Corporation.There could be cases, however, where losses are too large for this system to bear. In such cases overseas,public funds have been used subject to certain conditions to solve the problem.In view of those examples abroad and the current situation of Japan’s financial system,an argument has been put forward that public funds should be utilized for the early and fundamentalsolution of the nonperforming loan problem, triggering serious debate in the Government and Diet. TheBank considers the argument to carry great significance for the domestic financial system, and thereforehopes that a national consensus on the matter will be reached through wide discussions.The global and domestic conditions facing Japan’s financial system are becomingincreasingly harsh, as represented by the expansion of the “Japan premium” in international financialmarkets. Thus, Japan’s financial system is at a critical juncture that will determine whether it can restoredomestic and international confidence, with financial institutions further enhancing disclosure andaccelerating the disposal of nonperforming loans, and the authorities ensuring the stability of thefinancial system.III. Financial Conditions in Asia and Their Impact on the Japanese EconomyA. The Background of the Turmoil in Asian Financial MarketsLet me next discuss the recent developments in other Asian economies. In this section, Iwill refer to Asian economies on the basis of excluding that of Japan. To confront the turmoil in theAsian financial markets which started in summer 1997, various measures have been taken -- each countryBIS Review   12/1998
- 5 -has been adjusting its macroeconomic policy and setting out measures to stabilize the financial system,and international assistance has been provided under the leadership of the International Monetary Fund(IMF). However, instability remains in the financial and foreign exchange markets of these countries, anduncertainty prevails as to how their economies will evolve under the various economic measures. Today,therefore, I would like to examine the background of the Asian turmoil and its possible impact on theJapanese economy.First, I would like to emphasize that it is not appropriate to perceive the currencyturbulence in Asian countries as having been caused by speculative attacks by global investors onspecific currencies and financial markets, and to emphasize the instability of international financialmarkets. Turmoil in the international financial and foreign exchange markets has occurred several timesin the past: the demise of the postwar fixed exchange-rate system, established by the IMF in the 1970s;and the currency crises in the European Monetary System in 1992 and in Mexico in 1994.In all the above cases, before the turbulence arose in the markets, there had been forsome time a gap between the exchange rate of the country’s currency and the real economic condition ofthe country, with that gap expanding gradually preceding the turbulence. Immediate adjustment of theforeign exchange rate is inevitable once market participants detect the situation. In the adjustmentprocess, the exchange rate may overshoot, giving the impression that the market is in disruption.However, it is important that the grounds for such large fluctuations be clearly identified, or otherwise,the warning signals sent out by the market, which are pointing to the expanding gap in this case, will beoverlooked.With the emergence of the Asian currency turmoil, some have questioned the previousachievements of East Asian economies. This view also seems to be rather extreme. It appears that thepotential growth rate of East Asia remains high, supported by its high-quality labor, high savings rate,and solid market and industry infrastructures. Although East Asian economies will face adjustmentpressures in the short term, they can be expected to establish a foundation for further growth by carryingout various structural reforms based on their recent experiences.What, then, can be considered to be the background of the recent turmoil in Asiancurrencies? While Asian countries differ from each other in many ways, one common factor is that mostAsian currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar, and under the peg, large amounts of foreign fundsflowed in during the 1990s. This in turn led to excessive financial and investment activities, overheatingof the economy, and accordingly, deterioration in the external balance.It cannot be denied that there was a sense of euphoria, or an overexpectation of economicgrowth, in East Asia. When there is an influx of abundant funds based on such expectations, upwardpressure is exerted on the foreign exchange rate of the country’s currency. To maintain the peggedexchange rates, countries were under pressure to ease money to lower domestic interest rates or at leastavoid monetary tightening. Such policy response fuelled financial and investment activities, and this mayhave upheld the euphoria for a certain period of time.Inflation rates in Asian countries rose due to overheated economic activity, and undertheir fixed exchange rate system, their currencies became overvalued. Consequently, the internationalcompetitiveness of these economies declined gradually and current account deficits expanded. Thedeficits in the current accounts were not a problem as long as they were financed by foreign capital.However, as soon as market participants began to doubt the sustainability of the external imbalance andthe economic boom in the area, foreign funds were abruptly withdrawn from the countries, putting severepressures on foreign exchange rates and stock prices. Against this backdrop, many countries werecompelled to abandon their exchange rate pegs to the U.S. dollar and adopt a floating rate system.BIS Review   12/1998
- 6 -Several important lessons can be drawn from this experience with regard to ensuring thestability of international financial markets. Obviously, preventing an overheating of economic andfinancial activities through proper macroeconomic policies is the most important prerequisite for securingthe stability of one’s own economy as well as the international financial markets. It is equally importantto ensure flexible foreign exchange developments, promote information disclosure to allow the marketmechanism to check the appropriateness of economic policies, and establish a sound financial system by,for example, reviewing the framework of financial institution supervision.Based on these lessons, East Asian countries have embarked on the restoration of theireconomies and financial systems with international support. The Bank of Japan, too, continues to play anappropriate role in the framework in which the IMF takes the initiative. In terms of cooperation amongAsian central banks, the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) wasestablished in 1991. The governors’ meeting has taken place annually since 1996; the first being held inTokyo and the second in Shanghai. Taking the opportunity of such meetings, the Bank intends tostrengthen its ties with other Asian central banks by exchanging views and extending technical assistancein various fields.B. Impact on the Japanese EconomyNext, I would like to discuss the impact of developments in the Asian economies on thatof Japan.The economic relations between Japan and other Asian countries have been intensifying,and the region is now the largest trade partner of Japan. Of Japan’s total exports, those to Asia’s NewlyIndustrializing Economies (Asian NIEs) and the member countries of the Association of South EastAsian Nations (ASEAN) account for about 35 percent, exceeding the share of exports to the UnitedStates and to the European Union, 30 percent and 15 percent respectively. As for Japan’s imports, theshare of imports from Asian NIEs and ASEAN countries has grown to almost 20 percent, approachingthe 22 percent from the United States, which holds the largest share.Accordingly, it is inevitable that the depreciation of the currencies and the economicslowdown due to the implementation of adjustment measures in these countries will affect the realeconomy of Japan. At present, demand in other regions such as China, the United States, and Europe isfirm, and the average exchange rate of the yen (weighted by the value of trade with each country) remainsstable. Thus, the export environment is not significantly deteriorating as a whole. However, exports toAsia, especially to Thailand and the Republic of Korea, have started decreasing.Furthermore, slowdown of economic growth in East Asian countries is bringing about afall in international commodities prices, especially those of raw materials. This is beginning to affect theprofits of materials manufacturers in Japan, and as a result, some of these firms are planning to curtailproduction. Thus, careful observation of economic trends including these kinds of indirect impact isnecessary.In addition to developments in the real economy, the problem of nonperforming loans issurfacing in the Asian countries, although the degree differs from country to country.According to statistics compiled by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), thetotal credit exposure of Japanese banks to Asian countries amounts to US $270 billion, which accountsfor about 30 percent of the total exposure of world’s financial institutions to Asia.However, these figures include Japanese banks’ credits to Asian branches and affiliatesof Japanese, U.S., and European financial institutions. Furthermore, a large portion of business credits ofBIS Review   12/1998
- 7 -Japanese banks are extended to Japanese affiliates with a guarantee given by their parent companies.According to the Bank’s survey, Japanese banks’ credit exposure to non-Japanese firms and local banksin Asia appears to be around 30 to 40 percent of the total credit exposure reported in the BIS statistics.Moreover, most of such credit is loans to sound major banks and firms and project finances, which areunlikely to turn into nonperforming loans.As discussed above, the impact of the currency and financial turmoil in Asia on the realeconomy and financial market of Japan has been limited to date. However, the economic situation in thisregion remains unstable. Therefore, the degree of economic slowdown and developments in thenonperforming-loan problem in these countries must continue to be monitored.IV. Recent Financial and Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy Management in JapanA. Domestic Financial and Economic ConditionsI would now like to move on to today’s last topic -- the recent economic situation inJapan.The decelerating trend of Japan’s economic growth since April 1997 has beenintensifying recently. In final demand, exports and business fixed investment continue to be on anupward trend, supporting economic activity. However, household spending such as personalconsumption and housing investment, which fell substantially following the rise in the consumption taxrate in April 1997, is recovering only at a very slow pace. In personal consumption, outlays on servicessuch as travel services have shown a moderate increase, while outlays on goods, as indicated by sales ofautomobiles and household electric appliances as well as department store sales, have remained sluggish.In addition, housing starts have declined more recently to 1.3 million from the 1.5 million per annumlevel prevailing until spring 1997.With such weakness in final demand, inventory adjustment pressures remain in theconsumer durables- and construction-related industries, and thus industrial production has been decliningslightly. Such developments seem to be gradually affecting employment and income.However, this year’s temporary economic slowdown is inevitable in that the economy isat a phase in which the downward pressures of fiscal tightening appear most strongly. The concern ishow these developments will affect the momentum of the self-sustained economic recovery in 1998. Atpresent, corporate profits and employment income, which form the basis of the self-sustained recovery,continue to be on an upward trend. Therefore, it is unlikely that the economy has entered a recession.However, there is some weakening of the virtuous circle of production, income, and expenditure, and ifthis trend continues, it may undermine the strength of the self-sustained recovery. The Bank willtherefore continue closely to monitor the pace of recovery in consumption, progress in inventoryadjustment, and developments in household and corporate sentiment.Meanwhile, prices have remained stable on the whole. Domestic wholesale prices havecontinued to decline slowly, particularly those of construction materials. Consumer prices, afterexcluding the effect of the rise in the consumption tax rate, have been at a level slightly above that of theprevious year, and corporate service prices remain at the previous year’s level.In view of such economic and price conditions, the Bank is determined to observedevelopments carefully in managing monetary policy, placing emphasis on strengthening the foundationof the economic recovery. In the conduct of market operations, the Bank intends to continue supplyingsufficient liquidity to the financial market, to thereby ensure smooth transactions and stability of marketinterest rates.BIS Review   12/1998
- 8 -B. Lending Attitude of Financial InstitutionsWith regard to the recent financial situation, there have been various discussionsconcerning the cautious lending attitude of financial institutions.Today, financial institutions are faced with many challenging management issues, suchas expeditious disposal of nonperforming loans, as well as implementation of measures to deal with theJapanese “Big Bang” financial reform and with the introduction of Prompt Corrective Action. Therefore,with a view to enhancing the soundness and efficiency of management, an increasing number of financialinstitutions are strengthening their risk management and attaching more importance to profitability intheir extension of loans. These efforts by financial institutions are indispensable for strengthening Japan’sfinancial system. However, it is a matter of concern whether the cautious lending attitude of financialinstitutions has reached the point where it hinders the recovery of the economy as a whole.To date, partly because of weak corporate demand for funds, there has been neither anysignificant shortage of funds in corporate financing nor an overall rise in lending rates due to a squeeze inlending. Therefore, the Bank believes that the cautious lending attitude of financial institutions is nothampering economic recovery at present. However, risk management systems of financial institutions arebeing further reinforced. In addition, the influence of developments in financial markets, such as lowstock prices and the rise in the “Japan premium”, on financial institutions’ lending activity requires dueattention.While the current lending activity of financial institutions is not hampering economicrecovery, it is not positively contributing to the recovery as it did during past periods of monetary easing.This fact offers a significant point for discussion when considering the interaction between financialactivity and real economic activity, because the expected role of financial institutions goes beyondmerely responding passively to corporate demand for funds.Financial institutions are expected to actively support forward-looking businessactivities -- for example, by helping corporations find new business opportunities and accepting financialrisks when new businesses are started. In fact, such functions of financial institutions played a significantrole in promoting economic recovery in the past. While it is true that financial institutions went too far inthese activities, leading to the emergence of the economic “bubble”, it is also undeniable that in thepresent phase of economic recovery financial support for economic activity has been weak. In order toensure economic recovery, it is important to strengthen the functions of financial institutions and thefinancial market, thereby restoring a strong and efficient financial system. I would like to point out thatthe cautious lending attitude of financial institutions, causing the so-called “credit crunch”, shouldtherefore be discussed in connection with the issue of strengthening the financial system.C. The Significance of Stronger Confidence in the EconomyThe Bank’s primary concern regarding the economy is the fact that the confidence offirms and households in the Japanese economy and its outlook seems to be deteriorating.It is very difficult to measure accurately the level of confidence of economic entities.However, the financial and asset markets offer some important information. Asset values, for example,reflect the expectations of market participants as to the future profits which may be earned by holdingsuch assets.How, then, should we see the recent low level of stock prices? Corporate profits are at asignificantly higher level today compared with those in 1995, when there were concerns about adeflationary spiral. However, stock prices are close to the 1995 level. This suggests that confidence in theeconomy has weakened compared with that in 1995. Under such circumstances, firms and financialBIS Review   12/1998
- 9 -institutions would be inclined to hold back from forward-looking activities that involve risks. Weakenedconfidence would also reduce the effects of monetary easing.However, it seems unnatural to assume that the potential growth rate of the Japaneseeconomy in the medium to long term has declined significantly in the past two years. In 1995, forexample, there were strong concerns over the future of Japanese industry, due to increasing competitionwith other Asian economies and anxiety over a hollowing-out of industry, but Japanese firms areresponding by building new global networks of production and parts procurement, utilizing the newinternational division of labor. Also, with the depreciation of the yen, apprehension about theinternational competitiveness of Japanese industry seems to have receded considerably.In view of these conditions, the weakening confidence in the economy that is reflected inthe low stock prices must be attributable to some other factor. A clue in finding the answer is the fact thatthe “outlook for the economy” does not reflect only the estimated potential growth rate, but alsouncertainty regarding its realization.For example, even when similar levels of profit growth are expected, stock prices willdecline when there is greater uncertainty about the realization of the expected profit growth, in otherwords, when the risk premium expands. The same phenomenon can be observed in the economy as awhole. Uncertainty regarding future developments significantly undermines confidence in the economy.Thus, it can be said that the present weakness of confidence in the economy is related tothe fact that the Japanese economy is at a critical phase of various structural reforms, including financialsystem reforms. There are many uncertainties surrounding economic entities -- such as the developmentsin the financial system, the progress of structural reform of the economy such as deregulation, and issuesregarding public pensions, which have a substantial impact on household income. Therefore, theimportant issue now is to clarify the outlook for each of these factors, including the prospect of additionalburdens and costs.I mentioned earlier that confidence in the economic outlook is based on two factors,namely, expected growth and risk premiums. It is quite difficult to boost the potential growth rate orexpectation of growth through economic policy in the short term. However, it is possible to reduceuncertainty about the economy, and this is an effective and credible method of reinforcing confidence ina market economy. In this regard, making steady progress in structural reforms such as deregulation andensuring the stability of the financial system are significant. If these efforts can reduce uncertainty abouteconomic and financial developments, then the present monetary easing will be more effective instimulating economic activity, strengthening the force of the virtuous circle in the economy.BIS Review   12/1998
Mr. Kelley discusses the Federal Reserve’s perspective on the Year 2000issue   Remarks by Mr. Edward W. Kelley, Jr., a member of the Board of Governors of theUS Federal Reserve System, before the Florida International Bankers Association and the MiamiBond Club in Miami on 11/2/98.It’s a great pleasure to be here in Miami to speak before the Florida InternationalBankers Association and the Miami Bond Club to lengthen the growing list of Federal Reservegovernors who have appeared before your organizations over the past few years. Tonight, Iwould like to discuss the Federal Reserve’s perspective on the Year 2000 and share with yousome of my observations and concerns about the banking industry’s computer system readinessfor the century date change. With the impressive growth in international banking activity inFlorida since the passage of the Florida International Banking Act 20 years ago, it is particularlyimportant to ensure that the Year 2000 challenge is effectively addressed by all banksconducting an international business in the local and state markets.The stakes are enormous, actually, nothing less than the preservation of a safe andsound financial system that can continue to operate in an orderly manner when the clock rollsover at midnight on New Year’s Eve and the millennium arrives on the scene. And even thegovernment can not declare an extension!So much has already been written about the difficulties ascribed to the Year 2000challenge that the subject is becoming almost commonplace in most conversational circles. Bynow, almost everyone’s familiar with the basic issue -- specifically, that information generatedon computer may be miscalculated and conveyed to others, or possibly programs may beterminated because they cannot recognize dates shown as 00. The problem is even the brunt ofjokes contained in the monologues of late night TV comics, one of whom laughs that he’ll knowwhen midnight, New Year’s Eve, 2000 arrives because his pace maker will start to play AuldLang Syne. Whether you think the problem funny or not, it is quite real.From the Federal Reserve’s perspective as the central bank of the United Statesand a bank supervisor, we have been working intensively to address the issues faced by theindustry and formulate an effective supervisory program tailored to those issues. To start with, ithas taken an enormous effort simply to elevate the industry’s senior management awareness ofthe seriousness and magnitude of the problem which sounds at first like a modest technical issuethat’s easy to fix and not terribly significant. But, if programming logic misinterprets thetwo-digit 00 representation of 2000 to be 1900, automated operating systems across the entirebreadth of the world’s economy are likely to miscalculate date-sensitive information or simplycease to operate. One reads in the press about the possibility of catastrophic failures in such vitalsystems as air traffic control, telecommunications, and the utilities that make up the power grid.Society depends on these vital systems to operate dependably, as it also depends on the financialsystems to do likewise. And they are interdependent. Those responsible for every critical serviceneed to review their Year 2000 plans to be sure they will be compliant in a timely manner sothat, among other obvious reasons, the financial services industry can rely on them. In turn, wein the financial services industry are determined, to the very best of our ability, to be part of thesolution and not part of the problem.In the context of our banking environment, calculations based on a span of timesuch as interest earned, interest due, settlement dates and many others, may result in thegeneration of misinformation and errors that would be labor intensive, slow and costly toidentify and correct after the fact. In the extreme, if the problem doesn’t get fixed ahead of time,a bank or securities trading firm may find itself unable to depend on the information provided byBIS Review   11/1998
- 2 -its general ledger including its funding position and the account balances of its depositors andtrading customers. Obviously, a bank’s inability to understand and manage its funding andliquidity positions could have disastrous consequences for the organization, its customers and itscounterparties. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve and the other banking supervisors that make upthe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the FFIEC, have been working closelyto orchestrate a uniform supervisory approach to supervising the banking industry’s efforts toensure its readiness.Supervisory InitiativesTo give you an overview of the banking agencies’ initiatives to date, theinteragency program began in earnest in June, 1996, with the issuance of the first Year 2000advisory distributed to all domestic and foreign banks in the United States. Following up inMay, 1997, the agencies issued a second advisory entitled “Year 2000 Project ManagementAwareness” which alerted senior management and the boards of directors to the seriouschallenge facing the industry. The advisory indicated that the problem was not merely atechnical issue and that top management and the board had to be directly responsible for theimplementation of a suggested five-phase management process that included awareness,assessment, renovation, testing and implementation. It also alerted bank directors and seniormanagement about the external risks relating to the Year 2000 readiness of their borrowers,vendors and counterparties. Failure of these third parties to address this issue could easily havean adverse effect on a bank’s ability to conduct business.As part of the May advisory we established two particular benchmarks withrespect to progress toward compliance. First, it was expected that by September 30, 1997, bankswould have completed a thorough inventory of all of their mission critical applications andestablished a comprehensive plan and priorities for their renovation. This benchmark has passedand so the banking agencies are now increasing supervisory efforts at those few banks that havenot completed such an inventory and plan. The second time frame stated that by December 31,1998, mission critical systems should be largely renovated with testing well underway so that thebalance of testing and implementation could be accomplished in 1999.The third banking agency advisory was issued last December affirming the needfor thorough periodic reporting of project progress to bank management and more importantlymaking clear that all banking offices are ultimately responsible for their own readiness, eventhough they may be heavily dependent on a third-party service provider or a foreign parent fortheir automated data processing activities. Banks were encouraged to communicate with theirvendors or parents to seek a thorough understanding of their ability to service the bank’s needs.Banks have also been advised to incorporate Year 2000 credit risk into their underwritingstandards and securities trading policies, given that their borrowers or counterparties couldexperience unresolved processing problems that might hamper their ability to meet theirfinancial obligations on a timely basis.The Federal Reserve has also committed to conduct an examination for Year 2000readiness of every bank subject to our supervisory authority by June 1998, and we will continueto conduct further Year 2000 examinations right up to the millennium.Industry AssessmentWell, taking a step back from looking at our initiatives, it’s fair to ask, “How wellis the industry doing?” Most banks have completed the assessment phase; however, those thatBIS Review   11/1998
- 3 -missed the September 30, 1997, time frame are going to be the subject of intensive supervisoryattention. They are also likely to lag behind their peers when it comes time to test theirrenovated applications with their counterparties. Accordingly, in some cases, we are issuingnotification letters putting lagging banks on notice that the deficiencies in their progress requirespecific corrective action. Most banks are now in the renovation and testing phases and arefinding it more expensive and time consuming to fix and test their systems than they previouslyestimated. Consequently, many have had to revise their budgets upward and delay thedevelopment of new services that would divert limited programming and systems developmentresources.Some banks have started the validation phase and have confirmed that testing is acostly, cumbersome and time consuming process. As for the final phase of implementation, fewbanks have advanced this far with any more than a handful of their mission critical systems.Most have a significant amount of testing ahead of them before final implementation can beaccomplished. Let’s focus for a moment on the testing phase as an excellent example of themagnitude of this process.TestingTesting is one of the more crucial issues being addressed, given that it willconsume more than a year and absorb as much as 70 percent of Year 2000 resources. One mustfocus first on internal testing and the isolation of a test environment to avoid contamination withthe current production environment. Then a building block approach starts with one-by-one unittesting of a single application such as demand deposit accounting, then progresses to integrationtesting, which would apply to a group of applications such as those for all deposit systems fordemand, time and savings deposits. Then system testing combines entire systems, which might,for example, cover all automated applications that permit the preparation of the liabilities side ofthe general ledger. This is often followed by regression testing which checks each variable andall combinations of variables relied on by the various systems to see if any cause a problem.Each application is also subject to external testing that is conducted with a singlecounter party to confirm compliance with agreed upon protocols and compatibility of differentYear 2000 solution techniques that may have been used. In a trading operation, this might meantesting trades with a single counterparty. Then organizations have to test with multiplecounterparties and if problems are discovered, it may require further renovation and retesting.Each step is very time consuming and absolutely essential, and it is anticipated that costsassociated with getting it done will rise appreciably as strains on labor markets to support suchtesting grow.The banking agencies are working with the industry to develop guidance on bestpractices pertaining to testing. In addition, the Federal Reserve will soon be publishing a detailedschedule of testing opportunities for Fedwire, automated clearing house transactions and otherservices provided by the Federal Reserve. Actual testing will commence at mid-year 1998 andcontinue throughout 1999. It promises to be a very busy period.Contingency PlanningThe Federal Reserve has been involved with contingency planning and dealingwith various types of emergencies for many years. Today is no different in many respects, butthe need for Year 2000 readiness raises new concerns that are applicable to all banks, foreign ordomestic. One is the risk of contagion. Operating problems at individual banks must not beBIS Review   11/1998
- 4 -allowed to spread and become systemic. Many experts have pointed out that counterparties toautomated transactions ordinarily do not transmit material whose logic statements can act as avirus and destroy software in a receiving host. On the contrary, most exchanges are simplytransmitting data that is ordinarily subject to edits intended to identify any miscalculated datesensitive information. If indeed, the sender has unintentionally transmitted erroneous,miscalculated information and it is identified as such, the recipient rejects the misinformationand is free from the problem which can then be corrected by the sender. So this very importantissue should be readily manageable, but managed it must be.On the subject of operating outages, if an automated information system crashesbecause of a Year 2000 readiness problem, the crash must be prevented from spreading. Weknow that when electric utilities experience a local problem with the power grid, it has onoccasion in the past taken down a wider, regional network. Could this happen withinterconnected computer systems? Most professionals argue that the operational outage of onedata center need not spread and disable others. Nevertheless, as a bank supervisor concernedabout systemic issues, even the remote possibility for operational outages and disruptions toservice require all of us to do significant contingency planning.Early in our efforts to address Year 2000 automation issues, we realizedcontingency planning in the Year 2000 context is made more difficult because operating centerscan not fall back to an earlier version of a software package because the earlier version itselfmay not have been readied for Year 2000. Similarly, a US office of a foreign bank experiencinglocal problems may not be able to rely on its parent because it is likely that the parent dependson the same software that caused the local problem. So, in order to plan for continuation ofservices, it may be necessary to provide a complete, alternative service, or a service that can berepaired as a Year 2000 problem is identified.A major interagency contingency planning effort underway addresses a possiblefederally assisted resolution scenario that might be necessary should a bank experience extensivecomputer problems. If this were to lead to serious liquidity problems, the chartering authoritymight deem the bank nonviable, thus necessitating resolution by the FDIC together with otherbanking agencies that may be involved. It is also necessary for us to consider the legal andpolicy issues that may pertain to a US office of a foreign bank that is unable to meet its liquidityobligations. Such a case will not lend itself to a simple resolution process.Another concern of the Federal Reserve is the extent to which the industry is soheavily dependent on vendors. As I noted earlier in discussing the most recent advisory to theindustry, banks are ultimately responsible for their own operations despite their reliance onthird-party service providers. There are many thousands of information systems vendors of oneform or another that provide services to federally insured depositories, and obtaining meaningfulinformation on vendor plans and status has proven difficult for the industry and the regulators. Ifthey have not already done so, vendors need to provide very soon their program to renovate andsupport a product relied on by banks. With sufficient information on vendor plans, banks canprepare their testing strategies.Vendors and banks are realizing that it is advantageous to make vendor planspublic on web sites and through other means so that they do not have to repeatedly respond tothe same questions from each of their customers. There are important opportunities for banks towork together in this area. By expanding and intensifying interbank cooperative efforts toaddress Year 2000 issues such as the development of common testing scripts and the sharing ofinformation, the industry can enhance its ability to be prepared in a timely manner.BIS Review   11/1998
- 5 -International Initiatives - Foreign Banking OrganizationsLet me now turn more directly to international initiatives which are likely to be ofparticular interest here tonight given the extent of business you conduct with customers andbanks outside the United States. The Federal Reserve has a keen interest in the readiness of theinternational community and the special problems facing foreign banks operating branches andagencies in the United States. The Federal Reserve has been involved in active dialogue withbankers and supervisors that have banks in the United States from around the world. We areinvolved in international visitation programs, conferences and training efforts pertaining to theirpreparedness efforts. On an interagency basis, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC areall represented on the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS) Committee on BankingSupervision, referred to as the Basle Committee. The Federal Reserve is also on the BISCommittee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) which is presently chaired by WilliamMcDonough, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.With the issuance of the US industry advisory in May, the Basle Committee tookup the subject, forming a special task force on Year 2000. Subsequently, the G-10 governorsissued an advisory on September 8 to all BIS member central banks and bank supervisors fordistribution to their respective banks world-wide. It clearly spells out the issues pertaining to thechallenge, and I strongly recommend you read it if you have not yet had an opportunity to do so.The Federal Reserve also produced a video entitled “Year 2000 Executive ManagementAwareness” and distributed it to all bank supervisors responsible for foreign banks that operatein the United States. In so doing, we encouraged foreign bank supervisors to intensify theirefforts to address millennium issues in their home countries and to ensure that their banks weretaking the necessary steps to ready their operations, including those conducted in the UnitedStates. The Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies are making their Year 2000supervisory material available to domestic and foreign banks, and the general public over theInternet. The Federal Reserve has already distributed about 20,000 copies of our video, many inresponse to requests from abroad, and our web site hot links to that of the BIS and many otherYear 2000 sites world-wide. By widening the availability of information on an internationalbasis, we hope to encourage global readiness.The BIS is also working with the International Organization of SecuritiesCommissioners and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors to address thisimportant issue. Together, they will convene a meeting in April of international financialsupervisors and financial organizations to focus on Year 2000 and address issues of concern toall.Based on concerns expressed by banks, the work of the BIS task force and ourown inquiries, we believe that certain countries around the world have not embarked onaggressive compliance supervision and examination programs, so that there is a likelihood thatbanks in those countries have not yet begun to effectively address the problem and will now findit increasingly difficult to be ready. We are concerned that many US offices of foreign banksmay be particularly exposed if their parent is not ready for the Year 2000. Therefore, we haveasked the US branches and agencies to confirm that they will be able to continue to conductbusiness using the same standards for readiness that we apply to domestic banks. Those that relyheavily on their parent for information processing and risk management are expected to be ableto demonstrate to examiners that these systems are being readied for the Year 2000.Further, Federal Reserve supervision policy calls for direct contact with the parentbank to ensure its awareness of the requirements. When problems are identified, contact with theBIS Review   11/1998

In so doing, we hope to be better able toaddress any institutions that have not made sufficient progress toward resolving the issue withtheir US offices. Given the unique characteristics of a branch operation dependent on a foreignparent that, in turn, is subject to the authority of its home country bank supervisor, the FederalReserve and other US banking agencies must carefully consider any necessary follow-up withthe appropriate international authorities.Compounding our concerns about international readiness are a number ofcompeting initiatives that further stretch the limited resources available to achieve preparedness.In 1999, the euro will be introduced requiring record keeping of financial transactions in a newcurrency. Extensive planning and programming will be necessary to permit foreign exchangetrading and other cross border transactions to be conducted in the euro, with the addedcomplexity of the continued circulation of various national currencies for several years. Ofcourse, banks outside the European Monetary Union that are trading counterparties will alsohave to program their computers to accommodate the euro. Similarly, plans in Japan call forextensive deregulation of various segments of the financial markets relatively soon. These andany other high priority efforts will exacerbate the problem of preparing for the century datechange by competing for limited resources. I suggest that all nations should assess theirrespective financial initiatives and determine if any opportunities exist to defer projects that canwait until after 2000. We all need to recognize the magnitude and overriding importance of thistask and take action to protect vitally needed resources from being diverted to other projects thatmay be of lesser priority.Concluding RemarksIn closing, let’s take a moment to ask what you can do. First of all, be alert torecognize any danger signs in your own organizations and in your counterparties, customers andborrowers. For those of you involved in underwriting and dealing in securities, solid evidence ofYear 2000 readiness should be part of your due diligence. You will know you likely have aproblem if you hear that the Year 2000 is “not an issue for our shop”, or if you hear “we canhandle the Year 2000 within the normal planning process without significant budgetimplications”, or if you hear that the Year 2000 “is a technical issue that does not require specialattention by senior management and directors”. Any of these comments are almost certain to bedead wrong, and probably are tip offs to the presence of dangerous complacency, ignorance, ornaivete.You, of the Florida International Bankers Association and the Miami Bond Club,can also help heighten international awareness and action on the matter by ensuring that thepolicy statements I referred to are widely available in other languages, by discussing them ateach opportunity and by building Year 2000 issues into your day-to-day lending and financingbusiness activities, negotiations, contracts, and sales agreements as well as conferences andmeetings with various international regulatory authorities. I am sure that many here have closerelationships with banks in other countries. Let me urge you to delve deeply into preparationsfor Year 2000, and if there is evidence of a potential readiness shortfall, do everything in yourpower to urge the institution to get active very quickly. In so doing, you will advance the causeof readiness throughout the local community and on an international basis as well, whileprotecting yourself in the process.Hopefully, when the century date change arrives, we will be ready, everythingwill work effectively, and we will all celebrate the new millennium in a relaxed and unreservedBIS Review   11/1998

Mr. Tietmeyer considers the challenge of the euro for Europe   Special addressby the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof. Hans Tietmeyer, at the conference on “TheChallenge of the Euro for Emerging Markets”, convened jointly by the National Bank of Polandand the European Economics and Financial Centre in Warsaw on 12/2/98.Europe is facing major challenges. Not only will it have to take importantdecisions affecting the course of future integration. Above all, Europe must also stand up to thetest of global competition while preserving its basic values of freedom and solidarity.The immediate task facing the countries of central and eastern Europe is economictransformation - making their economies internationally competitive and open on a sustainablebasis.Jumping into the “deep water” of international competition with privatisedenterprises and banks has set off radical reforms having far-reaching implications.One of the great thinkers of the Enlightenment, Immanuel Kant, said that the truephilosophers are those who carry conviction through their teachings and by setting an example.Poland may be said to be one of the most successful countries in transition so far.For years now, it has been achieving notable rates of growth. The central bank is doing a goodjob under its president. It is universally recognised that the rate of inflation has been broughtdown sharply and that this has been a crucial factor underpinning the restructuring of theeconomy.Furthermore, important steps have now been taken towards autonomy for thePolish central bank; they are reflected in the Central Bank Act which recently came into force.Germany congratulates Poland on the progress that has been achieved. And we arepleased that many different contacts exist at all levels - including, of course, the field of centralbanking.I should also like to mention the notable scale of direct investment in Poland byGerman enterprises. It is gratifying to see that particularly small and medium-sized enterprisesare involved in that area.But, where there are many points of light, some things inevitably cast a shadow.According to the OECD, one of the major risks is that the expansion of the current accountdeficit cannot be sustained at a manageable level. Furthermore, the OECD experts are calling forthe acceleration of restructuring, especially in the areas of privatisation and pension reform. I amcertain that the responsible decision-makers in Poland are taking that advice seriously.IIThe EU countries are also facing a problem of transformation.Increasingly fierce worldwide competition is setting great challenges for most ofthe EU-countries, too. They must subject their systems of public finance to a criticalexamination, adjust their welfare systems and make the labour market more flexible. The highlevel of unemployment - not least in Germany - calls for far-reaching reforms quiteindependently of the euro.BIS Review   10/1998
- 2 -But the changeover to the euro also calls for transformation.At the beginning of May, the European Council will take the decision on thecountries which are to be members of monetary union from January 1999. For the futureparticipating countries it is a question of transition to the single currency and merging nationalmonetary policies to form a single monetary policy.These are no longer distant, visionary goals but projects on which a decision isimminent in the next few months.Admittedly, that decision also involves giving up monetary sovereignty to a newsupranational institution - the European Central Bank (ECB). In most countries, this will not bean easy step to take, since in some cases it will represent a permanent departure fromlong-standing and cherished national traditions. Entry into monetary union is a road on whichthere is no turning back.European monetary union (EMU) is not a new project, however. Economic andpolitical integration has been an established policy aim in Europe since the end of the SecondWorld War.As early as 25 years ago, there was a serious attempt to set a monetary union inmotion, although it did not meet with success at the time. In 1991, the Maastricht Treaty revivedthe idea of monetary union and enshrined the goal of creating a new currency.The key element of the Treaty is the Statute of the European System of CentralBanks with the European Central Bank at its apex. According to the present schedule, the ECB isto be officially inaugurated in Frankfurt on June 30. It will have the legal task and duty ofmaintaining the price stability of the new European currency. In doing this, the Maastricht Treatyexpressly provides that the ECB shall take its decisions without being subject to any influence onthe part of political decision-making bodies.The new single currency undoubtedly deserves a good starting position with anoperationally viable supranational central bank. That is because a euro which is stable on asustainable basis offers great advantages and opportunities:-The euro will save conversion costs.-It will eliminate exchange rate risks between the euro participants.-The euro will improve the functionality of the single market. That will, aboveall, benefit consumers.-Above and beyond that, the euro has the potential to build on the internationalrole of the former European currencies (and the D-Mark, in particular) and tobecome an international reserve and investment currency.-And the euro can lend a further boost to European economic and politicalintegration.The national central banks of the participating countries will become integral partsof the European System of Central Banks. The Bundesbank is working all-out to stay onBIS Review   10/1998
- 3 -schedule for putting the technical, organisational and institutional framework in place. The otherEuropean central banks, too, must conclude their preparations on time so that the EuropeanSystem of Central Banks can begin its work punctually in compliance with the terms of theTreaty.The spirit and letter of the Maastricht Treaty require a euro which is a singlecurrency in the true sense of the word. That means more than just having the same currency inthe participating countries. A single currency requires:-that monetary policy uses the same set of instruments and pursues a commonobjective and a common orientation - not national interests and orientations;-that fiscal, economic and social policies - which will remain the responsibility ofthe individual nations - are consistent with stability and do not come into conflictwith one another.A monetary union without adequate and sustained joint stability might become a“union of conflict”. Further political integration in Europe, too, would be subjected to severestrain.To prevent that happening, it will be crucial to make the right choice ofparticipating countries. They must have the economic capability and the political will toparticipate in monetary union on an enduring basis without excessive tensions.Demonstrating that the convergence criteria enshrined in the Maastricht Treatyhave been met on a lasting basis is an important factor in the decision on the countries to beselected. This decision is meant to ensure that only those countries will participate which areready for economic union in terms of their economy and anti-inflationary policy.I shall not make any forecasts here about the prospective participants. That isbecause I have too much respect for the procedure enshrined in the Treaty and for thedecision-making prerogative of the Heads of State or Government - a right which they willexercise at the beginning of May. The preparations for this are likely to start as soon as theCommission and the EMI (the forerunner of the ECB) have presented their Convergence Reportson March 25.Why is the decision on the countries chosen to be in at the start of monetary unionso important? In monetary union, all the participating countries must be in a position to stay thecourse unaided. They must be able to secure economic competitiveness and efficiency, above all,by virtue of their own internal efforts. If they are not in a position to do that, not only will theyencounter difficulties themselves but other countries of the EMU area will, too.In contrast to the United States, for example, there will be no supraregional safetynet, no revenue and burden sharing arrangement or a union-wide social security system in thefuture euro area. Regional divergences in economic development will still have to be cushionedat the national level.Moreover, EMU is not - and, according to the provisions of the Treaty, should notbe - a “transfer union”. Instead, the Maastricht Treaty and the “Stability and Growth Pact” callfor autonomous fiscal policy stability on the part of all member states. In particular, excessivenational budget deficits and high levels of government debt may create the potential for conflict,BIS Review   10/1998
- 4 -which would result in political pressure to provide transfer payments or to conduct a softmonetary policy.That must not be allowed to occur, however. That is because, in a monetary union,differences over the course of policy can quickly lead to political conflict and confrontation.IIIFor the present countries in transition in central and eastern Europe, the mostrelevant topics to start with are future EU membership and participation in the single market.It is not yet clear when they will be able to participate in EMU. This is likely torequire a lengthy process of convergence.It was, not least, precisely at the insistence of the German representatives at theLuxembourg summit that the Heads of State or Government agreed to start discussions in Marchof this year on EU membership with six countries - including Poland. I hope that this discussionprocess will bring positive results in the none too distant future.For that purpose, however, the present EU countries must also ensure that the EUis well prepared for the demands of an enlarged community. In particular, a reform ofagricultural policy and the structural funds of the Community are on the “Agenda 2000”.As part of a possible EU membership, joining the fixed exchange rate mechanismof the reformed European Monetary System (ERM II) will then probably also be on the agendafor the currencies of the new member countries.I can imagine that - if there is a positive decision on Poland’s EU membership -the Polish zloty would be a potential candidate. In principle, all EU countries have the right toparticipate in ERM II if they fulfil the necessary economic conditions - in particular, fullcurrency convertibility, application of the relevant single market legislation, andstability-conscious monetary, fiscal and economic policies.Given successful monetary and economic policies, many people will perhaps askwhether unilaterally pegging the exchange rate to the euro in advance might not be a sensiblestrategy for advanced emerging economies - which would be more ambitious and demandingthan the crawling peg strategy which is being pursued here at present.1However, a strategy of this kind initially presupposes that the euro will indeed bea stable, and internationally attractive, investment and reserve currency, and hence a seriouscompetitor for the US dollar.If that is the case, emerging economies can, of course, use exchange rate peggingto import credibility for an anti-inflationary stance which has yet to be established.Nevertheless, as was shown by the ERM in 1992-93 and latterly by developmentsin South-East Asia, this kind of pegging must not be too rigid, especially if there are                                                  1The Polish zloty is currently linked to a basket of five currencies (including, primarily, the US dollar andthe D-Mark) in the form of a crawling peg.BIS Review   10/1998
- 5 -shortcomings in economic policy and economic divergence from the anchor currency. Exchangerate pegging which has become obsolete can be made worthless overnight by the financialmarkets. Importing credibility by means of pegging exchange rates must be underpinned by acorresponding domestic policy. If that is not achieved, pegging the exchange rate can becomevery dangerous.Far-reaching and sustained anti-inflationary and institutional convergence shouldtherefore come before an exchange rate pegging of this kind, and not the other way round.That is especially true for later entry into monetary union.Sustained convergence towards a European stability union is the stated objectiveof the central and east European countries in transition. In this regard, I share the view of theOECD that Poland has decidedly good prospects of converging over time with western Europe.We in Germany would very much welcome a sustained stability convergence. Iam certain that this would be an advantage for both countries in the long run.Important as the political will to become more closely involved in the process ofEuropean integration may be, the key to its success will be a permanently sustainable economicbase.Good politics needs good economics; in the final analysis, there is no way ofgetting round that fact.BIS Review   10/1998
Mr. Heikensten discusses economic policy in EMU and Sweden   Speech by theDeputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at an IIR Seminar on “EMU soon areality - how is monetary policy affected?” in Stockholm on 12/2/98.1.  IntroductionThe European Monetary Union is now less than a year away. For Europe this is amomentous step, perhaps the most important change, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, since WorldWar Two. EMU will gradually entail major consequences for European economic development, forthe way in which monetary policy in Europe is conducted, for financial markets and for all Europeancitizens.Today I shall mainly be considering three issues:•First there is the countdown in Europe. Which decisions about EMU andmonetary policy will have to be made in Europe in the coming year?•Then I shall say something about the problems that European economicpolicies will encounter. How, for example, should fiscal and monetarypolicies be constructed? What will be the need for cooperation and dialogue?•Finally some words about the economic policy issues that will be raised forEurope and for Sweden.2.  The countdown in EuropeTimetable for spring 1998Perhaps the principle issue this spring is, of course, which countries will be adoptingthe euro from the start. The selection process starts at the end of February when the member statessubmit national convergence data. What has happened in the past year with budget deficits,government debt, inflation and interest rates, for example? The European Monetary Institute and theCommission will then independently assess the national statistics in the light of the MaastrichtTreaty’s criteria. The findings are to be presented in two convergence reports on March 25th. On thesame day, moreover, the Commission is to present a recommendation to the Ecofin Council as to thecountries that meet the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency, as well as arecommendation concerning countries that are considered to have an excessive government deficit.The reports are to provide a basis for decisions by the Heads of State or Governmentand show whether members states are ready to adopt the single currency – whether they haveachieved what is commonly referred to as sustainable economic convergence, though what is meantby sustainable is not clearly defined in the Treaty. The convergence reports are also to assess whethermember states have adapted their national laws in accordance with the Treaty and given their centralbank an independent status with price stability as the statutory objective.During March and April these reports and recommendations will be studied by themember states and the EU institutions. During the first weekend in May, which is liable to be hectic,the final decision will then be taken.The Ecofin Council will convene in the evening of 1st May to discuss the reports andthe Commission’s recommendation before drawing up a recommendation to the Heads of State orGovernment as to which member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the singlecurrency. The recommendation from the Ecofin Council is also to be presented to the EuropeanParliament, which will then forward its opinion in the morning of 2nd May so that this, too, can betaken into account in the decision by the Heads of State or Government. That afternoon, finally, theBIS Review   9/1998
- 2 -Heads of State or Government of the member states will assemble to make the final decision, whichrequires a qualified majority, about which countries will adopt the single currency from the start in1999.As soon as it has been decided which countries will be participating in the euro area,the Ministers of Finance or Economic Affairs in the selected countries will meet to decide thebilateral exchange rates between their national currencies that will apply from 1st January 1999.At the same meeting, the ministers of the selected countries will prepare arecommendation concerning the future members of the Executive Board of the new European CentralBank (ECB). Work on this is already in progress and, as you will have gathered from discussions inthe press, arriving at an agreement is not a simple matter. There are some general criteria to do withprofessional experience and so on but in practice it is almost inevitable that nationality will also be acriterion. During May and June, both the European Parliament and the EMI will express an opinionon this recommendation. The composition of the Executive Board is to be finally decided by theHeads of State or Government by 1st July at the latest. This decision must be unanimous.New central bank establishedOnce the ECB’s Executive Board has been appointed, work can start on building upthe new organisation. The Executive Board is to comprise a president (the head of the ECB), avice-president and up to four other members. If some member states do not adopt the euro from thestart, it is possible to appoint a smaller Board and enlarge it later as more states join; but the Boardmust consist initially of at least four members. The term of office is eight years. When the membersare first appointed in 1998, however, their terms will differ so as to avoid having to renew the wholeBoard simultaneously.The Executive Board and the central bank governors of countries that adopt the euroconstitute the ECB’s highest decision-making body, the ECB Governing Council, which is to meet atleast ten times a year. Monetary policy decisions require a simple majority; each member has onevote and the president has the casting vote.The Executive Board is to conduct monetary policy in accordance with decisions andguidelines from the ECB Governing Council. But rather than concentrate everything in Frankfurt, theintention is to arrange for the national central banks (NCBs) to undertake as much as possible,including monetary policy’s implementation. The Executive Board will accordingly issue theinstructions that the participating NCBs need in order to carry out the decisions. The Executive Boardwill also be accountable for the day-to-day activities of the ECB.The central bank governors of member states that do not adopt the euro, e.g. Sweden,will be represented on the ECB General Council together with their colleagues from participatingcountries and the ECB president and vice-president. The General Council is the ECB’s thirddecision-making body but will not exert any influence on the single monetary policy; it is intended totake over the functions that are currently performed by the EMI. The General Council will exist aslong as there are member states outside the euro area. Information about decisions taken by the ECBGoverning Council will be conveyed to central bank governors of outsider countries via the GeneralCouncil.These three decision-making bodies will presumably be supplemented withcommittees with representatives of the NCBs, along the lines of the EMI’s existing committees. Thestructure of this has still to be decided. There are likely to be committees for discussions on monetarypolicy, payment systems, inflation forecasts and so on. Neither is it yet clear in which fields and towhat extent outsider countries will be able to participate in this committee work.BIS Review   9/1998
- 3 -The ECB will not be a large organisation. To begin with, around 500 people will workcentrally in Frankfurt, about 400 of them as administrative staff. There will clearly be a great deal ofdiscussion about how the work should be divided between the ECB and the NCBs. The ECB isnaturally interested in creating a strong and highly competent central organisation that can uphold anoverall European perspective in monetary policy. At the same time, many of the participatingcountries are interested in maintaining competence, operations and influence. One aspect of this thatis already colouring some discussions is the effects that different ways of organising the central bankactivities would have on the geographical distribution of private financial activities in the Union.What consequences would, for instance, a decentralised implementation of monetary policy have forthe status of Frankfurt relative to Paris or London?Most issues resolvedThe work of constructing the new European Central Bank (ECB) and the EuropeanSystem of Central Banks (ESCB) has been in progress for a long time. It is now more than four yearssince the NCBs joined forces to lay the foundation for a new central bank. To appreciate what thisentails it is necessary to look at what the new central bank will be doing.The Treaty states that the ESCB is to define and implement the monetary policy of theCommunity, conduct foreign exchange operations, hold and manage the official foreign exchangereserves of the member states and promote the smooth operation of payment systems. In addition, theESCB is to ensure that supervisory authorities can pursue their policies and thereby contribute to thestability of the financial system.While the NCBs will play an active part in the implementation of monetary policy, itis the ECB that will prepare and make the policy decisions. The ECB accordingly needs its ownanalytical capability for the work of constructing monetary policy and deciding the appropriate levelof the interest rate. This in turn calls for a monetary policy model and a strategy for constructing thepolicy so that the ultimate objective is met. When the interest rate has been set, a system is neededwhereby the central banks can exercise interest rate control and signal their intentions clearly. Aneffective monetary policy also requires a system for payments and the exchange of informationbetween the central banks as well as with the financial sector. Certain financial market procedureshave to be harmonised and uniform principles have to be agreed; for example, securities issuedanywhere in the euro area must be eligible as collateral. Then the ECB has to have foreign reserves aswell as routines for their management. The matter of accounting also has to be settled. In the contextof information and analysis, moreover, there will have to be harmonised statistics for the euro area.The organisation and administration of the new central bank then have to be arranged. Premises,personnel and equipment must be ready for the ECB to function as of January 1999.Most of these issues have been resolved through the EMI cooperation, though ofcourse this has not always been simple. The Community consists of fifteen sovereign states withtraditions that differ in many respects and affect how a central bank works. This is not just a matter ofattitudes to monetary policy and inflation; it also concerns approaches to regulations, free trade,administrative traditions, transparency and so on. Each NCB has a veto, so the discussions have beenlengthy. But the main features of the system are now clear, as are the principles that will apply.There are some issues, however, that could not be solved in the EMI, so the matterhas been referred to the ECB. In such cases, alternative solutions have been prepared and theirnumber has been reduced as far as possible to make it easier to reach the final decision.1.  The choice of monetary policy strategy is one matter that has been referred to theECB. The primary objective – price stability – is stipulated in the Treaty but it will be up to the ECBBIS Review   9/1998
- 4 -to quantify this objective, make it operational and choose the strategy for achieving it. To prepare forthe ECB’s decision, the EMI has studied alternative strategies and whittled these down to two: adirect inflation target and an intermediate target in the form of a monetary variable.2.  The EMI is setting up TARGET, a European payment system or a freeway forintra-EU payments. All the NCBs are developing their national payment systems for real-timesettlement and linkage to a common network. A matter of importance for Sweden that has not beensettled is whether non-euro countries will have access to credits in the payment system. Somecountries fear that if they do, it may be detrimental to the single monetary policy. The Swedishposition, however, is that member states outside the euro area ought to have access to intraday crediton the same terms as euro participants. TARGET will not be the only payment system in Europe andwill have to compete by being the most efficient and reliable. A smooth flow of payments in thesystem would accordingly benefit all the participants.3.  The principles for the new system for interest rate control are known; the systemwill resemble the Swedish arrangement with an interest rate corridor and a repo rate. But the ECBwill also have to decide whether the monetary policy instruments are to include minimum reserves.Those in favour argue that minimum reserves facilitate the construction of monetary policy, forinstance by reducing the need to fine-tune liquidity. In Sweden, however, we consider that minimumreserves create unnecessary complications and are not required for controlling liquidity.3.  Economic policy in EMUWith all the preparations completed, the monetary union can be established on 1stJanuary 1999. There will be a single monetary and exchange rate policy – that is inherent in thenotion of a monetary union – but fiscal policy will continue to be conducted nationally. But thesituation will be new for both fiscal and monetary policy; credibility must be established under thenew conditions and ways must be found for cooperating on the different components of economicpolicy.Monetary policyThe ESCB will have a very independent status so that monetary policy can focus onsustainable price stability and be immune to short-run political considerations. The nationalgovernments have enshrined these principles in the Maastricht Treaty, which every member state hasratified.Independence, however, does not absolve the ECB from the duty of explaining itspolicy in public. It is rather the case that just the high degree of independence, plus the fact that theECB is a new institution with no store of credibility on which to draw, obliges the new central bankto be particularly transparent. If the single monetary policy is not made comprehensible to the publicand politicians, the ECB will not acquire the desired credibility.A clear strategy for the single monetary policy is therefore needed. The Riksbankconsiders that the strategy should include a distinct and explicit inflation target. One advantage is thatsuch a target is comparatively easy to explain and monitor. We have also argued that inflation reportsshould be published on a regular basis in order to provide as transparent a picture as possible of thecurrent policy and how this will be constructed in the future against the background of the existingforecasts.Opinions on this matter differ, however. Monetary targets are likewise distinct in thesense that they can be monitored for fulfilment. But they do not always show a direct relationshipBIS Review   9/1998
- 5 -with inflation and in practice they may have to be abandoned from time to time. That is liable torender the policy less transparent.Without being unduly partial, it seems to me that the Swedish arrangement with aninflation target is attracting growing attention. It is strongly supported by academic economists andmy European colleagues are also increasingly interested in our experience. But against this there is,of course, the Bundesbank’s long and favourable experience of monetary targeting and Germany’sself-evident weight in this discussion.Certain routines for the central bank’s policy presentation are prescribed in the Treaty.The annual report from the ECB is to be presented to the Ecofin Council and the EuropeanParliament, which may hold a general debate on that basis. The ECB president and other members ofthe Executive Board may, at the request of the European Parliament or on their own initiative, beheard by the Parliament’s committees. EU discussions are in progress on the arrangements for thisand whether further clarification is feasible.Under the Treaty, meetings of the ECB’s Governing Council may be attended by thepresident of the Ecofin Council and a member of the Commission but without the right to vote.Similarly, the ECB president may attend Ecofin Council meetings on matters relating to the ECB’sobjectives and tasks. The Ecofin Council president is also entitled to submit motions for deliberationto the ECB Governing Council.Exchange rate policy in the monetary union is another topic for discussion. This ishardly surprising – interest rate policy and exchange rate policy are two sides of the same coin. Aninterest rate adjustment, upwards or downwards, normally affects the exchange rate, just as theexchange rate has consequences for inflation and thus for the appropriate level of the interest rate.The Treaty entitles the European Council to issue guidelines for exchange rate policy under a flexibleexchange rate between the euro and other currencies. Discussions have been held to clarify what thisentails. The member states have agreed that such guidelines are to be drawn up only underexceptional circumstances and then only in general terms. The guidelines are not to jeopardise theprice stability target. Still, it is not entirely clear how exchange rate policy will be implemented.Fiscal policyFiscal policy will continue to be a national concern in EMU. The Maastricht Treaty isintended to institute a common objective to preclude imbalances in government finances. Thisobjective is specified in greater detail in the Stability and Growth Pact that the member statesconcluded last year, the aim being to avoid fiscal irresponsibility in member states after the move toStage Three.In this Pact, all the EU countries have undertaken to avoid an excessive governmentdeficit and to aim for a budget that is close to balance or surplus in the medium term. In principle, abudget deficit is not to exceed 3 per cent of GDP. A country in the euro area that exceeds this limitwill normally be liable to a fine. Sanctions can be waived, however, under certain exceptionalcircumstances defined by the member states.The reasonableness of the Pact’s strict limit for government finances has beendiscussed and doubts have been expressed as to whether fines can be imposed in practice. Themonetary union accentuates the need to adjust Europe’s economies in other ways than via theexchange rate, above all as regards the functioning of the labour market. But national fiscal policycan provide a buffer in the event of shocks. Provided the medium-term objective is met, moreover,there is still some scope for fiscal policy under the Pact.BIS Review   9/1998
- 6 -Estimates from the OECD and others indicate that, as an average for the EU countries,a retardation of growth by one percentage point enlarges the budget deficit relative to GDP by half apercentage point. This implies that a normal conjunctural slowdown can cause the cyclical deficit toincrease by about 1–1.5 percentage points. Staying below the ceiling imposed by the Stability Pactthen presupposes a limited structural deficit. Today the statistical picture is troublesome in that anumber of member states, including some of the core countries, have structural deficits of more than2 per cent. This leaves a very small margin for coping with an economic slowdown.Trade-off between fiscal and monetary policyThe credibility and success of the Stability and Growth Pact are highly dependent onthe ability of member states to meet the medium-term target. Like the single monetary policy, underthe Pact fiscal policies will be closely scrutinised and assessed in the initial years. For monetarypolicy, high credibility confers greater freedom to make temporary allowance for other factorswithout this impairing expectations about the central bank’s target. Similarly, by building upcredibility, more room is created for the Ministers of Economic Affairs or Finance to accept minordeviations from the Pact.Monetary policy and the other components of economic policy are interdependent.Safeguarding price stability, for example, is easier if fiscal policy is tight and Europe’s economicstructures function smoothly. From time to time there may be more direct calls for a dialogue aboutpolicy but such a dialogue must not be allowed to endanger the price stability objective; neither needit, since the ECB ultimately controls the instruments whereby low inflation can be maintained.Let me illustrate this with a simple example. About a year ago most economistsconsidered that British policy needed to be tightened to prevent inflation from exceeding the targetedrate. However, the pound was already so strong that most people believed British manufacturingwould ultimately suffer. If possible, therefore, it was fiscal policy that should be tightened. As thingsturned out, however, the adjustment was made via monetary policy. The Bank of England lived up toits responsibility for price stability and raised the interest rate to prevent an increase in inflation.Precisely the same discussion may be called for in the future at the European level.The ECB may perceive a threat to price stability even though the euro is “too strong” and maytherefore advocate fiscal restrictions. The finance ministers in turn may want to discuss how thisshould be done and how the burden of adjustment should be allocated between them. Such mattersare far from simple; I mention them here mainly to illustrate what I see as a growing need forcommunication and cooperation, at least if the aim is to construct policy with the best interests ofEurope in mind.As most of you know, a dialogue and cooperation have been called for in the debateon the monetary union’s policy arrangements. In December 1997 the member states agreed on thesetting up of what has been called the Euro X Council. This body is not to have any formaldecision-making powers and its composition is to be determined by the agenda. Matters that onlyconcern countries in the euro area are to be discussed by the ministers of those countries;representatives of the outsider countries may join in on matters that are also of interest to them. Howparticipation in Euro X is to be decided and the arrangements for this are not yet clear. What is clearis that the Ecofin Council is the only decision-making body and that all formal decisions have to bemade there.In my opinion the debate about Euro X tended to extremes. It can hardly be deniedthat in certain economic matters the euro participants will need to arrive at a common standpoint. Theabove example of the United Kingdom is a case in point. At the same time, the mutual dependence ofcountries inside and outside the euro area is very pronounced and good arguments for excludingBIS Review   9/1998
- 7 -outsider countries from the discussion are to be found in extremely few issues (one example isperhaps matters to do with the position of the euro relative to the currencies of non-euro memberstates). A number of colleagues have in fact indicated some concern about the EU split that Euro Xmight bring about under unfortunate circumstances.4.  Economic policy in SwedenIt is frequently claimed that the establishment of a European monetary union thatSweden has chosen not to join imposes new requirements on Swedish economic policy. This may betrue but only up to a point. EMU will bring the countries of Europe closer to each other economicallyand this will accelerate and accentuate the internationalisation of Sweden’s economy. Theconsequences are essentially favourable: stronger competition and lower prices, access to a largerlabour market, etc. At the same time, in some respects internationalisation restricts the scope fornational economic policy. But in this context EMU does not represent something radically different;it simply reinforces earlier tendencies.As regards economic policy, the major step was really taken at the beginning ofthis decade with the realignment of our policy for stability. Today, the main features of Swedisheconomic policy are the same as EU policy and there are good grounds for believing that this willcontinue to be the case. Here I shall briefly consider three types of argument:•Firstly, the results of policy in recent years; low inflation and a rapidimprovement in government finances.•Secondly, institutional changes; the rules for both monetary and fiscal policyhave been changed so that conditions today for conducting a policy forstability are considerably better than before.•Thirdly, Sweden, whether or not we adopt the single currency, belongs in aEuropean context that will continue to exert a distinct pressure on oureconomic policy and markedly affect our freedom of action.Good results for growth and inflationThe 1990 Budget Statement contained the first clear statement that low inflation wasone of economic policy’s primary objectives: low inflation paves the way for future growth andemployment. The distinct message signalled an awareness that there was no turning back – thedevaluation policy was no longer tenable and what mattered now was a policy focus on long-termstability. This awareness naturally had its roots in the Swedish experience of recent decades – acombination of high inflation and weak economic growth. But another important contribution was theEU experience – in many countries a policy focused on low inflation since the early 1980s had bornefruit, for instance in terms of growth. A major drawback, however, was that the good growth had notgenerated good results in terms of employment. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, Sweden was nowbeginning to draw closer to the EU politically.Since the reduction of inflation to a more normal European level, which happenedsoon after the policy realignment, the rate of price increases in Sweden has matched or been belowthe EU average. Since the announcement of the inflation target in January 1993, the CPI has risen atan average annual rate of 2.3 per cent. Since the target came into force at the beginning of 1995, CPIinflation has averaged 1.5 per cent. The picture is even clearer in terms of underlying inflation,calculated to exclude transitory effects like tax increases, interest rate adjustments, etc. This indicatorof inflation has been relatively stable inside the tolerance interval of 1–3 per cent that surrounds theRiksbank’s target.BIS Review   9/1998
- 8 -It is worth underscoring that the economic growth which has accompanied thisperformance has been relatively good. Since the low in economic activity in Sweden in the summerof 1993, at 2.5–3 per cent the average annual GDP growth rate has been higher than in the 1980s.However, employment has not picked up with growth to the desired extent. This has to do withnumerous factors, of which one is, of course, the cuts in public sector activities in connection withbudget consolidation, for example. Another factor is the problems in the labour market, which partlyconcern rules and the process of wage formation.The profound crisis in the early 1990s meant that output in Sweden dropped byaround 5 per cent, which is almost unparalleled in post-war Europe. The drop in production was theprimary cause of the dramatic weakening of government finances in the period 1991–94. Since thenthis situation has also radically improved. Having peaked at over 12 per cent of GDP, the governmentdeficit has swung sharply. Stronger economic activity has made a major contribution to this but itwould not have been possible without the extensive consolidation of government finances. Taxincreases and spending cuts between 1995 and 1997 have totalled the equivalent of almost 7 per centof GDP. Besides their direct budgetary impact, these measures laid a foundation for a downward shiftin interest rates, a considerably better exchange rate trend and an overall economic stabilisation thataided the improvement appreciably.The massive budget deficits meant that in the period 1990–96 public sector debt grewfrom 44 to 78 per cent of GDP. This restricts the future freedom of action in fiscal policy. ForSweden this constraint is accentuated in that the high revenue and expenditure ratios render thebudget very susceptible to conjunctural factors. Seen in this light, the Government’s objective of a2 per cent budget surplus over the medium term seems reasonable. It also provides a margin of safetyfor the deficit criterion in the Stability and Growth Pact. A budget surplus lessens the risk of asizeable deficit when economic activity is weak. Moreover, the objective means that Sweden fulfilsthe undertaking in the Pact that the budget is to be close to balance or in surplus in the medium term.Institutional changesTo some extent, Sweden’s problems with government finances have stemmed frominstitutional factors. In recent years, however, there have been changes which improve the conditionsfor a sound budget policy. One change, instituted for other purposes as well, is that the Riksdag isnow elected for four years instead of three; the longer mandate renders policy more stable. As of1997, moreover, the Budget Act has altered the budget process. A nominal spending ceiling has beenintroduced and applies to a moving three-year period; this means that additional spending in one fieldhas to be financed via reassessments elsewhere so that the overall ceiling is not exceeded.Expenditures during the current fiscal year are also monitored more closely; if items are expected toexceed the budgeted figure, the competent ministry has to propose ways of preventing this.Institutional changes are also on the way in the domain of monetary policy. The statusof the Riksbank is to be strengthened as of 1999. As a result of the five-party agreement, the inflationtarget is to have the force of law. The ban on giving instructions is to be statutory. The only groundsfor dismissing the Riksbank governor are to be serious misconduct or an inability to continue to fulfilthe conditions required for the performance of his/her duties. Concerning monetary and exchange ratepolicy decisions of major importance, instead of the present obligation to consult the Minister ofFinance, in future the Riksbank will simply inform him/her. The agreement also provides for adifferent managerial structure, an adaptation in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty, and changes inthe right to decide exchange rate policy. In exchange rate policy matters the Riksbank has a strongerlegal status than the ECB. All this makes the Riksbank one of Europe’s most legally independentcentral banks.A European contextBIS Review   9/1998
- 9 -The fact that Sweden will not be adopting the single currency from the start does notmean that Swedish economic policy can be constructed independently of opinions in other EUcountries. Cooperation and dialogue with other member states are requirements that have grown upwith the increasingly pronounced economic integration and definitely applied when we joined theCommunity. The Maastricht Treaty stipulates that we are to regard our economic policy as a matter ofcommon concern. We shall therefore continue to participate in the discussions in Brussels at whichthe economic policies of member states are deliberated and assessed.We will take part once a year in the construction of the broad guidelines for economicpolicy. The Stability and Growth Pact applies to Sweden even as a non-euro member state. We areadmittedly not liable to sanctions but we are under an obligation to fulfil the Pact’s objectives. Wehave also undertaken to explain our policy continuously in convergence programmes that require theapproval of the other member states. Moreover, the Treaty requires us to regard our exchange ratepolicy as a matter of common concern.These arrangements mean that we continuously participate in the joint supervision ofeconomic policies in the Community and have to explain and defend the policy we pursue.Conducting a policy that differs in essentials from the Community’s declared objectives is scarcelyfeasible and, at least as far as Sweden is concerned, undesirable. The pressures from joint processesof this kind should not be underestimated.5.  ConclusionThe countdown to the economic and monetary union is proceeding rapidly. All thepreparations throughout Europe will have to be completed in the course of this year so that the singlecurrency can be adopted from the beginning of 1999. Most of the major and difficult decisions havealready been made. In about three months time the EU countries will have selected the member statesthat are to constitute the euro area. The new European Central Bank will then be launched and dressrehearsals can begin. EMU is indeed on the way.Much will be required of both the ECB and the governments of participating countriesin the form of a credible policy. The legal framework provides good conditions for this. But of coursethere are elements of uncertainty. One important issue is the formulation of economic policycooperation in the union. Only time will tell just how this matter will be settled.EMU will entail changes for the players in financial markets as well as for othereconomic agents, like households and firms. Sweden is no exception, though the drama should not beexaggerated. The tendencies are gradual and much has already happened.The conditions for economic policy in Sweden will also be affected. In the wake ofexcesses in the 1980s, the realignment of Sweden’s economic policy in the early 1990s led initially toconsiderable convulsions. Today, however, our stabilisation policy stands up well in a Europeanperspective. Government finances have been improved in record time and inflation is low. New ruleshave been established for both fiscal and monetary policy. The task now is a consistent continuationof this policy.BIS Review   9/1998
Mr. Thiessen discusses international developments and the prospects for theCanadian economy   Notes for remarks by the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mr. GordonThiessen, in Saint John, New Brunswick on 5/2/98.A year ago, in early 1997, prospects for global economic growth were verypromising. World economic activity had strengthened and was expected to accelerate further,with the benefit of low inflation, reduced fiscal imbalances, and stable or declining interest rates.In Canada too, output and employment growth had picked up. And the economy was expected togain momentum in 1997, supported by strong US demand and the lowest domestic interest ratesin many years. Low inflation and a dramatic improvement in our fiscal situation had made thoselow interest rates possible.Today, the views about the global economy are more mixed. The buildup ofevents in Asia since last summer has cast a cloud over the economic picture. The InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD) have scaled back their projections for world economic growth this year. In earlyDecember, they suggested that global output growth could be ¾ to 1 percentage point slower in1998 than previously expected.But the news on the external side is certainly not all negative. There have alsobeen some positive surprises recently. For example, the underlying economic momentum in ourmajor trading partners, other than Japan, looks to be stronger than expected a few months ago.And longer-term interest rates have been declining in most industrial countries, which shouldhelp underpin global economic expansion.Today, I would like to give you an update on the Canadian economy and discussthe prospects for the period ahead in light of the latest international developments.My conclusion and main message is that, even with the current uncertainties onthe external horizon, Canada’s economic outlook remains positive. An important basis for thisconclusion is that the underlying foundations of the Canadian economy are sounder than theyhave been for many years. Thus, we are in a better position to weather the impact of unexpectedinternational developments and to make progress in generating higher incomes and employment.How did we do in 1997?Let us start with a quick look at our economic performance in 1997. Based on themost recent information available, the Bank of Canada estimates that the Canadian economyexpanded at a rate of about 4 per cent from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of1997. Exports were the mainstay of the economic recovery until mid-1996; but since then theexpansion has become more broadly based. Over the past year and a half, spending by Canadianhouseholds on consumer goods and by businesses on investments in technology and newequipment has been the driving force in the economy.The strong pickup in economic activity has also contributed to a substantialincrease in employment. Over 380,000 new jobs were created in the private sector last year,offsetting many times over the 13,000 jobs lost in the public sector because of restructuring.Even more encouraging is the fact that a good part of this increase in employment representedfull-time jobs. Moreover, the unemployment rate fell to 8.6 per cent by year-end from 9.8 percent at the end of 1996.BIS Review   7/1998
- 2 -Inflation has remained low, and within our target range of 1 to 3 per cent for mostof 1997, although it did end the year somewhat below target. Some of the factors thatcontributed to this recent greater-than-expected slowing in the trend of inflation are of atemporary nature and are expected to unwind in coming months. But some of the otherdampening influences at work may be more persistent than seemed likely earlier. So, althoughwe see the trend of inflation moving back inside the target range in the near future, on balance itwill probably be somewhat lower in 1998 than previously expected.I would also like to underline the additional progress made during the year in thearea of public finances, where government deficits have been further reduced. More importantly,the ratio of public debt relative to the size of our economy is finally falling. This is a majorcontribution towards the sounder economic foundations that I mentioned earlier.Altogether then, 1997 turned out to be a good year for the Canadian economy.Prospects for 1998 and the ’Asian factor’But what about prospects for the current year? How important are the latestinternational events when viewed from a Canadian perspective? And what is their likely impacton our economy?There is no doubt that what started as financial turbulence related to difficulties inThailand has become a more widespread problem than anyone would have thought likely somemonths back. An erosion of market confidence led to strong downward pressure on exchangerates and to sharply higher interest rates in the affected South-East Asian countries and,subsequently, in South Korea. These market difficulties in turn uncovered and exacerbatedfinancial and economic weaknesses that had been plaguing these countries for some time.The international community, including Canada, has taken steps, primarilythrough the IMF, to help these countries deal with their problems. Some of the initialuncertainties involved in setting up and getting these IMF adjustment programs going have beenresolved. And there are now some encouraging signs of improved confidence and financialstability in the region.Among the industrial countries, Japan is the one most affected by the spillovereffects from its Asian trading partners. Not only are its trade links with them important, but thisexternal shock comes at a time when the Japanese domestic economy is much less buoyant thanwas anticipated earlier. Substantial loan exposure by Japanese banks to the Asian region has alsoweakened an already ailing financial sector in that country. But it is important to note that Japanhas the financial wherewithal to deal with its banking difficulties and that a series of measures tocombat these problems and to strengthen the economic recovery have already been taken.Additional financial sector and fiscal measures were announced recently.At this stage, the situation in Asia is still evolving, and, while prospects haveimproved, we cannot be sure just how quickly and effectively the South-East Asian, Korean, andJapanese economies will respond to the adjustment measures that have been taken.What about the potential effects of all this on Canada? Since our trade with Asia,including Japan, makes up less than 10 per cent of our total exports, the direct effects will berelatively modest. But we must also take into account the indirect effects that work through ourother major trading partners and through the prices of some of the products we sell abroad.BIS Review   7/1998
- 3 -Indeed, the implications of the Asian crisis for global economic growth and for primarycommodity prices on world markets will probably have a more important impact on Canada thanthe reduction of our exports to Asia.The fallout from Asia will no doubt have a dampening effect on Canadian outputgrowth for the current year. But there are also other, more positive, developments that couldwell work to mitigate this effect. As I said before, economic performance in our major tradingpartners in the West, particularly the United States, has been somewhat stronger than anticipated.And even though our short-term interest rates have risen, Canadian longer-term rates have beenfalling, along with their counterparts in the United States and Europe, reflecting declininginflation and lower inflation-risk premiums. These longer-term rates are an important element inboth business investment decisions and household spending on consumer durables and housing.The Bank continues to monitor the situation carefully and to appraise the overalleffect of these positive and negative influences on our economy. It is clear, however, thateconomic growth in 1998 will not be as robust as appeared likely last fall. And some Canadianregions and industries, particularly those with heavier reliance on primary commodities andexports to Asia, will no doubt feel the impact more than others. As well, there are the economiceffects of the recent ice storm in Eastern Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes to consider. But Iwant to stress that, for the economy as a whole, the outlook is still favourable for continuedexpansion in output and employment, and for a further gradual reduction in the margin ofunused capacity.Recent developments in international financial marketsNext, I would like to say a few words about recent developments in worldfinancial markets. The key feature of these developments has been the sharp appreciation of theUS dollar. Measured against all major currencies, the value of the US dollar has risen by about 4per cent since late September. Two main factors have combined to push the US dollar up. Thefirst is the remarkable strength of the US economy relative to the economies of its major tradingpartners. Indeed, the US economy has been expanding more rapidly and operating at higherlevels of capacity than were thought to be sustainable in the past. The second factor is theattraction that the large, efficient, and liquid US financial markets hold for nervous investors insearch of a safe haven because of the events in Asia.The dampening effect of the Asian problems on expectations for primarycommodity prices has also been a factor behind movements in the currencies of countries, likeCanada, that are important producers and exporters of such products.With all this going on, the Canadian dollar has declined by just under 5 per centagainst the US dollar since late September. Because other major currencies have also fallenagainst the US dollar during this period, the Canadian dollar has declined much less againstthese currencies. Nonetheless, given the importance of our trade with the United States, theeffective value of the Canadian dollar, measured on a trade-weighted basis against all the majorG-10 currencies, has declined significantly in recent months.This decline in the value of our currency led to a further substantial easing ofmonetary conditions. But, as I said before, even with the effects of the Asian crisis, the Canadianeconomy is on track to continue expanding and moving towards full use of its potential. In thesecircumstances, the extent of the recent further monetary easing was not appropriate. That is whyBIS Review   7/1998
- 4 -we moved last week to re-balance monetary conditions, and to provide support for the Canadiandollar, by raising the Bank Rate by ½ of a percentage point to 5 per cent.It is probably too early to be drawing conclusions and lessons from this latestepisode of world financial turbulence. Still, when it comes to Canada, it is worth noting thedifferent reaction in domestic financial markets this time compared with our experience duringthe Mexican currency crisis of early 1995. Back then, the international financial turmoil had theeffect of focusing market attention on Canada’s fiscal problems, causing investors to demandhigher risk premiums. And this led to sharply higher longer-term rates in Canada. This time, as Imentioned, domestic longer-term rates have been falling, along with comparable rates in theUnited States and Europe, to their lowest levels in 30 years.What this tells me is that it pays to have one’s house in order. Now we can seemore clearly the importance of the remarkable progress that has been made since 1995 in fiscaldeficit reduction. A declining ratio of public debt relative to the size of our economy will help tofurther reduce our vulnerability to international shocks.From a monetary policy perspective, the best contribution your central bank canmake to helping the economy cope with external shocks is to ensure that inflation remains undercontrol. Nothing is as important to investors, especially during turbulent times, as the assurancethat comes from the protection that low and stable inflation provides for the value of money.Concluding remarksIn closing, let me reiterate that, in view of the uncertainties involved, it is difficultat this time to make precise assessments of the likely effects of the Asian crisis on the Canadianeconomy. But in making judgments about our economy, we must also consider the positiveinfluences of the economic momentum in many of our major trading partners, as well as theprospects for domestic demand in Canada.The main factors at play in the outlook for domestic demand suggest that businessand household spending should continue to grow. In particular, monetary conditions are verystimulative, providing considerable encouragement for expansion.All in all, the economic outlook remains positive. And with our low inflation rateand greatly improved fiscal position, the Canadian economy is now in better shape to withstandthe impact of the Asian crisis and to continue to make headway in improving the well-being ofCanadians.BIS Review   7/1998
Mr. Greenspan analyses further the roots of the current crisis in AsiaTestimony by the Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. AlanGreenspan, before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House ofRepresentatives on 30/1/98.The global financial system has been evolving rapidly in recent years. Newtechnology has radically reduced the costs of borrowing and lending across traditional nationalborders, facilitating the development of new instruments and drawing in new players. One resulthas been a massive increase in capital flows. Information is transmitted instantaneously aroundthe world, and huge shifts in the supply and demand for funds naturally follow.This burgeoning global system has been demonstrated to be a highly efficientstructure that has significantly facilitated cross-border trade in goods and services and,accordingly, has made a substantial contribution to standards of living worldwide. Its efficiencyexposes and punishes underlying economic weakness swiftly and decisively. Regrettably, it alsoappears to have facilitated the transmission of financial disturbances far more effectively thanever before.As I testified before this Committee three years ago, the then emerging Mexicancrisis was the first such episode associated with our new high-tech international financial system.The current Asian crisis is the second.We do not as yet fully understand the new system’s dynamics. We are learningfast, and need to update and modify our institutions and practices to reduce the risks inherent inthe new regime. Meanwhile, we have to confront the current crisis with the institutions andtechniques we have.Many argue that the current crisis should be allowed to run its course withoutsupport from the International Monetary Fund or the bilateral financial backing of other nations.They assert that allowing this crisis to play out, while doubtless having additional negativeeffects on growth in Asia, and engendering greater spill-overs onto the rest of the world, is notlikely to have a large or lasting impact on the United States and the world economy.They may well be correct in their judgment. There is, however, a small but notnegligible probability that the upset in East Asia could have unexpectedly negative effects onJapan, Latin America, and eastern and central Europe that, in turn, could have repercussionselsewhere, including the United States. Thus, while the probability of such an outcome may besmall, its consequences, in my judgment, should not be left solely to chance. We have observedthat global financial markets, as currently organized, do not always achieve an appropriateequilibrium, or at least require time to stabilize.Opponents of IMF support also argue that the substantial financial backing, bycushioning the losses of imprudent investors, could exacerbate moral hazard. Moral hazardarises when someone can reap the rewards from their actions when things go well but do notsuffer the full consequences when things go badly. Such a reward structure, obviously, couldencourage excessive risk taking. To be sure, this is a problem, though with respect to Asia someinvestors have to date suffered substantial losses. Asian equity losses, excluding Japan, sinceJune 1997 worldwide are estimated to have exceeded $700 billion of which more than $30billion has been lost by U.S. investors. Substantial further losses have been recorded in bondsand real estate.BIS Review   6/1998
- 2 -Moreover, the policy conditionality, associated principally with IMF lending,which dictates economic and financial discipline and structural change, helps to mitigate some ofthe moral hazard concerns. Such conditionality is also critical to the success of the overallstabilization effort. As I will be discussing in a moment, at the root of the problems is poorpublic policy that has resulted in misguided investments and very weak financial sectors.Convincing a sovereign nation to alter destructive policies that impair its own performance andthreaten contagion to its neighbors is best handled by an international financial institution, suchas the IMF. What we have in place today to respond to crises should be supported even as wework to improve those mechanisms and institutions.Accordingly, I fully back the Administration’s request to augment the financialresources of the IMF -- U.S. participation in the New Arrangements to Borrow and an increasein the U.S. quota in the IMF. Hopefully, neither will turn out not to be needed, and no funds willbe drawn. But it is better to have it available if that turns out not to be the case and quickresponse to a pending crisis is essential. I also believe it is important to have mechanisms, suchas the Treasury Department’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, that permit the United States inexceptional circumstances to provide temporary bilateral financial support, often on short notice,under appropriate conditions and on occasion in cooperation with other countries.In my testimony before this Committee in mid-November, I endeavored to outlinethe roots of the current crisis. This morning I should like to carry the analysis a bit further.Companies in Korea and many other Asian countries have become formidableworld-class producers in a number of manufacturing sectors using advanced technologies, but ina number of cases they permitted leverage to rise to levels that could only be sustained withcontinued very rapid growth. Growth, however, was destined to slow.Asian economies to varying degrees over the last half century have tried tocombine rapid growth with a much higher mix of government-directed production than has beenevident in the essentially market-driven economies of the West. Through governmentinducements, a number of select, more sophisticated manufacturing technologies borrowed fromthe advanced market economies were applied to these generally low-productivity and, hence,low-wage economies. Thus, for selected products, exports became competitive with those of themarket economies, engendering rapid overall economic growth.There was, however, an inevitable limit to how far this specialized Asianeconomic regime could develop. As the process broadened beyond a few select applications ofadvanced technologies, overall productivity continued to increase and the associated rise in theaverage real wage in these economies blunted somewhat the competitive advantage enjoyedinitially. As a consequence of the slackening of export expansion caused in part by losses incompetitiveness because of exchange rates that were pegged to the dollar, which wasappreciating against the yen, aggregate economic growth slowed somewhat, even before thecurrent crisis.For years, domestic savings and rapidly increasing capital inflows had beendirected by governments into investments that banks were required to finance. As I pointed outin previous testimony, lacking a true market test, much of that investment was unprofitable. Solong as growth was vigorous, the adverse consequences of this type of non-market allocation ofresources were masked. Moreover, in the context of pegged exchange rates that were presumedto continue, if not indefinitely, at least beyond the term of the loan, banks and nonbanks werewilling to take the risk to borrow dollars (unhedged) to obtain the dollar-denominated interestBIS Review   6/1998
- 3 -rates that were invariably lower than those available in domestic currency. Western, especiallyAmerican investors, diversified some of their huge capital gains of the 1990s into East Asianinvestments. In hindsight, it is evident that those economies could not provide adequateprofitable opportunities at reasonable risk to absorb such a surge in funds. This surge, togetherwith distortions caused by government planning, has resulted in huge losses. With the inevitableslowdown, business losses and nonperforming bank loans surged. Banks’ capital eroded rapidlyand, as a consequence, funding sources have dried up, as fears of defaults have risendramatically. In an environment of weak financial systems, lax supervisory regimes, and vagueguarantees about depositor or creditor protections, bank runs have occurred in several countriesand reached crisis proportions in Indonesia. Uncertainty and retrenchment have escalated. Thestate of confidence so necessary to the functioning of any economy has been torn asunder.Vicious cycles of ever rising and reinforcing fears have become contagious. Some exchangerates have fallen to levels that are understandable only in the context of a veritable collapse ofconfidence in the functioning of an economy.A similar breakdown was also evident in Mexico three years ago, albeit to asomewhat lesser degree. In late 1994, the government was rapidly losing reserves in a vain effortto support a currency that had come under attack when the authorities failed to act expeditiouslyand convincingly to contain a burgeoning current account deficit financed in large part bysubstantial short-term flows denominated in dollars.These two recent crisis episodes have afforded us increasing insights into thedynamics of the evolving international financial system, though there is much we do not yetunderstand.With the new more sophisticated financial markets punishing errant governmentpolicy behavior far more profoundly than in the past, vicious cycles are evidently emergingmore often. For once they are triggered, damage control is difficult. Once the web of confidence,which supports the financial system, is breached, it is difficult to restore quickly. The loss ofconfidence can trigger rapid and disruptive changes in the pattern of finance, which, in turn,feeds back on exchange rates and asset prices. Moreover, investor concerns that weaknessesrevealed in one economy may be present in others that are similarly situated means that the lossof confidence can quickly spread to other countries.At one point the economic system appears stable, the next it behaves as though adam has reached a breaking point, and water (read, confidence) evacuates its reservoir. TheUnited States experienced such a sudden change with the decline in stock prices of more than 20percent on October 19, 1987. There is no credible scenario that can readily explain so abrupt achange in the fundamentals of long-term valuation on that one day. Such market panic does notappear to reflect a simple continuum from the immediately previous period. The abrupt onset ofsuch implosions suggests the possibility that there is a marked dividing line for confidence.When crossed, prices slip into free fall -- perhaps overshooting the long-term equilibrium --before markets will stabilize.But why do these events seem to erupt without some readily evident precursor?Certainly, the more extended the risk-taking, or more generally, the lower the discount factorsapplied to future outcomes, the more vulnerable are markets to a shock that abruptly triggers arevision in expectations and sets off a vicious cycle of contraction.Episodes of vicious cycles cannot be easily forecast, as our recent experience withAsia has demonstrated. The causes of such episodes are complex and often subtle. In the case ofBIS Review   6/1998
- 4 -Asia, we can now say with some confidence that the economies affected by this crisis faced acritical mass of vulnerabilities; ex ante, some were more apparent than others, but thecombination was not generally recognized as critical.Once the recent crisis was triggered in early July with Thailand’s forcedabandonment of its exchange rate peg, it was apparently the lethal combination of peggedexchange rates, high leverage, weak banking and financial systems, and declining demand inThailand and elsewhere that transformed a correction into a collapse. Normally the presence ofthese factors would have produced a modest retrenchment, not the kind of discontinuous fall inconfidence that leads to a vicious cycle of decline. But with a significant part of short-termliabilities, bank and nonbank, denominated in foreign currencies (predominantly dollars),unhedged, the initial pressure on domestic currencies led to a sharp crack in the fixed exchangerate structure of many East Asian economies. The belief that local currencies could, virtuallywithout risk of loss, be converted into dollars at any time was shattered. Investors, both domesticand foreign, endeavored en masse to convert to dollars, as confidence in the ability of the localeconomy to earn dollars to meet their fixed obligations diminished. Local exchange rates fellagainst the dollar, inducing still further declines.The weakening of growth also led to lowered profit expectations and contractingnet capital inflows of dollars. This was an abrupt change from the pronounced accelerationthrough 1996 and the first half of 1997. The combination of continued strong demand for dollarsto meet debt service obligations and the slowed new supply, destabilized the previously fixedexchange rate regime. This created a marked increase in uncertainty and retrenchment, furtherreducing capital inflows, still further weakening local currency exchange rates. This viciouscycle will continue until either defaults or restructuring lowers debt service obligations, or thelow local exchange rates finally induce a pickup in the supply of dollars.These virulent episodes appear to be at the root of our most recent breakdowns inMexico and Asia. Their increased prevalence may, in fact, be a defining characteristic of thenew high-tech international financial system. We shall never be able to alter the human responseto shocks of uncertainty and withdrawal; we can only endeavor to reduce the imbalances thatexacerbate them.While, as indicated earlier, I do not believe we are as yet sufficientlyknowledgeable of the full complex dynamics of our increasingly developing high-tech financialsystem, enough insights have been gleaned from the crises in Mexico and Asia (and previousexperiences) to enable us to list a few of the critical tendencies toward disequilibrium andvicious cycles that will have to be addressed if our new global economy is to limit the scope fordisruptions in the future. These elements have all, in times past, been factors in international anddomestic economic disruptions, but they appear more stark in today’s market.1.LeverageCertainly in Korea, probably in Thailand, and possibly elsewhere, a high degreeof leverage (the ratio of debt to equity) appears to be a place to start. While thekey role of debt in bank balance sheets is obvious, its role in the efficientfunctioning of the nonbank sector is also important. Nevertheless, exceptionallyhigh leverage often is a symptom of excessive risk taking that leaves financialsystems and economies vulnerable to loss of confidence. It is not easy to imaginethe cumulative cascading of debt instruments seeking safety in a crisis whenassets are heavily funded with equity. The concern is particularly relevant tobanks and many other financial intermediaries, whose assets typically are lessliquid than their liabilities and so depend on confidence in the payment ofBIS Review   6/1998

Moreover, both financial and nonfinancialbusinesses can employ high leverage to mask inadequate underlying profitabilityand otherwise have inadequate capital cushions to match their volatileenvironments.Excess leverage in nonfinancial business can create problems for lendersincluding their banks; these problems can, in turn, spread to other borrowers thatrely on these lenders. Fortunately, since lending by nonfinancial firms to otherbusinesses is less prevalent than bank lending to other banks, direct contagion isless likely. But the leverage of South Korea’s chaebols, because of their size andthe pervasive distress, has clearly been an important cause of bank problems withtheir systemic implications.2.Interest rate and currency riskBanks, when confronted with a generally rising yield curve, have a tendency toincur interest rate or liquidity risk by lending long and funding short. Thisexposes them to shocks, especially those institutions that have low capital-assetratios. When financial intermediaries, in addition, seek low-cost, unhedged,foreign currency funding, the dangers of depositor runs, following a fall in thedomestic currency, escalate.3.Weak banking systemsBanks play a crucial role in the financial market infrastructure. When they areundercapitalized, have lax lending standards, and are subjected to weaksupervision and regulation, they become a source of systemic risk bothdomestically and internationally.4.Interbank funding, especially in foreign currenciesDespite its importance for distributing savings to their most valued use, short-term interbank funding, especially cross border may turn out to be the Achilles’heel of an international financial system that is subject to wide variations infinancial confidence. This phenomenon, which is all too common in our domesticexperience, may be particularly dangerous in an international setting.5.Moral hazardThe expectation that monetary authorities or international financial institutionswill come to the rescue of failing financial systems and unsound investments hasclearly engendered a significant element of moral hazard and excessive risktaking. The dividing line between public and private liabilities, too often,becomes blurred.6.Weak central banksTo effectively support a stable currency, central banks need to be independent,meaning that their monetary policy decisions are not subject to the dictates ofpolitical authorities.7.Securities marketsRecent adverse banking experiences have emphasized the problems that can ariseif banks are almost the sole source of intermediation. Their breakdown induces asharp weakening in economic growth. A wider range of nonbank institutions,BIS Review   6/1998
- 6 -including viable debt and equity markets, are important safeguards of economicactivity when banking fails.8.Inadequate legal structuresFinally, an effective competitive market system requires a rule of law thatseverely delimits government’s arbitrary intrusion into commercial disputes.Defaults and restructuring will not always be avoidable. Indeed “creativedestruction”, as Joseph Schumpeter put it, is often an important element ofrenewal in a dynamic market economy, but an efficient bankruptcy statute isrequired to aid in this process, including in the case of cross-border defaults.* * *Interest and currency risk taking, excess leverage, weak financial systems, andinterbank funding are all encouraged by the existence of a safety net. In a domestic context, it isdifficult to achieve financial balance without a regulatory structure that seeks to simulate themarket incentives that would tend to control these financial elements if there were not broadsafety nets. It is even more difficult to achieve such a balance internationally among sovereigngovernments operating out of different cultures. Thus, governments have developed a patchworkof arrangements and conventions governing the functioning of the international financial systemthat I believe will need to be thoroughly reviewed and altered as necessary to fit the needs of thenew global environment. A review of supervision and regulation of private financial institutions,especially those that are supported by a safety net, is particularly pressing because thoseinstitutions have played so prominent a role in the emergence of recent crises.As I have testified previously, I believe that, in this rapidly expandinginternational financial system, the primary protection from adverse financial disturbances iseffective counterparty surveillance and, hence, government regulation and supervision shouldseek to produce an environment in which counterparties can most effectively oversee the creditrisks of potential transactions.Here a major improvement in transparency, including both accounting and publicdisclosure, is essential. To be sure, counterparties often exchange otherwise confidentialinformation as a condition of a transaction. But broader dissemination of detailed disclosures ofgovernments, financial institutions, and firms, is required if the risks inherent in our globalfinancial structure are to be contained. A market system can approach an appropriate equilibriumonly if the signals to which individual market participants respond are accurate and adequate tothe needs of the adjustment process. Among the important signals are product and asset prices,interest rates, debt by maturity, detailed accounts of central banks, and private enterprises.Blinded by faulty signals, a competitive free-market system cannot reach a firm balance exceptby chance. In today’s rapidly changing market place producers need sophisticated signals tohone production schedules and investment programs to respond to consumer demand.There is sufficient bias in political systems of all varieties to substitute hope (read,wishful thinking) for possibly difficult pre-emptive policy moves, both with respect to financialsystems and economic policy. There is often denial and delay in instituting proper adjustments.Recent propensities to obscure the need for change have been evidenced by unreported declinesin official reserves, issuance by governments of the equivalent to foreign currency obligations,or unreported large forward short positions against foreign currencies. It is very difficult forpolitical leaders to incur what they perceive as large immediate political costs to containproblems that they see (often dimly) as only prospective.BIS Review   6/1998
- 7 -Reality eventually replaces hope, but the cost of delay is a more abrupt anddisruptive adjustment than would have been required if action had been more pre-emptive.Increased transparency for businesses, financial institutions, and governments is a key ingredientin fostering more discipline on private transactors and on government policymakers. Increasedtransparency can counter political bias in part by exposing for all to see the risks to stability ofcurrent policies as they develop. Under such conditions, failure to act would also be perceived ashaving political costs. I suspect that recent political foot dragging by governments in bothdeveloped and developing countries on the issue of greater transparency is credible evidence ofits power and significance.Transparency, which is so important to foster safe and sound lending practices, is,of course, less relevant for local currency lending if banks are guaranteed with sovereign credits.Moreover, transparency becomes especially difficult to create for organizations and corporationswith large interlocking ownerships. Cross holdings of stock lead too often to lending on the basisof association, not economic value.The list of problems that must be addressed to achieve balance in our futureglobal financial system could be significantly extended, but let me end with a notion that isrelevant also to today’s crisis. It is becoming increasingly evident that supervision and regulationshould address excess nonperforming loans expeditiously. The expected values of the losses onthese loans are, of course, a subtraction from capital. But since these estimates are uncertain,they embody an additional risk premium that reduces the markets’ best estimate of the size ofeffective equity capital even if capital is replenished. It is, hence, far better to remove thesedubious assets and their associated risk premium from bank balance sheets, and dispose of themseparately, preferably promptly.* * *As a consequence of the unwinding of market restrictions and regulations, and therapid increase in technology, the international financial system has expanded at a pace far fasterthan either domestic GDP or cross-border trade. To reduce the risk of systemic crises in such anenvironment, an enhanced regime of market incentives, involving greater sensitivity to marketsignals, more information to make those signals more robust, and broader securities markets --coupled with better supervision -- is essential. Obviously appropriate macro policies, as ever, areassumed. But attention to micro details is becoming increasingly pressing.Nonetheless, it is reasonable to expect that despite endeavors at risk containmentand prevention the system may fail in some instances, triggering vicious cycles and all theassociated contagion for innocent bystanders. A backup source of international financial supportprovided only with agreed conditions to address underlying problems, the task assigned to theIMF, can play an essential stabilizing role. The availability of such support must be limitedbecause its size cannot be expected to expand at the pace of the international financial system. Idoubt if there will be worldwide political support for that.In closing, I should like to stress that the significant degree of volatility thatcontinues to exist in Asian markets indicates exceptionally high levels of uncertainty, borderingon panic. It is not reasonable to expect that the substantial investments needed to implementmeaningful structural reforms can proceed very far until we observe a simmering down offrenetic changes in asset prices and exchange rates.BIS Review   6/1998
- 8 -That is likely to result only when stability of banking and financial systemsgenerally is achieved. As I indicated in my November testimony, the failure of the fragilebanking systems of East Asia to hold steady as financial pressures increased was a definingelement in the developing crisis. The stabilization of those banking systems is crucial, ifconfidence, that has been so thoroughly undercut in this most debilitating crisis, is to be restored.BIS Review   6/1998
Mr. George discusses the problems in Asia and considers the risks they poseto the global economy   Speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, atthe British-American Chamber of Commerce Lunch in London on 22/1/98.The role of the Chamber is to promote Anglo-American trade and investment, andyou’re doing a pretty good job. Two way trade in goods and services is running at around $50billion in each direction, and has grown at an annual average rate of about 8% over the past fiveyears. Over the same period the US has accounted for just over half of all inward directinvestment into this country and close to a third of all UK outward direct investment. Theseexamples suggest that our commercial relationships are in good shape.Economic developments in our two countries have provided a favourablebackdrop to British-American commercial relationships. In the US Goldilocks continues totiptoe through the tulips. Total output has been growing for seven years - at an average annualrate of around 2¼%. Unemployment has fallen from a peak of 7.4% to 4.7%; and consumerprice inflation has averaged 3%.In this country output has been growing for the best part of six years - at anaverage annual rate of close to 3%. Unemployment on a comparable basis has fallen from a peakof 10.7% to below 7% and underlying consumer price inflation has averaged around 2¾%. Ifthat’s not Goldilocks exactly, it is surely her younger sister! And while, in this countryparticularly, we are having to work harder to keep her from tasting Father Bear’s porridge, thereare now signs that the porridge itself may be beginning to cool down - as it needs to do, quitesoon and quite quickly, if we are not to see inflation pick up.Some US business people - and certainly some British business people - engagedin international trade are understandably discomforted by the recent strength of our respectiveexchange rates - not vis-à-vis each other because the dollar-sterling rate has been relativelystable, but against the rest of the world. But the domestic environment, here and in the UnitedStates, remains - actually and prospectively - relatively benign.We are though both exposed to the chilly winds now blowing from Asia. And Ishould like to devote the rest of my remarks to discussing the problems in Asia and consideringI emphasise “problems” in this context because it is important to recognise thatthe situation in Asia differs materially from one country to another, even though they are allinevitably affected to varying degrees - through their close commercial links with each other -by the present economic weakness in the region as a whole.Let me begin with a few words on Japan. Japan is of course much the largesteconomy in Asia. After a spectacular period of sustained growth during the 1980s, the Japaneseeconomy has stagnated over the past six years, as Japan has struggled to overcome the fragilityof its financial system in the aftermath of the infamous Japanese financial bubble. A constrainingfactor for much of this time has been a widespread resistance to the use of public funds tostrengthen the financial system which has, in turn, constrained the financial system in itsextension of domestic credit. Japan has been reluctant, too, given the size of its public debt, touse fiscal policy to stimulate the domestic economy. There is now evidence of a change of hearton both these fronts. Japan - which has an extraordinarily strong external position - was never atthe eye of the storm which struck Asia around the middle of last year. But if, as I expect, thesepolicy changes now lead to somewhat stronger domestic demand growth, and greater confidenceBIS Review   5/1998
- 2 -in Japanese financial institutions, that will make a crucial contribution to the stabilisation of theregion as a whole.The storm struck essentially the ASEAN Four - Thailand, the Philippines,Malaysia and Indonesia - spreading subsequently to South Korea and intermittently batteringHong Kong and elsewhere.It is still not wholly clear - to me at least - quite why the storm suddenly struck.Most crises of this sort have their origins in some evident macro-economic policy failure. Atleast in hindsight there are usually fairly clear tell-tale signs of expanding fiscal deficits and/orlax monetary policies, classically accompanied by evidence of imbalance in the form ofaccelerating inflation or a rapidly deteriorating balance of payments. There were such signs,perhaps most notably in Thailand; but they were not for the most part particularly pronounced inAsia. In fact through the first half of the 1990s, and in some cases for much longer, the countriesin question were remarkably successful. They attracted, by their very success, huge inflows ofcapital from the rest of the world in search of higher returns.The capital inflow made a major contribution to sustaining the economicexpansion in Asia, but, with the benefit of hindsight, the increasing scale of the inflow, andparticularly the form that it took, became an important part of the problem. It was not alleffectively employed. There was overinvestment in some production sectors; much went intoambitious property development; and much went into financial rather than real assets. Thehoped-for higher returns could not be maintained.Again with the benefit of hindsight, it is possible to identify a number ofstructural weaknesses in the mechanisms for financial resource allocation in the recipientcountries. There was, for example, a general lack of reliable financial information, and a lack oftransparency in relation to the financial position, of both public and private sectors. Complexand opaque links between government, financial institutions and non-financial companies madeit difficult for outsiders to understand the real nature of their exposures. Financial markets werenot well developed, leaving the system heavily dependent upon the banks. There was inadequateregulatory or supervisory oversight. There was widespread government influence over financialflows, which importantly also contributed to a perception that much of the borrowing waseffectively under-written by the government. The list could go on.The problem was compounded by the absence of any real perception of exchangerate risk. Borrowers were evidently confident that governments would maintain their exchangerate pegs against the dollar so that unhedged foreign currency debt, much of it at short term,appeared a cheap alternative to domestic currency borrowing. The result was a build-up ofshort-term private sector foreign currency liabilities, by banks and non-banks, which was notfully appreciated, and which left the Asian economies especially vulnerable to a flight of capitalin the event of a change in sentiment. The problem is that national authorities can create theirdomestic currency, if they choose to do so, even if it leads to inflation, but they cannot simplycreate foreign currencies in the same way.So, once the run started, it was violent and contagious.There are certainly all sorts of lessons to be drawn from Asia’s experience for thefuture relating to the structural weaknesses in the financial system that allowed the problem toemerge. These weaknesses certainly need to be addressed in the borrowing countries’ owninterests if they are to continue to reap the great benefits of the free international movement ofBIS Review   5/1998
- 3 -capital without similar extreme volatility in the future. But the immediate question was, and is,how to contain the present problem.Essentially there are two broad options. One is simply to allow financial markets -exchange markets, interest rates, and stock and bond prices - to take the strain, and to seek torestore confidence, and moderate the impact of market movements, by restrictivemacro-economic policy adjustment. The second is to limit the financial market impact and theextent of the associated macro-economic adjustment by providing or arranging alternativeexternal financing. In practice these options are not, of course, mutually exclusive and the realquestion is the appropriate balance between them.Where a country has transparently been pursuing an undisciplined andunsustainable macro-economic policy, most people find it easy to accept that that country shouldbear the burden and adjust, painful though that may be. Many people find that harder to acceptwhere, as in the present case, conventional macro-economic policies have, for the most part,been relatively responsible. There were certainly adjustments to macro-economic policy thatneeded to be made - a more flexible exchange rate regime in some cases, for example, or asomewhat tighter overall macro-economic stance, with perhaps some adjustment between fiscaland monetary policy. And, once the capital outflow had started, adjustment needed to be moreabrupt than might otherwise have been necessary, in order to re-establish confidence. But thereare real dangers in extreme market movements or in excessively severe macro-economicadjustment to contain them. That could cause a vicious circle of domestic default and systemicfinancial weakness in the affected country. And it would have seriously adverse implications - interms of both financial and economic knock-on-effects - for the global economy.That, essentially, is why it is in the self-interest of the international community toattempt to mitigate the market and macro-economic adjustment pressures in Asia by providingfinancial support. It is why the international community responded to the crisis in Asia bypromptly offering very large amounts of official assistance - $17 billion in the case of Thailand,$43 billion for Indonesia and $57 billion for South Korea.But such official financial help cannot be unlimited and it cannot be providedwithout strings. It, too, has real dangers. If it were too readily forthcoming it could encourage“moral hazard”, partly by encouraging macro-economic laxity in other potential borrowingcountries, but especially by encouraging commercial lenders - particularly foreign currencycreditors - in the belief that they will be bailed out if things go wrong. That would be likely toadd to the problem of potentially volatile capital inflows next time around. Not surprisingly, too,there is also strong political resistance in many countries, including notably the United States, tothe idea that public - taxpayers’ - money should be used to bail out private creditors, especiallyforeign creditors.Alternative external financing need not come solely from the public sector.Private finance would, in principle, serve the same purpose, and in many situations market priceadjustments may be sufficient to stem the capital outflow. But given the extent of the loss ofconfidence in the present case it would be optimistic to think that other private lenders werequeuing up to volunteer to stand in place of those that are rushing for the exit. In practice in thepresent situation private support means persuading existing creditors that their assets will bebetter protected if they are prepared to leave them in place. And they may be prepared to do so,if all other major creditors agree to do the same, especially if official support is being madeavailable in parallel. But in this case, too, difficult judgments have to be made. There is a dangerBIS Review   5/1998
- 4 -that, if private creditors have to be in effect coerced into staying put, they will immediately cuttheir positions elsewhere, while they can, adding to the international contagion.Achieving a reasonable balance between market and macro-economic policyadjustment and official and private financing was never going to be easy. It depends upon thegood sense and judgment of key players all around the world - the governments and centralbanks as well as major market participants in both the major creditor and the debtor countries, aswell as the international organisations. My impression is that after the initial shocks, in whichmarket adjustments have been massively overdone, the key players are now co-operating moreeffectively to bring about stabilisation. Within the constraints imposed upon it, the IMF inparticular is playing a very positive leading role. And I particularly welcome the constructivepart which the major commercial banks, from all the main creditor countries, are now playing inrolling over their loans to Korea. This has already helped to begin to stabilise the situation there,and it has provided a breathing space while new market financing is organised. Together withthe availability of the further official support already committed, this, I am reasonably confident,will enable Korea to regain control of its external position, and go on to rebuild confidence onthe back of the underlying strengths of its economy and an already rapidly improving currentaccount. That, in turn, would do more than anything to help to re-establish stability elsewhere.Stabilisation, of course, is not the end of the story - it is simply the necessary firststep.Even assuming, as I do, that we are able in fact to contain the immediate financialturmoil, there is bound to be a substantial economic aftershock. Domestic economic activity inmuch of Asia will inevitably be subdued, with knock-on effects elsewhere, and majorimbalances are likely to emerge in international trading patterns.It is too soon to have any very clear view about the likely scale or duration ofthese economic effects. The IMF, in its Interim World Economic Outlook, based on informationavailable to early December, has tentatively estimated that world gdp growth this year - at3½% - might be around 1% lower than it had expected in the autumn. They expected much ofthe impact to fall on the Asian economies themselves - with forecast growth in the newlyindustrialised Asian economies falling by 2½%, whereas growth in the G7 countries wasexpected to be only about ¼% lower at 2¼%, with a substantially larger impact on Japan. Myimpression is that, notwithstanding these revisions, most analysts would still see the risks asbeing quite heavily on the downside.There have been suggestions that the dampening of activity, particularly in thiscountry and in the US, as a result of these developments is welcome insofar as it will help toprevent the re-emergence of inflationary pressures. And that is true - up to a point, my LordCopper. It is clearly not desirable that the necessary moderation of demand should be narrowlyconcentrated on those sectors that are exposed to international competition. And while some ofthe industrial countries can certainly tolerate significant external deficits for a time, persistent,large deficits would not be sustainable indefinitely. So it is clearly in our own interests as well astheirs that the Asian economies recover as rapidly as possible and that we help them towards thatend. That represents a difficult international economic and financial agenda for the future -which, given the time, is perhaps the subject for another lunchtime occasion. The immediate firststep is financial stabilisation in Asia, and my message to you today is that we are makingprogress towards that end.BIS Review   5/1998
Mr. Fazio discusses Italy and Europe in a world of global finance   Addressby the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Dott. Antonio Fazio, at a conference jointly organised byAIOTE - ASSOBAT - ATIC - FOREX - AIAF and held in Naples on 24/1/98.The expansion of trade and the globalization of markets have maintained the rateof growth of the world economy at a high level in the last ten years. The pace has beenparticularly rapid in the countries where labour is most abundant and least costly and in theindustrial countries whose economies are marked by a high degree of flexibility and risingproductivity.The liberalization of trade in goods and services, the improvement incommunications and the reduction in transport costs increase the efficiency of the allocation ofresources in the world. The gains from trade, the new wealth created are unequally dividedamong the countries involved; they also result in a redistribution of productive capacity and anincrease in specialization and concentration.The globalization of finance allows saving to be allocated and managed moreefficiently at world level; it has made a significant contribution to sustaining productiveinvestment in the fastest growing economies.In the six leading industrial countries the volume of financial assets rose between1982 and 1995 from $30 trillion to $124 trillion and from four to six times their annual GDP atcurrent prices. In the industrial countries the huge rise in public debt contributed to the increasein the supply of financial instruments. Stock markets have grown very rapidly in recent years,especially in the emerging countries. The activity of non-bank intermediaries operating on aglobal scale and investing primarily in shares and bonds and other widely traded assets hasdeveloped, rapidly reaching a very substantial volume.Financial intermediaries, including banks, tend to behave according to operatingmodels that are based on the same theoretical paradigms; sometimes, however, by reactinguniformly to important new information or to changes in expectations concerning individualeconomies, they shift funds very rapidly from one economy to another; they can take positionswith very-short time horizons in foreign exchange or securities of a size that heavily influencescountries with less solid financial structures.1. The Asian crisisForeign investment in the emerging markets by banks and institutional and privateinvestors rose from $50 billion in 1990 to $240 billion in 1996.In mid-1997 the foreign debts of eight emerging Asian economies, includingHong Kong, Singapore and China, amounted to $900 billion or about 40 per cent of the area’sGDP; some two thirds of the total was due to mature within one year.The crisis, which has affected five countries in particular -- Thailand, Indonesia,Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea -- is basically the result of the persistence of largeexternal current account deficits ranging from 3 to 6 per cent of GDP and the consequent rapidaccumulation of foreign debt.These countries’ budgets are generally close to balance and their public debt islimited. The disequilibria are attributable to an excess of private and public sector investment inBIS Review   4/1998
- 2 -relation to the albeit high rate of saving. The returns on investment projects have not alwaysbeen adequate in terms of profitability and exports, partly owing to inefficiencies in theallocation of credit. Competitiveness was eroded by the 40 per cent devaluation of the Chinesecurrency in 1994.Firms’ growing dependence on foreign loans, denominated mostly in dollars, thepreponderantly short-term nature of the debt and shortcomings in the supervision of financialintermediaries made financial systems more fragile. The uncertain performance of the Japaneseeconomy and financial system exerted a negative influence.The crisis started and spread when market participants came to recognize thedifficulty of sustaining exchange rates in the face of the sharp and continuing appreciation of thedollar and expectations of increases in interest rates in the United States. The possibilityemerged of heavy losses by firms; growth prospects were scaled back, with further adverseeffects on stock markets.It is surprising, in this crisis as well, how fast the climate of opinion changedamong investors; it suggests a formation of expectations based on the performance of themacro-economic variables only in the short run and on the attitudes of other market participants.The extrapolative nature of expectations compounds fluctuations in exchange rates and securitiesprices.Once again there was a failure to make a thorough analysis of the underlyingconditions of each economy. To be sure, the shortness of the average maturity of the debtindicated uncertainty among investors regarding long-term growth prospects; nonetheless, untilmid-1997 the flow of capital to the area remained substantial.Notwithstanding the interventions organized by the IMF, the crisis deepened inDecember and the early days of this year. The falls in share prices and exchange rates against thedollar in the five countries mentioned since early 1997 have reached respectively 40 and 50 percent on average; expressed in dollars, share prices have fallen to less than one third of the initiallevel. The markets, and especially the stock markets, of Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong havebeen caught up in the crisis.Events in the markets and the poorer prospects for the economies of the countrieshit by the crisis have adversely affected the already delicate balance of Japan’s capital marketand the quality of its banking system’s assets.The Chinese economy has not been drawn into the crisis, owing to its initiallystrong competitive position, relatively underdeveloped financial system and the preference givento direct inward investment over portfolio investment.The volume of financing mobilized by the IMF, other international organizationsand the nations working to cope with the crisis is without precedent. The World Bank and theAsian Development Bank have been called upon to contribute to objectives beyond the scope oftheir respective institutional mandates. Total disbursements of around $110 billion have eitherbeen made or are envisaged.Banks will have to help in containing the effects of the crisis by rolling overexisting loans.BIS Review   4/1998
- 3 -The intensity of the crisis and the fear of systemic repercussions have produced adisarray in the measures and decisions adopted that suggests the present arrangements forinternational cooperation are inadequate in the face of the challenges posed by the globalizationof markets.2. International monetary developmentsThe backdrop to the Asian crisis is the persistent problem of the uncertainperformance of the Japanese economy and the excessive burden placed on monetary policy.This situation is an inheritance from the Mexican crisis in the early months of1995, which led initially to an abnormal appreciation of the yen and to fears of a prolongeddecline of the dollar.The lowering of interest rates in Japan to near zero led in the second half of 1995to a fall on the order of 20 per cent in the effective exchange rate of the yen. The economy didnot benefit sufficiently in terms of growth, while the imbalance associated with Japan’s largeexternal credit position was aggravated. The weakness of the exchange rate tended to depressshare prices, thereby contributing to the contraction in domestic bank credit.Fiscal policy, even after the recent announcement of a small reduction in taxation,continues to be directed towards the undeniably desirable objective of containing the public debtin the long term. A further reduction in the budget deficit is expected in 1998; there does notappear to be sufficient concern about the deflationary implications of this course in the shortterm.The measures now before the Japanese Parliament provide for a limited stimulusto domestic demand based on tax reductions that should amount to around half a percentagepoint of GDP. The package also includes a plan for shoring up and rescuing the financial andbanking system involving very substantial resources, some $240 billion or 6 per cent of GDP.The long period of expansionary monetary policy in Japan, especially from thespring of 1995 onwards, has substantially increased the supply of yen and lowered the cost ofyen financing. Japanese banks have considerably increased their supply of credit to internationalmarkets; their external liabilities have fallen substantially and they have become large netcreditors.The expansion in the credit provided by the Japanese banking system hasoccurred in a period which has been marked by a very large US current account deficit, atpresent on the order of $180 billion a year, coupled with a persistently high level of directinvestment abroad by American firms. The relatively slack economic conditions in most of theindustrial countries made it easier to finance the external deficits of the countries affected by thecrisis.In a context of low inflation, both actual and expected, the supply of money atvery low interest rates has been reflected in long-term yields in Japan and the other leadingmarkets. The yields on long-term Japanese securities fell to 2.1 per cent in 1997. Japaneseoverseas portfolio investment amounted to more than $80 billion in 1994 and 1995, twice thelevel of the preceding years; it rose further in 1996 and the early part of 1997; around one fifthof the outflow goes directly to the US market.BIS Review   4/1998
- 4 -Foreign investment in US securities amounted to more than $300 billion in 1996,an increase of 50 per cent on 1994 and 1995; compared with three years earlier it more thandoubled. Annual disinvestment is on the order of $100 billion. The yield on ten-year USsecurities fell from 6.4 per cent in 1996 to 5.8 per cent at the end of 1997.The European financial system also received much larger portfolio investmentinflows in 1996 and 1997 than in the preceding years. More than $200 billion flowed intoGermany in 1996, compared with $125 billion in 1995 and $76 billion in 1994. In 1997 theyields on medium-term securities fell faster in Germany than in the United States, reaching 5.3per cent.In some respects the abundance of liquidity in the international market appears to be a replay ofthe situation in the early 1990s, up to the beginning of 1994, following the prolonged USmonetary expansion. The Federal Reserve held short-term rates close to 3 per cent for nearly twoyears. In these circumstances the yields on medium and long-term securities in the leadingmarkets declined steadily and substantially until the last few months of 1993. Those on ten-yearUS Treasury bonds fell from 7 per cent at the beginning of 1992 to just over 5 per cent inOctober 1993; the yields on German securities fell from 8 per cent to below 6 per cent at the endof 1993. The yields on ten-year Italian Treasury paper fell from over 14 per cent in the autumnof 1992 to below 9 per cent in the early months of 1994, after reaching 15 per cent during theEMS crisis.From February 1994 onwards, in connection with the shift in the stance of USmonetary policy, interest rates rose rapidly everywhere; securities prices fell to their level of twoyears earlier.After the Mexican crisis, medium-term interest rates declined gradually again inall the main markets from the spring of 1995 onwards. Monetary policy was tightenedmoderately during 1997 in all the industrial countries except Italy and Spain. The upwardpressures on interest rates are now being neutralized by the need to facilitate the solution of theAsian crisis and the expectations of slower growth in the United States.The funds that have been withdrawn from the Asian economies have flowed tothe financial markets of the industrial countries, above all that of the United States, providingsupport for share and bond prices and the exchange rate of the dollar.The yen has been constantly weak, but in general outside Asia the pattern ofexchange rates has remained orderly.On several occasions during the 1990s the Japanese government announced plansfor fiscal expansion. Although they were substantial, the composition of the measures, theirtemporary nature and incomplete implementation meant that they produced effects of limitedsize and duration. The Japanese economy appears to be dominated by negative expectations forthe medium and long term connected with the prospective ageing of the population. The largefall in property and share prices at the beginning of the 1990s created difficulties for the bankingsystem, which have now been aggravated by the crisis of South Korea and the countries ofSouth-East Asia, which have close commercial, financial and entrepreneurial ties with Japan.The way to overcome the impasse -- given the size of the Japanese economy andits actual and potential strength in terms of productive capacity and saving -- appears to be toBIS Review   4/1998
- 5 -provide an effective stimulus to domestic demand. Monetary policy, with interest rates close tozero, appears to have shot its bolt.The plan now under discussion, if it is approved by Parliament in its entirety,appears to be on a sufficiently large scale as regards the rehabilitation of the financial system. Bycontrast, the stimulus for economic activity appears still to be small. More incisive budgetarymeasures, possibly with short time horizons, could improve the outlook for growth in Japanwithout having adverse long-term effects on its public finances.The levels reached by share prices in the economies affected by the crisis, inconjunction with the stabilization plans drawn up for some of them with the support of the IMF,mean that there are likely to be profitable investment opportunities.In the present phase the international economy is exposed to the risk of systemicinstability, with consequent widespread deflationary effects. International portfolio investmentflows have been of unprecedented size in the last few years; it is necessary at least to monitorthem and to some extent to govern them.A recovery in domestic demand and an improvement in the prospects for growthin Japan would also underpin the yen; they would bring direct benefits for the Asian countriesand indirect benefits for the world economy. There is an increasingly urgent need for a newcomprehensive approach to these problems conforming with the configuration of global marketsand today’s international financial system.3. Europe in the global marketEurope’s markets are increasingly integrated with the international market infinance.The international opening of the Italian and French financial systems hasproceeded apace in the 1990s. Germany had already been playing an important role ininternational markets; at the same time the share of finance coming from abroad has steadilygrown and the large net external credit position built up above all in the 1980s is tending todiminish. The international openness of the United Kingdom remains pronounced, reflecting thepresence of the world’s leading financial centre.The recent monetary developments have had a significant effect on all themarkets of continental Europe. The last three years have seen substantial flows of portfolioinvestment into Germany, France and Italy as well as smaller countries. The fall in long-termyields, which occurred simultaneously everywhere, has reflected the stability of prices and thereduction in government deficits within Europe; more immediately it is the consequence of thelarge inflows of funds that have been a feature of all the European markets.Policies must be designed to maintain in the European Union financialinvestments that tend to be of a temporary nature. The small inflow of direct investment intosome continental European countries, coupled with growth in EU outward direct investment, is acause for concern. There is a need to develop conditions of competitiveness and profitability inproductive systems that will attract the funds of international investors on a permanent basis.The competitiveness of the financial industry in continental Europe is relativelylow. Costs are high; the quality of the services provided is still inadequate. Small markets andBIS Review   4/1998
- 6 -the chronic weakness of some currencies have been a brake on the development of a moremodern financial industry able to compete in the global market.In 1996 the current account of the European Union’s balance of payments showeda surplus of $86 billion or 1 per cent of the area’s GDP. From 1990 onwards the externalaccounts of the EU countries fluctuated between deficit and surplus against a background ofrapid growth of the world economy and moderate growth of domestic demand within the area.The limited increase in output, the steady decline in industrial employment andthe rise in unemployment are indicators of insufficient competitiveness with respect to the rest ofthe world. The markets for goods and above all the market for labour are more rigid incontinental Europe; unit labour costs in industry are comparable with those of the United Statesand Japan, but much higher than those of newly industrialized countries in Asia, Latin Americaand eastern Europe. The tax burden, and especially that relative to employee workers, is high.Population ageing will profoundly alter the balance between the economicallyactive and inactive members of society. The low level of economic growth depresses thepropensity to invest.The prospect of economic and monetary union has forced European countries totake determined action to put their public finances back on a sound footing. To a large extent theeffort required to adjust budget deficits has been made. A high degree of monetary stability hasbeen restored. In several cases however, the tax burden has increased further.Monetary stability is the primary objective of the unification; it serves to createconditions conducive to investment and growth.The parameters for government deficits and public debts are playing a key role inachieving monetary stability in the area; they were nonetheless conceived in a context in whichthe implications of the globalization of commerce and finance were still not sufficiently clear; itis also necessary to try and reduce the burden on the economy of some items of the publicfinances and the ratio of taxes and social security contributions to GDP.To seek to enhance the Union’s competitiveness through the exchange rate wouldbe in contrast with the objective of monetary stability. Competitiveness is in the first place areflection of the share of resources absorbed -- directly in the form of wages, indirectly via someitems of public expenditure -- by labour. It must therefore be enhanced through a cost of labour,a flexibility in its use and a level of direct and indirect taxation that are compatible with today’sgreater international openness of the markets for goods, services and especially finance.Increasing the size and diversification of the capital market can make a decisivecontribution to monetary stability and ultimately to the prosperity of the economy.Europe as a whole is a net creditor with respect to the rest of the world. Thecreation of a single financial market that is no longer segmented by different currencies, in acontext of price stability and greater competitiveness, will offer considerable scope for growth inthe issue and trading of corporate bonds and shares, and for the development of related capitalmarket activities, benefiting enterprises and economic activity and supporting their extension toworld markets.BIS Review   4/1998
- 7 -Looking ahead, the international monetary system will increasingly be dividedinto three large blocs: those of the dollar, the yen and the European currency. The currencies ofsmaller countries will tend to be grouped around, and refer to, the three of greatest importance.The strength of each currency will depend on the credibility of the monetarypolicies adopted. In the background there will be a tendency for the productivity andcompetitiveness of the real economy to take on renewed importance. It is necessary to foresee arecomposition of the area’s value added in the medium term at the expense of more traditionalindustries and to the benefit of more advanced services, especially financial services.Important opportunities are opening up for Italian and European operators thatthey must succeed in grasping by updating strategies and professional skills and by correctlyassessing the related risks through the application of more advanced and complete models.4. ItalyItaly recorded another surplus on its external current account in 1997, of the orderof 60 trillion lire or just over 3 per cent of GDP.Towards the end of the year the country’s net external position returned to nearbalance. Some 470 trillion lire of net government liabilities vis-à-vis non-residents (mostly shortand medium-term lira paper purchased on the Italian market, but with about one fifth consistingof foreign currency bonds issued abroad) were matched by net assets of more than 350 trillionheld by the non bank private sector, about 100 trillion held by the Bank of Italy and smalleramounts held by banks and other financial operators.The Bank of Italy’s gold reserves amount to 2,500 tonnes; in addition the centralbank’s external position improved from 51 trillion lire at the end of 1995 to 96 trillion at the endof last year.Households and firms have converted Italy’s substantial current account surplusesinto external financial assets. They first repaid foreign currency debts taken on in earlier yearsand then increased their holdings abroad. Their overall position in foreign currency improvedfrom near balance in 1993 to a surplus of more than 200 trillion lire last September.Capital outflows in the form of portfolio investment increased from a monthlyaverage of 4.5 trillion lire in 1996 to one of about 9 trillion last year. This reflects a propensityfor portfolio diversification aimed at achieving a better combination of risk and return, a processthat is structural and that is bound to become more pronounced over the next few years.Increasingly, these outflows are being channelled through Italian and foreign intermediariesspecialized in asset management.Despite the large volume of capital outflows in 1997, the net supply of foreigncurrency in exchange for lire remained very substantially positive, enabling the Bank of Italy toachieve the build-up in its foreign exchange reserves referred to earlier at stable exchange rates.The supply of foreign currency derived not only from the trade surplus but alsofrom a large volume of inward portfolio investment by institutional investors, banks and privateoperators. In response to more favourable domestic conditions and abundant internationalliquidity, the foreign investors continued to make very large purchases in 1997: 118 trillion lire,in line with the previous year. At the same time, the improved climate of confidence wasBIS Review   4/1998
- 8 -reflected in a sharp reduction in the share of purchases foreign investors financed in lire in orderto hedge the exchange risk.Net purchases of Italian government securities by non-residents exceeded issuesby a wide margin. The economy’s regained credibility, the prospects for the consolidation of thepublic finances, low inflation and the upward trend in bond prices encouraged investment andaccentuated the decline in yields on medium and long-term securities, which are nowcomparable to those in the markets with the most stable currencies.Italian savers directed the bulk of their investment to the various forms ofmanaged savings; through this channel they increased their purchases of foreign assets andItalian shares. Problems may arise in this connection with respect to the risks that householdsand firms may sometimes run with this new configuration of their portfolios. The decliningyields on Italian government paper and the lower liquidity of these alternative instruments alsostrengthened the demand for money, and in particular for current account deposits.The climate of confidence that has prevailed in the markets has also beenreflected in the surge in share prices, which has continued even after the outbreak of the Asiancrisis. Financial conditions facilitated major privatizations of public sector banks, coupled withtheir recapitalization, along lines we had frequently suggested.Economic activity remained weak in the first half of 1997, bearing out theforecasts we made at the end of 1996 and early last year. In 1997 the growth in GDP, which hadbeen a disappointing 0.7 per cent in 1996, would have been just over 1 per cent. Incentives forthe purchase of consumer durables stimulated economic activity despite the further fiscaltightening and permitted annual growth estimated at about 1.5 per cent.Investment in plant and machinery has shown signs of picking up, partly inresponse to favourable conditions in Europe; by contrast, the construction sector continues tostagnate.The situation with regard to employment is not improving, however; in fact, inthe more depressed regions it is deteriorating further. Growth in consumer spending is stillhesitant, owing to the uncertain prospects for employment and the slow increase in households’income.Monetary policy has continued to be firmly directed to stabilizing inflation.Consumer price inflation fell below 1.5 per cent on a seasonally adjusted annualbasis in the second half of 1996 and remained at that level until the summer of 1997. In thefourth quarter of last year it rose to around 2 per cent, reflecting the upturn in producer pricesthat had occurred in the second.The expectations regarding inflation have improved continuously and nowindicate a rate of 2 per cent for 1998 and 1999.The lowering of official interest rates from the middle of 1996 onwards wascalibrated in relation to actual and expected inflation and the outlook for the adjustment of thepublic finances, the condition for a lasting return to stability, with constant attention to thechanges in residents’ portfolios and the inflows of foreign capital.BIS Review   4/1998
- 9 -We have kept the exchange rate consistent with the lira’s central parity, with noneed for support intervention in the moments of tension of international origin or related todomestic political developments.The reduction in the official rates, the discount rate and the rate on advances,decided at the end of last year is helping to sustain conditions that, thanks in part to the goodperformance of exports, are likely to foster investment. The growth in GDP in 1998 couldexceed 2 per cent.Italy is still faced with difficulties that will have to be overcome, thereby layingthe foundations for improvements tomorrow; there is a need for behaviour and policies that willensure the saving available is used to strengthen productive investment at home. Over the lastfive years direct investment by Italian firms expanded substantially; the inflow remainedvirtually unchanged; the balance showed a deficit of 30 trillion lire.The quest for higher profits in a climate of renewed confidence in stability andeconomic growth can be directed towards expanding the scale of production and investment,with a view to creating employment.Wage moderation must be maintained, thereby permitting a reduction in unitlabour costs; the albeit limited pressure on prices -- particularly producer prices -- must not beallowed to increase.Last year saw substantial progress towards the consolidation of the publicfinances. On the basis of the latest data, general government net borrowing should be less than 3per cent of GDP. A start has been made on reforms aimed at improving the working of thepublic administration and rationalizing the tax system. Cuts have been made in some expenditureitems and transfers to non-state public bodies reduced.What is needed now is action of a structural nature to consolidate the resultsachieved. Public services must be made more efficient and provide effective support forproductive activity.There is a manifest need for flexible formulas in the use of labour that willenhance its productivity. Unit labour costs must be brought down substantially in the lessdeveloped regions, where both youth unemployment and the underground economy are presenton a large and growing scale and where the labour force participation rate, particularly amongwomen, is very low. It is indispensable to eliminate the rigidities In the economic relationsbetween employers and employees, which prevent wages and salaries and other contractualconditions from adjusting to the level of productivity and the demand for labour. Excessivelyhigh labour costs lead to forms of hidden employment; they prevent most young people fromembarking on a career in the regular economy and, together with high tax rates, give rise toevasion of abnormal proportions.A lack of effective demand is increasingly evident. A low level of investment iscommon to all the European economies; it lies at the root of the decline in employment incertain sectors and the rise in unemployment. It is serious in the more depressed regions,particularly in southern Italy; together with high labour costs, the fall in private and public sectorinvestment is adversely affecting the economic and productive fabric. Appropriate policies arerequired to restore higher rates of investment. Lower unit labour costs and increasedcompetitiveness provide fertile ground for a recovery in investment.BIS Review   4/1998
- 10 -I have spoken at length elsewhere of the potential and actual availability ofprivate saving in Italy. I have endeavoured to show that a higher level of economic activity andfaster growth, combined with monetary and wage stability, can accelerate progress towards thelasting adjustment of the public finances.The price stability that we have regained with a monetary policy that at times hashad to be extremely rigorous, must be bolstered by a competitive and expanding real economy.By pursuing a stable policy from the summer of 1994 onwards we brought therate of inflation back into line with that of the leading industrial countries. Wage moderation, thedrastic reduction in the Treasury borrowing requirement in 1997 and the weakness of prices ininternational markets have helped considerably in the curbing of inflation; as a consequence,long-term interest rates have come down. These results, obtained through an unwaveringcommitment, have made a major contribution to the convergence of Italy’s economy towardsthose of our European partners with a more firmly established tradition of stability.The months from now until the decisions connected with the launch of MonetaryUnion, but also the second part of this year, will prove especially delicate for the entire systemof European exchange rates. In these circumstances monetary policy, while it will continue toguarantee moderate medium-term inflation expectations, is now focused more on the stability ofthe exchange rate.If economic agents’ behaviour is consistent, Italy will be able to maintain theinternational position it has so arduously regained, to the benefit of present and futuregenerations.BIS Review   4/1998
Mr. Patrikis discusses global electronic commerce   Speech by the First Vice-Presidentof the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. Ernest T. Patrikis, at the 1998 International ACHConference in Seattle on 9/3/98.I am very pleased to be here today to discuss global electronic commerce. At the FederalReserve Bank of New York, we have a tradition of embracing emerging technologies as a means offostering the growth of commerce. As early as 1914 the Federal Reserve System was using the telegraphto wire funds across the nation. By 1918, the Federal Reserve Banks had introduced their first dedicatedfunds transfer network. Today, over 350,000 funds transfers are sent over Fedwire every day with a totalvalue of more than $1.1 trillion.So, electronic commerce itself is not new. What is new is the emerging global networkenvironment and its electronic access capabilities. The promise of this global network has broughtelectronic commerce to the forefront of public-policy making. The Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development and other international organizations have expressed their belief that “theexponential growth and diffusion of the Internet is quickly making the promise of widespread electroniccommerce a reality. High-speed, interconnected global networks like the Internet provide new ways toconduct commercial transactions, generate new markets and revenue streams, lower transactional costs,and forge new relationships between businesses and consumers.”Nowadays, it is impossible to speak about the potential explosion of the Internet andelectronic commerce without a discussion of the appropriate role of Government in fostering andregulating electronic commerce. In the United States, the question of the Government’s role in globalelectronic commerce was answered when, in July 1997, the White House released its “Framework forGlobal Electronic Commerce” white paper. The Framework is the clearest and most comprehensivearticulation of the United States Government’s view of its role in the creation of the global informationinfrastructure as a vibrant international market-place. The overriding theme of the Framework wassummed up in a statement made by President Clinton upon the release of the report. He said that:Governments can have a profound effect on the growth of electronic commerce. By theiractions, they can facilitate trade or inhibit it. Government officials should respect theunique nature of the medium and recognize that widespread competition and increasedconsumer choice should be the defining feature of the new digital market-place. Theyshould adopt a market-oriented approach to electronic commerce that facilitates theemergence of a global, transparent, and predictable legal environment to support businessand commerce.To ensure that the acts of the United States Government comport with this view, theFramework sets forth five principles intended to inform the Government’s actions in this area. The firstprinciple is that the private sector should be allowed to take the lead. Although the Government played asignificant role in financing the initial research and development of the Internet, the White Housebelieves that its subsequent expansion has been, and should continue to be, driven primarily by theprivate sector. The Framework takes as a fundamental principle the notion that innovation, expandedservices, broader participation, and lower prices will arise in a market-driven arena. The naturaloutgrowth of this first principle is seen in the Federal Government’s hesitance to issue any regulationsgoverning the use of the Internet and its encouragement of private sector self-regulation.The second principle in the Framework is really a corollary to the first principle andprovides that the Government should avoid undue restrictions on global electronic commerce. Thisprinciple is based on the belief that unnecessary regulation of commercial activities on the Internet willdistort the development of the electronic market-place by raising the cost of products and services forAccording to the third Framework principle, where Government involvement is needed,its aim should be to support and enforce a predictable, minimalistic, consistent, and simple legalBIS Review   26/1998
- 2 -environment for commerce. This legal environment should be based on a commercial law model thatallows for private governance though decentralized, contractual relationships or organized system rules,rather than a top-down regulation model. Moreover, the basic goal of any Government regulation shouldbe to ensure competition, protect intellectual property and privacy, prevent fraud, foster transparency,support commercial transactions, and facilitate dispute resolution.The fourth principle directs the Government to recognize the unique qualities of theInternet in relation to existing regulatory models. We should not assume, for example, that the regulatoryframeworks established over the past sixty years for telecommunications, radio, and television apply tothe Internet. The Framework specifically directs the Government to review, and revise or eliminateexisting laws and regulations that may hinder electronic commerce to reflect the needs of the newelectronic age.Finally, in the fifth principle, the Framework announces what, to many, is the mostimportant principle in connection with electronic commerce and the Internet, namely that electroniccommerce over the Internet should be facilitated on a global basis. In this regard, the United StatesGovernment has identified nine areas where international agreements are needed to preserve the Internetas a non-regulatory medium, one in which competition and consumer choice will largely shape themarket-place. The nine areas are: (1) customs and taxation; (2) electronic payments; (3) a UniformCommercial Code for Electronic Commerce; (4) intellectual property protection; (5) privacy; (6) security;(7) telecommunications infrastructure and information technology; (8) content; and (9) technicalstandards. These nine areas are discussed in some detail in the Framework. I would like to spend the restof my time discussing two of these issues in more detail -- specifically, electronic payments and aUniform Commercial Code on Electronic Commerce.My interest in these areas reflects my belief that advancements in each are essential to thecontinued growth of electronic commerce over the Internet both domestically and globally. Users ofelectronic commerce need safe and reliable payments systems linked to the Internet to facilitate paymentfor goods and services contracted for over the Internet. More fundamentally, contractual relationshipsforged over the Internet must have some basis in a sound legal and technological infrastructure.Electronic PaymentsOver the past few years we have seen the emergence of new technology which allowsindividuals to pay for goods and services over the Internet and over private networks. These paymentmethods have developed along two lines. First, technology exists that allows individuals to makepayments over the Internet and private networks using traditional payment mechanisms such as creditcards. When used in this way, the Internet is simply the next in an evolving line of communicationsmedia used to convey payment information. The underlying payment is governed by the same laws thatwould govern credit card payments at a point-of-sale terminal or over the telephone. Moreover, andperhaps more importantly from a central banker’s perspective, these Internet payment methods remaintied to existing payments systems involving the transfer of balances among accounts at financialinstitutions.“Electronic money,” based on stored-value smart cards and other technologies, is alsounder development. When used in connection with these products, the Internet no longer acts solely as anaccess device to communicate payment information to merchants and banks. Instead, the transfer of“value” over the Internet will become, for all practical purposes, the modern day equivalent of tenderingcurrency in satisfaction of a debt. While private electronic money will not have “legal tender” status,electronic money issuers will use private contractual relationships to effect discharge of their obligations.“Electronic money” is essentially the re-emergence in the United States ofprivately-issued currency, the value of which depends on the financial health of the issuer. Becauseelectronic value is simply a promise of the issuer to pay on demand, the question arises as to whether theissuance of electronic value should be limited to banks and other supervised institutions. In the UnitedBIS Review   26/1998
- 3 -States, banks have been intricately linked to the payments system and, as a result, are subject to uniqueregulatory burdens such as reserve requirements, deposit insurance premiums, and extensive supervision.Some argue that the safety and soundness of the payments system require limiting the issuance ofelectronic money to banks. In fact, some foreign jurisdictions, such as Japan and the European Union,have limited the issuance of electronic currency to banks or credit institutions in EU parlance.Unlike Europe and Japan, however, the United States is, at least for the time being,remaining silent on the issue of nonbank issuance of electronic money. The White House believes thatthe commercial and technological environment is changing far too rapidly for it to be able to developpolicy that is both timely and appropriate. In the near term, therefore, the White House is calling forcase-by-case monitoring of electronic payments experiments.In keeping with the spirit of the White House Framework, Federal bank supervisors inthe United States have expressed a clear willingness to listen to what the private sector has to say onissues involving emerging electronic payments. For example, in 1996 the Board of Governors issuedproposed regulations concerning the applicability of Regulation E to stored-value cards. As part of thatproposed rule making, the Board requested comments from the public as to whether part or all ofRegulation E should apply to electronic money or value residing on a computer system orpersonal-computer hard drive. Similarly, the FDIC requested public comment on the application ofFederal deposit-insurance coverage to electronic value represented on computer systems. This openness,combined with an increasing willingness to let the banking industry partner with technology and otherindustries, reflects a commitment on the part of bank supervisors in the United States to allow the privatesector to direct the future of electronic commerce and payments.From a longer term perspective, however, the market-place and industry self-regulationalone may not fully address all of the issues associated with e-money. The White House Frameworksuggests that Government action may be necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of electronicpayments systems, to protect consumers or to respond to important law-enforcement objectives. Ofcourse, the White House would work closely with the private sector to inform policy development andensure that governmental activities flexibly accommodate the needs of the emerging market-place.From a central bank perspective, one of the most fundamental questions raised byelectronic payments is its impact on monetary policy, especially if its development is as widespread assome have predicted. In the near term, it appears that Internet payments systems will not significantlyimpact monetary policy. For the most part, the Internet and other communication networks are currentlybeing used to facilitate existing banking transactions using traditional banking settlement channels. Mostpayments over the Internet simply result in the movement of funds from a bank account in one institutionto one in the same or another bank. This should have few, if any, implications on the conduct of UnitedStates monetary policy or the measurement of the United States money supply. “Money” as defined byM1, M2, or M3, would still be held in accounts at banks and would be reported to the Federal Reservethrough existing reporting mechanisms.If, however, Internet payments evolve to the point where digital “coins” or other privateelectronic money begin to be widely used and circulated like Federal Reserve bank notes, the potentialimplications for monetary policy could be much greater. The effect that stored value, whether smart cardor computer based, has on monetary policy will in large part turn on the extent to which it shifts themoney supply out of the banking sector. When stored value is issued by banks, this is not a real risk. AsGovernor Edward Kelly noted in a 1996 speech before a cyber-payments conference, bank liabilitiesincurred through issuing stored-value cards should be included in the statistical reports that banks mustcurrently submit to the Federal Reserve Board.In addition to monetary policy concerns, other factors could trigger the need for theGovernment to resolve the issue of bank versus nonbank issuance of electronic value. For example, as Inoted earlier, banks are subject to extensive regulation and supervision at least in part to ensure the safetyand soundness of the payments systems. If nonbanks begin to take significant market share away fromBIS Review   26/1998
- 4 -banks because of an inherently lower cost structure, that raises serious questions about a level playingfield and whether banks can ever fairly compete. If nonbanks begin offering through the Internet many ofthe payment services, or alternatives to the payment services, now offered exclusively by banks, it raisesa real question about the ultimate value of a bank charter, and what it really means to be a bank. It couldbe argued, for example, that there is no such thing as a nonbank issuer of e-money -- but only supervisedbank issuers and unsupervised bank issuers.Another related concern is the emergence of nonbank Internet financial firms that havebalance sheets closely resembling that of banks, but do not have access to the lender-of-last resort. Whathappens if these institutions have a liquidity crisis? What if that crisis is so large that it threatens togridlock the entire payments system? What role do the supervisors play? What role should thesupervisors play?In addition to these domestic policy concerns, the Administration’s position on electronicpayments will be informed by international developments. A number of international organizations inwhich the Federal Reserve plays a role, such as the Bank for International Settlements and the G-10central bank governors, have already completed important studies on aspects of electronic banking andpayments. For example, a multi-national task force on the Security of Electronic Money was establishedby the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, and the Group of Computer Experts, of the G-10central bank governors. This task force, which was chaired by Israel Sendrovic of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, issued a report on its findings entitled “Security of Electronic Money” in August1996. The Task Force examined primarily consumer-oriented stored-value products by surveying theleading global suppliers of both card-based and software-based stored-value systems. The reportconcluded that the technology security measures of these systems are being designed to achieve anadequate level of security relative to other forms of common retail payments, assuming that they areimplemented appropriately.What remains to be seen is whether the infrastructure needed to create binding electroniccontracts between previously unaffiliated parties can be developed to meet the needs of consumers andmerchants globally. This leads me to my second topic -- the establishment of a Uniform CommercialCode for Electronic Commerce.Uniform Commercial Code For Electronic CommerceThe White House Framework states that, in order “to encourage electronic commerce, theUnited States Government should support the development of both a domestic and global commerciallegal framework that recognizes, facilitates and enforces electronic transactions worldwide.” In keepingwith its belief that the private sector should take the lead in electronic commerce issues, the White Houseis largely relying on the efforts of the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws andthe American Law Institute, the sponsors of the Uniform Commercial Code, to produce the desireddomestic commercial law framework. Internationally, the United States Government is working withorganizations such as the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, the OECD,UNIDROIT and the International Chamber of Commerce to achieve the necessary global commercial lawframework.The United States has adopted, and has urged others to adopt, the following draftingprinciples. First, parties should be free to order the contractual relations between themselves as they seefit. Second, rules should be technology neutral -- in other words, the rules should neither require norassume a particular technology -- and should be forward looking -- should not hinder the use ordevelopment of technologies in the future. Third, existing rules should be modified and new rules shouldbe adopted only as necessary or substantially desirable to support the use of electronic technologies.Finally, any drafting process should involve the high-tech commercial sector as well as businesses thathave not yet moved on-line.BIS Review   26/1998
- 5 -Unlike the situation in the retail electronic payments area, where there has beensignificant private-sector resistance to developing legal standards, there is an increasing consensus, bothdomestically and abroad, that electronic commerce will not flourish until there are laws addressing thevalidity of electronic contracts and the legal significance of attribution procedures used by parties todetermine the identity of the sender of an electronic message.Domestic EffortsDomestic efforts to address these needs have proceeded under two very different venues.First, there is the work of the NCCUSL and the ALI to modernize the UCC to reflect the realities of theInternet. In the absence of Federal legislation or regulation, the NCCUSL/ALI drafting process isattractive for at least two reasons. First, the general approach of the UCC is consistent with the views ofmany in the emerging electronic commerce community in that it allows for variation through privatecontract. Second, NCCUSL/ALI has been extremely successful in ensuring that commercial law isessentially the same in substance among the fifty states. This success largely results from the care thatNCCUSL takes in establishing drafting committees that reflect diverse interests affected by the particularlegislation being considered.With respect to electronic commerce, NCCUSL and the ALI have established a draftingcommittee that will recommend changes to the general definition provisions of the UCC located inArticle 1. The drafting committee’s mandate is broad: consider and draft revisions and additions toArticle 1 in light of developments since its adoption. One of the most significant developments that hasoccurred since the adoption of Article 1 is the shift from paper to electronic media. At a minimum,therefore, it is expected that Article 1 will be revised to recognize the validity of electronic signatures andelectronic writings.Another effort rapidly proceeding under the auspices of NCCUSL and the ALI is a newUCC article on licenses which will govern not only traditional software contracts but any license ofinformation (for example, books, movies, databases). In the process of addressing concerns unique to theinformation industry, the drafters have considered issues, such as electronic contracting, that everyindustry will likely need to consider. For example, the February 1998 draft of Article 2B provides that a“record” cannot be denied legal effect solely on the grounds that it is electronic. Article 2B also addressesthe use of “attribution procedures” as a signature substitute in an electronic commerce environment. Inthis regard, Article 2B, as currently drafted, largely mirrors the concept of commercially reasonablesecurity procedures found in Article 4A of the UCC governing funds transfers.Article 2B does not, however, address some rather important aspects of electronic recordsnamely, the admissibility of electronic records in legal proceedings and the use of electronic records tosatisfy legal requirements that original documents be retained. Regardless of whether Article 2Bultimately addresses all of these issues, the adoption by all 50 states of Article 2B is still a long way off.Moreover, the principles stated in Article 2B are restricted to the scope of Article 2B. Thus, even whenArticle 2B is adopted, it will not affect a significant portion of electronic commerce. With that in mind,NCCUSL established a separate drafting committee to tackle electronic transaction issues generally in anew Uniform Electronic Transaction Act. The ETA, although on a “fast track”, is still at a very earlydrafting stage. Several important decisions, including the scope of the Act, are still being debated.Having said that, the Act is expected to provide for the legal recognition of electronic signatures andrecords in most commercial transactions, and for the use of electronic records as evidence.In addition to the uniform state law efforts of NCCUSL/ALI, there has been aproliferation of non-uniform United States state laws addressing electronic commerce that are generallyreferred to as “digital signature” or “electronic signature” laws. There are at least 43 states that haveenacted, or are currently considering, electronic signature legislation. These state law initiatives varyconsiderably. For example, many states have limited the scope of their legislation to specific types oftransactions (for example, transactions with the State, medical records, motor vehicle records). However,BIS Review   26/1998
- 6 -the biggest difference concerns the type of signatures covered, electronic signatures versus digitalsignatures, and the effect of those signatures on electronic documents.The more general term -- electronic signature -- can be used to describe any letters,characters, or symbols manifested by electronic or similar means and executed or adopted by a party withan intent to authenticate a writing. Examples of an electronic signature include a name typed at the end ofan e-mail message by the sender or a digitalized image of a handwritten signature of the sender. A“digital signature” is a subset of electronic signatures and represents a unique way to “sign” an electronicmessage.A digital signature is simply a string of alpha-numeric characters. It is created by runningan electronic message through a one-way hash function (thereby creating a unique digest or fingerprint ofthe message) and then using public key cryptography to encrypt the resulting message digest. Like allelectronic signatures, a digital signature can serve the same function as a handwritten signature in that itcan be used to signify authorship or assent. A digital signature, however, also serves an importantsecurity function that a handwritten signature and many electronic signatures may not. Because of the useof the hash function, a digital signature allows the receiver of a message to determine whether themessage has been altered since it was digitally signed.State legislation in this area tends to address either electronic signatures (23 states) ordigital signatures (16 states), but not both. States with legislation on electronic signatures differ on thequestion of what qualifies as an electronic signature. Several states have taken the UCC Article 1approach and recognize any form of electronic mark intended to serve as an electronic signature. Otherstates, however, require that several conditions be met before an electronic signature will be legallyenforceable. Generally, for these states, in order for an electronic signature to be effective it must: (1) beunique to the person using it; (2) be capable of verification; (3) be under the sole control of the personusing it; (4) be linked to the data in such a manner that if the data is changed the signature is invalidated;and (5) conform to regulations adopted by the Secretary of State.Digital signature statutes typically provide for the promulgation of regulations governingthe implementation and use of a digital signature infrastructure. The digital signature infrastructurecontemplated by these statutes involves a trusted third party, usually a certification authority or CA,whose job is to confirm that the private key used by a sender to sign an electronic message is in fact theprivate key of the purported sender. Because the legitimacy of the digital signature infrastructure largelydepends on the procedures established by the CA, most digital signature statutes define the obligations ofthe sender, relying party, and CA with respect to the use of digital signatures and certificates and setstandards of conduct or CAs. In addition, most digital signature statutes establish a licensing procedurefor CAs.As an aside, on January 12 of this year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencyauthorized Zions First National Bank to establish an operating subsidiary that would serve as acertification authority. The OCC determined that acting as a CA is the functional equivalent of notaryservices long offered by banks and a natural outgrowth of bank identification and verification skills. Theoperating subsidiary will be licensed and operated in accordance with the Utah digital signature statute.The Utah law, which served as a model for many of the other states’ digital signature laws, insulatescertification authorities, that properly perform their functions, from liability.Of course, the ultimate purpose of any digital and electronic signature statute is toprovide for the validity of electronic signatures. All of the state statutes provide that use of an electronicor, if appropriate, digital signature on an electronic record will be treated in the same manner as ahandwritten signature on paper. Most of the digital signature statutes, however, also include a legalpresumption that the person whose name is associated with a digital signature is in fact the person whosigned the document.BIS Review   26/1998
- 7 -One final point that I would make in connection with state law initiatives is what lawyerscall conflicts of laws law -- that is, most of the legislative efforts just described do not address the degreeto which the state enacting the legislation will recognize electronic signatures created in compliance withanother state’s statutory scheme. These statutes also generally fail to address the validity of unsignedelectronic documents or the evidentiary use of electronic records generally.If you are interested in learning more about these statutes, you might want to visit thewww.mbc.com web site. This web site provides a summary of all existing and pending digital andelectronic signature legislation in the United States with links to the actual legislation where possible.Like the states, Congress is also divided on the appropriate scope and content ofelectronic authentication legislation. In September 1997, the House passed “The Computer SecurityEnhancement Act of 1997”. If passed by the Senate, that act would establish a national policy panel fordigital signatures. The panel, which would be composed of Federal and state Government as well asprivate technical and legal experts and interested members of the public, would serve as a forum forexploring all relevant factors associated with the development of a national digital signatureinfrastructure. The panel would be expected to produce model practices and procedures for CAs,standards to ensure consistency among jurisdictions that license CAs, and audit standards for CAs.In addition to this bill, at least three other bills have been introduced into Congresswithin the past five months that propose specific rules for electronic signatures. The Electronic FinancialServices Efficiency Act introduced by Representatives Baker and Dreier (H.R. 2937) on November 8,1997 is by far the most comprehensive of the three. The Baker bill would place electronic authenticationmethods on par with traditional written signatures provided that they reliably establish the identity of thesender or maker of the electronic communication, and reliably verify that the message has not beenaltered. Public key cryptography and signature dynamics technology are specifically recognized astrustworthy electronic authentication techniques. Other technologies would be deemed satisfactory if theymeet certain criteria.One aspect of the Baker bill which has generated a lot of interest is its establishment ofan industry self-regulatory organization along the lines of the National Association of Securities Dealers.Any person or entity -- not just a certification authority -- wishing to provide electronic authenticationservices in the United States would have to be registered with the SRO. The SRO would establish acommittee, supervised by the Department of Treasury, to develop, refine, and apply standards respectingthe role and responsibilities of parties involved in electronic authentication services and the licensing andregistration of certification authorities.On February 2, 1998, Senator Bennett, Chairman of the Banking Committee’sSubcommittee on Financial Services and Technology, introduced the Digital Signature and ElectronicAuthentication Law of 1998 (S. 1594) which is aimed at facilitating the use of electronic authenticationby United States financial institutions. The bill establishes the right of a financial institution to useelectronic authentication if it has entered into an agreement with any counterparty or has established abanking, financial, or transactional system using electronic authentication and the use of the electronicauthentication would be valid according to the relevant agreement or system rules.Under this bill, financial institutions would be exempt from state law regulationsgoverning the registration, licensing, or use of electronic authentication as well as from any state lawlimitations or impositions of fees in connection with electronic authentication services. Absentcompliance with state laws, however, use of electronic authentication by financial institutions would notbe eligible for the state law presumptions or benefits, including the presumption that an electronicsignature is the equivalent of a manual signature.Moreover, financial institutions remain subject to supervision by the appropriate bankingsupervisor which may, by regulation or order, preclude a financial institution from using electronicauthentication in its business if it determines that such use would not be consistent with safe and soundBIS Review   26/1998
- 8 -banking practices, or if such use would threaten the safety and soundness of the institution, subsidiary oraffiliate. In addition, like the Baker bill, the Bennett bill expressly provides that state consumerprotection laws, as well as the Truth in Lending Act and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, continue togovern consumer transactions that use electronic authentication.Finally, in early November 1997, Representative Eshoo introduced the ElectronicCommerce Enhancement Act of 1997 (H.R. 2991), which would require Federal agencies to make formsavailable electronically and to allow individuals to submit forms electronically over the Internet.Digitally signed forms accepted in accordance with this act would have the same force and effect as ifthey contained a written signature. In addition, the bill calls for the issuance of digital signatures toappropriate Federal employees and the establishment of guidelines governing the manner in whichFederal agencies accept certificates for digital signatures. These guidelines will permit a Federal agencyto accept certificates issued by the agency or a trusted third party provided that: (1) the trusted third partyis licensed or accredited by a state or local Government or an appropriate accreditation body; and (2) “inaccordance with commercially reasonable standards, accepts liability for and is insured against negligentissuance or handling of certificates”.International EffortsWhile the United States Government has for the most part been an observer of thedomestic efforts to establish a legal infrastructure for electronic commerce, it has been an activeparticipant in the international arena through organizations such as the United Nations Commission onInternational Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and the Organization for Economic Co-Operation andDevelopment (OECD).UNCITRAL was established by the General Assembly in 1966 with the general mandateto further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade. In 1996,UNCITRAL adopted a Model Law on Electronic Commerce. The Model Law is aimed at removing legalobstacles to the use of electronic communications. Thus, the Model Law provides that information shallnot be denied legal effect solely on the grounds that it is generated, sent, received or stored by electronicmeans, and establishes rules for when an electronic writing and signature will satisfy existing legalrequirements for writings and signatures. The Model Law also provides solutions for legal issues thatarise in the use of electronic communications, such as the admissibility of electronic records and theattribution of electronic communications to particular parties.UNCITRAL, along with OECD and others, has now undertaken to explore possible legalrules underpinning digital and other electronic signature systems; specifically the cross-borderrecognition of electronic signatures. While the United States would have preferred UNCITRAL to haveextended the work of the Model Law to cover additional contracting issues, a large number of othercountries supported work on digital and other electronic signatures. The United States has chosen to fullyparticipate rather than risk the emergence of rules which, while not binding on any state, might not be assupportive of market-based commerce as the United States believes it should be, and which would carry aUN imprimatur.The core issues from the United States perspective have been whether agreement can beobtained on rules that are open to all systems, that is rules that recognize leading technologies such asPublic Key Infrastructure, or PKI, but also provide legal support for other systems. Moreover, variablePKI formats have been developed, and differing levels of PKI certification will be in commercial use,including CA generated high and low level certs, and probably non-CA issued certs. The United Statesposition has been that the different user paradigms may require different legal standards andpresumptions, which should not be limited to existing PKI-based systems.In addition, the United States has advocated that any UN or other international legal texton signature rules should incorporate both regulated licensed systems and private sector non-regulatedsystems. Furthermore, such rules should be open to non-digital technologies. From the standpoint ofBIS Review   26/1998
- 9 -commercial law, delineation of fall-back rules on obligations, assurances, and reliance would benecessary to achieve the necessary risk allocation and commercial usage. This will probably requiresliding standards for attribution, commercial reliance, liability and security depending on the types oftransactions and the imperatives of market cost and pricing. Carveouts may be appropriate for closed orcontrolled access systems.So far, there has been a significant amount of debate, but little agreement, on these and ahost of other issues. While a number of countries in the Working Group appear to agree that any projectshould, to the extent possible, follow the media neutral approach taken in the 1996 Model Law, thus farthe focus has tended to be on the cross-border recognition of the use of digital signature technology. Thismay be indicative of the fact that several countries have enacted or have proposed digital signaturelegislation. Spain, Germany, Malaysia and Italy are among the foreign jurisdictions that have enacteddigital signature legislation. Other countries such as Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom havedeveloped guidelines on digital signatures.The Working Group has agreed on at least one important issue. Even though PKItechnology can be used to encrypt messages, questions relating to the use of PKI and other cryptographyfor security purposes are outside of the scope of this UNCITRAL effort. Of course the United Statescontinues to advocate the development of a voluntary market-driven key management infrastructure andof key recoverable encryption products. And while this position is not reflected in the OECD’sGuidelines for Cryptography Policy, I am sure that the Administration will continue to promote keyrecovery both domestically and abroad.In closing, I would like to echo the sentiment expressed in the Framework: “The successof electronic commerce will require an effective partnership between the private and public sectors, withthe private sector taking the lead.” The creation of private fora such as this conference, which bringtogether Government representatives and industry, provides an exciting opportunity to further thatpartnership. I challenge each of you to use this opportunity not just to recite your company’s or youragency’s views but to listen to the ideas and concerns of other conference participants and incorporatethem into both public and private policy initiatives.BIS Review   26/1998
Mr. George discusses Britain in Europe and the economics of EMU   Speech by theGovernor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at the Borsen in Copenhagen on 6/3/98.I am delighted to be here this morning, and to have this opportunity to meet with theDanish financial community.I would like to use this opportunity to explain to you something of the British attitude toEurope - as I see it - and in particular our attitude to monetary union. I am well aware that we Britishhave something of a reputation for stubbornness about Europe. I should like to try to persuade you thismorning that while we do have some - not wholly irrational - misgivings, we are nevertheless as anxiousas anyone to see the project succeed. We have to be - it is clearly in our national interest that it should.Let me make clear at the outset that, of course, I recognise that monetary union isfundamentally a political issue. It necessarily involves some deliberate pooling of national sovereigntyover important issues of public policy - monetary policy and overall fiscal policy - just as the singlemarket involved the pooling of sovereignty over aspects of trade and competition policy and so on.Decisions about monetary union will quite rightly be taken by elected politicians, according to theirperception of its long-term political impact on the future of Europe, as well as its impact on the futureprosperity of their countries, and they will have to carry their electorates with them.As a central banker I have nothing to say about the politics of monetary union. But it isalso, of course, about economics, and the economics of monetary union could go either way; if it goeswell, that certainly could yield political benefits, but if the economics were to go wrong, then that couldblow back on the politics of Europe and give rise to tensions. I shall concentrate my remarks thismorning on the economics of EMU.The economic pros and cons have in fact been exhaustively debated in the UnitedKingdom and the arguments are now reasonably well defined, even though different opinions inevitablyattach different weights to them.On the positive side, the crucial and unique economic advantage of monetary union isexchange rate certainty within the euro area - not just the reasonable de facto stability that might resultfrom each EU member state individually pursuing disciplined macro-economic policies in parallel - butactual exchange rate certainty. And that is a very real economic advantage as UK exporters presentlysuffering from the strengthening of sterling over the past eighteen months will readily tell you! One canargue that exchange rate certainty is not an essential complement to the European single market - anymore than exchange rate fixity is essential to achieving benefits from free trade more generally. But thereis no doubt that intra-European exchange rate certainty would - through the increased competitionresulting from greater transparency of prices and lower transactions costs, through broader and deepercapital markets, and through the associated improvement in economic resource allocation - enhance thebenefits derived from the single market. Whether or not it is essential, therefore, most people would, Ithink, agree that, other things equal, exchange rate certainty would be very desirable in this context.The potential disadvantage of monetary union can equally be simply stated, though it isperhaps more difficult to assess. Essentially there is a risk that the single monetary policy - the single,one-size-fits-all, short-term interest rate - within the euro area, which is a necessary corollary of thesingle currency, will not in the event prove to be appropriate to the domestic needs of each of theeuro-member countries. There is no doubt that such risk exists. It may result from cyclical divergence -where for example would we be in the UK now, confronted as we are with relatively strong domesticdemand growth, if we were obliged to have German- level interest rates? Or where would Germany andFrance be as they struggle to sustain domestic demand if they were constrained to have interest rates atthe UK level? The risk may arise from differences in fiscal positions even though these are to beconstrained through the Stability Pact. Or it may result from economic shocks of some sort that have abigger impact on some countries than on others. The rise in oil prices in the early 1970s or Germanreunification are classic examples.BIS Review   23/1998
- 2 -So the risk of divergent monetary policy needs within the euro area is real. And thedamage it could cause if serious tensions between member countries were to emerge is substantial,because alternative adjustment mechanisms, such as labour migration or fiscal redistribution, that existwithin individual countries, and which help to alleviate the similar regional tensions that arise at thenational level, are not well-developed at the pan-European level.The Maastricht Treaty, of course, recognised this risk, and the famous convergencecriteria were designed precisely as a means of reducing the risk to manageable proportions by requiringthat, before they join the euro club, countries should have achieved at least a minimum degree ofmacro-economic convergence - demonstrating their commitment to macro-economic discipline throughboth fiscal consolidation and monetary policy directed at effective price, and exchange rate, stability.And there is no doubt that all European Union member states have made huge progress towardsmacro-economic stability over the past few years. The betting in financial markets is therefore that when,in early May, the Heads of State come to make their decision, a broadly based euro will indeed go ahead.The nagging concern is whether this determined pursuit of macro-economic stability willbe maintained - whether in fact the degree of macro-economic convergence that has been achieved islikely - in the terms of the Treaty - to be “sustainable”.A particular worry is that macro-economic stability, on its own, is not enough. It has notbeen enough to prevent the progressive emergence of very high, and very different, levels ofunemployment in a number of the major Continental European economies. Unemployment has been forsome considerable time, and it remains, much the most urgent and important economic issue confrontingus in Europe. I do not suggest for a moment that the right answer would be to abandon macro-economicdiscipline and revert to old-fashioned demand management policies. In anything other than the very shortterm that would be likely to make matters worse. I share the broad consensus view that Europe’sunemployment problems originate essentially in rigidities on the supply-side of the economy. The pointis that unless we are all more successful in bringing down this structural unemployment, throughmicro-economic policies designed to improve structural, supply-side flexibility, then some countriescould find it difficult to continue to live with a common macro-economic discipline without significanttensions.Some people here on the Continent who share this concern are inclined to argue that if aeuro-participating country were to find itself in this situation - and given that it would have nomacro-economic way out, for example, through exchange rate adjustment, or monetary relaxation, orfiscal stimulus beyond the limits of the Stability Pact - it would then have an overwhelming incentive totake the sort of supply-side measures which have proved so difficult to implement hitherto. I am not surethat you can necessarily rely upon that making life very much easier. But what I think this discussionpoints up, is the broader conclusion that if the euro is to go ahead in current conditions, as I assume thatit will, then supply-side flexibility will become more crucially important that ever across the whole euroarea.The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced last October that the United Kingdom wouldexercise its opt-out and not participate in the first wave of euro membership. That was a disappointmentto some of our European partners. But it was a considerable relief to others, because UK participationfrom the outset would certainly have complicated the project - not least because of the substantialcyclical divergence between ourselves and the major countries on the Continent.But the Chancellor also made it clear that the British Government is not opposed to euromembership as a matter of principle; it will make its decision on pragmatic, economic, grounds, andsubmit that decision to Parliament and to the British people in a referendum. The Chancellor recognisedthat - barring some fundamental and unforeseen change in economic circumstances - it was unrealistic tothink that a decision could be made during the lifetime of the present Parliament - which could extend toMay 2002. But he stressed that in the meantime the United Kingdom should prepare - both for the euro’sintroduction on the Continent on 1 January 1999 and for our own eventual participation.BIS Review   23/1998
- 3 -This statement was the first by a British Government to declare for the principle ofmonetary union. It implies that the United Kingdom is to be regarded effectively as a “Pre-In”. Itrecognised that the single currency will affect us whether we are in or out of it, and that it is clearly in ournational interest to play a full part in ensuring that the euro is successful.This, in my view, provides a solid foundation for a continuing, positive and constructiverelationship between the United Kingdom and those EU member states that do participate in the firstwave of the euro. And that must be in the interest of both sides: just as we benefit from a stable andprosperous Europe, so too the Continental European interest lies in a stable and prosperous Britain - andthat mutual interest above all is the thing we must all hold on to. To allow the euro to become a divisivefactor in the broader relationship between European Union member states would be collectively to cut offour nose to spite our face!What then can the United Kingdom bring, initially as an ‘out’, or ‘pre-in’, to the party, interms of contributing to the euro’s success?There are, I think three things in particular.Most immediately the Government has undertaken to use its current term as President ofthe European Union Council of Ministers to promote an orderly decision-making process during thecrucial next few months. Not being part of the first wave leaves us free to concentrate on that, and whilethere are issues - such as the vexed question of the Presidency of the European Central Bank - which onlyothers can resolve, the UK’s role is to give them every opportunity to reach timely decisions.We can, secondly, contribute positively and directly to the success of the euro throughthe City of London’s financial markets.The potential benefits of the euro derive importantly, as I have said, from the exchangerate certainty which it will provide across the euro area. But the potential benefits will deriveimportantly, too, from the greater transparency and liquidity of unified financial markets in theeuro-denominated instruments rather than the fragmented markets denominated in the various nationalcurrencies that we have now. Providing transparent and liquid, competitive, innovative andwell-regulated financial markets is one of the things which the City does particularly well. There will bea vigorous Euro-euro market in London, just as there are vigorous markets in Euro-DM, Euro-francs,Eurodollars and so on now. If not our dowry exactly, since we will not participate in the first wave, itwill be our wedding present.The wholesale financial markets in the UK derive their strength from London’s positionas a uniquely international, rather than simply a national or regional European, financial centre. Thisreflects the critical mass of markets and financial services in commercial and investment bankingavailable in London including the strongest financial businesses from all around the world, and includingleading Danish institutions. For instance, there are more banks operating in the City which areincorporated abroad than there are domestic banks, and more than half the total deposit base (over £1trillion) of the UK banking system is denominated in foreign currencies. And, the fact that so manyforeign-owned institutions - including very many from our European partner countries - continue to buildtheir presence in London, suggests that they share this perception.The City in this capacity is, I know, seen as something of a mixed blessing by somepeople on the Continent. There is a view that the euro should in some sense ‘belong’ to the participatingcountries and to them alone. If that view were to prevail it would point in the direction of one form ofbureaucratic regulation or another - no doubt with a nod in the direction of monetary policyconsiderations as justification - which would damage the euro at least as much as it would harm thefinancial markets of the City. At the same time some of these same people argue for a successful, strongand widely-used euro that will take its proper place alongside the dollar and the yen as an internationalBIS Review   23/1998
- 4 -trading and portfolio currency, and in that context they positively welcome the active participation ofLondon.In the end I do not think there is very much choice. In a world of increasingly integratedcapital markets and liberalised capital movements it is inconceivable that the international use of the eurocould be unnaturally constrained. There will be active euro markets in the major financial centres of theworld, including in London, which will be ready to trade in the whole range of euro wholesale financialproducts from day one.And that will be in the interest of financial activity right across Europe. Like trade ingoods, trade in financial services is a positive sum game, so that London’s success is not a threat to otherEuropean financial centres. As a major interface between Europe and the rest of the world I have littledoubt that euro-activity in London will mean more rather than less euro activity in other Europeanfinancial centres like Frankfurt, Paris, Milan, Amsterdam or Copenhagen. And I have little doubt eitherthat what is good for those centres will be good too for the City.Thirdly, and perhaps most fundamentally, the United Kingdom, even while it does notparticipate in the euro, can contribute to its success by continuing to pursue macro-economic, both fiscaland monetary, discipline in parallel with the euro-area countries. The Government is committed to thiscourse as a matter of national economic self-interest - one of its very first acts in Government forexample was to hand operational independence for the conduct of monetary policy to the Bank ofEngland. But these same policies are calculated, too, to make us a more prosperous and active tradingpartner for Europe as a whole, and to ensure that we do not have any avoidable disruptive effect on thepolicies or on the economy of the euro participants. More than this they are calculated to fostersustainable economic convergence as the necessary precursor to our eventual adherence to the euro club.And in the meantime the British Government will continue to pursue, and to advocate inthe councils of Europe the supply-side flexibility that will be vital to its success.Madam Governor, I hope that I may have persuaded some of you at least that Britishreservations about monetary union are not just plain obstinacy! Out of the first wave of the euro we maybe, but we remain very much an active and, I hope, constructive partner in the process of Europeanmonetary integration in a wider sense - which is why I prefer to think of Britain in Europe - which I tookas the title for my talk.BIS Review   23/1998
Ms. Phillips focuses on four themes underlying sound international bankingsupervision  Remarks by Ms. Susan M. Phillips, a member of the Board of Governors of theUS Federal Reserve System, before the Conference on Coping with Financial Crisis inDeveloping and Transition Countries: Regulatory and Supervisory Challenges in a New Era ofGlobal Finance, Forum on Debt and Development held at the Netherlands Bank in Amsterdamon 17/3/98.It is a pleasure to be here to address this international conference of fellowbanking supervisors and other distinguished international participants. Conferences like thisone are important forums for discussing current issues in international banking supervisionamong the supervisors, bankers, and other financial industry participants of many nations. Suchcommunication has become critical as the financial operations of the banks we supervisebecome more global, complex, fast paced, and interwoven. I would like to thank the Forum onDebt and Development and other co-sponsors for organizing this conference, which I hope willhelp us build essential bridges among banking supervisors and open new channels ofcommunication internationally at all levels.I would like to focus my remarks today on four fundamental themes underlyingthe 1997 Basle Supervisors Committee’s Core Principles of Effective Banking Supervision. AsI discuss each theme, I will naturally draw on our experience in the United States, whilemaking a few observations about the applicability to the current Asian banking situation.•The first theme is the need to focus supervisory efforts on the specificrisk profile of individual institutions.•My second theme is the need for sound accounting and disclosuresystems to provide sufficient transparency to allow the financial marketsand supervisory agencies to evaluate institutions’ financial conditions.•My third theme is the need for adequate capital and the challenges weface in keeping capital standards current.•Finally, we must recognize the need for international bankingsupervisors to work closely and cooperatively together to achieveeffective coordinated supervision of global banks and other financialfirms.One of the goals of banking supervisors is to help identify and address weakbanking practices early so that small or emerging problems can be addressed before theybecome large and costly. To do that in today’s global fast-paced markets, and in anenvironment in which technology and financial innovation can lead to rapid change, theFederal Reserve is pursuing a risk-focused supervisory approach. Such supervision plays acritical role in helping us to achieve our responsibilities of:•working to ensure the safe and sound operation of the bankingorganizations that we supervise,•promoting an efficient and effective financial system that financeseconomic growth, and•ensuring that financial institutions do not become a source of systemicrisk, threat to the payment system, or burden to taxpayers by makingthem absorb losses arising from inappropriate extension of the federalsafety net.BIS Review   24/1998
- 2 -The Federal Reserve has undertaken its new risk-focused examination approachto respond to the dramatic changes that are occurring in the banking and financial servicesbusiness, including tremendous advancement in technology and securitization, the breakdownof traditional product lines, the expansion of banks’ global operations in the world’s financialmarkets, and the development of new risk management systems. Furthermore, developments intechnology and financial products, combined with the increased depth and liquidity of domesticand global financial markets, have enabled banks to change their risk profiles faster than everbefore. A key goal of the Federal Reserve’s risk-focused approach is to enable banks tocompete effectively in this dynamic financial services sector, while focusing examiners onbanks’ ability and willingness to deal effectively with their own risk exposures rather than onstandardized examination checklists.US banking supervisors in the past focused primarily on validating bank balancesheets, particularly the value of loan portfolios, as of a specific point in time. Losses on banks’loan portfolios historically have been the principal source of their financial problems.Concentrating on the quality of banks’ loans and the adequacy of their reserves was, andcontinues to be, essential to sound banking supervision. As part of the examination process,examiners reviewed the soundness of management practices, internal controls, and internalaudit activities, but that review was not the examination’s primary focus. The FederalReserve’s adoption of a risk-focused approach, however, reflects its view that examinersshould target their work on individual banks’ specific risk profiles, including the traditionalexamination of loan quality and reserves.This need for fundamental change in the traditional approaches of bankers andsupervisors became evident in reviewing the lessons learned from the turmoil, stress, andchange in the US banking system over the past decade. Ten years ago, many of the UnitedStates’ largest banks announced huge loan loss provisions on doubtful loans to developingcountries, while many banks were also struggling under the weight of loans to the energy,agriculture and commercial real estate sectors. By the end of the 1980’s, more than 200 bankswere failing annually. There were more than 1,000 banks on the problem list of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation, which is the US banking agency that insures bank deposits andserves as receiver for failed banks. This period includes the costly crisis of the US savings andloan industry -- which is composed of institutions chartered to make home loans available tothe American public.In response to these systemic developments, bankers and supervisors eachchanged their fundamental ways of operating and managing risks. For their part, bankersrecognized the need to rebuild their capital and reserves; strengthen their internal controls;diversify their risks; and improve internal risk management systems. The Federal Reserve, inturn, responded to these changes by adopting its risk-focused examination system tailored toassessing the quality of individual banks’ internal processes and risk management systems. Theneed for this approach is illustrated by the failure of several high-profile international bankingorganizations that did not have adequate internal control and risk management systems.Adopting a risk-focused approach improves the examination process bytargeting examinations more directly on specific institutions’ problems. However, it also makessuch examinations more challenging for examiners because they must be knowledgeable abouteach bank’s business activities, risk profiles, and risk management systems. Furthermore, weare trying to make these examinations more efficient for examiners and bankers by employingvalid statistical sampling methods, which will free examiner time to devote to banks’ specificrisk exposures.BIS Review   24/1998
- 3 -In addition, banking supervisors need to assess the integrity and independence ofa bank’s decision-making processes, giving special attention to any conflicts of interest orinsider influence that could distort this process. The Basle Committee’s Core Principles forEffective Banking Supervision address this point by recognizing the need for effectivemeasures to control directed lending and transactions with affiliates that are not on anarm’s-length basis. Specifically, the Core Principles state that, to prevent abuses arising fromconnected lending, banking supervisors should require that any loans banks make to relatedcompanies and individuals be on an arm’s-length basis; that such extensions of credit beeffectively monitored; and that other appropriate steps are taken to control or mitigate the risks.For example, the Federal Reserve’s Regulation O, whose application was expanded to directorsin the early 1990s, is aimed at making sure that any loans a bank makes to officers or directorsare on the same terms that are available to the general public.Finally, the Federal Reserve places great reliance on on-site examinations tomake the presence of supervisors tangible to bankers and to facilitate the review of records anddocuments that are essential to assessing a bank’s financial condition. Such on-siteexaminations also permit examiners to observe whether bank policies are being followed inpractice, or, alternatively, whether they only exist on paper. Although I recognize that manyother countries do not conduct on-site examinations for legal and other reasons, the FederalReserve concurs with the position taken by the Basle Committee’s Core Principles that it isimportant for supervisors to perform some on-site supervision.II. Need for Sound Accounting and Financial TransparencyThe Federal Reserve believes that sound accounting and transparent financialinformation is a fundamental pillar of a strong banking -- and, indeed, financial -- system.Transparency is essential for the market to be able to make decisions on an informed basis. Thearms-length negotiations of informed investors and issuing banks provide the strongest marketbasis for the issuance and pricing of equity and debt securities, as well as loans. Bankingsupervisors should strongly advocate transparency to aid effective supervision and marketdiscipline. Indeed, they can encourage the process directly through appropriate regulatoryreporting requirements and even making all or part of those reports public.It is important for governments to allow market forces to reward prudentbehavior and penalize excessive risk-taking. Sound, well-managed firms can benefit if betterdisclosure enables them to obtain funds at risk premiums that accurately reflect lower riskprofiles. Inadequate financial disclosure, on the other hand, could penalize well-managedfirms, or even countries, if market participants do not trust their ability to assess firms’ orcountries’ fundamental financial strength.Regulatory structures that overly protect banks from market forces, or that allowlax accounting and disclosure to disguise firms’ financial problems, remove market disciplineon banks and permit them to operate less efficiently. Deposit insurance systems and the publicsafety net are examples of regulatory interference with market forces, despite their publicbenefit. They create a moral hazard by allowing institutions to take on what might be excessiverisk without proportional fear that their ability to raise funds at favorable rates will beimpaired. This is illustrated by the costly US savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. Laxaccounting and capital standards allowed economically insolvent institutions to continueoperating and attracting insured deposits at attractive rates because the deposits weregovernment insured. This, in turn, delayed government and public recognition of the scope ofBIS Review   24/1998
- 4 -the problem and tremendously increased the cost of its resolution to the deposit insurancesystem and the American taxpayer.To be credible to global investors, accounting standards should be established byindependent professional organizations and enforced by a combination of market discipline andnational oversight authorities. Particular to banking and the credibility of banks’ financialstatements is the establishment of prudent levels of reserves. Investors must be confident thatbanks are establishing sufficient levels of reserves and recognizing loan impairment in a timelyfashion. Compliance with sound accounting, disclosure, and reserving standards not onlyprotects safety and soundness, but also gives the world’s investment community confidence inits analysis of risk exposure from investing in various countries and companies. The absence ofsuch confidence, on the other hand, may lead investors to overreact to adverse financial eventsin such countries by ceasing investment, immediately withdrawing current investment fundsand demanding a high return for any remaining or renegotiated investment in such countries.Today’s technology and global financial markets enable investors to take these actions veryquickly with dramatic consequences, as has recently happened in some Asian countries.Another issue related to the efficient operation of market forces is thatgovernment intervention in the credit and investment decisions of banks distorts marketdiscipline and pricing. Such programs frequently cause banks to make less than arm’s-lengthinvestments in, and loans to, non-economic government-affiliated projects or to individualsassociated with such projects. Once these loans are made, it is difficult for national supervisorsto demand that banks apply prudent reserve and charge-off policies, let alone foreclose on suchloans. In addressing governmental interference with market forces at their meeting in Londonin February, representatives of the G-7 countries unanimously supported the InternationalMonetary Fund’s requirement that countries receiving IMF funds make structural reforms toreduce inappropriate government interference in the market economy. The message thatgovernments should heed is that, ultimately, market forces will come to bear with severeresults if firms or nations are artificially protected from market forces.III. Sound Capital as a Risk-Absorbing BufferMy third major theme today -- the importance of adequate capital -- has drawnmuch attention in the past decade as a result of the Basle Accord. The idea is pretty simple: ifwe want banks to be prudent in their risk-taking, there is no substitute for requiring banks’owners to have their own money at risk. With that requirement, supervisory interests andbanks’ private interests are more closely aligned and banks have fewer incentives to takeexcessive risks. When banks’ managers and directors assess the riskiness and profitability ofprospective business opportunities, they will weigh heavily the potential effect of new businessactivities on their banks’ capital positions.Capital must be sufficient, but “How much capital is enough?” The answer islinked, of course, to the level of risk that an institution takes. Institutions that aggressivelypursue risky business strategies clearly need a stronger capital base than those with moreconservative objectives and products.While a fairly simple approach, the Basle risk-based capital framework hasproven to be a balanced risk-focused framework for setting minimum capital standards forthousands of banks of all sizes worldwide. It is important, though, that banks not misuse thisminimum prudential standard by substituting it for more rigorous internal evaluations of capitaladequacy suitable for their own risk exposure and the sophistication of their financialBIS Review   24/1998
- 5 -strategies. For example, US supervisors support the development by a limited number ofsophisticated banks of advanced credit risk models for assessing such institutions’ internalcapital needs to keep their probability of default within their established parameters. Suchsystems represent significant advances in developing systems to tailor banks’ assessments oftheir capital needs to their credit risk exposure. On the other hand, the cost and complexity ofsuch systems raises issues about their current feasibility as part of the uniform capital measurefor all institutions. In any case, banks must rely on their own internal capital assessmentsystems targeted to their risk profiles and financial sophistication, as well as complying withthe necessarily broadbrush, uniform capital standard established under the Basle Accord.We must look constantly for better ways to design regulatory capital standardsand to promote adequate risk measurement in banks. On this note, the US Federal FinancialInstitutions Examination Council held a conference for bankers and supervisors last Decemberto consider a myriad of views on ways that capital regulation should be modified to addresschanges in banking and risk management. The New York Clearing House Association justcompleted a pilot study of the pre-commitment approach to capital requirements for marketrisk. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also recently organized a conference, inconjunction with the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and the Federal Reserve Board, for theexchange of economic papers on developments in risk assessment and management, as well ason how such advances should be incorporated into the international capital framework.Although considerable progress has been made in amending the Basle standards in such areasas market risk, there will no doubt be additional changes as new tools are developed to addresscredit risk differentials, interest rate risk and, perhaps even, operational and legal risk. Indeed,capital standards should be thought of as an evolving process.IV. Coordinated International SupervisionWe all recognize the need to achieve coordinated international bankingsupervision based on cooperation and strong working relationships between home country andhost country supervisors. New challenges in attaining this goal are presented by the advent ofnew technologies, the geographic expansion of banking activities, and the globalization offinancial markets. We should work together, relying on the leadership of home countrysupervisors, to analyze banks on a consolidated global basis as the financial market does. Homecountry supervisors need sufficient global information and international cooperation to performtheir supervisory responsibilities, while enabling host country supervisors to oversee theactivities of international banks in their countries.A key issue arising for all of us, both internationally and domestically, is thegrowing prevalence in world markets of financial conglomerates -- which blend banking,insurance, securities, and other financial activities in a single diversified global entity.Universal banking in some nations’ financial firms has long combined banking and securitiesactivities, and to some extent insurance powers, in a single entity. Such financialconglomerates, which are growing in number and size, engage simultaneously in a myriad ofbusinesses and seek to integrate those businesses to cross market their varied products. Thispresents a significant supervisory challenge because most of our legal frameworks use separateand different approaches for each traditional segment of the financial industry.The challenge of achieving coordinated international supervision of suchconglomerates is addressed in the consultative documents, “Supervision of FinancialConglomerates,” developed by the Joint Forum on Financial Conglomerates. These workingpapers were announced on February 16th by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, theBIS Review   24/1998
- 6 -International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and the InternationalAssociation of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). The Joint Forum, which was formed to helpcoordinate the international and inter-industry supervision of financial conglomerates,requested comment by July on these papers. The documents make concrete recommendationsfor steps that supervisors in each of the securities, insurance, and banking sectors can take toenhance supervision of the group-wide risk exposures of these global and inter-industryconglomerates. The documents also stress the need to enhance cooperation and informationexchange among the supervisors in each country and industry segment.Implementing these recommendations may necessitate changing the legalframework of our financial oversight frameworks, but major changes in our financialinstitutions and markets demand changes in the supervisory frameworks of our countries. TheUnited States is no exception.ConclusionIn closing, I want to reiterate that banking supervisors must work together toachieve effective consolidated supervision of global banks under a shared set of supervisoryprinciples, such as the Basle Committee’s Core Principles. Furthermore, I believe that the bestway to implement coordinated global supervision is to focus on the four themes that I havehighlighted today -- the benefits of risk-focused supervision, the value of sound accounting anddisclosure, the need for adequate capital, and the importance of international supervisorycoordination.I appreciate having the opportunity to meet with you today to discuss keysupervisory issues. I look forward to our continuing joint supervisory efforts towardcoordinated international bank supervision.BIS Review   24/1998
Mr. Grenville discusses the Asian economic crisis and how such problemsmight be avoided in future   Speech by Mr. Stephen Grenville, a Deputy Governor of theReserve Bank of Australia, to Australian Business Economists and the Economic Society ofAustralia (NSW Branch) in Sydney on 12/3/98.It is much too early to draw definitive conclusions about the economic crisiscurrently being played out in Asia, but there is some point in trying to bring together theemerging ideas as to what went wrong, what might be done to fix the immediate problems, andhow, in a more fundamental sense, these problems might be avoided in future. One of the thingsthat strikes me is how much thinking has evolved, already, in the months since the crisis broke.With that in mind, lessons which now seem to be appropriate will, no doubt, be modified overtime. Historians can wait to compose the definitive, fully-digested version when the dust settles,but others need to call it continuously, refining and modifying our understanding as we go along,knowing perfectly well that what we write today may seem unperceptive or simply wrong whenwe come back to it in a year’s time.Ross Garnaut has recently written that: “The shock of 1997 is a defining event inthe economic history of East Asia. Like the great Depression in the West, it has the capacity tochange thought about economic development and economic policy in fundamental ways.”1. Thisprocess is currently underway, and if it sounds more like a damage report rather than theanatomy of a paradigm shift, this may reflect the close range of our current perspective. Amongthe jumble of likely causes and hypotheses, it is difficult to fit all the pieces together and assignproper weights. That said (and to anticipate one of the later conclusions), the individual elementsof the crisis are neither new, nor were they ignored beforehand. But the conjuncture of eventsproduced outcomes that no-one forecast. And once the critical break had come, it was notpossible to restore the status quo ante by fixing the individual elements that had gone wrong.General lessonsThe first lesson, which stems directly from the fact that no-one forecast the natureor the extent of the crisis, is the need for humility. While plenty of observers worried aboutvarious aspects of these emerging markets, no serious commentator could be said to haveforecast these crises, in the sense of defining the nature of the unfolding story with someprecision as to timing.2 Generic weakness in the financial sector was, like Mark Twain’sweather, something that everyone complained about, but no-one did much about. The relatedpoint is that there remains much that we do not understand.This issue of failure to forecast is especially embarrassing because these countries,by and large, did the things which economists had said were important. Their budgets werebalanced, they kept inflation low, they reduced (over time) protection and increased theiropenness, both on trade and capital accounts, and they embraced deregulation (although nevercompletely). Even to the extent that they ran what look in hindsight to be dangerously-largecurrent account deficits at times, there was no doubt that these were “good” deficits - i.e. theyfunded high levels of investment, rather than government expenditure or private consumption.                                                       1 Garnaut (1998, p. 23).2 For example, Paul Krugman, who was sceptical about aspects of the “Asian miracle”, does not claimto have foreseen the crisis:  “Speculative attacks on currencies are nothing new, and some of us evenwarned a couple of years ago that South-east Asian countries might be at risk.  But the scale anddepth of this crisis have surprised everyone;  this disaster has demonstrated that there are financialdangers undreamt of in our previous philosophy.” (Krugman 1998b).BIS Review   22/1998
- 2 -The second general lesson is that it has turned out to be much more complex thanit seemed initially. Initially, the crisis was seen in relatively simple terms (President Clintondescribed it as “a few little glitches in the road”). The belief was that exchange rates had becomeover-valued, these economies had run a bit faster than their productive capacities would allow,and that in some cases (most notably Thailand) the current account had blown out in a way thatmade them vulnerable. The implication was that, with exchange rates floated, they woulddepreciate modestly, fiscal and monetary policies could be tightened a bit in order to slowgrowth, and in the process current account deficits would shrink. There was a feeling that “thisisn’t a problem; it’s an opportunity”. At least, there was a feeling that after some short-termpain, these economies would emerge stronger than before: the crisis would provide themotivation for institutional improvement.These are the generalisations: let’s get more specific about the things that mightexplain the crisis.The exchange rateIf this was a “currency crisis”, then exchange rates must be the key factor, mustn’tthey? There are a couple of different aspects of this that need separate discussion. First, did someaspect of the initial exchange rate cause the crisis? Secondly, what can we learn from thebehaviour of exchange rates as the crisis emerged?First, did the exchange rate regimes cause the crisis? The early diagnosis was thatthe central problem was exchange rates which were over-valued, and fixed. Most commentatorsassess that the exchange rates were over-valued by something in the order of 10 per cent. Weknow that over-valued exchange rates are vulnerable, so this was clearly an element in the story.But these exchange rates are now at levels around half the starting point, or in the case ofIndonesia around a quarter. Whatever over-valuation there was in the exchange rates at the start,markets have taken them much further in the opposite direction. If a 10 per cent exchange ratemisalignment in one direction made these countries vulnerable to crisis, where does that leavethem now? In short, the initial exchange rate over-valuation seems too small, too routine, and thesubsequent behaviour too inexplicable, for this to carry the full weight of being the key cause.Were fixed rates the culprit? Again, fixed rates raise issues of vulnerability, butthese countries did not stick to this fixed rate regime out of any perversity - they felt they neededthis anchor in their macro policies. At the same time, some of their neighbours which have comethrough the crisis well also have fixed rates - Hong Kong and China. It might also be noted bythose who believe that exchange rate flexibility would have avoided the crisis that thesecountries’ exchange rates had been under substantial upward pressure during the first half of the1990s. While the policies they pursued have clearly turned out to be unsustainable, thecounter-factual - earlier introduction of floating exchange rates - might also have been a verybumpy ride.3In short, it may be routine to refer to these as currency crises, but the exchangerate movements are symptomatic of something else. That said, we can learn something, in apathological sense, about the behaviour of exchange rates from observing their behaviour intimes of crisis. The first and most obvious lesson is that when exchange rate regimes shift fromfixed to floating, the transition may be quite turbulent, and markets have some troubleestablishing a sensible rate. It was naive to believe that a modest over-valuation would be                                                       3 Grenville (1998, p. 33).BIS Review   22/1998
- 3 -smoothly corrected by floating. Even in deep, well-established markets, such as Japan and theUSA, exchange rates routinely move by 30 per cent or more.Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of this is the degree of contagion ofexchange rates. Just because the Thai baht moved a fair way, why did the rupiah and won haveto move also (not to mention the ringgit and peso)? Two factors seem to be involved here. Thefirst is the “wake-up call” argument: the fall of the baht made markets look at other currencies,and find the same matters of concern. The second component of the argument is that, once oneexchange rate started to move, the others had to move to maintain their competitiveness.4While we are talking about exchange rates and their extreme behaviour, I shouldsay something about the apparent failure of high interest rates to support these exchange rates.Interest rates in these countries have been quite high (both in nominal and real terms) for quite afew years (in fact, this is one of the important causes of the large capital inflows). When thecrisis arrived, interest rates were put even higher. This was appropriate, but what is clear is thatthey were not put high enough to prevent the depreciation over-shooting. Why was this so?Some argue that the only thing that went wrong here was that the authorities were not preparedto put them high enough to do the job. There is, however, another side to this story.5 Briefly: extremely high interest rates are not credible: markets expect them to beabandoned quickly; the foreign debt was foreign currency denominated, and higher domestic interestrates would have made foreign creditors even more nervous about thecredit risks they faced, and therefore more likely to withdraw their money; very high interest rates raise problems of adverse selection - the only borrowersare those who do not intend to repay.Current account deficits and capital flowsThe large current account deficits incurred by these countries are now seen tohave been a major source of vulnerability. We noted earlier that these were “good” deficits, andin defence of Korea and Indonesia, it should also be noted that neither was running a particularlylarge deficit over recent years (for Korea 2 per cent of GDP in 1990-96, and 3 per cent forIndonesia). But Thailand certainly was - around 8 per cent of GDP. What is very clear, ex post,is the vulnerability to extraordinary reversals of capital flows (which we have not, for example,seen in Australia). The inflow into these countries was around US$ 40 billion in 1995, more thandoubled to nearly US$ 100 billion in 1996, and reversed to an outflow of around US$ 12 billionin 1997. It is hardly surprising that a major adjustment is underway in these countries, to adaptto this reversal.Before we condemn current account deficits as a manifestation of misguidedpolicies, we should note that these deficits were not only “good” (in the sense that they fundedinvestment, not consumption), but were - to a very large degree - the normal working through ofmarket processes. These countries experienced very high productivity growth as technology wasbrought to bear, combined with low labour costs. They “got their act together” and provided a                                                       4 Those who like this argument would also point to the Chinese effective depreciation of 1994.  This isclaimed by some to have disturbed international competitiveness and helped to set in train the exportshortfalls in other Asian countries, that in turn contributed to the crisis.5 The following argument is set out in more detail in Grenville (1998, p. 33).BIS Review   22/1998
- 4 -hospitable environment for commerce and investment. It is hardly surprising that there has been,over time, a significant flow of capital from the “old” high-saving countries to the “new”investment opportunities in East Asia.6 If there was an economic miracle taking place, foreigninvestors wanted a slice of the action. The fast-developing financial infrastructure provided theconduit between domestic borrowers and foreign savers. There is, in fact, an earlier example ofthis. Singapore went for two decades with a current account deficit averaging more than 10 percent of GDP, and most people look back on this era as an extraordinary success.In short, if we can identify a critical problem here, it is the potential for reversalof the capital flow, rather than the current account deficit per se. This was, of course,exacerbated by two characteristics of the capital flows - their short-term nature and the foreigncurrency denomination of the debt. These were seen, at the time, as natural-enoughcharacteristics of the institutional structure:7 to interfere would be to go against the tide ofmarket-oriented policies. But we can now identify them as major sources of vulnerability.8The financial sectorA third key weakness, which was identified early on,9 is that fast-growingfinancial sectors are very vulnerable, because they inevitably reflect lack of experience, by thecommercial bankers, borrowers and prudential supervisors. Just as a rapidly-growing balancesheet is a warning sign for an individual financial institution, the same warning signs existed inthese countries. But even this was hard to foresee as a devastating problem. As a country movesaway from under-developed financial “repression”,10 it is both inevitable and desirable that thedepth of the financial sector increases - i.e. the balance sheets of financial institutions expandfaster than nominal GDP. That said, of course there is an issue of “how much faster”? Lessexcusable are the inadequate efforts to put in place effective prudential supervision.Coincidence and compoundingI have argued, so far, that none of the elements which are usually put forward is,in itself, all that unusual, or enough to explain the extent of the crisis. The fatal flaw was thecombination.11 To some extent, the problems were self-reinforcing - when one weak link broke,this put more pressure on other linkages, which collapsed under the extra burden placed on them.But it is by no means inevitable that these problems should coincide - I would simply note thatAustralia in the mid 1980s had an exchange rate fall of the magnitude of Thailand’s and Korea’swithout a major crisis, and had an asset price bust of probably the same order of magnitude (inthe late 1980s) without this degree of damage.                                                       6 Feldstein and Horioka (1980).7 Grenville (1998, p. 31).8 The bumpy international environment made the capital flows more volatile, and help to explain boththe exchange rate appreciations and the variation in capital flows.  The yen/dollar exchange ratemoved 20 per cent in the year beginning April 1996, affecting these countries’ effective exchangerates, their trade and their capital flows.  Low Japanese interest rates initially encouraged excessliquidity to flow to these countries, which reversed when markets began to focus on possible interestrate increases.9 Grenville (1997) and Macfarlane (1997b).10 McKinnon (1973).11 An analogy might illustrate the point about compounding causation:  in a car crash, who or what is toblame for the injuries?  Is it speed, some act of recklessness such as intoxication, a poor roadsurface, an under-inflated tyre, an inadequate guard-rail, a poorly-designed car, or inadequateseat-belts?  Some of these things are mutually compounding, and others are simply unable to copewith the abnormal strains to which they are subject.  So it is with the Asian “currency” crisis.  Thesearch for a single key cause - and, by implication, a single key solution to prevent recurrence - willmiss the complexity of the task ahead.BIS Review   22/1998
- 5 -That said, there are clear linkages between the fault lines, and in the Asian case,there was a conjuncture of problems. Large capital inflows led, more-or-less inevitably, toexcessive credit growth and growth of the financial sector, because it was not possible to sterilisethem fully. The large flows meant, also, that there was easy funding available for projects (bothgood and bad), and that asset prices were bid up. Similarly, the large capital flows made itdifficult to raise interest rates higher (they were already quite high), for fear of inducing evenmore capital inflow. High domestic interest rates, at the same time, persuaded many borrowersto take the risk of tapping into attractively lower foreign currency-denominated borrowing.Further, with quasi-fixed exchange rate regimes in these countries, there was little incentive forinstitutions borrowing in foreign currencies to hedge their debt. These issues should have beenrecognised as sources of vulnerability, but the focus was on growth, without enough concernabout resilience in the face of variance in growth.This failure to recognise the interaction of elements was a key misunderstandingas the crisis broke. With hindsight, it should have been realised that simply freeing the exchangerates would cause them to shift a fair way and this would create enormous problems for afinancial sector weighed down by bad debts and large foreign currency-denominated debt. Thiswould, in turn, feed back into the exchange rate. If we were to identify the crucial combination,it would be the large volatile foreign capital flows, plus fragile financial sectors.These two factors, in combination, made these economies extremely vulnerable tochanges of confidence. We have in our minds financial markets which are constantly digestingand evaluating information to produce a price - an exchange rate - which reflects the“fundamentals”. But we see, here, that the more nebulous concept of “confidence”, at times,dominates the fundamentals. “In a matter of just a few months, the Asian economies went frombeing the darlings of the investment community to being virtual pariahs. There was a touch ofthe absurd in the unfolding drama, as international money managers harshly castigated the verysame Asian governments they were praising just months before. … But, as often happens infinancial markets, euphoria turned to panic without missing a beat. Suddenly, Asia’s leaderscould do no right. The money fled.”12 This is not, of course, the first time this has happened.Alan Greenspan, describing this reaction in capital flows as “a visceral, engulfing, fear”, went onto say “The exchange rate changes appear the consequences, not of the accumulation of newknowledge of a deterioration in fundamentals, but of its opposite: the onset of uncertainties thatdestroy previous understandings of the way the world works. That has induced massivedisengagements of investors and declines in Asian currencies that have no tie to reality. In allaspects of life, when confronted with uncertainty, people tend to withdraw. … At one point theeconomic system appears stable, the next it behaves as though a dam has reached a breakingpoint, and water (read, confidence) evacuates its reservoir. The United States experienced such asudden change with the decline in stock prices of more than 20 per cent on October 19, 1987.There is no credible scenario that can readily explain so abrupt a change in the fundamentals oflong-term valuation on that one day. Such market panic does not appear to reflect a simplecontinuum from the immediately previous period.”Krugman (1998a) has suggested a possible reason for this big shift in confidence.Foreign investors thought they were working in a riskless world, and made their investmentdecisions accordingly. Then, quite suddenly, they realised the risk, and underwent a fundamentaladjustment in expectations. This explanation has some attractions but does not seem to fit theoverall reality closely. There were not too many explicit guarantees around, leaving aside bank                                                       12 Sachs (1997).BIS Review   22/1998
- 6 -and sovereign debt (which remained guaranteed), so there was not a rational reason forre-evaluation. The more intuitively appealing explanation (at least to me) is that investors simplychanged their minds. They had not known much about the countries (or projects) they investedin to start with, so there was lots of opportunity for them to shift between exuberance and deeppessimism, either based on a modest accretion of news on fundamentals or, more likely, on thebasis of what their colleagues in the market were doing. Correlated shifts in expectations are thekey to understanding what happened. The fundamentals (such as when a thing gets cheaper,people buy more of it) were overwhelmed by something akin to panic - if everyone is running inone direction, we should run too (because it becomes increasingly costly not to). Of course, oncethe mood had changed, commentators and investors alike found much in these economies thatthey did not like, particularly issues which come under the broad rubric of “governance”.What can be done?There are two relevant time horizons here - what should be done, in the form of“battle-field dressing”, to cope with the crisis and get these economies back on the rails again?Then, in the longer term, what can be done to make them less vulnerable in the face of futureproblems?Early on it was recognised that these crises had many of the characteristics of anold-fashioned banking liquidity crisis - a “bank run”. There had been a massive loss ofconfidence and withdrawal of money, so what was required - reaching back into the 19th centuryprescription of Bagehot - was: “lend freely, but at a penalty rate”. The “withdrawal” took theform of capital outflow from the country, rather than a domestic shift of funds, but the principlewas the same. This was, indeed, the diagnosis and the prescription in Mexico in 1995, and mostpeople, with hindsight, regard this as an overall success. (More on Mexico in a moment.)While this is clear enough in principle, making it operational presents problems.The most prominent of these has been concern about “moral hazard”. Moral hazard arises “whensomeone can reap the rewards from their actions when things go well but not suffer the fullconsequences when things go badly”13. In the Asian policy debate, there were lots of left-overarguments from the 1995 Mexican episode, with some arguing that the US$ 50 billion IMF/USAbail-out had been unduly beneficial to fund management institutions, particularly in the USA.It has to be acknowledged that all types of insurance have significant elements ofmoral hazard, and the issue is not to avoid doing anything involving moral hazard, but how tokeep it in check. The idea that Asian creditors have, in general, been protected is wrong.14 Theproblem is a narrower one than is usually posed - applying specifically to government debt andbank debt - the first because of its sovereign nature, and the second because of the systemicimplications of widespread bank failure. In these cases, it is difficult to avoid a degree of“bailing out”, and it is just as difficult to expect investors to ignore this.15                                                       13 Greenspan (1998, p. 2).14 Chairman Greenspan has pointed out that:  “Asian equity losses, excluding Japan, since June 1997worldwide are estimated to have exceeded $700 billion of which more than $30 billion has been lostby US investors.  Substantial further losses have been recorded in bonds and real estate.”(Greenspan 1998, p. 2).15 The dramatic fall in interest-rate spreads going into 1997 has to be explained in terms of collective“exuberance” rather than the moral hazard residual from Mexico, because the narrowing of spreadsoccurred across all types of debt, including debt which by no stretch of the imagination was going tobe subject to any kind of bail-out.BIS Review   22/1998
- 7 -We will examine, in a moment, what might be done to address moral hazardissues in the longer term. But meanwhile, with the crisis on us, moral hazard should not be usedas the all-encompassing excuse for inaction. Bagehot’s prescription worked reasonably well inMexico, but has not been applied with the same speed and vigour in Asia.What about the longer-term reforms? Given that the damaging combination seemsto have been big foreign capital flows plus fragile financial sectors, this is the place to begin.Longer-term reform must include the building of resilient financial sectors, which can withstandsubstantial shifts in sentiment, and big changes in the exchange rate. Part-and-parcel ofprudential measures would be to discourage the sort of short-term and foreign currencyexposures which occurred, and where they occur in the private commercial sector, to insulate thebanks from them. A well-functioning banking sector might also act as the stable core of thefinancial sector which would, to some extent, act as the “guardian on the gateway toinvestment”. For this to be possible, banks need not only to be well staffed by people with realbusiness experience, but need to be free from the pressures of “connected” or “command”lending pressures, which have been all-too-apparent in these countries in the past.The difficulties with moral hazard have to be acknowledged, and the crises dealtwith in ways that ensure that those who were involved in failed investments are financiallypenalised. But if, when all other measures are taken to improve transparency and disclosure,these international capital flows remain flighty and volatile, even those who are searching formarket purity will have to either accept restrictions on such flows, or the existence of somelender-of-last-resort. The damaging externalities of the reversal of these capital flows cannotsimply be left to run their course, with markets “sorting it out” in the way we are observingcurrently in Asia.No-one has yet come up with any clever ideas on how to back up the internationallender-of-last-resort by prudential rules to address the moral hazard problem. Just as disclosureis an important part of any prudential framework, it will have a role to play - hence the IMF’sSpecial Data Dissemination Standard and the BIS’ data on bank lending. No-one could arguewith the general principle that “more information is better than less information”, or that whenmarkets are “blinded by faulty signals, a competitive free-market system cannot reach a firmbalance except by chance”16, but it might be worth focusing on exactly where the informationdeficiencies lie. Looking back on it, most of the problems which exist were known about ingeneral terms, and it is misleading to argue that if more exact figures had been known, thenvarious market participants would have behaved very differently. Will greater transparency putan end to the problem of correlated expectations in financial markets - the sudden switches fromeuphoria to gloom? It seems unlikely (there was no shortage of information in stock markets inOctober 1987). But they might help to limit the extent of the swings. As we have seen in thecase of Indonesia, once markets and the press take a set against a country, every new piece ofnews is given the most pessimistic slant and every negative rumour is treated as established fact.As we search for what more might be done, it is worth keeping in mind that, forevery over-eager borrower in these countries, there was an over-eager lender in thecapital-supplying country. Are there measures that could be taken by the prudential authorities inthe capital-supplying countries so that these authorities look not just at the consequences fortheir own financial system, but for the financial stability of the capital-receiving country? Oneobvious lesson is that, in evaluating the “fundamental health” of countries, we should widen the                                                       16 Greenspan (1998, p. 10).BIS Review   22/1998
- 8 -scope of the assessment of “fundamentals”, to embrace an assessment of the health of thefinancial system and the effectiveness of prudential supervision.Much more controversial would be any proposal to restrain capital flows. One ofthe important initiatives to come out of the IMF’s meeting in Hong Kong in September 1997(i.e. shortly after the crisis broke) was to develop an amendment of the IMF Articles ofAgreement to make the liberalisation of international capital flows one of the purposes of theFund. There is the potential for vigorous debate on this. Some argue that the problems of capitalflow were caused by “half-way liberalisation”, and things would have worked better if financialmarkets had been deeper, with a greater range of instruments and greater liquidity. Theprescription that follows from this is, of course, to proceed with speed and vigour towards morefinancial deregulation. The counter argument is that prudential supervision and the generalapparatus of administering big capital flows need to develop pari passu with the process offinancial deregulation, and it is very clear that this did not occur over the past ten years: financialdevelopment greatly outpaced the development of the prudential framework. In this view,financial deregulation should only occur as and when the appropriate prudential safeguards canbe put in place.Whatever the outcome of this debate, I suspect that these countries will be muchless ready to welcome short-term capital flows, and the enthusiasm for developments such as theBangkok International Banking Facility (which acted as a frictionless conduit for Thai businesspeople to borrow overseas) has been dampened. There is unlikely to be much enthusiasm forvigorous financial deregulation if this means encouraging the sort of free-wheeling, non-bankinstitutions which were not only eager to sign up borrowers for foreign currency loans, but thenturned around and sold this debt into banks elsewhere in the region, with disastrousconsequences for both borrower and lender.How quickly will the recovery occur?As the crisis unfolded in the second half of last year, it might have been arguedthat the best guidance on the likely evolution of these three countries was the Mexican crisis of1994/95 - styled by the IMF Managing Director as “the first crisis of the 21st century”17. Thishad the usual characteristics - that the financial aspects unfolded quite quickly, and that afterthese had stabilised, the real sector effects worked their way through more slowly, over time.The sequence might be characterised like this: there was a 50 per cent depreciation; a $50 billion IMF/USA rescue package was made available: not all of this wasneeded, and a large part of it was repaid within a year. Private capital flowreturned relatively quickly, particularly direct foreign investment (and, infact, Mexico’s foreign debt is larger now than in 1994); the annual GDP growth figures were minus 6 per cent in the year following thecrisis, and plus 5 per cent in the year after that, so that two years laterGDP is back somewhere near the original starting point;                                                       17 It was unlike most earlier IMF crises, in that neither budget deficits nor lax monetary policy were thecause - see Macfarlane (1997a).BIS Review   22/1998
- 9 - inflation of close to 100 per cent in the ensuing three years, so that the improvedcompetitiveness created by the depreciation was more-or-less unwound (atleast measured by the CPI) by subsequent inflation;18 there was a very quick closure of the current account deficit, turning into abalance more-or-less as soon as the economy slowed;19 an amount in excess of 10 per cent of GDP was used to rescue the financialsector.Mexico was, as far as the casual observer can tell, not greatly changed in theprocess. No doubt the banking system has been strengthened by the cleaning-out of bad debt, buton the basic approach to policy, there has been no paradigm shift. No real-world economic eventis just like the pure text-book case, but this does look like the international version of anold-fashioned bank run, and the old-fashioned remedy worked well enough. It might be arguedthat one of the main legacies of the Mexican rescue was the inhibitions to action that itproduced, when the problem recurred elsewhere. Despite its success, it triggered a coalition offorces (led by those who are concerned about the moral hazard aspects of the bail-out) who havehindered the same prescription being applied in Asia. Why might the Asian countries bedifferent? whereas Mexico received something approaching US$ 50 billion in availablecredit from the IMF/USA (and the required amounts were quicklydisbursed), these countries have received much smaller disbursements:Thailand - US$ 8½ billion; Korea - US$ 13 billion; and Indonesia - US$3 billion. one reason why Mexico received a quick disbursement of assistance to offset thecapital flight was the nature of the foreign debt. It was largely sovereigndebt (Tesobonos), and there was little debate (at least beforehand) that itshould be paid out in full. The USA/IMF money made this possible.When it came to Asia, none of the short-term debt was sovereign, so therewas, initially, no specific plan to pay it off. The hope was that theannouncement of the packages would, itself, instil new confidence so thatcreditors would roll over their debt;20 these countries may well be headed for the same sorts of negative growth ratesthat Mexico faced in the first year after the crisis. If so, the deceleration inthe growth rate is significantly greater, because Mexico had been growingat around 3-4 per cent, whereas these countries grew at 7-8 per cent; Mexico had the advantage of being next to the large and growing US market,whereas Asia’s crisis comes at a time when the US growth is at the maturephase of the cycle, and Japan is still stagnant;                                                       18 In terms of wages, a significant real depreciation remains.19 Contrast this with the mid 1980s in Australia, where, despite the loss of confidence and concernsabout the current account deficit, the inflow continued at more than its historic average.20 With Korea close to default in late December 1997, the American authorities stepped in (with the IMF)to broker a rollover for bank-to-bank debt, which included a guarantee by the Korean Government.BIS Review   22/1998
- 10 -•as in Mexico, these countries have very quickly (almost immediately)corrected their current account deficits, by reductions in importsstemming largely from the slowing of GDP; Mexico began with a much more clearly over-valued exchange rate; if Asian exchange rates do not recover, these countries seem headed for verysubstantial inflation (particularly Indonesia). Mexico was probably moreable to handle this, as it had had plenty of recent experience withinflation. The Asian countries have had relative price stability for manydecades; the unfinished business of rescuing the financial systems of Thailand andIndonesia have already absorbed the sorts of money Mexico used tosupport its financial sector (i.e. more than 10 per cent of GDP), and theyare “still counting”. This is neither surprising (in Scandinavia, somethingaround 6-8 per cent of GDP was used, and even in the relatively minorcase of the American S&Ls, something like 2 per cent of GDP wasrequired), nor is this particularly alarming - all of these countries startedwith almost no government domestic debt, and they can cope with thisdegree of future indebtedness. But it is a heavy price to pay, for countriesthat are still poor.An important issue is whether these countries will emerge with strongerinstitutional structures. As the crisis broke, there were many of us who thought that “this isn’t aproblem, this is an opportunity”. We had in mind the sort of institutional reform which came inIndonesia in the mid 1970s, following the Pertamina crisis - painful and expensive, but resultingin significant institutional improvement. These issues were probably a major motivation in thedesign of the IMF’s program, which included a large number of structural or governance issuesin the “conditionality” - the requirements imposed on Indonesia. This fits with the idea that “outof adversity comes reform”. We probably need more perspective to be able to judge thisproperly, but in the case of Indonesia, at the moment it looks as if the degree of crisis has farexceeded the “optimal level” and the process of reform is slipping backwards, rather thanmoving forward. Most notably, we see the position of the group of economists who have guidedIndonesia’s economic success over the past thirty years substantially eroded. As they lose theirinfluence, diversions such as the currency board proposal distract attention from facing up to theurgent elements of the crisis - an exchange rate which has wildly over-shot; a wounded bankingsystem; and a degree of foreign indebtedness which puts many Indonesian companies not justilliquid, but insolvent.In the case of Indonesia, the potential crisis is such that it is now time to refocusthe reform effort on the core economic issues - the exchange rate, foreign debt; and rebuildingthe financial sector. To be sure, reform in the structural issues of governance is eminentlydesirable, but what is needed now is the kind of triage we see in an emergency room - sorting thelife-saving critical priorities from longer-term issues.21,22Will these countries get back to their old pace of growth relatively soon? Theystill have many of the attributes that gave them fast growth. There is still plenty of potential to                                                       21 Feldstein (1998).22 Will financial markets accept something short of root-and-branch reform of Indonesian governance?Who can tell?  But we know that they worked happily enough with these problems for thirty years.BIS Review   22/1998
- 11 -link technology with relatively cheap labour, with all the productivity boost that this implies (toput this point differently, they are still well back from the technological frontier in many areas).That said, it is not going to be easy. As Garnaut has put it: “Two of the pre-conditions of growthin the old East Asian style have obviously been lost for the time being: a reasonable level ofmacro-economic stability; and political coherence around the growth objective.”23What have we learnt about our economic paradigm? The text-book modelenvisages continuous adjustment of prices and quantities as the system gropes towardsequilibrium. Good models acknowledge mis-starts and false cues along the way. But none of thisseems to fit the process we see underway in Asia. Exchange rates started modestly over-valued,and are now dramatically under-valued. Current account deficits may have been too large, butthese countries are now running surpluses: Thailand has gone from a deficit of 8 per cent ofGDP to the prospect of a surplus, this year, of 4 per cent of GDP. This is being achieved (if thatis the right word) through a fall in domestic spending (not through exchange-rate-boosted exportgrowth). The main manifestation of the crisis - the falls in currency - have not been the principalequilibrating mechanism, but are producing unfortunate (to say the least) side effects andcollateral damage - not just inflation, but enormous damage to bank and commercial balancesheets, to saving, and are distorting relative prices.What is underway here is not an equilibrating process of adjustment, but one ofeconomic collapse, where markets are no longer operating to provide sensible price signals. It is,in the words of David Hale, an “unnecessary crisis”. The loss of faith in markets is likely tocolour future policy-making (making these governments probably more likely to be tempted byvery interventionist policies). Foreign markets are likely to be even more uncertain about theirrelationships with these countries, particularly their investment relationships.The other side of the coin is that these countries have, until now, been high savingcountries and if this saving can be maintained in the face of strong inflation, the wherewithal tofund investment still exists, even without foreign capital flows.One would have to be more pessimistic if one accepts the commonly-held viewthat the investment done in these countries was predominantly low return. While not claimingany expertise, I am not immediately drawn to this view. If the investment was all that bad, howdid they manage to grow at 7-8 per cent for so long? While there has doubtless been excessinvestment in apartments and office buildings, and when growth prospects change dramatically,over-capacity in other areas is likely, I do not get the impression that there has yet, for instance,been over-investment in city freeways in either Jakarta or Bangkok. To put the point moreexplicitly, many good, high-return projects have been done, and these will continue to servetheir countries well, once the economies can be got back on an even keel.                                                       23 Garnaut (1998, p. 21).BIS Review   22/1998
- 12 -ConclusionIn 1993, the World Bank produced a book called the East Asian Miracle -formally anointing something which had been seen by many other observers quite a few yearsearlier - the extraordinary economic growth of East Asia. This had begun, some three decadesearlier, with the four “tigers” - Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. These economiesgrew, year after year, at pace two or three times as fast as the industrial countries. Theperformance spread to a number of others - Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia - and the biggestmiracle of all, China.Two things are worth noting. First, this was not someamazing-but-irrelevantly-trivial miracle, like pulling a white rabbit out of a hat: this made anenormous difference to the living standards of these countries, with per capita income doublingin less than a generation. Hong Kong and Singapore went from being well behind the livingstandards of Western countries, to being much the same.24 Secondly, it changed the wayeconomists thought about the so-called “developing” countries: no longer were they seen aspathological cases to be discussed with a mixture of pity and resignation that nothing muchcould be done. Instead, they were seen as having some kind of advantage - at least in growthterms - over the developed countries which had used up all the easy opportunities for expandingproduction. Economists started to argue that the best qualification for growing fast was to startfrom behind.That was still the broad picture at the start of 1997. But now, in a matter of a fewmonths, real questions are being asked whether this - like so many other miracles - turns out tobe some sleight of hand, or not sustainable over time. One of the original sceptics of themiracle - Paul Krugman - might seem vindicated in his likening of these countries to the earlyyears of the Soviet Union, where fast growth was achieved artificially and in a way that couldnot be sustained in the longer run.25 Even among the countries themselves, the basis of themiracle - free markets and increasing exposure to the outside world - is now under seriousquestion.In the face of these doubts and the current crisis, should we abandon this newparadigm and return to some version of the old, low-growth, view of these countries? The mostpowerful reason for not doing this is that the forces which drove growth in the past are stillthere - the poorer of these countries are still well back from the technological frontier and theapplication of capital to still-cheap labour, and improvements in organisation and governancemean that fast growth is still achievable. The fact that they are still relatively poor makes thiseminently desirable. First priority is to get them back on the rails again. Second priority, whenthe immediate crisis is over, is to get along with those structural and governance issues that wehave heard so much about of late. If they are as economically important as the current debateimplies, the growth potential of these countries should be higher still. The countries which canput in place robust, resilient and responsive financial sectors most quickly will be the ones whichcan return to rapid growth first.                                                       24 As Stiglitz has said:  “In 1975, six out of 10 Asians lived on less than $1 a day.  In Indonesia theabsolute poverty rate was even higher.  Today, two out of 10 East Asians are living in absolutepoverty.  Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand have eliminated absolute poverty and Indonesia is withinstriking distance of that goal.  …  No other economic system has delivered so much, to so many, inso short a span of time.” (Stiglitz 1998).25 Although he was most sceptical about Singapore, which seems to be one of the least affected.BIS Review   22/1998

Mr. Brash asks how central banks can best help banking systems remainstrong in a world of open capital markets   Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank ofNew Zealand, Dr. Donald Brash, to the Asian Pacific Bankers Club Annual Conference inAuckland on 13/3/98.IntroductionI appreciate your invitation to address you this morning and I join with others inwelcoming you all to New Zealand. This country can not be regarded as truly Asian, but we areincreasingly integrated into the Asian region, through trade, through immigration, throughpolitical and diplomatic linkages, through cultural exchanges, and in my own case throughmarriage!Whereas when I went through school almost the only foreign language learnt inNew Zealand schools was French, now more New Zealand students learn Japanese than learnany other foreign language, with many students also studying Mandarin and Indonesian.Whereas when I went through school the United Kingdom took roughly half ofNew Zealand’s exports, now the British market takes only some 7 per cent of our exports, withJapan taking 16 per cent, China/Hong Kong taking 6 per cent, and Korea (in 1997) taking 5 percent. Seven of our largest 10 export markets are now in this region.Whereas when I went through school almost all immigrants to New Zealand camefrom the United Kingdom, Australia or the Pacific Islands, in the last few years a great manyimmigrants have come from East Asia - especially from China/Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea.And New Zealand has gained enormously from these immigrants, who have tended to behard-working, thrifty, enthusiastic about education, and enterprising. They have enriched ourculture and helped our economy.Whereas when I went to school New Zealanders seeking international experienceinevitably travelled to the United Kingdom and Europe, typically by means of a ship whichtravelled via the Panama Canal and lots and lots of ocean, today many New Zealanders seekoverseas experience in the countries of Asia and, even when travelling to Europe, travel viaseveral Asian countries.This year and next, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand holds the Chair ofSEANZA, a grouping of 20 central banks in the Asian region originally formed in themid-1950s, and we were a founding member of EMEAP, an 11-country group of East Asiancentral banks. (Indeed, we hosted two of the three EMEAP working groups in New Zealand lastmonth.) And of course next year New Zealand will host the APEC Leaders’ meeting here inAuckland.So we are increasingly a part of the Asian region, and have a vital stake in theprosperity of the region.And in that regard, everybody in this room, and indeed almost everybody in thiscountry, is very much aware of the stresses and strains which several of the countries in theregion have been going through in the last few months. Even countries which have notexperienced severe turbulence in their currency markets in some cases face very considerableBIS Review   21/1998
- 2 -pressures on their banking systems, so that it is no exaggeration to say that most of the people inthe region live in countries where banking systems are under real strain.Oceans of ink have been spilt in analysing the causes of these strains, and thisanalysis will no doubt continue for a long time to come. Most detached observers seem to agreethat the underlying problems had nothing to do with the real or imagined activities of foreignspeculators but a great deal to do with more fundamental factors, factors which clearly variedfrom country to country, but which included politically-directed lending by banks, the end of areal estate bubble, sharply increased real exchange rates in a pegged exchange rate situation, alack of transparency in financial markets, and, dare I say it to this audience, some poor qualitycredit analysis by some of the banks and other financial institutions.I do not propose to offer my own analysis of the causes of ‘the Asian crisis’ thismorning. I was originally invited to speak about ‘the role of central banks, the New Zealandexperience’. But instead I want to tailor my remarks more specifically to the theme of yourconference, ‘Open Markets - the implication for Banks in the Asian Pacific Region’. So for thisreason I want to focus this morning on a question, namely ‘In a world of open capital markets,how can central banks best help banking systems remain strong?’ Not surprisingly, my remarkswill be heavily conditioned by our own experience in New Zealand.While we are all conscious of the strains currently besetting the banking systemsin many Asian countries, not all of you will be aware that we in New Zealand had our ownbanking system problems less than 10 years ago. As a result of these problems, our largest bankwould almost certainly have failed had the government, as majority shareholder, not beenwilling on two occasions to provide a substantial capital injection. One very major financialinstitution (not a bank, but certainly a quasi-bank, and an institution which was in the process ofapplying for a banking licence) did fail, one of the largest failures in New Zealand’s history.Another bank would have failed had its private sector shareholder not been in a position to injectvery large amounts of additional capital, and even after that was done the institution waseventually wound up. At no point did it look likely that the whole banking system might fail, butwe certainly had major problems with some of the largest participants in the system.What lessons did we learn from that experience? There were of course a wholehost of factors which caused these difficulties. One important factor was the sheer inexperienceof many of our bankers: they had been accustomed to a highly protected environment, and wereill-prepared to deal with the demands of a deregulated environment. Nevertheless, I think therewere four important lessons. While every country has to make judgements and decisions in thelight of its own particular circumstances - and certainly no two countries are exactly alike - someof the things we learnt may have relevance to other countries also.Lessons from New Zealand: encourage banks to behave prudentlyFirst, it is important that banks are given every incentive to behave prudently.This may seem a self-evident statement, but it is astonishing how frequently the importance ofthis principle is ignored. In New Zealand’s case, we diminished this incentive to behaveprudently by allowing the view to go unchallenged that banks were effectively ‘sovereign risk’,or at least ‘too big to fail’. This meant that bank creditors felt little need to assess thecreditworthiness of the banks with which they deposited funds - banks were, it was widelybelieved, effectively guaranteed by government. Bank boards and managements may have feltsimilarly protected against the possibility of failure, and made loans with a disregard for riskwhich was, in some cases, breath-taking. This so-called ‘moral hazard problem’ may have beenBIS Review   21/1998
- 3 -particularly severe in the case of two of the three institutions which got into serious difficultiesin the late 1980s, both of them owned wholly or in part by government. There was little or nodirection of their lending by government, but the management of both institutions certainlyembarked upon lending transactions in the newly liberalised environment which rapidly gotthem into serious difficulties.In some Asian countries, it is possible that the incentive for banks to behaveprudently was seriously eroded not only by the impression that most large financial institutionswould not be allowed to fail but also by the extent to which governments directed the lendingactivities of the banks themselves. After all, if governments are going to become extensivelyinvolved in directing where banks should and should not lend, it is not unreasonable if the banksand their creditors assume that governments will ‘see them right’ if things go wrong. Bankmanagement certainly has little incentive to carefully assess credit risk if, at the end of the day,the decision on whether or not to lend will be made by the bank’s board under the influence ordirection of higher political authority.At the moment, there is a great deal of international attention focused on how thisproblem of poor credit decisions in the banking sector can be dealt with. Most of the attention ison how official banking supervision and banking regulation can be improved, and made moreindependent of political influence. Certainly, freeing banks from political interference in theircredit decisions is very desirable, and better banking supervision is one possible way to reducethe risks of future problems in the banking system.But as some of you perhaps know, we in New Zealand are not persuaded thatimproving the quality of official banking supervision is the only way to proceed, or indeed evennecessarily the best way to proceed in all circumstances. When we reviewed what we were doingin banking supervision in the early 1990s, we became concerned. At that time, we wereconducting banking supervision along conventional Basle Committee lines. We were gatheringvery large amounts of confidential information from banks on a quarterly (sometimes a monthly)basis. We were laying down a large number of rules and limits designed to ensure that banksbehaved prudently.Several things prompted us to review that approach, and one of them was a worryabout the risks which we were incurring on behalf of taxpayers. What would happen if, despiteour banking supervision, a bank were to get into difficulties? Might depositors argue that theywanted full compensation, since while they had had no knowledge of the bank’s financialcondition we in the Reserve Bank were not only fully aware of that condition but were alsoresponsible for laying down the rules and limits by which the bank had been obliged to operate?We consoled ourselves with the thought that our banking supervision was so goodthat no banks would fail under our watchful eye. But then we looked abroad - at the UnitedStates, at Japan, at Scandinavia, at the United Kingdom, at Australia, and indeed even at NewZealand itself. We found banks going down in significant numbers, despite some extremelyprofessional and politically-independent banking supervision.  We could not be confident thattraditional banking supervision would prevent bank failure, and we could be confident that, bybeing the sole recipient of detailed financial information on banks and the main arbiter of whatconstituted prudent banking behaviour, there was a major risk that we would be held liable,politically and morally if not legally, for any losses incurred by depositors.Then we became aware of anecdotal evidence that our banking supervision wasreducing the incentive for bank directors to make their own decisions about crucial aspects ofBIS Review   21/1998
- 4 -their bank’s operations. In other words, because the Reserve Bank was laying down maximumindividual credit limits, and limits on open foreign exchange positions, and guidelines forinternal controls, some bank directors were assuming that they were necessarily behavingprudently provided they were operating within those limits and guidelines. They stoppedaddressing the risks which their own banks were facing and simply complied with the generallimits and guidelines. To the extent that that was true - and as I say we found some evidence thatit was true in some banks - we concluded that our banking supervision might actually beincreasing the risk of bank failure, by reducing the incentive for bank directors and bankmanagers to make their own careful assessment of risk.So we retain a system of official banking supervision, and we take it veryseriously. But we retain only a few absolute rules within that framework, principally that allbanks must at least meet the Basle capital adequacy rules, and rely mainly on a requirement thatbanks disclose to the public a substantial amount of financial information quarterly. In addition,all bank directors must sign off these quarterly statements, at the same time attesting to the factthat the internal controls of their banks are appropriate to the nature of their banking business,and that those controls are being properly applied. We in the Reserve Bank do not attempt to tellbanks what those controls should look like, but directors signing those quarterly statementswithout making a careful assessment of the adequacy of internal controls are exposingthemselves to very considerable legal risk in the event that their bank gets into difficulty.We have also gone out of our way on a number of occasions to make it clear tothe public that neither the Reserve Bank nor the government of New Zealand is guaranteeingindividual banks, and we published a booklet designed to assist the general public to interpretbanks’ financial information.None of these actions is a guarantee against imprudent bank behaviour, but webelieve that we have gone a considerable distance towards ensuring that banks face strongincentives to behave prudently. No bank operating in New Zealand is now owned bygovernment, none is guaranteed by government, none is obliged to lend to particular sectors orcompanies, and our supervision is based heavily on mandatory public disclosure and directorattestations. As Alan Greenspan said last year, ‘Regulation by government unavoidably involvessome element of perverse incentives. If private market participants believe that government isprotecting their interests, their own efforts to do so will diminish.’1  We have tried to minimisethose perverse incentives.Of course, to some extent this approach only works where there is a clearframework of company law which makes it clear that company directors and managers haveunambiguous responsibilities. Having agreed accounting rules is important.  Having a vigorousmedia, with probing financial journalists, is also of great value, so that when a bank is forced todisclose to the public a deteriorating financial position, or a breach of one of the few rules weretain, there is at least a reasonable chance of that being picked up and sensibly analysed by themedia. Not all countries are so lucky.So far at least, we are well satisfied by the way in which the new system isworking. (A few months after the new system first came into operation, at the beginning of1996, one bank was obliged to disclose the fact that it had had a credit exposure to itsshareholder bank which considerably exceeded the limit which we had stipulated for such                                                       1 Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System, Dr Alan Greenspan, at the annualconference of the Association of Private Enterprise Education, in Arlington, Virginia, on 12 April 1997.BIS Review   21/1998
- 5 -exposure. The attention focused on this issue by the media, and indeed by other banks, createdstrong incentives for the bank never to repeat that mistake - quite probably stronger incentivesthan any threat of central bank sanction could have created.)Lessons from New Zealand: beware of government ownership of banksThe second lesson from the New Zealand experience in the late 1980s is that theownership of banks is an important issue. For us, the issue was in part government ownership ofbanks and in part foreign ownership of banks. The government-owned financial institutionsalmost without exception suffered various degrees of financial difficulty - sometimes becausetheir managers had undertaken imprudent lending, and sometimes because they had been obligedto invest in large amounts of government securities at sub-market interest rates. The largeforeign-owned banks suffered to a much more limited extent from the bad debts and losseswhich the government-owned banks experienced.There have been various reasons given for this difference, but the most plausibleis that the large foreign-owned banks were under the watchful eye of experienced parent banks,and were therefore much less able to stray into some of the riskier propositions which temptedthe government-owned institutions, especially in the years immediately after the banking sectorwas liberalised in the mid-eighties. (The newly-arrived foreign-owned banks, however, often didsuccumb to the temptation of lending on risky propositions, perhaps because, being quite smallboth in absolute terms and in relation to their overseas parents, they were subject to much lessintensive parental scrutiny.)More recently, New Zealand has been running a very large balance of paymentsdeficit, probably amounting to more than 7 per cent of GDP at the present time. As in someAsian countries, this balance of payments deficit has been experienced at a time when thegovernment itself is running a fiscal surplus. In other words, it has been the private sector whichhas been borrowing heavily from overseas, not the public sector. And while some of thisborrowing has been done by the corporate sector directly, much of it has been done by thebanking sector. Comparable levels of overseas borrowing by some Asian banks have beensufficient to make foreign lenders very nervous, and yet similar nervousness has not been at allevident in New Zealand. Why? I can only conclude that the foreign lenders take considerablecomfort from the fact that most of the banks operating in New Zealand now are in factwholly-owned by foreign banks, or are indeed branches of foreign banks.  Those parents areseen as being financially strong, and fully able to back the operations of their New Zealandsubsidiaries or branches. (It may also be relevant that, overwhelmingly, the overseas borrowingbeing undertaken by New Zealand banks carries no foreign exchange risk for the banksthemselves.)In some countries, there is political reluctance to allow foreign institutionsunrestricted entry into local banking sectors. I would have to say that, as a country where all butone of our 19 banks are owned and controlled overseas, we have seen absolutely nodisadvantages from this situation, and many advantages. We have a financially stable bankingsector, with vigorously competing and highly innovative banks, all of them subject to themonetary policy influence of the central bank. I have no doubt at all that the banking sector isconsiderably more stable than would have been the case had all the banks beendomestically-owned, whether in the private sector or in the public sector.BIS Review   21/1998
- 6 -Lessons from New Zealand: keep prices stableThe third lesson from our experience has been the crucial importance of keepingprices stable. By the late 1980s, New Zealand had experienced nearly 20 years during whichinflation had been above 10 per cent almost without a break. Interest rates after adjustment fortax and inflation were often strongly negative, and there was as a consequence a strong incentiveto invest in real estate and shares, using as much borrowed money as could be obtained. Thiswas undoubtedly an important contributor to the severe difficulties which both the corporatesector and some parts of the banking sector experienced when monetary policy was tightened inorder to reduce inflation. Interest rates went up and asset prices went down, and several banksincurred very large losses as a consequence.Asian countries have an enviable record of combining very rapid rates ofeconomic growth with rates of inflation which, by the standards of many other countries, havebeen low or moderate. But it is also true that in many Asian countries relatively low consumerprice inflation has been accompanied by a huge escalation in asset prices.  There is no singleexplanation for this phenomenon and, as New Zealand has itself discovered over recent years,with quite a strong increase in the price of both residential and rural property, it is oftenextraordinarily difficult to restrain asset price inflation even when inflation in consumer prices islow.But it is at least possible that asset price inflation in Japan in the late 1980s - thereversal of which has done so much damage to bank balance sheets in that country - was aconsequence of monetary policy being kept too easy for too long, whether to appease the UnitedStates after the Plaza Accord or for some other reason I know not. Similarly, it may well be thatif central banks in some other Asian countries had not been so preoccupied with trying to avoidthe appreciation of their currencies against the US dollar as capital flowed into these economiesin recent years, their interest rates would have been higher and asset price inflationcommensurately reduced. And of course if asset price inflation had been less, theover-investment in certain kinds of real estate would presumably have been less and, with that,the subsequent fall in asset prices would have been less also.Lessons from New Zealand: avoid pegging the exchange rateAnd that brings me on rather naturally to the final lesson from New Zealandexperience, and that is the danger of pegging the exchange rate unless you are prepared to go allthe way to a currency board, as Hong Kong has done, and have the political and banking sectorstrength to endure the economic, political, and social pain which is inevitably associated with acurrency board arrangement from time to time.In New Zealand, we had a pegged exchange rate until March 1985. Prior to thatdate, it was not uncommon for companies to borrow overseas, often at interest rates which werevery much lower than those within the high inflation New Zealand economy.  Some companiesmade rather spectacular losses when the New Zealand dollar was devalued from time to time, orwhen, even when pegged, the New Zealand dollar depreciated against the currency in which theloan was denominated. (Borrowing in Swiss francs was particularly popular, and particularlypainful, for some companies.) But the losses were probably fairly moderate in comparison to theloss which the government itself incurred on behalf of taxpayers in 1984. In that year, the NewZealand dollar was devalued by 20 per cent after a foreign exchange crisis which had certainsimilarities to some of those in Asia more recently and the government, which had written veryBIS Review   21/1998
- 7 -large volumes of forward exchange contracts with companies trying to protect their positions,incurred losses of many hundreds of millions of dollars.Since March 1985, the New Zealand dollar has been freely floating, and indeed Isuspect we may be the only central bank that can claim not to have intervened directly in theforeign exchange market for more than 13 years. (I say ‘directly’ because from time to time wedid adjust monetary policy when we felt that movements in the exchange rate seemed likely tothreaten our single goal of low inflation.) One of the benefits of this has been that, though manycompanies and banks have borrowed overseas, none of this borrowing was undertaken in thebelief that there was no currency risk involved. Overseas interest rates were frequently muchlower than those in New Zealand, but after factoring in the exchange rate risk, the incentive toborrow offshore in foreign currency was substantially reduced.As a consequence, when, after a period of strong New Zealand dollar appreciationbetween early 1993 and early 1997, the New Zealand dollar fell by some 18 per cent against theUS dollar, there were very few companies unhappy about that fall - and indeed plenty ofexporters who were delighted. Even fewer of our banks were caught out by the depreciation, andto the best of my knowledge none incurred losses as a consequence of the move. Because theyknew that the New Zealand dollar was freely floating, they were careful to avoid taking onunhedged positions in foreign currency.ConclusionIn conclusion, in a world of open capital markets, the challenges facing banks arevery considerable. Central banks can not prevent all banks from getting into trouble, and norshould they try to do so. But central banks do have a responsibility in all our countries topromote the stability of the banking sector. In my own view, they can best do that by creatingstrong incentives for banks to behave prudently; by discouraging government ownership ofbanks, and removing barriers to the foreign ownership of banks; by keeping the focus ofmonetary policy on price stability; and by not creating the impression that borrowing in foreigncurrency is a riskless activity. We learnt those lessons the hard way.BIS Review   21/1998
Mr. Macfarlane gives an overview of the Asian situation from an Australianperspective   Talk by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. I.J. Macfarlane, to theAmerican Australian Association, in conjunction with the Asia Society, The Downtown EconomistsInc., New York Association of Business Economists and the International Economists Club held inNew York on 11/3/98.This is my first opportunity to address such an important audience in New York, but Ihope it will be the first of many such occasions. I have chosen as my topic the current Asiansituation, which as you can well imagine is exercising a lot of our time and thought in Australia at themoment. We like to think that there is a lot of expertise in Asian affairs in Australia among ourpolicy-makers, in our universities and in our press, and that therefore an Australian perspective couldhave interest for a wider audience.Forecasting economic crisesThe events in Asia over the last 18 months have raised again the issue of whether it ispossible to forecast economic crises. The international community went through the sameself-examination after Mexico in 1994, and a large amount of research was done on the subject -much of it by the IMF.It sounds as though it should be easy. We can all point to obvious signs of trouble inparticular countries - in Mexico, the over-valuation of the real exchange rate; in Thailand, decliningexports and widening current account deficit; in Korea and Indonesia, the large amount of unhedgedforeign borrowing. This type of casual empiricism, however, is not good enough; it tends to highlighta different factor for each country. To be a useful forecasting device, we need to identify a set ofcharacteristics that is nearly always present in all countries that are about to experience an economiccrisis. A number of economic studies have set out to do this, and have found a few useful regularities,but not much more. The results have disappointed those who hoped for a forecasting kit which wouldenable them to pick the timing of the next crisis and the countries involved.The private sector has not done any better as a forecaster, judged by interest ratespreads and credit ratings. The spreads between Asian interest rates and comparable US ratesnarrowed during the 1990s to reach a low point in the first half of 1997 just as the problems wereabout to unfold. The ratings agencies made no downgrades in the first half of 1997, and compoundedthe problem by making a flurry of downgrades after Asian currencies had already fallen sharply.Notwithstanding the disappointing results of these forecasts, I intend to examine someof the characteristics that seem to lie behind the economic crises of the past decade. But before doingso, I should say a word or two about what is meant by an economic crisis - it could be somethingtemporary and manageable, or, on the other hand, it could be an economic disaster.What do we mean by an economic crisis?Most of the studies on this subject concentrate on a very specific sub-species ofeconomic crisis, namely a currency crisis. This has the advantage that it can be measured by onevariable - a currency crisis can be defined as any episode when the exchange rate falls by a largeamount in a short period. A definition of this type would usually include, among others, Thailand,Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Korea and the Czech Republic in 1997, Mexico in 1994, the UnitedKingdom and Italy in 1992, and Australia in 1985. I could add a much bigger list if I wanted to, butthe above selection is sufficient to illustrate the points I want to make.BIS Review   20/1998
- 2 -The most important point is that a currency crisis need not be much of a crisis at all, inthat it may not lead to a broader economic crisis. While it often does lead to a broader crisis - as inAsia today - there are examples in the above list where it was not the case. Few would argue that theUnited Kingdom’s or Italy’s departure from the ERM precipitated an economic crisis or led to anylasting hardship. I would make the same case for Australia in 1985. The depreciation of the exchangerate in these cases led to a beneficial policy response, had only short-term inflationary impact, andwas soon followed by a significant appreciation.It seems to me that a fruitful approach would be to look at the factors which are likelyto precipitate a currency crisis, and look elsewhere for another set of factors which would cause acurrency crisis to lead to a full-blown economic crisis. By this, I mean a deep recession, highinflation and widespread corporate and banking collapses.Factors leading to a currency crisisThere is a literature dating back to the 1980s which deals with speculative attacks oncurrencies. Not surprisingly, this points out that any country that has a combination of a fixedexchange rate and the free movement of international capital is particularly vulnerable to a successfulspeculative attack. The ERM departures of 1992 and the Asian currency crises of 1997 fit neatly intothis pattern. But other countries with fixed exchange rates have been successful in avoidingdepreciation. For example, France maintained its peg in 1992 and Hong Kong has done so for thepast 13 years, despite the turmoil in its region. As well, some countries with floating exchange rateshave experienced currency crises. All that can be concluded at this stage is that a fixed exchange rateis more likely to result in a currency crisis than a floating one. It is more “brittle” - it allowsspeculators to build a position without turning the price against themselves. Also, it does not allowthe monetary authorities a tactical retreat - they have to keep supplying foreign reserves at a fixedprice.The situation described above becomes more marked if three other conditions apply: if there is evidence that the currency is becoming over-valued, either becauseof domestic inflation (as in Mexico), or because it is fixed to an appreciating currency (such as inAsia in 1997); if there have recently been other currency crises in countries with similarcharacteristics. Currency crises come in bunches; contagion is as good an indication of impendingtrouble as are any “fundamental indicators”; if there is evidence to suggest that the Government will not have thenecessary support to be able to resist depreciation. Such resistance would normally involvetightenings of fiscal and monetary policy which would be hard if the economy is in or near recession,or where the balance sheets of the corporate sector are very weak.I have not mentioned the traditional villains - large budget deficits financed by centralbanks, and the resulting rapid monetary expansion and inflation. I do not want to suggest that thesewill not lead to a currency crisis - obviously, they will, but they have not been the main culprits inrecent years.1 The interesting situations - and the ones worth studying - are where currency crisesoccur in countries with reasonably responsible fiscal and monetary policies, as in most of the casescited above.                                                       1 In an earlier speech I called these Type I crises and contrasted them to Type II crises where problemscentred on the weakness of banking systems and other private sector deficiencies (as discussed below).   See“The Changing Nature of Economic Crises”, Reserve Bank of Australia Bulletin, December 1997.BIS Review   20/1998
- 3 -Another category of economic characteristics that are traditionally associated withcurrency crises are those pertaining to a country’s external trade situation, such as its current accountdeficit or its accumulated external debts. Again, a large current account deficit is often associatedwith a currency crisis, but there are enough important exceptions to question whether this would be auseful indicator of an impending currency crisis. For example, neither Indonesia nor Korea had largecurrent account deficits in the 1990s (including in 1997), nor did either the United Kingdom or Italyin 1992. The celebrated case in the opposite direction is Singapore, which ran a current accountdeficit which averaged 15 per cent of GDP for the decade of the 1970s without a currency crisis.As you may have noticed, I have not mentioned any of the economic characteristicsthat have received so much attention in discussions of the current Asian situation. These includelongstanding structural features such as soundness of the domestic banking system, the transparencyof business relationships, the degree of government involvement in private investment decisions, orthe quality of bank supervision. While these are important, they are important in a different way.Deficiencies in these areas clearly cannot be the cause of the recent currency crisis in Asia, becausethese deficiencies have been around for decades. They did not deter international capital from flowingin year after year and, therefore, could not be the cause of the change of direction in 1997.They are important, not because they cause a currency crisis, but because they providean environment where a currency crisis can lead to a severe economic crisis.Severe economic crisesWhether a currency crisis leads to a severe economic crisis or not depends on twofactors - how far the currency falls, and how resilient the economy is to a lower exchange rate andhigher interest rates.(a) The size of the depreciationThis may sound as though it is a small diversion from the main theme, but it is not. Itis quite possible that an exchange rate may fall by an amount much greater than anyone expected onthe basis of ex ante information (anyone can always make up an ex post justification). This shouldnot surprise us because no-one has yet been able to find a satisfactory explanation for movements inthe exchange rate. That is, no-one has found an equation linking the exchange rate to variouseconomic variables that is good enough to yield forecasts that outperform crude rules of thumb. Weknow that certain factors, such as those listed in the previous section, are associated with falls in theexchange rate, but we do not know whether the fall will occur this month or in two years, or whetherit will be 10 per cent, 20 per cent or 80 per cent.One thing that seems clear is that in the early days of a floating exchange rate regime,we should expect some very large movements, particularly if the balance of forces is in the directionof depreciation. Markets are unfamiliar with the new system, they have no track record to guide them,there is often an atmosphere of panic among market participants or indecision among policy makers,and reliable information is hard to come by. In these circumstances, overshooting is almost bound tooccur. In Australia’s case, the Australian dollar moved from a relatively fixed regime to a float inDecember 1983 because it was under upward pressure. Yet within 15 months the scene had changedand it began to depreciate sharply; in the space of 17 months it fell by 39 per cent in effective terms.This was a gross overshooting, as subsequent events proved (it regained two-thirds of its fall in thesubsequent year).BIS Review   20/1998
- 4 -The situation in Asia involves an altogether higher order of uncertainty. Theircurrencies were floated because they could not resist downward pressure in 1997,2 and they had togive up their fixed rate regimes and move to a float before anyone was prepared for the new system.In these circumstances, floating rate regimes operate very badly and are extremely sensitive toconfidence factors. Great skill is required in finding the right policies and managing the crisis. Thecountries concerned usually have no experience of it, and therefore often turn to the internationalcommunity for help. It is an equally large challenge for the international institutions and the spirit ofinternational co-operation.When an exchange rate falls quickly to half its former level, or a quarter (as inIndonesia), the strain on the economy becomes intense. Even in those countries with the mostadvanced banking systems, capital markets and regulatory regimes, such a fall is hard to handle. It isalso clear that countries in this situation would have to attempt to reduce the size of the depreciationby raising interest rates, so that the economy would face a combination of a lower exchange rate andhigher interest rates.(b) Resilience of the financial sectorA large, but not enormous, fall in the exchange rate - say, something between 20 and40 per cent - could in some circumstances be absorbed without lasting damage, but in others it couldlead to a major economic crisis. On the basis of recent experience, it now seems that the factorswhich are most likely to lead to an economic crisis are financial in nature, and pertain particularly tothe structure of the banking system, the financial health of the corporate sector and the generalfinancial infrastructure. A shortlist of the main factors that reduce an economy’s resilience, and hencemean that a currency crisis will be translated into an economic crisis, is as follows:(a)Has it recently experienced a debt-financed asset price boom, and thusbecome vulnerable to a large fall in asset prices? Have there been a large rise in the ratio ofcredit to GDP, an increase in corporate gearing, and, of course, large increases in propertyand equity prices?(b)Is the financial sector in good shape? The main thing to look for hereis the quality of bank lending as indicated by the level of bad debts, the extent of lending thathas been collateralised by over-priced assets, or more crudely, the proportion of lending to theproperty sector. It is bound to be difficult to get reliable figures, so an alternative would be tomake an assessment of the quality of bank supervision. A starting point here would be to lookfor a good set of ownership rules; these should limit the extent of lending to related parties.(c)Have banks and commercial firms financed themselves by unhedgedforeign borrowing? Every crisis focuses attention on at least one important cause, and thispattern of financing seems to be heavily implicated in each of the current Asian troublespots.(d)Is the financial infrastructure strong enough to handle a crisis? Bythis, I mean the accounting standards, commercial law, disclosure requirements andbankruptcy procedures. In current parlance, this is often discussed under the title of“governance”, and means an institutional framework that limits the extent of related partytransactions (also known as “crony capitalism”). A favourable score in this area is needed to                                                       2 Of course, we should not lose sight of the fact that in the preceding years of the 1990s, thesecountries were under chronic upward pressure.BIS Review   20/1998
- 5 -help investors and lenders gauge whether they are dealing with a solvent or insolventcounterparty.A feature of all these underlying financial characteristics is that they are very slow tochange. Just as deficiencies in this area cannot have been the cause of the recent currency crises, it ishard to believe that meaningful improvements to them can be made quickly enough to restoreconfidence to currency markets. A tax or an interest rate can be raised immediately, and so cause arapid turnaround in fiscal or monetary policy. Domestic demand can fall sharply, leading to a quickmove into surplus in the current account, as we have already seen in Asia. But improvements tofinancial infrastructure and the sorting out of a weakened banking sector inevitably take a long time,and any immediate measures are more in the nature of a “promise” than an achievement. They willnot quickly prevent capital outflow or restore inflow: the immediate solution lies elsewhere.Concluding commentsNeither the financial markets, international organisations nor academic economists aregood at predicting currency crises. In the past, they have happened in circumstances that appearedquite tranquil, for example mid-1997.The likelihood of crises happening is greatest for countries that have a relatively fixedexchange rate and are open to international capital flows. The speed with which these flows can turnaround is astonishing. The five Asian countries at the centre of the current troubles - Thailand,Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Korea - received private capital inflows equivalent to 8 per centof GDP in 1996, and outflows of nearly 2 per cent in 1997.3 Such a turnaround in capital flows, toquote Chairman Greenspan’s understated style, “do not appear to have resulted wholly from ameasured judgment that fundamental forces have turned appreciably more adverse. More likely, itsroot is a process that is neither measured or rational . . .”4It is not surprising that these countries’ exchange rate regimes collapsed and theywere forced into a rather hurried float. It should also not be surprising that the ensuing depreciationswere extremely large, because that seems to be a common pattern. The smallest of the depreciationswas still of the order of 40 per cent, and this plus the rise in interest rates was bound to put enormouspressure on domestic financial systems.In my analysis, I have distinguished between factors that are likely to cause a currencycrisis and factors that are likely to mean it will become a general economic crisis. I have also said thatI do not think the second set of factors - essentially deficiencies in the financial infrastructure - couldhave triggered the currency crisis, because they have been around for years. The problem, however,is that they can interact with the currency crisis once it has started. Market participants who may havebeen indifferent to deficiencies in the financial infrastructure at the old exchange rate start to voicedisapproval of it once the exchange rate has fallen. But nothing may have changed with respect tofinancial infrastructure: the only new information on which the change in judgment could be based isthe lower exchange rate itself. This could become self-reinforcing and lead to further capital outflowand a yet lower exchange rate.There has been a tendency for this to occur over the past 12 months. For this reason,and others, we have seen exchange rates in some Asian countries that have fallen to half of their levela year ago or, in Indonesia’s case, a quarter. Falls of this size defy economic logic and serve no useful                                                       3 Institute of International Finance.4 Remarks before the Annual Financial Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, MiamiBeach, Florida, 27 February 1998.BIS Review   20/1998
- 6 -economic purpose. Indonesia was a successful trading nation a year ago at its former exchange rate,with a healthy growth of exports and a modest current account deficit. There is no value to Indonesia,to the region or the world in now having an exchange rate at a quarter of its former level.Any collective solution to the current troubles in Asia should have as a priority theaim of restoring exchange rates a fair way towards their former value. We should not lose sight ofwhat we originally intended to do when the international support packages were put together forThailand, Indonesia and Korea. Our aim was to allow an orderly economic adjustment and tominimise the risk of further contagion into other parts of Asia and the rest of the world. Our aim wasnot to capitalise on any of these countries’ difficulties in order to bring about a politicaltransformation.Some of the steps towards the restoration of a more realistic set of exchange rates arealready occurring. Most, if not all, of the troubled Asian countries have returned to trade surplus and,probably, current account surplus. Although it would be a great help, it is not absolutely necessary torestore capital inflow; in the short term, all that is needed in order to provide some upward pressureon currencies is to prevent further capital outflow. The collective agreement among major banks torollover Korean bank debt, and then to reschedule it, was a good example of what can be done. Ifthere is insufficient initiative or cohesion among private lenders to Indonesia to follow the Koreanlead, then a greater involvement of governments and the IMF is required. Whatever the details thatare finally worked out, there can be little doubt that the overwhelming priority is to rollover,reschedule, restructure existing debt or do whatever else is necessary to prevent further capitaloutflow.BIS Review   20/1998
Mr. George reviews the role and structure of the New Lady of ThreadneedleStreet   Text of the Vital Topic Lecture given by the Governor of the Bank of England,Mr. E.A.J. George, at the Manchester Business School on 24/2/98.At some point in the next few months the Bank of England will receive a newCharter. The occasion will lack the ceremonial that accompanied the grant of our first Charter in1694, when the Governors and Directors gathered in a solicitor’s office in Lincoln’s Inn Fieldsand swore oaths of allegiance to the King and of fidelity to the Company of the Bank ofEngland. The Charter itself will be a typescript bound with red ribbon - quite unlike the massiveilluminated manuscript of the original Charter displayed in our Museum: indeed we may evenhave to dispense with the red ribbon if the Treasury carry out their threat to send the documentto us by e-mail. But as a milestone in the Bank’s long history, this new Charter is almost assignificant as the first: and taken together with the new Bank of England Bill currently beforeParliament, it foreshadows a rebirth of the Bank - the New Lady of Threadneedle Street.Just four days after taking office last May the Government announced itsintention of giving the Bank immediate operational independence in relation to the conduct ofmonetary policy. A fortnight later the Government announced a radical reform of the entirestructure of financial services regulation in this country. This leaves the Bank with its traditionalresponsibility for maintaining the stability of the financial system as a whole, but transfers ourpresent specific responsibility for banking supervision to a new, single, regulator for the wholeof the financial services industry. The Bill now before Parliament legislates for these changesinsofar as they affect the Bank and it also changes the arrangements for the Bank’s internalgovernance and puts our finances on a statutory footing.The new legislation does not fundamentally alter the Bank’s raison d’etre - ourcore purposes. The heart of it remains the maintenance of monetary and financial stability, aswell as the promotion of the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial system. But it bringsnew clarity to our responsibilities, and it ensures greater transparency and public accountabilityin relation to all our activities. It is in fact a radical re-styling of the Old Lady. And tonight Ishould like to introduce you to the New Lady, and explain just what it is that the new-style Bankof England is seeking to do and how we are organised to manage our affairs.Governance of the BankLet me begin at the top with the changes to our governing body - the Bank’sCourt - or Board - of Directors. We already have a heavily non-executive based board,consisting of myself and the Deputy Governor, four full-time Executive Directors, and twelvenon-Executive Directors. The new Court will be entirely non-executive apart from myself andtwo Deputy Governors. Court as a whole will set the Bank’s strategy, determine its budget and -in the hallowed language of the 1946 Bank of England Act - “manage the affairs of the Bank”.In this sense we remain a unitary board. But, under the present Bill, the sixteen non-executivemembers, as a group, will be given the specific duty of reviewing the performance of the Bank,including the conduct of its financial affairs, and including the procedures of the MonetaryPolicy Committee, satisfying itself inter alia, that the Monetary Policy Committee takes properaccount of economic conditions in the various regions of the country. The prospectivenon-executive appointments to Court announced last week in fact include increasedrepresentation from the regions, with members from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Thenon-executives will have their own chairman, appointed by the Chancellor. The first chairmanwill in fact be Dame Sheila Masters of KPMG, currently Vice-President of the Institute ofChartered Accountants of England and Wales. They will be required to report on the Bank’sBIS Review   18/1998
- 2 -performance to Parliament in a separate section of the Bank’s Annual Report. The Bank’sRemuneration and Audit Committees will, as now, be made up entirely of non-executivemembers of Court. All of this is in the spirit of the most modern principles of corporategovernance.The Bank’s financesA second important change relates to our finances. In some senses the Bank islike a conventional trading company: we have our own capital and balance sheet, we trade, wemake profits, and we pay both tax and a dividend to our shareholder, the Government. But thereare also parts of our public policy functions - relating to monetary and financial stability - that,by their nature cannot be directly charged out to individual beneficiaries of our activities andwhich we need to finance in other ways. Like other central banks we, therefore, takeunremunerated deposits from the banking system on which we earn income, for this purpose.Central banks generally levy this charge on the banking - or deposit-taking - sector specifically,because one of the essential services we undertake is the provision, through our money marketoperations, of sufficient cash day-by-day to the banking system to allow it to balance its books.Without that the banks collectively would need to hold more cash with the central bank in placeof interest-bearing liquid assets than they do at present. These “cash ratio deposits” in thiscountry have hitherto been voluntary. The new Bill puts them on a statutory footing, with therate of deposit to be determined by the Government.The charge on the banks in this form has always been lower than in other majorcentres. This reflects the fact that the Bank of England is among the lowest cost central banks inthe world - with a fraction of the staff of the Bundesbank, the Banque de France or the FederalReserve System even when adjustment is made for differences in function. The charge willcertainly now be significantly lower to reflect inter-alia the transfer of banking supervision tothe FSA. But I recognise that whatever our costs we need to be accountable for the resourcesthat we use and the burden we place on the banking system. We will now be more accountable -to Court, to the Government that will set the charge, to the banks themselves and the widerpublic through our Annual Report.The Bank’s functionsBelow the Court the new Bank will be organised administratively into three mainsubdivisions, reflecting our responsibilities for monetary stability and financial stability, eachunder a Deputy Governor, with the third subdivision responsible for all forms of financialmarket operations, under a senior Executive Director. The central services of the Bank,including personnel and finance, will report to the Deputy Governor, Financial Stability, whowill remain responsible for the day-to-day management of the Bank.The main changes in the Bill affect our monetary stability and financial stabilityfunctions, which I will discuss in turn.Monetary StabilityLet me start with monetary stability - although the new arrangements may befamiliar to you not least because they are in place already! The Chancellor decided last May thathe would no longer exercise his powers to set short-term interest rates. Anticipating the Bank ofEngland Bill, he set an inflation target and delegated the technical implementation of monetarypolicy to achieve that target to a new Monetary Policy Committee established within the Bank.BIS Review   18/1998
- 3 -The Monetary Policy Committee has been operating independently in setting interest rates eversince.This position is formalised under the Bill. With respect to monetary policy theBill defines the Bank’s objective as the maintenance of price stability, and, subject to that, assupporting the Government’s economic policy, including its objectives for growth andemployment.The Chancellor will tell the Bank each year what precisely we are to understandby “price stability” - he will, in other words - set a specific inflation target. He has in factinitially set a target of 2½% for underlying inflation, and although the Bill provides for him toset the target each year, the expectation is that the target is for the medium to longer term. Thatis the political decision. The task of achieving that target - the technical implementation ofmonetary policy - is then delegated to the Bank of England. The Government will no longerhave the power to issue directions to the Bank in the field of monetary policy (except, in theterms of the Bill, in “extreme economic circumstances”). Instead, the Bill will formally establishthe Monetary Policy Committee. This is to be made up of myself, the two Deputy Governors,two Executive Directors of the Bank - responsible respectively for the Bank’s economic analysisand the Bank’s financial market operations, and four outside members nominated by theChancellor and having professional knowledge and experience relevant to the Committee’sfunctions. It also includes a Treasury observer, who may participate in our discussions, and actsas a link between the fiscal and monetary authorities, but who may not vote on our monetarypolicy decisions.The overriding purpose of these new arrangements is to improve the credibility ofmonetary policy, and to demonstrate to the world at large the Government’s commitment toachieving and maintaining effective price stability. But it is important to understand that thisobjective is not simply an end in itself. The ultimate objective, of course, is growth of output andemployment and rising living standards - there is no question about that. The argument is aboutmeans, not about ends. And effective price stability as the immediate objective of monetarypolicy is a necessary condition for growth to be sustained into the medium and longer term. Theaim of achieving permanently low inflation is a deliberate attempt to break away from theboom-bust cycles of the post-war years, which led, as we can all remember, to a persistentratcheting up of inflationary expectations and a steady erosion of long-term thinking andplanning, saving and productive investment, on the part of consumers and businesses. Bypursuing price stability - by keeping aggregate demand consistently, broadly in line with theunderlying, structural, supply-side capacity of the economy to meet that demand - we hope to beable to moderate, rather than aggravate, the cyclical swings in output and prices and to ensurethat growth is sustained in the medium term and hopefully then greater in the long term than itwould otherwise be.The operation of the Monetary Policy CommitteeThat then is what the Monetary Policy Committee is trying to do. Let me say aword about our procedures.On the Friday before our regular monthly decision-taking meeting, the MonetaryPolicy Committee members are given an intensive, all-day, briefing by the Bank of Englandprofessional staff on all the latest relevant data and on the staff’s analysis. This includes realeconomic and financial, statistical, anecdotal and survey, information and analysis, comparisonwith the work of outside analysts and commentators, and, importantly, input from our 12BIS Review   18/1998
- 4 -regional Agents who are in regular contact with all sectors of economic activity across thecountry. This includes, of course, input from our Manchester Agent, Tony Strachan, who I amsure is very well known to many of you.The, currently eight, MPC members, alone with just a small Secretariat, thenreconvene on the following Wednesday afternoon to identify and discuss the key issues and anytactical considerations, before meeting to take and announce our decision the following morning.This process of regular and systematic assessment, based on the economic andfinancial data, is unimaginably different from the erratic reaction to financial marketdisturbances which characterised the conduct of monetary policy too often in the more distantpast. And the reflective, interactive, debate within the Monetary Policy Committee is verydifferent too from the sometimes exaggerated advocacy of a particular viewpoint whichinevitably crept in to the Ken and Eddie show during which the Bank usually had at most anhour in which to persuade a sometimes reluctant Chancellor! The present arrangements allow usto explore, without initially taking hard positions, alternative possible interpretations of the dataand their implications; and those discussions capture far better than before the uncertaintiesinherent in the conduct of monetary policy. It is, I think, how monetary policy really should bemade.Transparency and accountabilityWith operational independence comes - quite rightly in my view - even greatertransparency and public accountability.The minutes of the two-day meeting at which that decision is taken, together witha summary of the information presented by the staff, are published in the week after thefollowing meeting. Those minutes also record the individual votes of each member of theCommittee.Beyond this, we publish a regular assessment of monetary policy - including aforecast of inflation over the two-year period that we believe is relevant, given the lags betweenpolicy actions and inflation outturns - in the Bank’s Quarterly Inflation Report. And theTreasury Select Committee of the House of Commons regularly summons me and othermembers of the Monetary Policy Committee to give evidence on the basis of these reports.Finally, the Government has made it a requirement that, if we miss the target of2.5% by 1% or more in either direction, the Committee must write an open letter to theChancellor, explaining why, how long we expect to stay adrift from the target, and what weintend to do about it. These arrangements, taken together, provide a framework of transparencyand accountability that, as far as I am aware, goes far beyond anything which applies anywhereelse in the world.Public understanding of what we are trying to do and why - even understandingthat the conduct of monetary policy is not a precise science but rather a matter of balancingrisks - is crucial to our success. And transparency and public understanding should - byinfluencing public expectations - reduce the costs of maintaining low inflation.But, of course, you need broad shoulders. As you know the minutes of ourJanuary meeting - published a fortnight ago - revealed that the MPC was for the first timedivided in its policy decision. That inevitably led to an excited and over-simple categorisation ofBIS Review   18/1998
- 5 -individual members of the Committee as either hawks or doves. In reality the division betweenus was a very narrow one, reflecting the fact - now acknowledged by most outsidecommentators - that the decision, as to whether or not we will need to raise interest ratesmoderately further, sooner or later, is very finely balanced. I hope this is a situation that we willget used to. I would expect the professional experts on the MPC to agree quite easily whenmonetary policy is clearly off track; but I would equally expect them to disagree as often as notat the margin when we are there or thereabouts. As it is I was actually encouraged by thereaction of many of the more thoughtful commentators who - in the circumstances - recognisedthat it was a reflection of a grown-up process that we could publish a division within theCommittee and the reasons for it without generating significant market disturbance. In thissense, too, I think it likely that once the new arrangements are properly bedded down they willbe seen to be a very considerable advance on what has gone before.Financial StabilityLet me turn now to the Bank’s second core purpose, the maintenance of financialstability.On the same day that the Bank of England Bill was introduced into Parliament,the Chancellor launched the new Financial Services Authority, the FSA, which will becomeresponsible for the authorisation and regulation or supervision of effectively all forms offinancial services activity in the UK.This is an extraordinarily bold and radical step, not attempted on anything likethis scale in any other developed financial centre, and the experiment is being watched withgreat interest by other central banks and regulators from around the world.But there are very strong reasons for moving away from the traditional model of aseparate regulator for each different type of activity - banking, securities, insurance and so on.Financial innovation and globalisation, driven by an interactive process of newinformation technology, competition and deregulation, are, unquestionably, progressivelyblurring the traditional boundaries between different forms of financial intermediation. Soregulation based on particular categories of institution has increasingly become overlaid byfunctional regulation. That has made the whole regulatory structure increasingly complex, bothfor the regulated firms and for the consuming public at large.It has made it increasingly complex, too, for the regulators! There are no fewerthan nine separate regulators joining the FSA. The new organisation may look big and complex,but I have to tell you that the task of co-ordinating the interests and responsibilities of all thoseseparate regulators, across the business of an increasing number of multi-functional groups, wasthreatening to become bigger still. Firms with complex financial services activities here in theUK welcome the idea of a one-stop regulatory shop where at present they have to deal with abewildering array of different regulators for different purposes. A single, over-arching, regulatorwill mean a clear line of responsibility and accountability, and it should also help to bring aboutgreater consistency of regulatory approach.In relation to banking supervision in particular there seem to me to be realadvantages in separating out the central bank’s responsibility for the stability of the financialsystem as a whole from the supervision of individual banking institutions. In the latter case, wehave seen during the twenty or so years that the Bank has had statutory responsibility forBIS Review   18/1998
- 6 -banking supervision how the public policy interest in our activities has increasingly focused onconsumer protection. That is not at all a natural habitat for a central bank. It may indeed producea conflict of interest if it causes the central bank to become over-protective of individualinstitutions, giving rise to moral hazard in the system as a whole.We were conscious of these tensions in the “old” Bank, although we foundeffective, informal, ways of reconciling them.There are therefore powerful reasons for including banking supervision amongthe responsibilities that are to be transferred to the FSA. The trick will be to ensure that theBank’s capacity to identify and address emerging “systemic” financial problems - that is thosewhich may have a significantly disruptive effect on the financial system as a whole rather thanjust on individual financial institutions - is not damaged in the process. And the key to that isthat both the Bank and the FSA should have a clear understanding of their respectiveresponsibilities, and that they should continuously work very closely together to ensure that theykeep sufficiently out of each others hair without letting things disappear between the cracks!Our ongoing relationship was formalised during the summer in a Memorandum ofUnderstanding (MOU) agreed between the Bank, FSA and the Treasury. This defines verycarefully our respective responsibilities and provides for both the Bank and the FSA to exchangeinformation freely and to consult where our interests interact or overlap. It helpfully establishesa high-level Treasury-Bank-FSA Standing Committee, which will provide a forum in which acommon position can be developed in relation to emerging problems. And, as a further means ofensuring that we are aware of each other’s concerns, the Chairman of the FSA will become amember of Court, while the Deputy Governor responsible for Financial Stability will serve onthe FSA Board. In the end the success of these arrangements will depend upon the workingrelationships between our respective staff at all levels, and it is helpful in this context that ourown supervisory staff are moving to the FSA which will help to ensure that we establish theright working relationships from the beginning. But we will need to work at these relationshipscontinuously to ensure that they are embedded into the future.Systemic RiskRelieved of our responsibility for supervising individual banks - and it is aconsiderable relief I can tell you - the “new” Bank can concentrate its energies on detecting andlimiting systemic financial risk. That is a responsibility of central banks everywhere, andbecause it involves close monitoring of economic and financial market developments -nationally and internationally - it fits more naturally and comfortably alongside ourresponsibilities for monetary stability. This responsibility will be overseen by a new, internal,Financial Stability Committee which effectively parallels the role and procedures of theMonetary Policy Committee.What we mean by “systemic risk” specifically is the danger that a failure of onefinancial business may infect other, otherwise healthy, businesses. This could happen in either oftwo ways: first through the direct financial exposures which tie firms together like mountaineers,so that if one falls off the rock face others are pulled off too; and second, by contagious panicwhich sweeps everyone off the mountain side like an avalanche. The dangers still relateparticularly to commercial banking businesses, because banks are still at the centre of paymentsand settlements systems, and they are still relatively heavily engaged in the maturitytransformation of liquid liabilities into less liquid assets as an important part of their coreactivity. But it is of course clear, in today’s world of global finance, that disturbances with theBIS Review   18/1998
- 7 -capacity to inflict systemic, financial, damage, and associated economic disruption, can originateoutside the commercial banking system.There are, certainly, things that we can do to reduce the risks - to try to preventthe first climber falling off the rock face, or to avoid kicking the rock that starts the avalanche.A key condition, obviously, is maintaining macro-economic, monetary, stability.That goes without saying. It gives everyone on the mountainside much the best chance ofcoming down unscathed!We can also turn the new information technology to our advantage, using it tomake the linkages between the climbers safer - by reducing the risks in payments andsettlements systems. A good deal of our attention on the financial stability side of the Bank isfocused in this direction.And we can satisfy ourselves - through micro-prudential supervision andregulation of individual financial businesses - that the climbers are properly trained andequipped, and fully conscious of the risks. This now, of course, becomes the responsibility of theFSA.InterventionBut however much we try to prevent accidents, we need to be prepared for themto happen. The Bank’s concern then becomes to ensure that they do not spread to other parts ofthe financial system.This may involve providing liquidity on penal terms, outside the central bank’snormal money market operations, against high quality assets to a particular institution, that doesnot want to appear in the market because it is under a cloud. Or it may mean standing betweenan intermediary and the market place, to facilitate payments or settlements which might nototherwise be completed, which could then cause gridlock. Such involvement would not normallyinvolve the central bank in significant financial risk.But in more difficult - and mercifully rare - situations, where the failure of oneinstitution could bring down other - otherwise viable - institutions, the central bank may need toconsider acting in the role of “lender of last resort” to the failing institution, against poorerquality, less liquid, assets which might expose the central bank to financial loss.The key phrase here, of course, is “where its failure could bring down other -otherwise viable - institutions”. The central bank safety net is not there to protect individualinstitutions from failure. It is there to protect the stability of the financial system as a whole. Inthe absence of a serious systemic threat, the right course would normally be to allow theinstitution to fail. If any institution felt that it could rely on being bailed out if it ran into realdifficulty, that, too, would introduce “moral hazard”, encouraging excessive risk-taking andfinancial fragility in the system as a whole. There can be nothing automatic about “lender of lastresort” assistance - and, when it is provided, it should always be on the most onerous terms thatthe borrower can bear: it is not provided to protect the shareholders who should be looked tofirst. Nor is it there to protect the management. “Lender of last resort” assistance, even when it isextended by the central bank, involves the commitment of public money - ultimately taxpayers’money - and it needs to be justified in terms of the damage that would otherwise result to thefinancial system and to the wider economy. For this reason the MOU, to which I referred earlier,BIS Review   18/1998
- 8 -provides that the Bank should always seek the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s explicit priorapproval wherever circumstances allowed, or at least his tacit prior approval in emergencysituations and where the risks are manageable in relation to the size of our capital. Thesearrangements ensure that we have the capacity to act to limit systemic damage where thatbecomes necessary; but they rightly make such intervention subject to appropriate authorisationand accountability, by and to, both the Chancellor and Court.ConclusionMr Chairman, we have come a long way in the Bank, even since I first joined itsome 35 years ago. We tended at that time to explain our role as being the “Banker to theGovernment and Banker to the commercial and other central banks”. And the truth is that ourresponsibilities, and the extent of our authority, were never very clear.Today we remain a bank, as we always have been, at the heart of the financialsystem, as indeed we must in order to carry out our wider functions. But the Bill, taken togetherwith the MOU which I have described, sets out those wider functions much more clearly thanever before, defining our responsibilities, our powers to exercise those responsibilities, and ourlines of accountability to the Government, to Parliament and to the public at large. This is amuch more precise framework for the Bank’s operations, but one which I am convinced is moreappropriate to our modern times.I was delighted to learn last week that I am to be allowed to continue, for the nextfive years, to walk out with this attractive New Lady of Threadneedle Street, and I look forwardto the challenge of carrying through the very positive changes now being made to the role andstructure of the Bank.BIS Review   18/1998
Mr. Reddy reports on recent developments and concerns in the emergingmarket countries and the current scenario in the Indian economy   Key note address by theDeputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Dr. Y.V. Reddy, at the CII seminar onEmerging Concerns and State of Indian EconomyOn this occasion, I propose to address the limited issue of identifying theemerging concerns on the state of economies of emerging markets with particular reference torecent developments and place before you a factual account of the current scenario in the Indianeconomy.The Recent CrisisThe recent crisis has many unique features which are worth relating as a backdropto the current concerns.First, it was unexpected, by almost all concerned i.e., governments, multilateralinstitutions, rating agencies and market participants. Second, it is unusual since its origin is notof low economic growth or low savings or high government deficit or financial repression but ina way failure of the market mechanisms or private sector. Third, it is pervasive since it is a crisisof currencies, corporates stocks and banking. Fourth, it is the most contagious so far, with animpact, initially on neighbours, then other developing countries and soon the developed worldalso. Fifth, it is still, by and large inexplicable though the immediate cause appeared to besudden confidence erosion and global scale herding by market participants. Sixth, the responseof the official policy makers and the international financial community seems to have been oftendelayed and pretty much behind events - following or reacting to events rather than shapingthem. Seventh, it is not only pervasive and widespread but also deep - say the extent ofdepreciation of some currencies. Eighth, while there are some similarities between the directlyaffected countries, there are significant dissimilarities. Ninth, similarly while there are someinternal causes (i.e. domestic situation or excessive short-term borrowing and lending to nonproductive sectors) there are also some external causes (i.e., global factors such as developmentsin Japan and China, including in particular excessive lending from major financial centres).There are three important aspects of the crisis which we need to note.Firstly, it appears to be a case of unrealistically high expectations anddisappointment on the part of participants. Secondly, there is still some lack of consensus on theappropriate response, and also as to the role of relevant institutions. Thirdly, and mostimportantly, there is widespread agreement that the economies concerned will bounce back butthe issue is, how soon and at what cost, even if they are transitional. Also, the bounce back willnecessarily be different for differently affected countries.Areas of ConcernIt is not, therefore, surprising that there are new concerns expressed, or what maybe called emerging concerns. These relate not only to the state of the economy or policies ofeach of the emerging markets but also the broader role of government, aspects relating to marketfailures in both capital exporting and importing countries, sovereignisation of private debt,financial sector liberalisation especially regulation of banks, volatility of capital flows, the paceBIS Review  17/1998
- 2 -of capital account liberalisation, regulatory systems in major financial markets, exchange ratemanagement, international bankruptcy procedure, the role of multilateral agencies, and of courseinternational lender of last resort, etc.Emerging Concerns and the Indian EconomyBroadly speaking, there are five major areas of concern today, whenever oneanalyses an emerging economy. These relate to macro-economy, external sector management,regulation of the financial sector, the state of the corporate sector and the broader issue oftransparency in the system. More important, the specific aspects of concern in each are differentnow compared to say a year ago. Without entering into a debate on the appropriateness of suchconcerns or the differences about what should be a concern or what magnitude should engageattention, I will address clearly identifiable areas currently being looked at by marketparticipants and the present status of the Indian economy in respect of each of these.Macro-EconomyThe annual growth rate of Gross Domestic Product has been in the range of 7 to7.5 per cent during the last three years (i.e., fiscal years 1994-95 to 1996-97). For the currentyear, estimates range between 5.0 to 6.0 per cent. Investments as a percentage of GDP has alsobeen reasonably steady in the period at around 26 per cent on average.The current account deficit as a per cent of GDP has been consistently in therange of 1 to 1.8 per cent, and has averaged 1.3 per cent, and the current year’s position will notbe very different.The fiscal deficit of the Government of India as a percentage of GDP has comedown gradually from 6.1 per cent in 1994-95 to 5.5 per cent in 1995-96 and 5.0 per cent in1996-97. Though there are some fiscal strains, it is hoped that there will be no directionalchange.The annual rate of growth in broad money (M3) was 22.3 per cent in 1994-95, butdropped subsequently, pulling down the annual average growth rate between 1994-95 and 1996-97 to 17.3 per cent and in the current year it should be around 15.5 per cent. There is a similarpattern in regard to inflation, which averaged 7.4 per cent between 1994-95 and 1996-97 and thewholesale Price Index this year is estimated to be around 6 per cent, less than last year’s 6.9 percent.Finally, non-food credit growth has averaged 21 per cent per annum in the lastthree years and this year it is expected to be around 20 per cent including investments in PSUand corporate bonds, debentures and CP.As you may be aware, the latest CSO estimate places GDP growth of 1996-97 at7.5 per cent and net capital inflow from abroad for the last two years has been placed at 1.86 and1.15 per cent of GDP at market prices.External SectorOn the external front, in SDR terms, exports have grown at 13.6 per cent and 16.7per cent during 1994-95 and 1995-96 while imports have grown at 18.0 and 23.7 per cent. Lastyear, (1996-97) there has been a deceleration to 9.6 and 10.6 per cent, respectively. This year,BIS Review  17/1998
- 3 -during April-December, growth of exports was 9.1 per cent and that of imports 13.5 per cent,both in SDR terms.The Foreign Direct Investment flows continue to rise and are US$ 2.5 billionduring April-December 1997-98 as against $ 2.7 billion during the whole of 1996-97. Moreimportant, the policy framework and the procedures ensure that most of the value of FDI flowsto infrastructure and productive sectors.FII investments during the current year so far are less compared to $1.9 billion forthe entire 1996-97 period; but, it is expected that it would be at least $1 billion during this year.The flows on account of external aid last year, commercial borrowings and non-resident depositsare positive on a net basis, and broadly as per expectations at the beginning of the year.The invisibles have also been on track and as a result, the foreign currencyreserves as on February 6, 1998 are higher at $24.4 billion compared to $22.4 billion at thebeginning of the financial year.More important, some mention about external debt management and magnitudeswould be in order. The RBI controls by a process of approval of each case, the total short-termdebt, including trade-related credit beyond 180 days. Our short-term debt as a per cent of ourreserves is around 27 per cent, while as a per cent of total external debt, it is about seven percent. Each external commercial borrowing, including maturity, interest terms etc., has to beapproved by the Government/RBI. In fact, a micro level productive use of such external debt isensured during the approval process. In fact, our volume of external debt has been generally onthe decline and during 1993-97 total external debt was reduced by US$ 1 billion, while therewas accretion to reserves of the order of US$ 16.6 billion. Indeed, strict control over externaldebt is the cornerstone of our external sector liberalisation.Sometimes, the issue of forward liabilities of the central bank is raised. We havebeen very cautious by generally limiting such aggregate outstanding liabilities and rarely does itexceed 10 per cent of reserves. Of course, there is no rigid rule. We observe great prudence inthese matters while exercising flexibility. We publish all such operations from time to time.Finally, the exchange rate is flexible but volatility has been and is being checked by the ReserveBank of India.Financial SectorAs most of you may be aware, we have adopted international standards of capitaladequacy for banks, and their non-performing assets are closely monitored with a view tobringing them down. In particular, I would like to emphasise some major features.First, our banks’ total exposure to assets of Asian and East Asian countries wasless than US$ 500 million, and foreign liabilities are well below 10 per cent of total liabilities.Second, lending to property is frowned upon and is generally restricted to housing finance.Third, lending to stocks is also severely restricted and there is a ceiling of 5 per cent ofincremental deposits for this purpose. Actually, very little of this facility has been used. Fourth,by virtue of close monitoring and approvals required and in the absence of derivatives etc.,off-balance-sheet items of banks are minimal and closely monitored. Fifth, the banks arepermitted to borrow or invest abroad only up to 15 per cent of their net unimpaired capital. Theauthorised dealers (apart from a few money changers) on foreign exchange are almost alwaysbanks, whose exposures, open positions etc. are closely monitored. Sixth, the non-bankingBIS Review  17/1998
- 4 -financial companies have been brought under tight legislative, regulatory and prudentialframework recently.Corporate SectorThe debt of corporates as a percentage of equity, on the basis of annual surveysaudited by the RBI indicates that corporate debt of 1730 selected non-financial public limitedcompanies was 76.5 per cent of the extent of equity in 1993-94 and it has come down to 57.9 percent in 1995-96.Also, as a percentage of total debt, external debt was about 10 per cent in respectof large corporates and less than 2 per cent in respect of all corporates covered by the study inrespect of 756 selected companies.At the present juncture, therefore, the corporate sector of India as a whole is notoverexposed to external liabilities.TransparencyOn all areas of public interest involving RBI’s operations, press releases on adaily basis are common. The Reserve Bank releases a weekly statistical supplement which isvirtually a balance sheet of the RBI and captures monetary, fiscal and external sectordevelopments. In addition, the monthly bulletin of the RBI gives a wide array of information,including for instance forex operations of the Reserve Bank. One can note all the forextransactions of the RBI, including outstanding forward liabilities in the monthly bulletin. Theformal statements of the Governor, especially on monetary and credit policy developmentsclearly express a view of monetary and credit developments. The Annual Report in Trends inBanking contains a wealth of authentic information and the latest issue gives bank-wise ratiosrelating to performance. Parliamentary oversight and occasional recourse to judiciary by affectedparties ensure that an acceptable degree of transparency is maintained.ConclusionIn brief, we ensure sustainable current account deficit, restrict reliance onshort-term external debt; limit access to external debt and emphasise productive use of suchdebt. We encourage Foreign Direct Investment as the main source of non-debt creating capitalinflows. Also, the exchange rate is market-determined though the RBI closely monitors andoccasionally intervenes to avoid volatility and also ensure orderly conditions in forex markets.We undertook financial sector reforms, especially banking reform as a prelude to liberalisationof some capital account transactions in the external sector. We discourage banks’ investments inreal estate and stock markets. Non-banking financial companies are currently subject toregulation. Corporate exposure to debt, especially external debt, is within reasonable limits,though growing. There is transparency in operations of the Reserve Bank of India - whether it isforward market or whether it relates to performance of banks. In fact, the RBI takes initiatives inthe orderly development of the money market, government securities market and foreignexchange markets. We hold constant formal and informal consultations with market participantson these issues. To conclude, we believe that market participants should note these features ofthe current state of our economy in assessing our prospects - both short and medium-term.BIS Review  17/1998

- 2 -Accord, where necessary, in order to maintain its effectiveness. The same may be true for otherrisks. but let me first go into credit risk.Objectives5. Before going on our way, we should have a clear idea of what our destinationis. One of the objectives for this undertaking is, at least for supervisors, that the capital standardsshould preferably be resilient to changing needs over time. That is, ideally, they should requireless frequent interpretation and adjustments than is the case with the present rules. Equallydesirable is that capital standards should accurately reflect the (credit) risks they insure against,without incurring a regulatory burden that would ultimately be unproductive. Substantialdifferences between the risks underlying the regulatory capital requirements and the actual creditrisks would entail the wrong incentives. These would stimulate banks to take on riskier loanswithin a certain risk category in pursuit of a higher return on regulatory capital. In order toobtain a better insight into these issues, banks’ methods to determine and measure credit risk andtheir internal capital allocation techniques should be investigated. In doing so, however, weshould not lose sight of the functions of capital requirements [as discussed in the precedingsession].6. Capital requirements foster the safety and soundness of banks by limitingleverage and by providing a buffer against unexpected losses. Sufficient capital also decreasesthe likelihood of a bank becoming insolvent and limits - via loss absorption and greater publicconfidence - the adverse effects of bank failures. And by providing an incentive to exercisediscipline in risk-taking, capital can mitigate moral hazard and thus protect depositors anddeposit insurance. Admittedly, high capital adequacy ratios do not guarantee a bank’s soundness,particularly if the risks being taken are high or the bank is being mismanaged. Therefore,supervisors consider a bank’s capital adequacy in the context of a host of factors. But the bottomline is that capital is an important indicator of a bank’s condition, also for financial markets, andminimum capital requirements are one of the essential supervisory instruments.Guiding principles7. Therefore, it should be absolutely clear that, when it assesses the treatment ofcredit risk, the Basle Committee has no intention whatsoever of reducing overall capitaladequacy requirements, maybe even the contrary. Higher capital requirements could provenecessary, for example, for bank loans to higher-risk countries. In fact, this has been publiclyrecognized by bank representatives in view of the recent Asian crisis. More generally, we shouldbe aware of the potential instability that can result from increased competition among banks inthe United States and European countries in the longer run. And we should not be misled by thefavourable financial results that banks are presently showing, but keep in mind that bad bankingtimes can - and will - at some point return. In those circumstances, credit risk will turn out to beinflexible, difficult to manage and undoubtedly the primary source of banks’ losses. Absorptionof such losses will require the availability of capital. A reduction of capital standards woulddefinitely not be the right signal from supervisors to the industry, nor would it be expedient.8. Of course, I am aware of the effects of capital standards on the competitivenessof banks as compared to largely unregulated non-bank financial institutions, like the mutualfunds and finance companies in the United States. Admittedly, this is a difficult issue. On theone hand, too stringent capital requirements for banks would impair their ability to compete inspecific lending activities. On the other hand, capital standards should not per se be at the levelimplicitly allowed for by market forces. Competition by its very nature brings prices down, but,alas, not the risks. If competitive pressures were to erode the spread for specific instruments toBIS Review  17/1998
- 3 -the point where no creditor is being fully compensated for the risks involved, prudent banksshould consider whether they want to be involved in that particular business in the first place. Itis therefore up to supervisors to strike the optimal balance between the safety and soundness ofthe banking system and the need for a level playing field. In the longer run, efforts should bemade to harmonize capital requirements among different institutions conducting the sameactivities, or at least to bring them into closer alignment.9. Another principle that the Basle Committee wants to uphold is that the basicframework of the Capital Accord, i.e. minimum capital requirements based on risk-weightedexposures, has not outlived its usefulness. Put differently, it should be maintained as much aspossible. The main reason is that this system of capital requirements applies - and will continueto apply - to the large majority of G-10 banks and a fortiori to banks elsewhere. Preciselybecause the Capital Accord is relatively simple, the framework is useful for banks and theirsupervisors in emerging market countries, and contributes to market transparency.10. At the same time, it should be acknowledged that the current standards are notbased on precise measures for credit risk, but on proxies for it in the form of broad categories ofbanking assets. Indeed, banks regularly call for other risk weightings of specific instruments. Inorder to obtain more precise weightings, the Basle Committee is willing to consider lessarbitrary ways to determine credit risks. But it is unrealistic to expect that internationallyapplicable risk weightings can be established, that accurately reflect banks’ risks at all times andunder all conditions. Compromises in this respect are inevitable.Credit risk models11. In the longer run, a way out may be to refer to banks’ own methods andmodels to measure credit risk, under strict conditions analogous to the treatment of market risks.At present, I would describe credit risk models as still being in a development stage, althoughthe advances that some banks have made in this area are potentially significant. Ideally, as soundcredit risk models bring forward more precise estimates of credit risk, these models will bebeneficial for banks. Models can be used in their commercial operations, e.g. in pricing, inportfolio management or performance measurement, and naturally in risk management. Thequantification that a model entails implies a greater awareness and transparency of risks within abank. More precise and concise risk information will enhance internal communication,decision-making and subsequent control of credit risk. Also, models enable banks to allow forthe effects of portfolio diversification and of trading of credit risks or hedging by means ofcredit derivatives. So, it can be assumed that a greater number of banks will introduce credit riskmodels and start to implement them in their day-to-day credit operations, once the technicalchallenges involved in modelling have been solved.12. The more difficult question is whether credit risk models could be used forregulatory capital purposes, similar to the way that banks’ internal models for market risk arealready being recognized. As should be clear from what I have just said, credit risk models canhave advantages from a prudential point of view. For this reason, the Committee is conscious ofthe need not to impede their development and introduction in the banking industry. However,there are still serious obstacles on this road. Firstly, credit risk models come with substantialstatistical and conceptual difficulties. To mention just a few: credit data are sparse, correlationscannot be easily observed, credit returns are skewed and, due to the statistical problems, backtesting in order to assess a model’s output may not be feasible. Clearly, there are model riskshere. Secondly, if models were to be used for regulatory capital purposes, competitive equalitywithin the banking industry could be compromised. Because the statistical assumptions andBIS Review  17/1998
- 4 -techniques used differ, it is very likely that credit risk models’ results are not comparable acrossbanks. The issue of competitive equality would be complicated even further by the potentialdifferences in terms of required capital between banks using models and banks using the currentapproach. Thirdly and most importantly, a credit risk model cannot replace a banker’s judgment.Models don’t manage. A model can only contribute to sound risk management and should beembedded in it. This brings me to conclude that if credit risk models were to be used forregulatory capital purposes, it is highly unlikely that they will be judged in isolation. Supervisorswill almost certainly also wish to carefully examine the qualitative factors in a bank’s riskmanagement.Market risk - pre-commitment approach13. Let me now make a short detour and discuss the supervisory treatment of risksother than credit risk. First market risk. Although the internal models approach was introducedonly recently, research work is going on and possible alternatives to this approach are beingdeveloped. The Federal Reserve, for instance, proposed the pre-commitment approach[discussed yesterday]. Its attractive features are that it incorporates a judgement on theeffectiveness of a bank’s risk management, puts greater emphasis on the incentives for a bank toavoid losses exceeding the limit it has pre-determined and reduces the regulatory burden. In myopinion, however, under this approach, too, a bank’s choice of a capital commitment and thequality of its risk management system still need to be subject to supervisory review. And thereare a number of other issues that are as yet unsolved, e.g. the comparability across firms as thechoice of the pre-commitment is subjective, the role of public disclosure and the supervisorypenalties, which are critical to the viability of the approach. For these reasons, internationalsupervisors await with interest the results of the New York Clearing House pilot study.Other risks14. Now, let me turn to the other risks. If one leaves aside the recent Amendmentwith respect to market risks, it is true to say that the Capital Accord only deals explicitly withcredit risk. Yet, the Accord provides for a capital cushion for banks, which is meant to absorbmore losses than just those due to credit risks. Therefore, if the capital standards for credit riskwere to be redefined, an issue that cannot be avoided is how to go about the other risks.Interestingly, awareness of, for instance, operational, legal and reputational risks among banksseems to be increasing. Some banks are already putting substantial efforts into data collectionand quantification of these risks. Not surprisingly then that the Basle Committee will also beconsidering the treatment of the risks that are at present implicitly covered by the Accord, suchas those just mentioned and possibly including interest rate risk. In this process, it will beimportant to distinguish between quantifiable and non-quantifiable risks and their respectivesupervisory treatment. More specifically, the Committee will have to consider whether it shouldstick to a single all-encompassing capital standard embracing all risks, including market risks, orto a system of capital standards for particular risks, i.e. the quantifiable ones, in combinationwith a supervisory review of the remaining risk categories. From a theoretical point of view, onecapital standard might be preferable, since risks are not additive. Given the present state ofknowledge, however, one all-encompassing standard for banking risks that takes account theirinterdependencies, still seems far away. As the trend thus far has been towards the developmentof separate models for the major quantifiable risks, a system of capital standards together with asupervisory review of other, non-quantifiable risks, seems more likely.BIS Review  17/1998
- 5 -Conclusion15. Let me conclude. The overall issue of this conference, particularly of thissession, is where capital regulation is heading. In my address, I have argued that, as supervisoryobjectives are unchanged, a reduction in banks’ capital adequacy would not be desirable. Neitheris there a cause for fundamental alterations in the basic framework of the Capital Accord. At thesame time, the Basle Committee is committed to maintaining the effectiveness of capitalregulation and willing to consider improvements, where possible. In this regard, the advancesmade by market participants in measuring and modelling of credit and other risks are potentiallysignificant and might at some point be incorporated into capital regulation. But before we reachthat stage, there are still formidable obstacles to be overcome.BIS Review  17/1998
Mr. O’Connell reports on the Irish economy and different aspects of the CentralBank of Ireland’s activities  Statement by the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Mr. MauriceO’Connell, to the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas (Parliament) on Finance and the Public Servicein Dublin on 18/2/97.I thank you for your invitation and I welcome the opportunity to appear before thisCommittee.Internationally, the economic outlook remains generally good. While the crisis in Asiahas reduced forecasts, there is still optimism that reasonable growth with low inflation will continue.Worldwide, there is a strong consensus on the merits of price stability and reduced budget deficits asthe best platform for growth and employment.In Europe, the picture is mixed. In general, there has been some improvement in thepast half year and a growth rate not far off 3 per cent on average is predicted for 1998. The prospectsfor substantial reductions in unemployment in the short term remain disappointing. Unemployment inEurope is seen largely as a structural problem that can only be resolved over an extended period. Onthe positive side inflation has been subdued and interest rates are relatively low. As we move towardsthe deadline for decision on membership of EMU, there is a great awareness everywhere, in shapingpolicy, of the requirements to satisfy the entry conditions.The Irish economyIreland’s position is unique at the moment by European standards. Economic growthhas continued to exceed expectations. The Central Bank expects that growth this year will be of theorder of 7 to 8 per cent. Others might put the figure higher. While growth will probably slow down inthe years ahead, it should remain well above the European average. The Central Bank estimates that along-term growth pattern of the order of 4-5 per cent is within our capability, if the internationalenvironment remains benign. This will depend on a number of factors, not least continuing lowinflation. The current national wage arrangements provide a solid basis for cost competitiveness andit is most important that these terms are not diluted. Unemployment is below the European average.The progress on job creation in recent years is impressive and the outlook is good.In its quarterly report published in December the Central Bank forecasted an averageinflation rate for this year of 2½ per cent, which is relatively low in absolute terms and is within thethreshold for qualification for EMU. The subsequent decline in the Irish pound has increased theprospect of a somewhat higher figure. There are other factors such as asset price increases andtightening conditions in the labour market, which also carry the potential for overheating of theeconomy and higher inflation. These are a source of concern because they could ultimately damagethe economy.One feature of the strong performance of the economy is the growth in private sectorcredit. The cumulative growth in the past three years was over 50 per cent and it is now increasing atan annual rate above 20 per cent. As we started from a level of indebtedness relatively low byinternational standards, growth on this scale may not be a cause of immediate alarm. On all previousexperience, however, it would be unsustainable in the longer term without inflationary consequences.The ready availability of credit at relatively low interest rate levels has been a contributory factor tothe excessive rises last year in house prices which are now at historically high levels in real terms andby reference to average earnings. House prices have risen by 40-50 per cent since 1994. There areBIS Review   16/1998
- 2 -predictions that a further substantial rise in prices this year is likely. We may not be far from asituation where home ownership will be beyond the reach of persons on average incomes.There seems to be a perception that the Central Bank can exercise some legalauthority in restricting credit. It has no such authority. Any restriction would be inconsistent withEuropean Union practice. Besides, it would be unworkable as demand would probably be met byoverseas lenders. The introduction of the single currency will facilitate access by overseas lenders.The Bank continues to monitor the conditions applied by the credit institutions in lending for housepurchase. It has warned these institutions repeatedly of the dangers inherent in high rates of creditgrowth and any relaxation of lending standards. Insofar as the Bank can establish, 100 per centmortgages have been issued only in exceptional cases where properties were being purchased forinvestment. The Bank would not encourage this practice and the credit institutions have been soadvised.Economic and monetary unionPreparation for EMU is a dominant feature of the work of the Central Bank at themoment. Our duty is to ensure, as best we can, that Ireland continues to fulfil the entry requirements,in particular the requirement on inflation, and that the banking and financial system in general is wellprepared for the single currency.It now seems virtually assured that EMU will start on schedule on 1st January 1999and that a substantial majority of European Union countries will participate from the outset. Controlof monetary policy will pass immediately to the Governing Council of the European Central Bankand decisions will be made on the basis of European requirements. We will no longer be able toadjust the exchange rate or interest rates to correct domestic problems. The priority of the EuropeanCentral Bank will be price stability. Besides, the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pacteffectively require that member countries run a balanced budget over a complete economic cycle.The preparations for monetary union at operational level are well advanced, under theaegis of the European Monetary Institute. Much of this work is of a detailed technical nature relatingto business between the individual central banks. The EMI has recommended two possible monetarypolicy strategies for the European Central Bank - monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting.Among the other important strategic issues are the extent of decentralisation, management ofreserves, pooling of reserves and monetary income and linking of payment systems. There are someawkward issues yet to be resolved. The definition of monetary income for instance is a problem.In the single currency regime there will be a deliberate policy of decentralisation andthe day-to-day activities of the Central Bank will be conducted within this framework. We willcontinue to manage reserves and to provide liquidity to the banks. We will, however, work toguidelines or benchmarks determined by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. Incertain areas of the Bank the working day will be extended. Our preliminary arrangements forproduction and stockpiling of euro banknotes and coin are well under way. While the deadline of 1stJanuary 2002 may seem distant, we must begin production far in advance.There have been reports to the effect that the Central Bank will have a large surplus ofreserves when we join EMU. This is misleading. At the end of 1997 the Bank had total assets of £6½billion.  These assets were matched by corresponding liabilities of £5 billion, leaving net assets, orinternal reserves, of nearly £1½ billion. The Bank will continue to need internal reserves. I would notspeculate on an appropriate level. We may not need the present level of reserves in due course but itBIS Review   16/1998
- 3 -is too early to make a judgement on this until we have experience of the new system. All of the othernational central banks participating in EMU will be in a similar position. Our internal reserves as aproportion of total assets are about average by European Union standards. I might add that anytransfer of internal reserves would reduce future earnings and profit transfers to the Exchequer.From 1st January next onwards, all Central Bank business will be conducted in thenew currency, the euro. All accounts with the Bank, whether held by credit institutions, theGovernment or international institutions, will be in euro. Existing notes and coin will becomeconstituent parts of the euro. The banks generally must be ready to make any banking servicerequired in Ireland available in euro. From January next, they will process lodgements and paymentsin Irish pounds or euro, as required. It would be reasonable to anticipate that Irish business in generalwill move to the euro faster than the official timetable requires.The National Changeover Plan, published some weeks ago, draws attention toarrangements for the period of transition pending the introduction of euro banknotes and coin. Duringthis period banknotes of the member States participating in EMU must be exchanged at par value.From January the Central Bank will provide an inward exchange service free of charge.Exchange rate/interest rateI am under the usual constraints in regard to comment on current exchange rates andinterest rates for the Irish pound. These issues are highly sensitive. Determination of exchange ratepolicy is the prerogative of the Minister for Finance. It has been decided that the method for arrivingat the conversion rates for the different currencies, including the Irish pound, will be settled andannounced at the time of decision on EMU membership. This decision, it now appears, will be takenon 3rd May. Nothing further has been decided at this stage in relation to fixing of exchange rates.The intention to pre-announce bilateral rates in May is driven by the general concernthroughout Europe to avoid market speculation as we move closer to the January 1999 deadline.While national authorities will continue to be responsible for the exchange rate of their respectivecurrencies up to this deadline, the May agreement should have a decisive influence and shoulddiminish the possibility of considerable fluctuations.There has been substantial convergence of interest rates in Europe in recent months.Irish interest rates, at the short end of the scale, though low by historic standards, remain substantiallyabove levels across much of Europe. There has been a good reason for this. It reflects domesticconditions here as the economy has continued to be exceptionally buoyant and the threat ofoverheating remains. If we were not on the doorstep of EMU, our interest rates would now be higher.Wholesale interest rates must converge, among the countries participating in EMU, by January 1999.This points to the expectation of reductions in Irish rates, even if European rates were to moveupwards further in the meantime. I cannot quantify reductions precisely nor can I outline a timepath.It is evident, however, that some reductions of significance are likely. In the meantime, Irish interestrate policy will be influenced by the requirements of the domestic economy. The Central Bank willretain the discretion to adjust rates for as long as possible.I might also draw the attention of members to the impact on savings. In a lowerinterest rate regime some deposit rates must inevitably come down. The returns on call deposits inparticular are already at very low levels. It would be unwise to assume that interest rates will remainpermanently low once the euro area is established. As with the US dollar, successful management ofthe euro will require periodic interest rate adjustments to secure the objective of price stability.BIS Review   16/1998
- 4 -In the context of EMU, the relationship with sterling is of obvious concern to us. Wenow know that the UK will not join EMU for some time ahead. It would be better for us, if it joinedat the outset. I cannot predict future movements of sterling relative to the euro. I would, however,point to the Treaty requirements that all member States should treat exchange rate policy as a matterof common interest. This applies as much to the UK as to anybody else. The Bank of England willparticipate in the General Council of the European System of Central Banks and will be subject to theobligations that this imposes. I would further suggest that the decision last year to give operationalindependence to the Bank of England is significant in this context. It is working to an inflation targetand this arrangement should reduce the likelihood of large-scale fluctuations of sterling vis-à-vis theeuro.It is vitally important that the credibility of the euro is established immediately. Toachieve this the new currency must be supported by a solid economic background and politicalconsensus. There is considerable speculation about the merits of a hard or a soft currency. The criticalfactor is that the currency be stable in terms of European prices so that its international role will besecure and that, in time, it will challenge the dominance of the US dollar. The external value of theeuro will be largely determined by the monetary policy implemented by the European Central Bankand by developments in the foreign exchange markets for the major industrial currencies.SupervisionMay I now turn to a different aspect of our activities.The Central Bank’s approach to supervision reflects European legal requirements andis in line with best international practice. The basic objectives of supervision of banks and buildingsocieties are to protect depositors and investors and to ensure as far as possible that risks to thefinancial system as a whole are minimised. Insofar as the Bank examines individual customeraccounts, its focus is always on the solvency of the institution. Our main attention is focused on thequality of loans and other assets and good management. We frequently come across breaches of therules. Many of these would be of a minor nature. Most are dealt with by administrative action. Wediscourage applications for banking licences unless we are fully satisfied as to the status of theapplicant.No system of supervision, however comprehensive, can give a one hundred per centguarantee against abuse. Effective supervision requires the co-operation of the entity that is beingsupervised. Despite the improvements in controls, and international co-operation, bank failurescontinue. The ultimate objective worldwide is to avoid systemic problems.Arising from the Tribunals of Inquiry and other recent developments, there has beensome confusion about the confidentiality exercised by the Central Bank in relation to its functions.May I say at the outset that we are co-operating to the fullest extent possible with Tribunalinvestigations.Members are aware that the Central Bank is conducting an investigation followingrecent allegations against National Irish Bank. I am precluded from discussing individual cases.The Bank is bound under law, to observe strict rules of confidentiality. It may notdisclose information about individual entities or persons to any third parties, other than in exceptionalcircumstances. These include criminal proceedings in court, providing information to the Gardai onmoney laundering and other criminal activity, including tax evasion, and transfer of information toBIS Review   16/1998
- 5 -other regulatory authorities. The Bank is prohibited from communicating information to the RevenueCommissioners. We are not tax investigators. It is the duty of individual financial institutions toreport to the Gardai suspicions of criminal activity (including tax evasion) by their customers. Iunderstand that such reports to the Gardai are not infrequent. If we become aware of tax abuse, by aninstitution that we supervise, it is our duty to notify the Gardai.These requirements derive from and are consistent with European Union laws. Otherbanking supervisors in the European Union are subject to similar confidentiality requirements. Oursituation is in no sense unique. If the Irish authorities attempted to abandon these requirements, notonly would we be in breach of EU law but we would forfeit the co-operation of other supervisors inexchanging information. This exchange of information is vital. Without it, we simply could notoperate as a competent supervisory authority and operations by Irish banks abroad would be calledinto question.The supervisory duties of the Central Bank have been extended considerably in recentyears. The International Financial Services Centre continues to expand. Last year responsibility forall investment intermediaries was assigned to the Bank. In response, we have contacted more thanone thousand intermediaries in order to compile a register and to develop a code of conduct. Thesupervision of small retail operations is a new departure for the Bank and it may take some time yetto settle on a definite pattern of operation. A further complication is that a majority of intermediariesare also engaged in insurance and other activities which are not the responsibility of the CentralBank. It makes little sense to examine investment operations without taking some overview of thetotal business of an intermediary.Exchange controls have also been in the news. In operating these controls up to theirabolition in 1992, the Central Bank acted as agent for the Minister for Finance. The Bank may giveinformation on these matters to the Minister only.Irish financial institutionsIrish banks and financial institutions generally have been returning consistently strongprofits. This is unsurprising in view of the favourable conditions for lending and minimising baddebts. At the same time, operating margins have been reducing significantly in the face of sharpercompetition. All indications suggest that competition will intensify further in the years ahead. Therewill be expensive technological developments and competition from outside will be facilitated by thesingle currency in EMU. It would be reasonable to predict that there may be significantrationalisation within our financial system in the period ahead. It would be disappointing if thisresulted in a situation where the great proportion of Irish banking was controlled from outside. Ishould also mention the impressive overseas expansion by a number of Irish financial institutions inrecent years.We live in a world of large-scale movement of funds across borders and Ireland is noexception. Given the open nature of the Irish economy, it is no surprise that cross-border holdings offunds in our case are relatively high.The total volume of deposits, excluding interbank deposits, with banks and buildingsocieties in Ireland is estimated to be in the region of £60 billion. Roughly one third of these depositsare held by non-resident companies and individuals. This proportion is quite high by internationalstandards. On the other hand deposits held abroad by Irish residents - again excluding interbankfigures - are in the region of £11 billion. This figure is high by international comparison. The figureBIS Review   16/1998
- 6 -has quadrupled in the past ten years, reflecting the growth in Irish trade, the removal of exchangecontrols in the context of the single European market and the development of the InternationalFinancial Services Centre.This covers only the deposit side of the picture. Borrowing by Irish residents fromoverseas banks has also grown rapidly in the past decade. It is now estimated to be of a similar orderof magnitude to overseas deposits. Access to credit abroad at competitive interest rates, growth in themultinational sector and the IFSC have contributed to this development.This is by no means a comprehensive picture. It does not incorporate cross-borderflows in securities and other investments such as equities, for which we do not have specificinformation. The Central Bank is aware throughout every day of the broad quantities of funds movingin and out of Irish pounds across the foreign exchange market. It does not have knowledge of themovement of funds on behalf of individual bank customers.ConclusionsBefore I conclude, may I refer again briefly to monetary policy. In the implementationof monetary policy the first objective of the Central Bank at all times is price stability. This will alsobe the first objective of the European Central Bank and this is made abundantly clear in theMaastricht Treaty. Price stability is the best foundation for a growing economy and for continuingimprovements in employment. This has been demonstrated consistently, not just in the Irish situationbut worldwide.BIS Review   16/1998
Mr. Stals discusses the independence of the central bank and monetary policy inSouth Africa   Address by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Mr. C. Stals, at the 21stAnnual Investment Conference of Société Générale Frankel Pollak (Pty) Ltd. in Johannesburg, on24/2/98.1. IntroductionThe debate on the independence of central banks is, fortunately for both governors ofcentral banks and Ministers of Finance, gradually losing its momentum. The discussions were oftenmisguided and created the misleading impression that central bankers had a desire to be completelyisolated from their political masters, and that monetary policy objectives could and should be pursuedin complete isolation from fiscal and other macroeconomic policies.This is, of course, not realistic. Monetary policy is but part of the overallmacroeconomic strategy pursued by governments. Monetary policy must, after all, support the overallmacroeconomic goals of governments, and must be applied in a consistent framework of overallmacroeconomic strategy. The independence of the central bank therefore applies not to the setting ofthe final destination, but to the choice of the route it prefers to take to reach that predetermineddestination.In the context of the South African macroeconomic policy framework, Governmenthas decided, by means of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, that the task of the SouthAfrican Reserve Bank shall be to protect the value of the currency. Without giving an explicitdefinition of what “protection of the currency” precisely means, it is clearly the intention that theReserve Bank shall pursue a policy that will keep inflation under control.The pursuance of this objective, however, often requires unpopular measures thatpoliticians may find difficult to force on their voters, particularly in times of pending elections. Forthis reason, and to ensure consistent and persistent implementation of the required financialdisciplines, central banks are given independent discretionary powers on the operational proceduresthey regard as necessary to discharge of their responsibilities. The South African Governmenttherefore wisely wrote into the Constitution that the South African Reserve Bank will be allowed topursue the objective of financial stability independently and without fear of interference by pressuregroups, be they from government or the private sector. In the final instance, success will be measuredAfter the turmoil in the South African financial markets in 1996, the South AfricanReserve Bank had no alternative last year but to follow a restrictive monetary policy, intended torestore overall financial stability and confidence. The Bank was often criticised for not resisting themarket pressures for higher interest rates, and for not providing more liquidity by using its unlimitedpowers to create more money. Private business people, many home-owners and heavily indebtedindividuals, economists with vested interests in speculative financial operations, labour unions andsome politicians, criticised the Bank for its stance, and blamed monetary policy for all the ills of theeconomy.Seasoned central bankers, however, know that the opposition to unpopular monetarypolicy measures gets more intense in situations when constraints are needed most, and when thecatalyst of painful monetary adjustment is indeed producing the desired results. In this game, there isno gain without pain. Wise governments know that this is the time for them to stand aloof ofindependent and often stubborn central bankers. South Africans can be grateful for the country’spolitical leadership last year when the Reserve Bank was allowed to pursue unpopular policies in anBIS Review   15/1998
- 2 -unfriendly environment. The beneficial effects of the policies are now being reflected in recentencouraging developments in a number of the more important financial aggregates.2. 1997: Year of financial consolidationAt the beginning of 1997, the Reserve Bank predicted that the year ahead would beone of consolidation. Time was needed to recover from the shocks of 1996 when foreign capitalinflows suddenly subsided and left the overall balance of payments with a R5 billion deficit. In theprocess, the country’s official foreign reserves declined to the extremely low level of less than R14billion (in September 1996), and the average effective exchange rate of the rand depreciated by 23.2per cent from February to October 1996.Monetary policy, which was tightened considerably during the course of 1996, had toremain restrictive throughout the major part of 1997. The Reserve Bank’s lending rate to bankinginstitutions, which was raised to 17 per cent in November 1996, was retained at this level until late inOctober 1997. Those market interest rates, such as the prime overdraft and mortgage lending rates ofbanking institutions that are closely linked to the Bank rate, therefore also remained relatively high.The high level of interest rates reflected a continuing high demand for credit, againstthe background of a further marginal decline in overall domestic saving. Total bank credit extendedto the public and private sectors together increased by 16 per cent over the year. There was, however,some slowdown in the rate of increase in bank credit extension to the private sector from 17 per centin 1996 to 14 per cent in 1997. This figure, however, still includes credit extended to local authorities.A refined version of the definition of bank credit extension to the private sector, excluding localauthorities, indicates a growth of only 12.4 per cent over the twelve months up to December 1997.Be that as it may, the Reserve Bank remains concerned about the high level of bankcredit extension in South Africa over the past three years. Bank credit extension is the main source ofmoney creation, and the increase of 17 per cent in the M3 money supply last year raised the level ofthe total money supply to gross domestic product to 60.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1997,compared to 56 per cent a year earlier. With a low income velocity of circulation at this stage, there isalways the danger that idle money can easily be activated in spending on real goods and services.It is accepted, however, that a number of structural changes affected the developmentsin the major financial aggregates over the past few years which require discreet interpretation of themeaning of the observed changes. The almost explosive increases in the volume of transactions in thefinancial markets, for example, may have contributed significant amounts to both bank creditextension and the money supply. Total turnover in the secondary bond market increased by 41 percent in 1997 to an aggregate amount of R4,269 billion. The number of shares traded on theJohannesburg Stock Exchange almost doubled from 1996 to 1997, whereas the total value oftransactions increased by 77 per cent to R207 billion. Less spectacular, but also significant, increaseswere registered in the markets for derivatives and for foreign exchange. Financial market operatorsobviously needed more cash (money) against the inflated turnovers.However, no central banker should ever become complacent about excessiveincreases in bank credit extension and in the money supply. Even if such increases do not have anyvisible or proximate effect on real spending or inflation, the excessive amount of money, once it hasbeen created, can easily be redirected, at some inopportune future time, into spending on goods andservices. What is of even more importance, is that excessive growth in the banking sector, relative toreal economic growth, can lead to a systematic decay in the health and soundness of the financialBIS Review   15/1998
- 3 -system. Ample evidence of the dangers of persistent excessive expansion in the financial aggregatescan be found in the recent frustrating experiences of many countries in South-East Asia.It is, however, true that the excessive increases in bank credit extension and in themoney supply last year, did not prevent the restrictive monetary policy pursued from supportingmeaningful restoration of overall financial stability. Firstly, equilibrium was restored in realeconomic activity because of a significant slowdown in the rate of growth in gross domesticexpenditure. After increases of about 6 per cent in 1994 and 1995, total demand increased by 2½ percent in 1996 and 1½ per cent in 1997.Secondly, with growth in total domestic demand more or less in line with but modestincreases in total production, the current account of the balance of payments returned to a moresustainable deficit during the last six months of 1996 and the first nine months of 1997. Preliminaryindications are that the deficit widened again in the fourth quarter of 1997, although the deficit for theyear as a whole remained well below the R10 billion level.A third very encouraging development last year was the return of foreign investorconfidence and a substantial increase in the net inflow of capital from the rest of the world. Afterslumping from R19.2 billion in 1995 to only R3.9 billion in 1996, the total net inflow of capitalthrough the balance of payments recovered again to R20.2 billion in 1997. The net inflow oflong-term capital indeed amounted to about R30 billion, which was partly neutralised by a netoutflow of R10 billion in short-term funds.The surplus on the overall balance of payments enabled the country to increase its netgold and other foreign reserves by R11½ billion from the end of December 1996 to the end ofDecember 1997. The total gross foreign reserves held by the Reserve Bank and the rest of thebanking sector amounted to R36.6 billion at the end of 1997, the equivalent of about 10 weeks’imports of goods and services.3. Results of macroeconomic financial consolidationTwo important beneficial macroeconomic results flowed from the frustratingconsolidation process of last year. Firstly, because of the improvement in the overall balance ofpayments situation, the exchange rate of the rand became much more stable. As a matter of fact, wereit not for the substantial net purchases of foreign exchange by the Reserve Bank, the rand could haveappreciated quite strongly last year. The average weighted value of the rand against a basket of thecurrencies of South Africa’s major trading partners declined by 0.3 per cent from 31 December 1996to 31 December 1997. The average level of the effective exchange rate of the rand throughout theyear 1997, compared with the average level in 1996, showed a depreciation more or less equal to theinflation differential between South Africa and its major trading partners. The more stable exchangerate also reduced the demand for forward cover in respect of outstanding foreign exchangecommitments of South African residents. The net oversold forward book of the Reserve Bank, aboutwhich there is much misunderstanding in financial markets, declined from US $22 billion at the endof 1996 to less than $15 billion at this stage.The second gratifying development was that South Africa succeeded in 1997 to arrestthe inflationary pressures created by the 1996 depreciation of the rand. The rate of increase inconsumer prices, measured over a twelve months’ period, accelerated from 5.5 per cent in April 1996to 9.9 per cent in April 1997. During the rest of last year, however, the rate of increase in consumerprices gradually drifted down to 6.1 per cent in December 1997. On a seasonally adjusted annualisedbasis, the rate of inflation declined to 4.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1997.BIS Review   15/1998
- 4 -Against the background of the relatively successful financial consolidation process of1997 and the progress made during the course of the year towards reaching overall financial stability,it is understandable why the turmoil in the international currency markets after the East Asian crisisonly had a limited effect on the South African situation. It hit the South African markets just at a timewhen the country had more or less completed painful adjustments to restore equilibrium after its owncrisis of 1996. Apart from the downward adjustment of prices in the equity market, the contagion onSouth Africa from the currency problems in East Asia appeared to have been limited.4. Prospects for 1998At the beginning of 1998, South Africa therefore finds itself in a much morecomfortable situation than a year ago, at least as far as the overall financial situation is concerned.The improved conditions were already recognised by a gradual easing of monetary policy in recentmonths. Bank rate was reduced from 17 to 16 per cent on 20 October 1997, and the money marketshortage allowed to decline from R11.1 billion at the end of November 1997 to R7.6 billion at theend of January 1998 (and R7.2 billion last Friday).The more flexible interest rates in the money and capital markets drifted downwards.The monthly average yield on long-term government bonds declined from 14.5 per cent in November1997 to 13.6 per cent in January 1998, and to 13.3 per cent at the end of last week. The rate onbankers’ acceptances with a maturity of three months gradually drifted lower from 15.0 per cent atthe end of November 1997 to 14.45 per cent at the end of January 1998, and 14.05 per cent at thisstage.There is a general expectation in the markets that the level of interest rates in SouthAfrica will decline further during the course of 1998. This expectation can be justified in terms ofrecent developments in most of the underlying domestic financial conditions, except that the ReserveBank must remain on its guard for any further acceleration in the growth rates of total bank creditextension and the money supply. Prudence requires lower rates of growth in these aggregates in1998. The continuing East Asian crisis, which placed many of the emerging market economies underpressure, also calls for caution. It should be pointed out that, even at the current high levels, realinterest rates in South Africa fall more or less in the middle of comparable rates in the economies ofthe thirty or so countries that have become known as the emerging economies of the world.The prospects for inflation in 1998 are also very encouraging. With production priceinflation at 4.0 per cent and consumer price inflation at 6.1 per cent in December 1998, and both stillon a downward trend, South Africa finds itself now more in line with inflation in the rest of theworld. In the longer term, as the South African financial markets get more integrated into the worldfinancial markets, the level of inflation in this country will be determined more by internationalinflation levels, and not so much by domestic policies. In a fully liberalised economy, the initialimpact of excess nominal demand or other inflationary pressures will fall on the balance of payments,and not in the first instance on domestic prices.The current more stable overall financial situation in the country provides a goodopportunity for the introduction of further structural adjustments aimed at improving the efficiency ofthe South African financial markets. Next month, the Reserve Bank will introduce two important newinitiatives in this regard:Firstly, on 9 March 1998, the South African Multiple Option Settlement System(SAMOS) will be activated to pave the way for the introduction later this year of an on-line real-timeBIS Review   15/1998
- 5 -inter-bank settlement system. This will reduce risk exposures in respect of open inter-bank positionsand lead to a more efficient financial system in general.Secondly, also on 9 March 1998, the Reserve Bank will change its present operationalprocedures of supplying accommodation to banking institutions through overnight loans at thediscount window. A new system for repurchase transactions (Repo’s) between the Reserve Bank andbanking institutions will be introduced, and the banks will tender on a daily basis for an amount ofcentral bank liquidity that will be determined by the Reserve Bank. The new system will bring moreflexibility into money market interest rates and will place South Africa on a basis of centralbank/private bank relationships that is being followed by many other countries in the world.The Department of Finance will also switch to a new system for the primary issuesand secondary dealings in government bonds as from 1 April 1998. Eleven banks have already beenappointed by the Department of Finance as authorised Securities Dealers for this purpose.With the continuing further removal of the remaining exchange controls, the SouthAfrican financial markets will provide some exciting new challenges over the rest of this year. Wehope that foreign investors, so well represented at this Conference today, will continue to participatein these challenges.The better overall financial environment provides a more supportive background forimproved real economic conditions. Monetary policy should never be used to stimulate total nominaldemand artificially when the stimulation will only be reflected in higher inflation. Monetary policyshould also not unduly restrict aggregate nominal demand once the objective of stable overallfinancial conditions has been accomplished. The present financial situation in South Africa must beseen as conducive for an improvement in real economic activity over the next year. If last year was ayear of consolidation, 1998 can easily turn out to be the year of recovery.BIS Review   15/1998
Mr. Grenville discusses exchange rates and crises against the background ofthe financial turmoil in Asia*   Talk by Mr. Stephen Grenville, a Deputy Governor of theReserve Bank of Australia, to the Third Biennial Pacific Rim Allied Economic OrganizationsConference in Bangkok on 16/1/98.Economists have an unenviable reputation for being practitioners of the “dismalscience”, but this is undeserved.  The economist’s characteristic response to a crisis is a positiveone:  they identify a central crucial factor, and generally this is something that can be put right.Economists rarely throw up their hands and say that it is all too difficult.  This capacity toproduce simple answers which purport to avoid further problems is, in one sense, admirable.But it carries with it the danger that complex causality will be mis-diagnosed.  It opens thepossibility, too, that pet panaceas, rules of thumb, and glib nostrums - often driven more bydoctrine than by careful analysis - will influence the response.The 1994/95 Mexican crisis, which provides a foretaste of the current problems inAsia, provides a classic example of this.  After the crisis (which involved an almost 50 per centfall in the exchange rate), one might have gained the impression from contemporary analysisthat, if only Mexico had published accurate figures of its foreign exchange reserves in a timelyIn the case of Thailand, there was a view - particularly in the early days of theepisode - that if only Thailand had floated its exchange rate sooner, everything would have beenall right.  According to this view, there were a couple of relatively simple policy mistakes (fastgrowth and a fixed exchange rate) and, when these were remedied, everything would quicklyreturn to normal.  What I will be arguing here is that the problems are much more complex andmulti-faceted than this.  To be sure, there have been very large falls in the exchange rate in anumber of Asian countries, and this has been an important part of the story.  But when we lookback on the early analysis, which identified the basic problem as an exchange rate over-valuationof 10-15 per cent which could be corrected by floating the exchange rate, events since thenshould have demonstrated the inadequacy of this view.I have argued elsewhere (Grenville 1997) that, if there is an identifiable principalproblem, it is more deep-seated and lies in the fragility of the financial sector.  It has many ofthe characteristics of an old-fashioned bank liquidity crisis, with failing confidence at the heartof the problem.  I am not going to go through this argument again today, because this session isabout exchange rates.  And, in any case, the exchange rate clearly did play an important part inthe story.  What I shall argue, however, is that it was not the central, over-riding, element of thestory.The factsFirst, the facts.  Table 1 shows the exchange rate movements in a number ofEast-Asian countries during 1997 and of course there have been some further large falls in theearly days of 1998.  These have been very large movements and unusually rapid, but themagnitudes, at least during 1997, are not unprecedented.Not long after the exchange rate was floated in Australia in 1983, there was achange of close to 40 per cent in the trade-weighted exchange rate (which would be of the sameorder of magnitude that we saw in Asia in 1997).  For Japan, in the two years beginning in                                                  *I am grateful for the help of John Hawkins and Amanda Thornton in preparing this paper.BIS Review   13/1998
- 2 -April 1995, the exchange rate depreciated by 34 per cent:  over a longer period of time (e.g. tenyears), we can find much larger changes in the yen, from around 250 to the dollar at oneextreme, to 80 to the dollar at the other extreme.  Even the exchange rate between the two “safehavens” - the US dollar and the German mark - experienced changes (both up and down) ofaround 50 per cent in the mid 1980s.1Table  1:   East  Asian  Exchange  Ratesper cent change during 1997vs US dollartrade-weighted*Indonesia-56-44Malaysia-35-24Philippines-33-26South Korea-47-43Thailand-45-38*   RBA calculationWhy do these big changes in exchange rates occur?This is a central question, to which there is no clear answer yet.  But I want to putforward two issues which may be a large part of the story:  the first has to do with large capitalflows;  and the second has to do with what the technicians would call “model uncertainty”:  thereis no close, well-established relationship between the fundamentals of the economy and theexchange rate.  When these uncertainties are great, it is difficult for markets to assess what is the“right” exchange rate.First, capital flows.  One of the outstanding (indeed amazing) characteristics ofthe 1990s has been the extraordinary increase in international capital flows, particularly to theemerging countries, and particularly to the countries of this region.  Graph 1 shows a measure ofthe increase in overall flows.  The ten countries that were the main recipients, shown in Graph 2,accounted for about three-quarters of the total, and half of them are in East Asia.  Graph 3 is areminder that these flows were extraordinarily large relative to the size of these economies -routinely amounting to 6 per cent or more of GDP.  The other characteristic of internationalcapital flows (shown in Graph 4) was the greatly increased importance of portfolio investment -first channelled through banks and, more recently, directly from funds management institutions.One of the characteristics of these professional fund managers is that they have applied moreformal, structured principles to portfolio management, including the idea that diversification willprotect fund holders from some volatility.  At the same time, few of these fund managers areexperts in the individual emerging markets - they tend to treat these markets as an investmentclass, rather than develop country-specific detailed information.  In this world, contagion is                                                  1 Among the Asian countries themselves, it is worth recalling that Indonesia, as a conscious anddeliberate element of macro policy, changed its exchange rate by large amounts three times in the late1970s and 1980s, at a time when it had a fixed exchange rate and there was no pressing need forexchange rate changes - they were well-conceived macro policy responses to emerging policy problems,and were taken on in the well-founded belief that exchange rate changes of this size could be absorbed bythe economy.BIS Review   13/1998

It is a bold fund managerwho stands his ground when the herd is stampeding.2Graph 1: Developing Countries Net Capital FlowsBillions of US$-60060120180-60060120180-60060120180-60060120180US$B199719921987198219771972US$BPrivateOfficialGraph 2: Concentration of Private Capital Flows1990-95IndiaRussiaIndonesiaThailandArgentinaMalaysiaKoreaBrazilMexicoChina020406080100120140160180Graph 3: Private Gross Capital Flows12 largest recipients of private capital, % of GNP0123456012345601234560123456%%199519901985198019751970Graph 4: Developing Countries Net Private Capital FlowsBillions of US$-80-4004080-80-4004080-80-4004080-80-4004080US$B199719921987198219771972US$BDirect investmentPortfolioinvestmentOther investmentAt the same time as these large mutual funds were discovering the attractions ofdiversification, the financial infrastructure to implement this was also being put in place, mainlydriven by international financial institutions searching out expansion opportunities.  They wereencouraged in this by the general intellectual climate which promoted globalisation, and by theofficial international financial institutions (IMF, World Bank, and so on) who saw freeing up offinancial capital as an important part of the development process.3,4  The recipient countrieswere happy enough to see these flows, as they themselves embraced the increasing sophisticationof their financial infrastructure as a symbol of modernity and as a driving force for the growth.Progressive dismantling of capital controls in the recipient countries was a factor, but in anumber of cases the capital accounts had already been substantially opened (in Indonesia, forinstance, capital flows were, to all intents and purposes, free from 1970 onwards).                                                  2One other point worth noting is the disparity between the size of these funds and the size of therecipient countries.  Even though these funds have not diversified all that much, their size is enormous.Even if the US mutual funds bought every share listed on the ASEAN stock markets, this would stillrepresent less than a tenth of their assets.3 Korea, for example, as a pre-condition for entry into the OECD “rich countries’” club, had further toderegulate capital flows.4 Coming out of this, we saw such developments as the Bangkok International Banking Facility,which began as an offshore banking centre, but very quickly developed into the smooth facilitator ofmassive flows of capital into Thailand (over $10 billion per year - more than 10 per cent of GDP - since1993). At the same time, Thai finance companies hoped to improve their claims for banking licences byfacilitating inflows.BIS Review   13/1998
- 4 -It was not so much change of regulation but change of attitude and perceptionsthat was the driving force of the enormous increases in capital flows.  By 1990, a number ofthese countries had recorded two decades of high growth and had established an enviable trackrecord of political stability, balanced budgets and lowish inflation.  If there was an “economicmiracle” occurring (cf. World Bank, 1993), it is not surprising that foreign investors wanted aslice of the action.Not least, domestic investors in these countries took the opportunity of whatlooked like extremely low borrowing rates on these overseas funds to finance an investmentboom, including, inevitably, a good share of over-investment and misplaced investment.These big flows (and the big current account deficits that went with them) werenot some kind of aberration, but reflected the normal working of market forces.  For those whofind these deficits to be aberrant behaviour, could I remind you of the Feldstein and Horioka(1980) analysis, which suggested that the true aberrant behaviour was the close correspondencebetween saving and investment within most countries in the world.  In other words, the amountof capital flow between countries has been smaller than optimal behaviour would seem tosuggest.  While a number of poor investment opportunities were certainly undertaken (mostnotably, excessive real estate investment), at an aggregate level it is still correct to say that therewere many high profit opportunities available in these countries, as they moved from well insidethe technological frontier towards the frontier itself, driven by an eagerness to adopt all sorts ofproductivity-enhancing techniques.Graph 5: Singapore Current AccountPer cent of GDP-40-30-20-10010-40-30-20-10010-40-30-20-10010-40-30-20-10010%%19961992Source: IMF International Financial Statistics.198819841980197619721968If all this sounds a bit textbook-ish, consider the experience of Singapore.  Asshown in Graph 5, they ran a current account deficit averaging more than 10 per cent of GDP fortwo decades, in a period of policy-making which would universally be regarded, with hindsight,as extremely successful.  I should remind you also that all these countries ran, in the textbooksense, “good” deficits - i.e. they were used to fund investment and not consumption, and werecertainly not funding budget deficits.Some of these countries understood, perhaps intuitively more than by rigorouslogic, that big current account deficits made them vulnerable:  Indonesia, for instance, wasuncomfortable if its current account deficit was above 3 per cent of GDP.  Korea, too (in recentyears at least), ran quite modest current account deficits.  But by and large, once these countriesBIS Review   13/1998
- 5 -accepted the idea of financial deregulation and open markets, they were going to be on thereceiving end of very substantial capital inflows.5Table  2:   Saving,  Investment,  Current  Account  and  Budget  Balances1991-1995  averageSaving(% of GNP)Investment(% of GNP)CAB(% of GDP)Budget Balance(% of GDP)Indonesia31.834.1-2.50.8Malaysia34.240.5-6.30.1Philippines18.721.7-3.4-0.6South Korea35.436.9-1.3-0.2Thailand34.941.8-6.42.9Memo:Mexico17.619.4-5.20.1United States15.516.0-1.2-3.6Germany21.822.2-0.9-2.0Japan34.830.42.6-0.6There is not a lot of point in trying to identify precisely whether the capital flowswere more supply-driven than demand-driven, because we have known since Marshall that theoutcome depends on the two blades of the demand and supply scissors.  Nevertheless, it mightbe worth noting that the financial flows were often significantly larger than the amount thatcould be absorbed in terms of real flows of goods and services - i.e. the capital inflow was largerthan the current account deficit:  Graph 6 illustrates this.Graph6: Private Capital Inflows and the Current AccountAs a percentage of GDP•••••••••••••-10-8-6-4-202468Argentina (92-93)Chile (89-94)ColombiaFinlandIndonesiaMalaysia (80-86)Malaysia (89-94)Mexico (89-94)NorwayPhilippines (89-94)SwedenThailand (88-94)Venezuela (92-93)Private capital inflows%%Source: World Bank (1997)We will return, later, to the issue of whether the policy problems created by thesehuge capital flows (and the resultant rapid growth of domestic credit) could have been avoidedby a different exchange rate regime.  The basic point made here is that these countries embodiedsignificant profit opportunities (albeit with lots of opportunities to over-invest and invest in thewrong industries), and that it was normal for large amounts of capital to flow from the “oldworld” of savers towards the new opportunities available in these countries.                                                  5 Indonesia also understood that it was difficult to put in place the necessary prudential structure intime to keep pace with the burgeoning capital inflows.  The central bank Governor has noted:  “we startedbuilding the foundations of a house but suddenly we had to host a party”.BIS Review   13/1998
- 6 -The second major issue behind exchange rate fluctuations revolves aroundperceptions of how the economy works - “the model”.  What is the “mind-set” of participants inthe market - what do they think is the “proper” exchange rate?  This is based not just on theirviews about some “fundamentals”, but also their guesses about other market participants’ views,so there is certainly plenty of opportunity for exchange rates to move very significantly, and stayaway from the underlying fundamentals for significant periods of time.  We noted, earlier, thatthis has happened in the case of countries such as the United States, Japan and Australia, wherethere are well-developed views about how the economy works and detailed analytical andeconometric studies of what proper pricing relativities should be.  The “models” or “mind-sets”for the countries in question are much less fully developed and universally held, so there is farmore opportunity for prices to shift sharply, and stay at rates which, earlier, would have seemedabnormal.  On top of this, there are substantial information asymmetries, asymmetries whichmade market participants very nervous about going against the run of the market or takingsignificant contrarian positions.This combination - very large, footloose capital flows and an exchange rate notfirmly anchored by “fundamentals” - goes a long way to explain the big exchange rate moves.When sentiment and confidence changed and the original investors began to pull out theircapital, the exchange rate fall did nothing to induce new inflows.  Where were the stabilisingspeculators of textbook theory, who were supposed (in the textbook view) to respond to the fallin the exchange rate by recognising that, once the exchange rate was below its fundamentallevel, there was a profit opportunity for those who bought the currency?  In the absence of afirmly-defined “fundamental” equilibrium exchange rate, as the exchange rate fell, the marketchanged its view on what was the “correct” equilibrium rate.  Even when most marketparticipants agreed that exchange rates had gone too far, they recognised the possibility that theycould go further still.  To stand against the run of the market in a contrarian position might beultimately vindicated, but in the short run required a degree of courage and confidence that nofund manager (whose performance is evaluated more-or-less constantly) could afford to take.  Inshort, there were no equilibrating flows to anchor the exchange rates.How should exchange rates behave?Let’s try to develop this a bit further to see whether there is any clear, fairlyuniversally-accepted idea of how exchange rates should move in the circumstances in whichthese countries found themselves.Perhaps the nearest guidance we can get from formal academic ideas is the olddiscussion about the “transfer problem”.  The key point is that as financial flows shift from onecountry to another, it is necessary to induce equivalent real flows of goods and services (whichwould take the form of a current account deficit, corresponding to the financial flows in thecapital account).  The old literature observed that there could be a wide range of outcomes forthe “transfer problem”:  where the financial flow took the form of direct foreign investment, thesame decision about the financial flow generally induced the real flow - as a company decidedto invest overseas, it shipped plant and machinery in roughly corresponding amount.  But if theflows took the form of portfolio investment, then the exchange rate had to appreciate toencourage the real resource transfer.The other longer-term structural influence on the exchange rate was the rapidproductivity increases in the tradeables sectors:  in theory, these countries might have expectedto find, over time, their real exchange rates appreciating.  In the Balassa/Samuelson (1964)BIS Review   13/1998
- 7 -model, productivity rises fastest in the tradeables sector, and equilibrium requires a higher realexchange rate.Of course, there were other forces at work.  In 1996, there was a very significantfall in the terms of trade of these countries.6  And the story is further complicated by the specificnature of the exchange rate regime - fixed more-or-less to the US dollar - so the effectiveexchange rate swung with the US dollar.  To further complicate the picture, capital flowsresponded to the changing monetary stance in the big capital-exporting countries - low interestrates in Japan in recent years encouraged the so-called “carry trade” - borrowing at low interestrates in Japan and lending at high rates elsewhere in Asia.7These factors were transient, and taking the dominant structural elements as beingthe capital transfer issue and Balassa/Samuelson, it was not surprising to find upward pressureon exchange rates during the 1990s and some modest appreciation of real exchange rates.  Theexchange rate strength might have been expected to last for a considerable length of time, andperhaps become permanent because of the structural improvement in productivity.  Therelatively modest increases in the real exchange rate seen in countries like Thailand were thusnot, in themselves, a clear indicator of an over-valued exchange rate or impending depreciation.Table  3:   East  Asian  International  Reserveschange from December 1991 to December 1996;  US$bnIndonesia9Malaysia16Philippines7South Korea20Thailand20Source:  IMF, International Financial StatisticsIn the face of this upward pressure on the exchange rate, the policy approach ofthese countries over the decade (until 1997) had been to resist significant appreciation.  This isreflected in the increase in their foreign exchange reserves (Table 3).  Why did they resist theupward pressure?  This was, in part, because the lower exchange rate was seen as offering abeneficial general incentive for the most dynamic parts of the economy - the tradeables sectorand, in particular, the export sector.  Partly, too, it reflected a perception that high exchangerates left countries vulnerable to sudden changes in sentiment.  Looking at the experience ofthese countries, it is hard to disagree strongly with these sentiments.  Dornbusch (1994, p. 280),writing about Mexico, notes “… over-valuation is one of the gravest policy errors along the way.Over-valuation stops growth and, more often than not, ends in a speculative siege on theexchange rate and ultimately currency realignment”.8LessonsI have tried to put the case that the capital inflows that occurred into thesecountries in the first half of the 1990s were not some aberration of policy-making, but were                                                  6 For example, the price of a standard computer chip fell from $50 in late 1995 to under $10 in 1996.7 Some argue that the reversal of capital flows to East Asia was triggered by market fears thatJapanese interest rates were about to rise, putting an end to the “carry trade”.8 It is worth noting that Mexico’s exchange rate over-valuation problem in 1994 was quite differentfrom any Asian experience - a fixed rate regime had been used by Mexico as an anchor while inflation wasreduced, with the inevitable consequence of over-valuation.BIS Review   13/1998
- 8 -more-or-less to be expected.  But we now know, with hindsight, that they were unsustainable.Where did it go wrong?  What should be done?The first lesson is that whatever the “model” suggests is the norm for capitalflows, when these flows get large, economies are vulnerable to changes in sentiment.  The modeldoes not say much about how policies should handle changes of sentiment which bring verylarge variance to capital flows and GDP.  Wherever there are large foreign capital flows, there isa high probability of rapid changes of mood, because - whoever bears the exchange rate risk(whether borrower or lender) - one of the parties to the transaction is holding an exchange rateposition which is not “natural”.  This makes that party flighty and quick to re-assess theirposition.  In many cases, the response was that the party with the most information bore theexchange rate risk - i.e. the domestic borrower borrowed in foreign currency.  It was notirrational to expect exchange rates to remain reasonably stable, not only because policy in thesecountries had succeeded in keeping a high degree of stability over a reasonably long period oftime, but also because (based on our earlier argument) they might have expected, if anything, theexchange rate to appreciate over time, which would have reduced the cost of their overseasborrowing.9  But in the end it was the old issue of variance or the variability over time thatbrought the best-laid plans of borrowers to such an unhappy end.  We noted earlier that thetextbook equilibrating forces were largely absent - as foreign exchange became dearer, peoplewanted to buy more, not less.  This was reinforced by lenders’ behaviour.  As the exchange ratesfell, foreign lenders, although protected from exchange rate risk, began to realise that they wereexposed to increasing credit risk, and became extremely reluctant to roll over their lending.  Thecredit-rating agencies added their own special twist-of-the-knife, down-grading these countriessix months after the problems began, so that portfolio managers were forced to sell into thecollapsed markets.Now we have looked at some of the forces operating on the exchange rate, we canask:  “Would an earlier float of the exchange rate have avoided these problems?”  Withhindsight, it is hard to argue against this view - the actual path proved unsustainable, so anyalternative looks attractive.  But this does not tell us whether the alternative would, in fact, havehandled the situation more satisfactorily:  for this, we would need to sketch out what theexchange rate path over time would have been under this alternative scenario.  Given thecapital-transfer process underway, how much would the exchange rate be expected toappreciate?  This is hard to think through, but the key idea here is that an interest ratedifferential should be balanced by an expectation of exchange rate depreciation if portfolios areto be held in balance.  Portfolio equilibrium could not be achieved by lowering domestic (localcurrency) interest rates, because these were set - in effect - by the high domestic marginalefficiency of capital:  high interest rates were needed to rein in the intrinsic dynamism of thedomestic economy.  If the interest differential was expected to be maintained for a significantperiod of time (say, a decade or more), then there would need to be a very large appreciation ofthe exchange rate to balance the likelihood that interest differentials would be maintained overthis period of time.  How far would it have had to appreciate before foreign investors wouldhave stopped extrapolating the appreciation and begun to expect depreciation?  Would thisprocess have been smooth, without the over-shooting we have seen?  What sort of knife-edgeequilibrium would this have been, in which portfolio managers’ calculations teeter between therecent history of appreciation, but incorporate a steady, gentle, expected depreciation from hereon?  Would the even-higher current account deficits that would have occurred during the                                                  9Were they foolish not to hedge their borrowing?  This is a common ex post criticism, but it seemsto ignore the obvious financial-market identity that if they had hedged their borrowing, then they would haveeliminated the interest rate advantage of borrowing in foreign currency.  This does not say that it wouldhave been unwise to hedge - merely that it is understandable that they did not.BIS Review   13/1998
- 9 -appreciation phase have spooked the market?  There are no answers to these “what if” questions,but it seems naive to argue that markets would have maintained a smoothly-evolving equilibriumexchange rate through the extraordinary changes of the 1990s.  Greater exchange rate flexibilitymay well have provided a better outcome (or, more likely, brought on the crisis earlier), but itneeded to occur within a financial infrastructure which had the capacity to withstand theexigencies of real-world flexible markets.I now turn to more immediate issues, particularly the events of 1997.  Onceexchange rates were floated, why didn’t higher interest rates work more effectively to stabilisethe exchange rates of these countries?  There are new lessons and old lessons to be re-learned:•if the market does not believe that high interest rates will be sustained,then there is no encouragement to capital inflows (and, in fact, the market may think that theexchange rate will fall further when the unsustainable interest rates are lowered);•high interest rates are supposed to work by encouraging domesticborrowers to roll over their foreign exchange debt and borrow more overseas, and byencouraging foreigners to lend more, denominated in domestic currency.  But foreigners arenow worried about credit risk:  higher local-currency interest rates do not encourage them toroll over their foreign exchange loans (in fact, will cause them to worry more about thefinancial health of their debtors), and it seems unlikely that many foreigners will be temptedto lend in local currency (the Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) “adverse selection” argument isrelevant here:  only the most daring (and therefore risky) borrowers will be willing to payhigher interest rates).None of this, of course, argues for low interest rates - but it is a reminder thatsimple manipulation of interest rates will not always protect an exchange rate.What other lessons should be drawn, specifically on the appropriate exchange rateregime for the future?  Policy-makers of these countries always accepted, in principle, that astheir countries became more integrated with the outside world, they would not be able to controlboth interest rates and the exchange rate.  They understood this, but were perhaps hoping to putoff the day for somewhat longer.  It seems unlikely, now, that these countries can go back toanything like the fixed exchange rates that they had before:  nor would this be desirable.  But wecould also understand if the policy-makers of the region find both the extent of the movementand the actual levels which the market has now produced to be aberrant, and hardly arecommendation for “leaving it up to the market”.  Those of us who have experienced floatingexchange rates for some time now might offer a couple of points:•like them, Australia did not float because we had decided that it was agood idea, but because we were forced by circumstances to do so;•like them, Australia found the initial stages of the float to be extremelyuncomfortable, and even over the longer term, there seem to have been moments when theexchange rate was not closely anchored by the fundamentals;•nevertheless, most of us have come to the view that floating exchangerates work well for us (although there will be times when we believe we can do beneficialBIS Review   13/1998
- 10 -intervention in the market).  Our systems have built up some resilience as people becomemore accustomed to exchange rate swings, and build these variations into their decisions.10It is also clear that the proper answer is not to restrict capital flows, although thesecountries may be, in future, less enthusiastic about encouraging some of the more footloose andvolatile forms of capital inflow.  These countries should move forward with financialderegulation, although the central lesson from this experience is that the prudential frameworkshould advance in step with the opening up of the financial sector.11  The sine qua non ofsmooth adaptation to large capital flows must be a resilient and robust formal financial sector,with risk-averse conservative banks forming a large stable core.  Such risk-averse institutionswould have been reluctant to expose themselves to the sort of exchange rate shocks that haveoccurred, and so a well-functioning formal financial sector would have borrowed less in foreigncurrency and would have been more conscious of the credit risk of lending to those who hadborrowed extensively overseas.  To the extent that this left private non-bank borrowers stillborrowing excessively in foreign currency, then we might hope that the “consenting adults”view would prevail, leaving the borrower and lender to sort out repayments on a one-on-onebasis without putting the entire economy at risk.  But those who are confident that this privatenon-bank borrowing will be a smooth, well-informed process might contemplate just howquickly private investors changed from wide-eyed enthusiasm to gloomy disillusionment, andhow slow the international credit agencies were to see the impending problems.  The alarm-bellswent off when the building was well-and-truly ablaze.  The problems of lack of aclearly-understood model and asymmetrical information may be addressed by greatertransparency and provision of data, but it hardly seems likely that they can be overcome.  Thelesson we should draw from all this is that inconvenient fluctuations in exchange rates areinevitable, and we have to design systems which can cope with them.To put this point in different words, we need to enlarge our view of “thefundamentals”.  To the conventional list of “fundamentals”, we need to add another vital one -some assessment of the health and resilience of the financial system.  Whether these countriescan afford to return to their old pace of growth depends very largely on their ability to cope withvariance - particularly variance of capital flows and exchange rates.  So the constraint on growthwill not be the conventional one of available resources, but whether the financial sector hasproven itself to be able to withstand vigorous “stress-testing” - can it withstand big exchangerate changes?  Can it cope with asset booms and busts?  It also needs to be able to handle bigswings in perceived company profitability, because we know that a project which is performingwell in an environment of 8 per cent growth can turn into a loser when growth slows.                                                  10 This is not to argue that the sort of exchange rate changes which have occurred in Asia are helpingto bring about a new and beneficial equilibrium.  They are, in fact, very damaging, not just because of theinappropriate price signals they embody, but because of the high interest rates used to contain theexchange rate movements, and the damage to firms which have borrowed in dollars.  Much more modestchanges would have achieved an improved competitiveness, and as far as capital flows are concerned, bigmovements in exchange rates seem to be inhibiting rather than encouraging capital flows, by worsening thebasic situation in these countries, reducing profitability, limiting GDP growth and creating substantial policy-making uncertainty.  It might be worth noting, too, that in the Mexican case, the large nominal exchangerate fall which was initially seen (in 1994/95) as being an important part of the corrective process has beenmore-or-less offset by subsequent inflation, so that the improvement in the real exchange rate andcompetitiveness has been largely lost.11 When people used to argue about the correct sequencing for the deregulatory process, theyrecognised that financial deregulation should come last, because if there remained any opportunities fordisequilibrium profits in the meantime, a very open financial sector would allow these to be exploited.BIS Review   13/1998
- 11 -I have already noted how important it is to improve prudential supervision inthese countries.  This is not controversial, although putting it into practice will be difficult andtime consuming.  One more-controversial element would be an effort on the part of theprudential authorities in the capital supplying countries to go beyond assuring themselves thattheir own banks are acting prudently and - in addition - asking whether their actions may beputting the recipient country’s financial institutions at risk.  This would seem to require a greaterdegree of co-operation than exists (or is envisaged) at the moment.In shortLarge and volatile capital inflows are an inevitable part of the internationalcontext in which these countries operate.  Even with a floating exchange rate, very largemedium-term exchange rate changes can be expected.  This will put a lot of pressure on thesolvency of firms and, more particularly, banks.  You therefore need a sound, well-supervisedand risk-averse banking system.  This is an essential part of a deregulated financial market, butone that many Asian countries lack.It may not be possible to return to the highest of the growth rates seen in theprevious three decades, but fast rates of growth are still possible, and eminently desirable.  Thecountries which get back there quickest will be those which are able to put in place institutionswhich can withstand the changes of sentiment which are part-and-parcel of a globalisedeconomy.ReferencesBalassa, B.

Mr. Clementi explains how London’s banks and markets will help to forgelinks between the euro area and the rest of the world   Speech by the Deputy Governor of theBank of England, Mr. David Clementi, before international bankers and members ofDespite all the uncertainties of the last few years, I think that it is now wellunderstood that the euro is going to be introduced on 1 January 1999. As you all know, theUnited Kingdom is not going to adopt the euro as its domestic currency from the start. But theeuro is likely to become the core currency for the European wholesale markets in London. TheCity of London is Europe’s leading financial centre; and the introduction of a major newcurrency on the Continent of Europe means that London must have all the necessary trading,payment and settlement infrastructure, and be fully part of the conversion.London will be ready for the euro. What I want to do today is to explain - withmy colleague, John Townend, and Sir David Walker, head of Morgan Stanley in Europe - howLondon’s banks and markets will help to forge links between the euro area and the rest of theworld. And we also want to discuss the broader question of how the euro will affect theEuropean financial landscape.We hope that EMU will be a success. The British Government is in favour ofjoining EMU in principle. It has made it clear that it sees no constitutional bar to Britishmembership.There are advantages. For example, the introduction of the single Europeancurrency will help to complete the Single European Market. And the uncertainty associated withinvestment decisions within the euro area will be reduced. Europe will continue its consolidationas a major trading bloc. And financial benefits should flow from the introduction of the euro as amajor currency for financing. The tradeable government debt of the EU as a bloc, for example,amounts to around 2.6 trillion dollars equivalent, compared to 2.1 trillion here in the US. Thiswill give the euro debt markets a broadly similar size and liquidity as hitherto has been thepreserve of the dollar markets.But there are also risks. For example, will the UK economy be able to livecomfortably with euro interest rates on a permanent basis? And if problems emerge after EMUbegins, will a ‘one-size-fits-all’ monetary policy be adequate to deal with them, particularly ifthere is insufficient flexibility in product markets and labour markets? A particular concern isthe high rates of unemployment in some Continental European countries, and the differing ratesbetween them.The British Government has set a number of economic tests to ensure that, beforethe UK joins EMU, there will be sustainable convergence between the UK economy and theeuro area. The tests include cyclical convergence and structural flexibility, the impact oninvestment, the impact on the financial services industry and the impact more generally ongrowth, stability and jobs.So the UK will not join EMU at the outset. But financial firms in London,whatever their nationality, see the euro as a key part of their business. With our support at theBank of England, they have been actively preparing for the introduction of the euro. Londonthrives on liquid markets, regardless of currency. So the introduction of the euro is a majoropportunity for London.BIS Review   11/1998
- 2 -From the start, London will act as a link between New York and the euro area byproviding a full range of euro services in wholesale financial markets. That includes europayments and settlement, so that anyone who wishes to do so will be able to trade and settle ineuro in London from the first day of EMU. But it also extends to euro banking, foreignexchange and derivatives trading, bond and equity issuance and trading, fund management,financial advice and professional support services as well.The City of London is Europe’s leading financial centre and one of the top threeglobal centres, alongside New York and Tokyo. Here in New York, the financial centre isinfluenced by the size of the domestic economy. That is true of Tokyo as well. But London’ssuccess has historically been due to its international financial business.London has more foreign banking institutions than any other financial centre, andit is the largest financial centre for cross-border bank lending.London is the world’s leading centre for foreign exchange business, with averagedaily net turnover six times that of Frankfurt. More foreign exchange business in dollars,Deutsche Mark and French francs takes place in London than in each currency’s country oforigin.London is the principal centre for the international bond markets, with 60% ofprimary international bond syndication and 75% of secondary market trading.The London Stock Exchange is the world’s largest centre for the listing andtrading of foreign equities, and LIFFE is the largest financial futures exchange in the worldoutside Chicago.London is also one of the largest centres for the fund management of institutionalequities, and one of the largest centres for insurance business.London’s position derives from the critical mass of markets and financial servicesavailable, and the concentration of the strongest financial businesses from all over the world.London’s strengths include a long track record of innovation and capitalising onnew opportunities. The most well-known example is the creation of the Eurodollar markets,which US firms in London did so much to promote.London is the home of the English language. It is in a convenient time-zonebetween Asia in the morning and New York in the afternoon.It has an abundance of trading and other financial skills and professional supportservices - in law, accountancy, tax, property and communications.It has a world-class technological infrastructure, which is continually beingimproved.And equally important, London has an unwavering commitment to openness andto welcoming the establishment of foreign firms. In particular, the regulatory framework inLondon has proved sufficiently adaptable to maintain confidence in financial institutions andmarkets without stifling innovation and risk-taking. The new Financial Services Authority inLondon is committed to continuing this approach.BIS Review   11/1998
- 3 -All these factors help to explain the size of the financial sector based in London.And foreign firms are continuing to move their operations, and in some cases their head offices,to London. I would like to acknowledge the contribution to London’s success made byAmerican firms such as JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Citibankand Chase. And many Continental European firms have recently also made major investments inLondon, including ABN AMRO, Paribas, Dresdner and Deutsche. This shows how globalfinancial institutions in the top rank regard London as the place to be, irrespective of whether theUK participates in EMU.You will have noticed that these factors have little to do with the question of thebase currency used either in the UK or in Continental Europe. The City thrives on liquid marketsregardless of currency, and it will thrive on the euro. Measured in these terms, the introductionof the euro represents an opportunity for London.We cannot of course be complacent about London’s position. London does nothold its pre-eminent position as of right. It continually has to earn it.For this reason, in the run-up to the introduction of the euro, the Bank of Englandis playing a key role in preparing London’s global marketplace for this major new opportunity,alongside market practitioners themselves: We are ensuring that the necessary financialinfrastructure in London is in place so that anyone who wishes to do so can trade and settle ineuro in London from the first day of EMU. We are also helping to ensure that City firms -whatever their nationality - are properly prepared so that they and their customers can make fulluse of the infrastructure.We are providing information to the London market so that firms - whatever theirnationality - are as well informed as possible about the technical side of the preparations for theeuro. This is the significance of our broadly quarterly series of publications on ‘Practical Issues’,which now has a circulation of around 40,000, of which 5,000 go directly overseas.We also aim to promote agreement between central banks and marketpractitioners across Europe on practical issues in areas where the market requires a degree ofco-ordination.In conclusion, I want to emphasise three points. First, the introduction of the euroon 1 January 1999 will create a major currency for financing, with significant depth andliquidity. Second, London will be ready for the introduction of the euro. Anybody who wishes todo so will be able to trade and settle in euro in London from the first day of EMU. Third, asEurope’s leading financial centre, we are confident that London will be the internationalfinancial centre for the euro. And by providing competitive financial services in euro, Londonwill help to increase the flow of business between Europe and the US. The City is not just amajor national asset. It is a major asset for Europe and the international economy as a whole.BIS Review   11/1998
The Bank of Japan’s January report of recent economic and financialdevelopments   BANK OF JAPAN, COMMUNICATION, 6/2/98.SummaryJapan’s economic growth remains stagnant. Sluggish domestic demand, especiallyhousehold expenditures, has been exerting negative influence upon production, employment andWith respect to final demand, net exports have continued to increase, and businessinvestment has been rising moderately, mainly in the manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, privateconsumption has continued to stagnate, reflecting cautious household sentiment that haspersisted even after the rebound of the front-loading expansion of spending prior to theconsumption tax hike had subsided. Housing investment has continued to be weak andpublic-sector investment has been decreasing. Reflecting the weak final demand, inventoryadjustment pressures have been spreading, and industrial production has been on a slightlydeclining trend. The pace of improvement in employment and income conditions has also beenslowing. Thus, the positive growth cycle of production, income, and expenditures has stalled.As regards the outlook of the economy, external demand is expected to continueupholding the economic growth, and the special tax-cut measures announced in December 1997are expected to have positive effects on household spending. Overall, however, the economy islikely to remain stagnant for a while, due to the intensifying pressures of inventory adjustment,the continued decline in public-sector investment, and the anticipated deceleration in businessfixed investment. Given the slowdown in the pace of growth, the economy is considered to bevulnerable to further negative impacts. In these circumstances, the possibility of the emergenceof further downside risks should be carefully observed, such as prolonged and intensifiedadjustments in the Asian economies, more restrictive lending stance of financial institutionsimpeding corporate finance, or further deterioration of confidence in the corporate andhousehold sectors.With regard to prices, wholesale prices have declined reflecting a slack in thesupply and demand conditions of goods. Meanwhile, consumer prices have remained at a levelslightly above that of the previous year when observed excluding the effects of institutionalchanges such as the rise in the consumption tax rate. Thus, prices on the whole remained stable.Prices are likely to be steady in the immediate future, since downward pressures on prices arenot as significant as was the case in 1995, when the yen’s appreciation induced a penetration ofimports, which then directly dampened prices of import-competing domestic final goods,arousing concerns for a deflationary spiral in the economy. However, conditions which mayaffect price developments, including the slack in supply and demand conditions in the Asianeconomies, should be carefully examined, since the output gap in the domestic economy isunlikely to diminish for a while.Financial markets have shown the following developments. Yields on TBs andlong-term government bonds have been at around their lowest levels. Interest rates of terminstruments in money markets and yields on corporate bonds and bank debentures, on the otherhand, have risen and remained high due to the more cautious attitude of market participantstoward credit and liquidity risks following the failure of some financial institutions. Stock priceshave been low as the confidence in corporate profit growth continued to be weak and uncertaintyover the financial system mounted. In the foreign exchange markets, the yen appreciated againstthe Asian currencies, while it depreciated against the US dollar.BIS Review   11/1998
- 2 -With respect to growth in monetary aggregates, the underlying trend of lendingsby private financial institutions has remained almost unchanged, and the year-to-year changes inaverage outstanding of M2+CDs have continued to be at around 3 percent. Lending attitudes offnancial institutions, however, are becoming increasingly cautious as capital adequacyconstraints have become more binding due to the fall in stock prices and the yen. Moreover,higher market interest rates are gradually pressuring lending rates to rise since December 1997.There is, therefore, a need to carefully monitor the developments in the financial markets andtheir influences on the real economy.BIS Review   11/1998
Mr. Fazio reports on the Bank of Italy and the European System of CentralBanks   Statement by the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Dott. Antonio Fazio, before theTreasury, Budget and Planning Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, in Rome on 12/2/98.The results the Italian economy has achieved in the past five years are attributableto the combined operation of fiscal and monetary policy and to wage moderation.In late 1992 and early 1993 the restrictive stance of monetary policy preventedexpectations of rising prices, fuelled by the decline in the external value of the lira and the abruptchange in the exchange rate regime, from translating into actual inflation. A substantialcontribution to this result came from low wage growth and budgetary measures that impinged onthe structure of the main components of government spending.Conditions in the economy became difficult again during 1994: the state sectorborrowing requirement was overshooting the targets and demand was growing rapidly, with theresult that inflationary pressures developed. In December 1994 and the first few months of 1995domestic political factors and the repercussions of the Mexican crisis on the foreign exchangeand financial markets aggravated the situation. Official rates were raised three times: in August1994, at the first manifestation of price tensions; in February 1995, in conjunction withsupplementary fiscal measures; and in May of the same year, when doubts arose about thecurbing of inflation.The monetary tightening, the fiscal measures of early 1995 and the stabilization ofthe exchange rate had a positive influence on inflation expectations and long-term interest rates.Monetary policy maintained a restrictive stance throughout 1995 and in the firsthalf of 1996, with the aim of subduing inflation expectations and bringing the rate of increase inprices into line with that prevailing in the other leading industrial countries.In July 1996 a start was made on lowering the official rates. The reduction wasprudent and calibrated above all in relation to the decline in expected and actual inflation. Thisapproach resulted in a constant inflow of funds from abroad for purchases of governmentsecurities; by offsetting the large outflows of Italian capital generated by the need for portfoliodiversification, these inflows contributed to the stability of the exchange rate of the lira.The progress achieved made it possible for the lira to rejoin the exchange ratemechanism of the EMS in November 1996.The caution employed in relaxing monetary conditions meant that Italy’s financialand foreign exchange markets were not affected more than marginally in 1997 by the tensionsthat emerged at the international level in connection with the crisis in East Asia and thevicissitudes of some important European countries or by those attributable to domestic politicaldevelopments.Today the Bank of Italy’s reserves comprise more than 2,500 tonnes of gold andforeign assets, net of repurchase agreements, worth 82 trillion lire, compared with ó trillion in1992. Underlying the lira’s solidity is the return to balance between Italy’s external assets andliabilities.At the end of 1992 Italy had external claims of 600 trillion lire and externalliabilities amounting to 770 trillion. The net debt of 170 trillion was equal to 11 per cent of GDP.BIS Review   10/1998
- 2 -Thanks to the succession of surpluses recorded on the current account of the balance ofpayments, at the end of 1997 Italy’s overall net external position was once more broadly inbalance.Last September some 470 trillion lire of government foreign debt, consistingmostly of government securities held by non-residents, were matched by net external assets ofmore than 350 trillion held by the non-bank private sector, about 100 trillion held by the Bank ofItaly and smaller amounts held by banks and other financial operators.The Bank of Italy and the European System of Central BanksIt has been agreed within the Community that the decisions concerning the start ofmonetary union – in particular, those involving the countries that will adopt the single currencyfrom the start – will be taken in the early part of the month of May.With the introduction of the single currency, the task of formulating monetarypolicy will be transferred to the European System of Central Banks, comprising the central banksof all the participating countries and the European Central Bank.The Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended at Maastricht,provides a broad outline of the internal organization of the ESCB. The preparatory work carriedout by the European Monetary Institute since the signing of the Treaty has focused on theseaspects.The national central banks will be entrusted with the task of implementing withineach country the monetary policy decided at the Community level.The central banks of the participating countries will continue to be responsible forall the functions they are entrusted with under national laws; in Italy these include bankingsupervision, the supervision of markets, the safeguarding of competition in the credit market and,jointly with the European Central Bank, oversight of the payments system.The systemic crises in foreign markets have strengthened the view that bankingsupervision complements monetary policy in determining conditions of stability in financial andcredit markets.The primary objective of the common monetary policy is price stability. Themandate, clear and unequivocal, given to the European System of Central Banks is based on twotenets held by the drafters of the Treaty: that the stability of the value of money is a public goodwhich does not hinder, but rather fosters, sustainable growth of the real economy; and thatmaintaining stability depends crucially on the operation of monetary policy.The European System of Central Banks will enjoy complete autonomy; it willregularly provide information on its activities and report on them to the other Communityinstitutions. In particular, the European Central Bank will be required, pursuant to Article 109bof the Treaty and Article 15 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks, to publishperiodic reports on the activities of the ESCB, with a description of the current and future stanceof monetary policy. The European Parliament will be able to debate these matters and invite thePresident and the other members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank to beheard by its competent committees.BIS Review   10/1998
- 3 -In particular, the need for a “single” monetary policy will have to be reconciledwith the principle of “subsidiarity”, which has also been embodied in the Statute of the ESCBand is intended to permit the highest possible degree of decentralization in operational terms.More specifically, provision is made for a division of tasks along the followinglines:-the decision-making powers in monetary policy matters, especially withregard to interest rates and compulsory reserves, will be centralized in theEuropean Central Bank. The ECB will exercise these powers through theGoverning Council, comprising the Governors of the national centralbanks and the Executive Board, composed of the President, theVice-President and four other members. The Executive Board will beresponsible for implementing the decisions of the Governing Council on acontinuous basis;-the operational implementation of monetary policy will be entrusted to thenational central banks.Each national central bank will thus have two tasks: it will contribute, through itsGovernor, to the decisions of the Governing Council; and it will implement these decisions in itsown country.Operations in the money and foreign exchange markets will normally be carriedout by the national central banks.Within this framework, the Bank of Italy will continue to carry out all theoperational functions that it currently performs. The procedures for conducting monetary controloperations will be different in part from those used today; the draft legislative decree currentlyunder discussion in Parliament is designed to permit the necessary changes.Legal convergenceThe Treaty requires each member state to make its national legislation, andespecially the provisions concerning its central bank, compatible with the Treaty and the Statuteof the European System of Central Banks. In particular, the Treaty requires each member state toensure that its central bank is independent from the government and all other political bodies; thenecessary reforms must be enacted before the introduction of the single currency.Within the general framework laid down in the Treaty, the European MonetaryInstitute and the Commission have done valuable work in analyzing and interpreting the relevantprovisions and providing clear indications of the criteria to be followed in adapting nationallegislation to Community law, not least in view of the need for the latter’s uniform applicationthroughout the European Union.The key requirements of central bank independence with a view to a country’sadoption of the single currency are:-the task of pursuing price stability as the primary objective;-complete autonomy in the management of the monetary instruments,interest rates and monetary and credit aggregates, for the purpose ofdefending the internal and external value of the currency.BIS Review   10/1998
- 4 -Some of the provisions of the draft legislative decree are aimed at strengtheningthe Bank of Italy’s independence, the essentials of which are in fact already provided for inItalian legislation.At a higher level there is the proposal of the Joint Parliamentary Committee onconstitutional reform for the Bank of Italy to be given constitutional status by affirming thecentral bank’s independence and autonomy in the performance of its monetary and supervisoryfunctions in the Constitution.The integration of the national central banks in the European System of CentralBanks is to be achieved by linking the implementation at national level of measures concerningofficial interest rates, compulsory reserves and open-market operations with the decisionsadopted by the European Central Bank.It is important to stress that, in conformity with the Statute of the EuropeanSystem of Central Banks, the participation of the Bank of Italy in the System will  • not affect theperformance of the other tasks that it is assigned under national legislation, especially thoserelated to banking supervision.The draft legislative decree contains the provisions needed to ensure thecompatibility of Italian legislation with the Treaty and the Statute of the European System ofCentral Banks. In addition to the competent Italian Parliamentary committees, it has beensubmitted, as required, to the European Monetary Institute for its opinion. The provisionsguaranteeing the integration of the Bank of Italy in the ESCB will mostly come into force at thetime the single currency is adopted.The Statute of the Bank of Italy will be modified in accordance with thelegislative decree under discussion. The Bank’s Board of Directors has already approved theproposed amendments, which will be put to the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholdersto be held on 19 March: they will be rendered compatible with the final text of the legislativedecree.The amendments to the Bank’s Statutes will then follow the procedure laid downfor their approval by the President of the Republic.*   *   *In Italy the monetary policy approach that has been followed in the last few years,and will be maintained in the coming years, is aimed at convincing market participants, workersand businessmen that increases in income can only be achieved by expanding economic activity.The action taken on the monetary front, of necessity extremely rigorous at times,has made a major contribution to the convergence of Italy’s economy towards those of Europeancountries with a more firmly established tradition of stability.The decisions that will be taken by the European Central Bank will havemaintaining price stability as their objective.Labour market, incomes and fiscal policies will increasingly be the only onesavailable to promote the competitiveness and profitability of Italy’s enterprises, and growth inproduction and employment. They will have to give renewed impetus to productive investment.BIS Review   10/1998
- 5 -The ample availability of savings, of which a large part is invested abroad at present, makes thispossible.The revival of economic activity in Europe as a whole cannot be based onmanoeuvres to enhance competitiveness through the exchange rate of the common currency; suchaction would be in conflict with the primary objective of monetary stability. This will have to beunderpinned by a strong productive system, to be achieved by curbing budgets and taxes,boosting investment and making more flexible use of the factors of production. These are theindispensable conditions for achieving faster growth and creating new employment.BIS Review   10/1998
Mr. Brash addresses the concern about New Zealand’s balance-of-paymentsdeficit   Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Dr. Donald T. Brash, to theCanterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce in Christchurch on 30/1/98.IntroductionI am delighted to be addressing you once again, on the last Friday of January. If mymemory is correct, this is the fifth year in which I have done this, and I appreciate your tolerance ininviting me back each year. On previous occasions, I have addressed a range of issues, often relatingto the exchange rate and to the question of whether monetary policy was too tight or too loose.Today, I want to focus on one particular subject. Over the last few weeks, there hasbeen heightened public concern about New Zealand’s balance-of-payments deficit, triggered at leastin part by media reports of comments made by the International Monetary Fund in the context of theirrecent review of the New Zealand economy. And this public concern is hardly surprising: at 6.4 percent of GDP in the year to September 1997, New Zealand’s current account deficit is already one ofthe highest in the world. The Reserve Bank’s latest projections have that deficit increasing further tonearly 8 per cent of GDP in the year to March 1998, a level comparable with that in the crisis year of1984, and closely similar to the deficit in Thailand’s balance of payments before its mid-1997difficulties. Moreover, our current account deficit is adding to a net stock of external liabilities which,at some 80 per cent of GDP, is already probably the highest of any developed country.So the questions I want to address today are, first, do large current account deficitsmatter? And secondly, if they do matter, what should policy-makers seek to do about them?Do large current account deficits really matter?There are a number of well-respected economists who argue that largebalance-of-payments deficits are not something for policy-makers to be concerned about. They arguethat a current account deficit is simply an indication that investment being undertaken in NewZealand exceeds the savings of New Zealanders and that, since the public sector is running a surplus,this excess of investment over savings simply reflects the decisions of countless individual NewZealanders in the private sector to borrow (or raise equity capital) to finance investment. In the longerterm, this process will be self-correcting as either New Zealanders decide not to take on additionaldebt or foreigners decide not to extend additional credit. This view, in which the balance of paymentsis expected to adjust relatively smoothly, without the involvement of governments or central banks, istaken by such eminent economists as Max Corden and John Pitchford in Australia and MiltonFriedman in the United States.Even economists who do not take quite such a sanguine view of current accountdeficits as that concede that deficits are of much less concern today, with a floating exchange rate andthe virtually complete abolition of the distortions which previously affected the allocation ofinvestment, than was the case, say, prior to 1984. At that time, deficits were often the result ofsubstantial fiscal deficits and had to be covered by government borrowing overseas in foreigncurrency. Today, of course, the government’s accounts are in surplus. So what causes the sort ofcurrent account deficits that have recently provoked so much comment?It is probably fair to say that today’s deficit is in part the result of the enthusiasmwhich foreigners have had for investing in New Zealand. Not, I should stress, because foreigninvestment creates a current account deficit over the full life of the investment. On the contrary, Ibelieve it can be shown that, after taking all the direct and indirect effects into account, most foreigninvestment in New Zealand actually tends to have a beneficial effect on the balance of payments.BIS Review   8/1998
- 2 -Rather what I am saying is that, as foreign capital flows into New Zealand, it is matched by a currentaccount deficit.In other words, if there is a net inflow of capital, there must of necessity be a currentaccount deficit. Because that is what a current account deficit actually means - it means there is a netinflow of capital. If the current account were in balance, there would be no net capital inflow. If thecurrent account was in surplus, it would mean that there would be a net capital outflow. (Those whosay, and many do, that New Zealand needs an inflow of capital to finance its future development arein effect saying that New Zealand must continue to have a current account deficit.) So in that sense,part of the reason for our current account deficit is simply a reflection of the enthusiasm whichforeign institutions, companies, and indeed individuals have had for investing in New Zealand inrecent years.Some of this foreign investment has been in the form of so-called direct investment,involving a foreign company establishing a controlling interest in a New Zealand operation. As youknow, there has been a very large amount of investment of this kind going back over many years - inbanks, insurance companies, and manufacturing - while in recent years the rate of foreign directinvestment has, if anything, increased - in telecommunications, food processing, hotels, forestry,commercial property, and transport.In addition, there has been an increasing flow of so-called portfolio investment fromoverseas - non-controlling investment in New Zealand equities, a huge investment in New Zealanddollar government securities, and most recently a very large investment in New Zealand dollarsecurities issued by overseas corporations and governments, the Eurokiwi and Samurai bond issues.These Eurokiwi and Samurai issues have, through the swap market, provided New Zealand bankswith attractively priced fixed-term funding, keeping longer-term interest rates lower than they wouldotherwise have been and making possible the recent rapid growth in the fixed interest rate homemortgage market.New Zealanders’ enthusiasm for borrowingBut if this desire to invest in New Zealand on the part of foreigners had been thewhole story, we might have expected to see interest rates in New Zealand at levels equal to or evenbelow interest rates abroad, and asset prices - share prices in particular - at high levels by worldstandards as the impact of the abundant overseas capital swamped our small economy and readily metNew Zealanders’ demand for funds. Instead, while New Zealand interest rates have been very muchlower in recent years than would have been the case had there been no capital inflow, they havetended to be higher than those in major capital markets, whether measured in nominal terms or ininflation-adjusted terms. The prices of shares and commercial property have tended to increase moreslowly than those in many overseas countries. This suggests that, while foreign investors have beenhappy to provide capital, many have done so because New Zealand has offered unusually attractiveyields. What is striking is the willingness of New Zealanders to pay those yields. At least part of thereason must lie in a strong demand for additional funds within New Zealand.To some extent this demand has reflected strong investment activity in the corporatesector, as recent reforms have opened up profitable investment opportunities or have obligedcompanies to invest in cost-reducing facilities to improve their competitiveness. There has also been astrong cyclical recovery in investment spending after the 1991 recession. Strong investment spendingwidens the current account deficit in the short-term, but as long as that investment turns out to beprofitable, any foreign capital tapped to finance it - whether in the form of debt, new equity, orretained earnings - will create no problems. In fact, corporate balance sheets in New Zealand havegenerally remained healthy after the stresses of the late 1980s and early 1990s.BIS Review   8/1998
- 3 -But much of the demand for borrowed funds in recent years has come from thehousehold sector, and has been secured by that favourite New Zealand financial instrument, the housemortgage. This borrowing has taken the ratio of household debt to household disposable income froma relatively low 42 per cent as recently as mid-1990 to almost 90 per cent currently (Graph 1) - froma level which was relatively low by international standards to around the levels of indebtedness seenin places like the United States. It has also taken the share of loans extended to the household sectorfrom 31 per cent of total bank loans to 52 per cent of the total over the same period, an increase in thedollar amount from $16 billion to $50 billion in just seven years. As Graph 2 illustrates, lending bymajor financial institutions to the household sector has been growing markedly more quickly thannominal GDP throughout most of this decade.Some of the borrowing by the household sector has been undertaken as a relativelycheap and efficient way of funding small businesses owned by the household sector, and to thatdegree is ‘mislabelled’ as household sector borrowing. But for the most part, the rapid growth inhousehold indebtedness appears to have helped make possible the rapid rise in house prices seen inmuch of the country in recent years and, as employment, incomes, and wealth have risen, strongconsumption growth.Obviously, this sort of strong growth in lending to households cannot continueindefinitely, but while it does there is likely to be pressure on our external accounts. Credit, after all,is designed to allow us to increase our investment without sacrificing current consumption, oralternatively to increase consumption now in the expectation of higher income in the future. Both ofthese mean enjoying now a level of consumption beyond what is produced locally: and in simplifiedterms, that is what a current account deficit is.BIS Review   8/1998
- 4 -Other things being equal, a strong demand to borrow tends to push up interest rates. Itis those pressures which then draw in foreign capital. The capital inflow in turn tends to check theextent to which interest rates rise in response to the strong borrowing demand.The willingness of foreign investors to provide capital allows us, as a nation, muchgreater flexibility in making our own spending and investment decisions. But of course, the foreigninvestors expect to earn a return on the funds that they invest in New Zealand, and by using thoseforeign funds we are taking on an obligation to pay interest or dividends on the capital used, just aswe do when we use funds from a domestic source. If we use the capital unwisely, then wecompromise our future prospects, and that is no different when talking about four million people as agroup than it is when we talk about people individually.The lessons of AsiaThe key issue at the moment is whether a current account deficit approaching 8 percent of GDP, well above the 5 percent of GDP sometimes regarded as being dangerous, should be ofconcern. And the answer appears to be ‘not necessarily’. Singapore ran a current account deficitaveraging 10 per cent of GDP for 20 years from 1965 to 1985, while Canada ran a deficit whichexceeded 5 per cent of GDP for most of the 43 years from 1870 to 1913.But what about the recent lessons of Asia? What about the risk that foreign capitalmight suddenly flow out again, with disastrous consequences for New Zealand banks, New Zealandcorporates, and the New Zealand dollar? Indeed, hasn’t the New Zealand dollar already been draggeddown because of foreign concerns about our links with Asia?Let me correct one misapprehension at once. Yes, as of the middle of this week, theNew Zealand dollar had declined by some 17 per cent against the US dollar since 1 January 1997, butthis is closely similar to the extent to which the Australian dollar had declined against the US dollarover the same period (15 per cent), and was from levels at which the New Zealand dollar was widelyBIS Review   8/1998
- 5 -regarded as being significantly over-valued. In fact, virtually all currencies have depreciated againstthe US dollar over the last year or so. This is simply another way of saying that the US dollar hasitself appreciated against virtually all currencies. By comparison to the 10 to 20 per cent depreciationof most currencies, including the New Zealand dollar, against the US dollar, the currencies of manyEast Asian countries have fallen very much more sharply - by 44 per cent in the case of Malaysia, by50 per cent in the case of South Korea, by 52 per cent in the case of Thailand, and by 84 per cent inthe case of Indonesia. Neither New Zealand nor Australia has had an experience even remotelysimilar.It is worth looking briefly at some of the factors which have provoked recentproblems in Asia because understanding these factors helps in understanding why the sorts of viciouscorrections we have witnessed in Asia are not likely to happen here.There appear to have been three factors in particular which caused what seemedinitially like a localised currency crisis in Thailand to spread so quickly to embrace many parts ofAsia:*First, a serious lack of transparency in many Asian countries and markets,which made it difficult for investors to assess and understand the risks theywere assuming, and which contributed to the speed at which confidencecollapsed as soon as bad news began to appear.*Second, fairly widespread evidence of poor credit evaluation by banks andother intermediaries, perhaps in part a result of the often-close connectionsbetween governments, banks, and big business, and in part a result ofover-confidence and carelessness borne of decades of strong economicgrowth. (Paul Krugman has suggested that the willingness of banks to take onhigh credit risks was in large part the result of the perception that theliabilities of banks were effectively government-guaranteed, and that themoral hazard created by this perception was itself the cause of grosslyinadequate credit evaluation.)*Third, the widespread maintenance of pegged exchange rates, whichcompromised the ability of the countries concerned to maintain adequatemonetary control when faced with very large capital inflows, and whichseriously complicated financial management when problems began to emerge.New Zealand different from Asia in several crucial respectsOf course, capital could flow out of New Zealand, and it would be a brave (orfoolhardy) central banker these days who would claim ‘it can’t happen here’. Foreign investors coulddecide to sell-up and leave New Zealand, and indeed New Zealand investors could do likewise, in theabsence of any controls preventing them from doing so. But I don’t think we are afflicted by any ofthe particular Asian problems I have just mentioned.To begin with, a rapid outflow of capital is very unlikely if the policy frameworkremains sound and transparent and if those who are the recipients of the foreign capital inflow remaincreditworthy.In that regard, there is no sign of the policy framework here being changed. Almostall political parties are committed to the retention of the current transparent and independentmonetary policy framework, established without dissentient vote in Parliament in 1989. Almost allpolitical parties recognise the importance of continuing to run fiscal surpluses at this stage of thedemographic cycle, and the high level of fiscal transparency is simply not a political issue at all.Almost all political parties are committed to an internationally open and competitive economy.BIS Review   8/1998
- 6 -And as far as creditworthiness is concerned, one of the major ‘borrowers’ - to theextent that foreign investors have bought New Zealand dollar government securities on the NewZealand market - is the government itself. The government has become markedly more creditworthyin recent years, as the ratio of net public sector debt has declined from around 52 per cent of GDP inthe early 1990s to some 27 per cent currently. In the private sector, banks have on averagestrengthened their total capital position since the beginning of the decade, and all registered bankscomfortably exceeded both the tier 1 and total capital ratios prescribed by international agreement asat the last date for which we have complete data (30 September 1997). All but two of the banks arerated by one or more of the international credit rating agencies, with the four largest banks allenjoying an S&P rating of AA- or better. In addition, of course, almost all the banks operating inNew Zealand have the backing of financially strong overseas parent banks. Among corporates,balance sheets are probably as strong as they have been at any time in the last two decades. It is in thehousehold sector that balance sheets are probably becoming most extended, after seven or eight yearsof strong borrowing, but international creditors are protected from potential bad debt problems in thatsector by the fact that the foreign capital which has, in effect, been lent to ordinary householdborrowers has been channelled through the banking system, and, as indicated, our banks are in robustcondition.So there seems little reason for any sudden loss of confidence leading to capital flight.Secondly, even if there were to be a sudden flight, leading to a sharp depreciation inthe New Zealand dollar, the result would be very different in one important respect from what wehave seen in some Asian countries in recent months. In those Asian countries currency weakness ledto very serious problems because, previously, as I have noted, currencies had been actually orvirtually pegged to the US dollar. This led borrowers to take on large unhedged US dollar liabilities -these looked very cheap at the time and, with the explicit or implicit guarantee that there would be nocurrency depreciation, devoid of currency risk. When as so often happens the countries concernedwere forced to abandon their peg to the US dollar and the currencies fell sharply as a consequence,the losses which both banks and corporates sustained were often huge, threatening many of themwith insolvency and collapse. (Indeed, the losses were magnified because, with sharply increasedliabilities expressed in local currencies, borrowers rushed to sell assets, which tended to push downasset prices sharply as well.) These large losses in turn tended to further reduce investor confidence,and accelerate the capital outflow.By contrast, much of the foreign capital inflow into New Zealand has been either inthe form of equity investments, with no currency risk borne by the company receiving the capital, orin the form of New Zealand dollar borrowings, by government and banks. The quarterly disclosurestatements published by New Zealand banks show that they have little in the way of unhedgedforeign exchange positions and, although I do not have detailed information on which to make adogmatic assertion, I would be fairly confident that the unhedged foreign exchange liabilities of NewZealand corporates are very small. They have been operating for too long in a freely floatingexchange rate environment to be unaware of the risks, and indeed some still recall the losses theysustained by borrowing in low interest foreign currencies in the 1970s and 1980s when the NewZealand dollar itself was pegged.A third point to note is that, if a capital outflow did occur, interest rates would risesharply as a result and it is very likely that the combination of sharply lower exchange rate andmarkedly higher interest rates would quite quickly reduce the current account deficit. The ReserveBank might well be blamed for the sharp rise in interest rates, and to be sure we would not be at allopposed to such an increase since if the exchange rate fell sharply a marked increase in interest rateswould be needed to keep inflation under control. But it is also true that, unless the Bank moved topump money into the economy aggressively, any sharp outflow of capital, whether owned byforeigners or owned by New Zealanders, would necessarily result in a sharp increase in interest rates,BIS Review   8/1998
- 7 -since those selling New Zealand securities and other assets would be forced to increase the yieldsoffered on those assets in order to encourage others to buy them.In other words, with a floating exchange rate, investors (whether foreign or local)wishing to sell out of New Zealand assets or the New Zealand dollar need to find private sectorbuyers to sell to. The central bank is not going to be supporting the price of the New Zealand dollar,or of New Zealand bonds, or of New Zealand shares.And of course, although capital outflow can alter the price of assets, foreign corporateowners can not take the land and buildings which they own with them. Those assets would remain inNew Zealand, with their ownership changing from foreign to local.Whether or not an outflow of capital was ‘painful’ and disruptive would depend verymuch on the magnitude and speed of the outflow. If, as seems quite unlikely, it happened on a largescale and over a short period, the adjustment could involve markedly higher interest rates. Companiesexposed to interest rates and not benefiting from the fall in the exchange rate would be put underpressure, and some might well collapse, notwithstanding their currently-strong balance sheets. Thiswould be part of the process of reducing the current account deficit, as resources were displaced fromdomestic or non-tradeable parts of the economy and enticed back into exporting andimport-replacement industries. Household borrowers, especially those with variable rate mortgages,could also face some very sharp adjustments to their spending patterns.So the deficit is not a matter for alarm, but we should not be complacent.So in answer to my first question, namely, whether our large current account deficitmatters, my answer is that it isn’t a matter for great alarm at present. The deficit in part reflectsinternational enthusiasm for investing in New Zealand, and in part a judgement by many thousands ofNew Zealanders that there are attractive investment opportunities in New Zealand which are worthpursuing with borrowed funds (especially in the housing sector) and perhaps a judgement that futureincomes will rise sufficiently rapidly to support a higher level of consumption spending now. Thereare market mechanisms which generally succeed in reconciling the intentions of individualhouseholds and firms with the interests of the nation as a whole. Some other countries haveexperienced similarly large deficits for years on end without ill effect, although it is not common tosustain for too many years a large current account deficit, in a floating exchange rate regime, withoutparticularly high GDP growth rates.Moreover, we are well placed to weather any capital outflow which might eventuate.While a current account deficit of about the present size was associated with a foreign exchange crisisin 1984, that situation was one where the Government was trying to maintain a fixed exchange rateagainst a widespread belief that the exchange rate was over-valued. Today, with the exchange ratefreely floating and able to adjust, month to month and hour to hour, to reflect changes in demand andsupply, the situation is fundamentally different.But we should not be complacent. The size of our accumulated external liabilitiesdoes, as the IMF has suggested, make us somewhat vulnerable to unpredictable external shocks, or toa sudden loss of confidence for whatever reason. It puts a premium on maintaining the confidence ofmarkets that New Zealand remains a safe place in which to invest, and means that the quality andtransparency of economic and financial sector policies are crucial. In a situation where much of thecapital inflow has, in effect, found its way into financing consumption, higher house prices, andresidential investment, rather than into much higher investment in directly growth-enhancing sectors,we would be unwise to assume that we can sustain a deficit at around current levels indefinitely.Much will depend on the rates of economic growth we are able to sustain: the results in recent yearshave been encouraging, but to adopt a cricketing analogy, the innings is really just getting underway.BIS Review   8/1998
- 8 -If we want to reduce the deficit, what needs to be done?If as a country we want to reduce our vulnerability to external shocks by reducing firstour current account deficit and then, over time, our high ratio of net external liabilities to GDP, howcould this be done?The first point to reiterate perhaps is the one which the Corden/Pitchford/Friedmanschool would probably make, and that is that, because the public sector is in surplus, our currentaccount deficit reflects decisions being made in the private sector to take on more liabilities. This willnot continue indefinitely, since at some point we are likely to find either borrowers deciding that theyhave taken on enough debt or lenders making that decision for them! New Zealand has already seen avery strong increase in the ratio of household debt to household disposable income, as already noted.This has seemed prudent to thousands of New Zealanders, partly because house prices have increasedstrongly in recent years. And while to some extent it does make sense to anticipate future incomegrowth, the ratio of house prices to incomes is currently at historically high levels - the sort of levelsreached in the mid-1970s, just before the very sharp fall in real house prices in the second half of thatdecade, or in the United Kingdom before the savage correction in the late 1980s and early 1990s. IfNew Zealand house prices were to falter, even more if they were to fall back somewhat over the nextyear or two, as several commentators are now suggesting is very likely, we could quite quickly see arapid slow-down in the growth of household sector borrowing followed by a down-turn in investmentin housing and a rather broader slowdown in consumer spending. This would in turn quite quicklyproduce a reasonably rapid reduction in the current account deficit, both as the demand for importsfell away and as the profitability of foreign companies operating in New Zealand dropped. Anypolicy issue would disappear.But supposing this does not happen in the near future. Are there measures whichpolicy-makers should be considering to reduce the deficit?We know from long and bitter past experience that imposing direct controls onimports is no solution. Unless matched by measures to reduce domestic spending power, consumersinitially spend on items other than controlled imports in such a way that exports tend to be reducedand other imports increased. The balance of payments is not helped. Moreover, in time New Zealandproducers invest in the production of the items subject to import controls, and since these items arealmost by the nature of the case expensive to make in New Zealand, productivity suffers and efficientexporters are severely hindered. There is no solution in trying to license or control imports.The key challenge: how to increase national savingsSince at root a balance-of-payments deficit is an excess of investment over saving,any attempt to reduce the deficit must either look to reduce investment or to increase saving. I willassume that reducing investment is hardly an attractive policy option given the constant pressure for ahigher standard of living and more jobs, which leaves us with the question of how to increase savingsin New Zealand. And I can’t stress too strongly that, fundamentally, reducing the current accountdeficit is ultimately about how we might increase total national savings relative to nationalinvestment.For a great many years, the public sector was a net dis-saver in New Zealand, asindeed it still is in most countries in the world. This was reflected in a considerable build-up in netpublic sector debt, to a peak of some 52 per cent of GDP in the early 1990s, as I have alreadymentioned. Partly as a result of the sale of government assets but mainly, since 1993/94, as a result ofrunning budget surpluses, debt has been roughly halved in relation to GDP and at the present time thepublic sector is making a contribution of some 1.5 per cent of GDP to our total national saving effort.This is a very much better performance than that of virtually any other developed country (theBIS Review   8/1998
- 9 -exception, as to so much else, is Singapore), but it is a markedly smaller contribution to nationalsaving than the public sector was making in, say, 1995/96. In that year public sector saving amountedto 3.7 per cent of GDP. So in the last couple of years the trend in public sector saving has beenunhelpful in terms of the balance-of-payments deficit, a reflection of a strong increase in public sectorspending over the last two years and a reduction in tax rates. One way of reducing thebalance-of-payments deficit might be to increase the public sector surplus again, although nobodyshould under-estimate the difficulties of doing that in a country where pressure to increasegovernment expenditure is relentless.New Zealand’s record of household sector savings seems to have been relatively poorfor many years. There have doubtless been many reasons for this. In the high inflation 1970s andearly 1980s, when many interest rates were controlled at artificially low levels, the after-tax realreturn on savings invested in fixed interest securities was strongly negative, creating a strongdisincentive to save. This situation changed markedly in the mid-1980s, with positive after-tax realinterest rates, but at about the same time financial sector liberalisation greatly increased the ability ofmany households to borrow; this too almost certainly discouraged net saving. And of course for mostof the last half century New Zealanders have been encouraged to believe that the things for whichpeople save up in many other countries - education, medical care, and retirement - would largely betaken care of by government. We were effectively told: you don’t need to save and, by the way, ifyou do, you’re a fool, because government-sourced inflation will steal a large chunk of what you saveanyway.I’m frankly not sure how this culture of low household-sector saving can be changed.Clearly there is a significant section of the community that has no surplus income at all. To suggestthat a solo parent living on benefit has scope for increased saving is absurd, and would bepresumptuous in the extreme coming from me. But it is also true that too many New Zealanders onhigher incomes still have attitudes to their personal finances that only made sense in the high inflation1970s and early-1980s. The mind-set was that only a fool had personal savings, and the quick and theclever were in debt up to their eyeballs. Indeed, those attitudes were sensible from an individual’spoint of view, with negative real interest rates and rising asset prices. Those attitudes no longer makesense.Part of the problem in recent years may have been the less-than-ideal mix of monetaryconditions, with interest rates too low to encourage saving or discourage borrowing and with theexchange rate too high to allow the export and import-competing sectors to grow. This mix ofmonetary conditions was particularly unhelpful when most of the inflation pressures were in thedomestic parts of the economy, especially the housing sector, and not in the export andimport-competing sectors. The Reserve Bank began to tighten monetary policy early in 1994 to headoff the inflationary pressures which we projected at that time. By the end of that year, 90 day interestrates had risen from around 4.5 per cent in January to close to 10 per cent, while the exchange ratehad increased from 57 on the trade-weighted index (TWI) to 60. Through the next nine quarters, tothe end of March 1997, interest rates never went much above 10 per cent, but the exchange ratecontinued to increase until the TWI reached 69. As a consequence, lending by major financialinstitutions to the private sector continued growing at rates more than double that of nominal GDPgrowth. In other words, although the exchange rate was putting great pressure on the exposed parts ofthe economy, interest rates were not nearly high enough to restrain a huge surge in private sectorborrowing.But hold on, you may be saying. Don’t we have some of the highest inflation-adjustedinterest rates in the developed world? And so we do, if one compares interest rates with inflation inthe CPI. But of course few of us borrow to buy the goods and services in the CPI basket. Rather,most of us borrow to buy assets, and particularly real estate. And when our interest rates arecompared with changes in an index of house prices, as shown in Graph 3, it can be seen that ourBIS Review   8/1998
- 10 -mortgage interest rates adjusted by house price inflation have been very low in recent years, and wellbelow those in Australia. For whatever reason, our real interest rates have not been seen asparticularly high by New Zealanders - despite all the protests to the contrary. If they had seemedhigh, we would not have been increasing our borrowings by 10 to 15 per cent per annum, and wewould have been increasing our saving. As noted earlier, the ratio of household debt to householddisposable income has more than doubled over the last seven years, and most of this increase has hadnothing to do with buying food and other necessities.However, central banks have very limited ability to influence the mix of monetaryconditions. This is ultimately determined by the decisions of countless thousands of individualinvestors here and abroad, and by the actions and expected actions of other central banks.As I have acknowledged previously, we gave some consideration when the exchangerate was at its peak in early 1997 to undertaking some form of so-called sterilised intervention in anattempt to reduce the exchange rate and increase interest rates - without risk to the inflationobjective - since most of the inflationary pressures were coming from sectors relatively immune fromexchange rate pressure but more susceptible, we believed, to interest rate pressure. But most of theinternational evidence suggests that such sterilised intervention has little lasting effect unless it issimply a precursor to an easing of overall monetary policy.I believe that the introduction of the Monetary Conditions Index in December 1996may have helped to change the mix of monetary conditions to some extent by eliminating theimpression which had grown up that we had an exchange rate target as well as an inflation target, buteven this is by no means certain.If the central bank can not do much to improve our national saving performance,could the Government do more? I have already mentioned the importance of the Government itselfcontinuing to run fiscal surpluses. There are almost certainly other policies which would have aneffect on private sector saving performance.BIS Review   8/1998
- 11 -For example, there may be some scope to further reduce our relatively heavydependence on raising government revenue from the taxation of income, in favour of relativelygreater reliance on taxes on expenditure, thus increasing the incentive to produce and save.Unfortunately, there is very little evidence that specific tax incentives for saving would increaseoverall private sector saving (as distinct from changing its form), and some evidence that nationalsaving would actually be diminished by such incentives, because of the cost to public sector savingsof providing the tax incentives.There is probably an on-going need to encourage New Zealanders to take moreresponsibility for their own future, though how this can be done after so many decades ofencouraging them to believe that doing so is entirely unnecessary is a political challenge of mammothproportions. At very least there is a pressing need for a multi-party consensus both to reassure NewZealanders that future governments will be able to provide a basic safety net for all in retirement, andto make it clear that those wanting a more comfortable lifestyle in retirement need to start savingnow.There is also the superficially attractive option of attempting to widen the gap betweenNew Zealand interest rates and those overseas through some direct policy measures. If this could beachieved, the argument runs, New Zealand interest rates could be driven up to the point where NewZealanders were encouraged to kick the borrowing habit without provoking a huge inflow of foreigncapital and the related increase in the current account deficit. This is a route which Chile, forexample, has followed, requiring a part of all monies borrowed overseas to be deposited for one yearin a non-interest-bearing account with the central bank. Others have noted the possibility ofreintroducing a withholding tax on interest payments to foreigners. Such proposals should be treatedvery cautiously. Not only would there be significant administrative problems in ensuring compliancewith such measures but the longer-term costs of undermining investor confidence in New Zealand’scommitment to free and open capital markets would weigh heavily against any possible shorter-termadjustment gains.Alas, none of the possible policy changes to encourage private sector saving - orreduce private sector borrowing - is politically easy. But then living beyond our means carries risksas well. I myself do not think that these risks are terribly large at present, but the longer we continueliving beyond our means, the greater those risks become.New Zealand is relatively prosperous, is well-endowed with educated people, and hasnatural resources which many others would give their eye teeth for. It is not obvious to me that weshould be content to be a heavy user of the savings of others indefinitely, especially when asignificant part of those foreign savings is being used not to generate faster economic growth butsimply to buy ourselves larger houses.BIS Review   8/1998
Mr. Hartmann reviews the standardisation in cross-border payments in thelight of European economic and monetary union   Speech by Mr. Wendelin Hartmann, amember of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank, on the occasion of the EMI Seminar onStandardisation - The case of cross-border transfers, held in Frankfurt/Main on 30/1/98.The European Monetary Institute has organised a seminar on a topic with which Ihave become very closely associated during the many years that I have been working at theDeutsche Bundesbank and my time as Chairman of the Working Group on EU PaymentSystems. The focal point of my work has always been in the field of organisation and in what isgenerally called “controlling” these days. Success in organising and managing means runningoperations quickly, safely and cost-effectively: in short, efficiently. To do this one requiresstandard frameworks within which those participating in the system in their respectiveenterprises can interact, standard procedural components, standard specifications and basictechnical conditions: in short, standards on whose application the participants are in agreementor which they are committed to use. This statement will have taken on a special meaning at theEuropean level, too, by the beginning of stage 3 of economic and monetary union. I amtherefore pleased to have the opportunity to speak to you today about my view of the issuesconcerning the standardisation of payments in Europe and of the role of the European System ofCentral Banks (ESCB) in this area.From January 1, 1999 the EU central banks will be required to use the euro as aunit of account. TARGET, the large-value payment system, will support the reliableimplementation of the monetary policy of the European Central Bank and will process paymentsin euros. The national RTGS systems of the central banks will be linked internationally throughan Interlinking component called the “Interlinking system”. The SWIFT network will be used atfirst as a communications network. All countries within the euro area will be able to participatein TARGET. EU member countries outside the euro area will likewise be able to participate inTARGET provided their national RTGS systems are able to handle the euro as a foreigncurrency in addition to handling their respective national currency. The credit institutions andtheir customers will convert to the euro successively at a date chosen by themselves. The creditinstitutions and the central banks will therefore incorporate conversion procedures into theiraccounting and payment systems. These will make it possible to convert transactionsautomatically prior to booking or before they are fed into a payment system, thus enabling theparallel use of two currency units. The means of achieving this vary from one European countryto another. You can well imagine that all of these plans would be impossible without intensiveconsultation at national and international level, and consultation here means agreeing onstandards.Using TARGET for settling payment transactions has also given rise to newquality requirements with respect to securities settlement systems. Monetary policy operationsand the collateralisation of intra-day credit with the purpose of fostering the smooth functioningof the payment system require the final and unconditional transfer of collateral prior to thegranting of the credit concerned if the central banks are to be protected against credit risks. Asthe settlement of the cash leg of these transactions is done via TARGET, correspondingly tighttime schedules have also to be applied to the settlement of securities transactions. Adevelopment similar to the RTGS systems at the national level and TARGET at the internationallevel would therefore be extremely desirable to support the European money and capitalmarkets. The national and international central securities depositories are currently cooperatingon the preparation of a model to link their respective systems. Whether an EU-wide network ofcentral securities depositories can be set up by the beginning of stage 3 of EMU is still uncertain.The central banks will carry correspondent safe custody accounts on a mutual basis for a limitedBIS Review   7/1998
- 2 -period so that the cross-border use of collateral will be possible. However, market solutions willhave to be sought in the long term. I am confident that the central securities depositories will besuccessful in achieving that in cooperation with ourselves.With this in mind the European Monetary Institute submitted, at the beginning ofthe month, a list of requirements which it had worked out in cooperation with the EU centralbanks and which contains standards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in ESCBcredit operations in stage 3 of monetary union.1 These new standards have to be met by allsecurities settlement systems which are to be used for the respective transactions with the ESCB.At this juncture I would, of course, also like to draw your attention to the previous EMIpublications on the operational framework for the single monetary policy,2 the generaldocumentation on monetary policy instruments and procedures3 and, naturally, especially thoseon TARGET.4The EU central banks are only marginally involved, if at all, in cross-border retailpayment transactions, another field which also includes electronic money. It is generally agreedthat these payments should continue to be primarily commercial transactions and are thereforenot subject to the general technical preparations for monetary union. This means that theEuropean commercial banks will be all the more dependent on an early agreement on thetechnical standards which are probably indispensable for competitive cross-border retailpayment systems. There is no doubt that as a result of these standards cross-border retailpayments in the single market will be more efficient and cheaper.As these examples show, the standards that are relevant to payment transactionsconsist of general legal norms regulating structures and procedures, thus forming a basis whichensures that business operations are at least of a minimum quality. National legislators and otherlegislating authorities are responsible for this type of standardisation. They themselves set, makepossible or limit procedural standards from, for example, competitive aspects through legalnorms and legal interpretation. I would now like to concentrate on payment system standardsthat are suitable for operational use and that have been developed - usually by private operators -on the basis of the procedural standards I have just mentioned.The main objective of standardising operational procedures should always be toachieve the maximum degree of rationalisation for all participants while retaining competition                                                  1.

- 3 -with respect to terms and conditions. What this means in practice is the creation of efficientbusiness processes through the use of standard components such as data records and, ultimately,the use of standard comprehensive procedures themselves. This makes it possible - especially inpayment systems - to achieve economies of scale and straight-through-processing. In addition tothat interface problems can be reduced and, as a result, the costly conversion into other standardscan be avoided. Standard data formats (e.g. SWIFT and EDIFACT), address codes (e.g. bankcode numbers, BIC and IBAN) and communication protocols (e.g. ISO/FTAM) as well as thestandard general procedural arrangements and legal frameworks are examples of how suchobjectives can be achieved.As far as procedures relating to applications are concerned, there is no doubt thatthe banking industry deserves credit for standardisation issues being tackled enthusiastically andsuccessfully. This has often been done in close cooperation with the central banks and theEuropean banking associations (e.g. the ECBS). I hope that the European Central Bank will alsotake part in this in future. Today’s event suggests that it will.I think it is important to refer here, too, to the industrial standards that support ourbusiness and that have become essential pillars of the systems we use: there is no doubt thatSWIFT, which is probably de facto the only globally accepted payments standard, is the mainone to mention here. No less effective, however, are the respective national standards in eachcountry, for example, the DIN standards of the Deutsches Institut für Normung and, on a worldbasis, the international standards, for example, the internationally accepted ISO standards of theInternational Standardisation Organisation, which are being incorporated into national standards.I would like to draw your attention in particular to the internationally standardised data transfervia ISO/FTAM protocols and electronic mail by means of the ISO/OSI X.400 standard formessage handling systems. These systems are also used in the German gross and net paymentsystems. When supplemented by the protocols of the TCP/IP family (Transmission ControlProtocol/Internet Protocol), they will play a “translator” role between the business applicationsunder the different IT conditions of the various central banks in the future communicationsnetwork of the ESCB.Thus, we already have an excellent set of instruments and suitable means ofachieving standardisation. So what is still missing in practice in cross-border payments inEurope? What else can and should be done? There have been complaints about the time requiredto execute payments and about the transparency of procedures used in retail payment systems.Implementing the transparency directive of the EU Commission will possibly help here. In thestandards relating to applications in this payment sector, however, we have a large number ofprocedures which still confuse the user and which, generally speaking, are relatively inefficient.If I now add electronic money on chip cards or network money to my list, I think the absence inmany cases of internationally applicable standards is precisely what is hampering the spread oftechnical innovations and the speed of European integration. As far as the cross-border use ofdebit cards is concerned, a commendable start has been made here, and these efforts have beensuccessful. Perhaps we are therefore justified in thinking that progress will soon be made in theother areas for which solutions have not yet been found such as the interoperability of e-moneysystems. Such progress would be desirable in achieving a standard European direct debits systemas well. Different national legal frameworks, customs and experience naturally do not make iteasy to achieve common standards. Even the security systems in payment transactions are stilllargely nationally oriented. In the end, the absence of common standards, and not just for retailpayments, results in a de facto isolation of national payment systems. In the long run thatcertainly cannot be in Europe’s interest because for the participating banks and their customers itBIS Review   7/1998
- 4 -can only compound the problem of segmented markets with little transparency but withrelatively high prices and a low degree of efficiency.What conclusion are we to draw from all of this? The status quo ofstandardisation in Europe’s cross-border payment systems is hardly satisfactory. There is nodoubt that what we require is a simple, that is to say, a standardised, form of access to thenational systems within the EU from other countries. The European central banks, and thebanking industry, have shown that it is possible to build bridges in the first instance to linknational systems to each other. Bridging standards reduce the national conversion cost to the costof using this standard instead of a large number of national ones. I am thinking here of theInterlinking system in TARGET and, with respect to retail payments, of, for example, TIPANETof the cooperative bank sector or S-Interpay of the savings bank sector. Further progress couldthen be achieved, for example, by stepping up the consistent use of international standards andthe ECBS norms, which are not dependent on specific formats, for the national side of settlingcross-border payments, that is to say, by using them in the country in which the principal isdomiciled and in the country of the ultimate beneficiary. In my opinion, there is an urgent needfor action in the field of retail payments. I very much prefer a market-oriented approach. As faras possible, the banking industry and the central banks should reach voluntary agreements onefficient cross-border payments. These agreements can be amended more easily and moreefficiently to meet the momentous developments in payment systems than, for example,payments legislation could. The work on European integration in payments, however, must beaccompanied by a harmonisation of the legal frameworks, which in some cases still containenormous differences. This work must be done by the legislating bodies. The Directive onsettlement finality which the EU Commission is in the process of passing legislation on andwhich is designed to remove the possibility of national bankruptcy law having an effect onpayments and settlement systems is a very important step here. However, there are still a numberof other obstacles to be cleared away, for example, those adversely affecting progress inestablishing a standard European direct debit system. However, the central banks could take overan active role as coordinator provided the European banking industry were in agreement.Criticism is sometimes heard to the effect that standardisation and the formationof cartels in payments are undermining competition. I do not think this is true as long as thetechnical standards do not adversely affect competition with respect to terms and conditions. It istrue that standardisation leads to restrictions in operational freedom. A bank can no longer actexactly as it wishes. In the end, however, standardisation tends to foster competition on atransparent platform which is technically uniform.EDIFACT is possibly an example of a system in which efforts at standardisationmay also be limited. This standard, which in my opinion is splendid, broadly-based andapplicable in various sectors of the economy, has only had moderate success in being applied inpayment transactions. The credit institutions in Germany have agreed to admit the EDIFACTformat as a standard in addition to the national DTA format and the SWIFT formats in interbankcredit transfers. I think that the pressure from the large enterprises to find as many applicationsfor this effective standard as possible has created problems with respect to its acceptability andimplementation among those concerned. The payment systems component directly affecting usis only a small part of the entire application spectrum. Only time will tell whether there has beensuccess in establishing this very consistent standard for process control. It could be argued in thefirst instance that in any case different individual, national and international needs call for acorresponding plurality of systems even in payment transactions. In my opinion, however, itwould be better in the long term to strive for a maximum degree of standardisation with the aimof creating uniform effective payment standards at least throughout Europe. The resultantBIS Review   7/1998

The implementation of monetary policy and a satisfactorilyfunctioning economy require efficient payment systems. According to Article 3 of the ESCB’sStatute, one of the functions of the ESCB is therefore to promote the smooth functioning of thepayment systems. Article 22 of the ESCB’s Statute actually gives the future ECB the right tomake regulations to ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems within theCommunity and with other countries. To that extent there may be a fairly reasonable distributionof functions within the ESCB in line with the subsidiarity principle laid down in the MaastrichtTreaty.The ECB and the national central banks could be asked to act as intermediaries orcoordinators for the banking industry in standardisation matters concerning payments. The factthat central banks may also be seen by the banking industry to be competitors in some cases,namely in large-value payment systems, has not proved to be a problem so far. Providing aservice of a neutral nature in relation to the various banking groups has always been a functionof the central banks. The banking industry and the national central banks have cooperatedsuccessfully for years to devise and implement rules and systems for executing payments. I amtherefore optimistic that the industry will continue to do this in cooperation with the ECB infuture. The way the preparatory work for payment systems in stage 3 of monetary union hasgone so far confirms my opinion. Let us therefore meet the challenges that lie before us withenthusiasm and confidence.Ladies and gentlemen, I expect that this seminar will provide important insightsinto the possibilities of improved cooperation in the field of standardisation between the EUCommission, the European banking associations and the central depositories, on the one hand,and the future ESCB, on the other. I am convinced that the undisputed objective of an efficientEuropean financial market cannot be achieved without successful standardisation.BIS Review   7/1998
Mr. Greenspan comments on the current direction of the US economy andthe fiscal situation in the United States   Testimony by the Chairman of the Board of theUS Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Committee on the Budget of theUS Senate on 29/1/98.Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, in just a few weeks, the FederalReserve Board will submit its semiannual report on monetary policy to the Congress. Thatreport, and my accompanying testimony, will give a detailed assessment of the outlook for theUS. economy and the implications for monetary policy. This morning, I would like to directmost of my comments to the fiscal situation. But let me begin by offering a few observationsabout the current direction of the economy.First, it is clear that the U.S. economy has been exceptionally healthy, with robustgains in output, employment, and income. At the same time, inflation has remained low --indeed, declining by most measures -- over the past year.Second, to date, we have as yet experienced only the peripheral winds of theAsian crisis. But before spring is over, the abrupt current-account adjustments that financialdifficulties are forcing upon several of our Asian trading partners will be showing through herein reductions in demand for our exports and intensified competition from imports. All of thissuggests that the growth of economic activity in this country will moderate from the recent briskpace.Third, as I’ve noted previously, such a moderation would appear helpful at thisjuncture. The growth of output has caused employment to rise much faster than the working-agepopulation and there are limits to how far this can go. Pressures in the labor market likelycontributed to the acceleration of wages in recent months. Since price inflation has been minimaland domestic profit margins firm, productivity appears to have accelerated sufficiently last yearto damp increases in unit labor costs. How long that pattern can continue is still an unresolvedissue. The likelihood that we shall be seeing some lower prices on imported goods as a result ofthe difficulties in Asia may afford some breathing room from inflation pressures. But they willnot permanently suppress the risks inherent in tightened labor markets. Conversely, acontinuation of the Asian crisis should give us pause in assuming that our economy will remainrobust indefinitely. As a consequence, we must be vigilant to the re-emergence of destabilizinginfluences -- both higher inflation, and shortfalls in demand and decreases in some prices thatwould press the disinflation process too far, too fast.One very favorable aspect of our economic performance over the past few yearshas been the remarkable improvement in the federal budget picture. The deficit dropped to itslowest level in more than two decades in fiscal 1997, and yesterday the Congressional BudgetOffice released projections that show the budget remaining essentially in balance over the nextfew years, moving to annual surpluses equal to 1 percent of GDP by the middle of the nextdecade. The reduction in federal borrowing to date and in prospect is already paying off for theU.S. economy by helping hold down long-term interest rates and, in turn, providing support toprivate capital spending and other interest-sensitive outlays.But much hard work remains to be done to ensure that the projected surplusesactually materialize and that we remain on track to address our longer-run fiscal anddemographic challenges. The CBO projections provide a good starting point: They are based onsensible economic and technical assumptions and thus offer a reasonable indication of how thebudget is likely to evolve over the next 10 years if economic conditions remain favorable andBIS Review   6/1998
- 2 -current budgetary policies remain in place. But, as CBO highlights in its latest report, suchforecasts are subject to considerable error. Indeed, as recently as last winter, when fiscal 1997was already well under way, both CBO and OMB were still overestimating that year’s deficit bymore than $100 billion.In the case of CBO, about two-thirds of the error was in receipts, including nearly$50 billion more tax receipts than would have been expected based on the actual behavior ofincome as measured in the national income and product accounts. This overage helped lift thereceipts share of GDP to an historical high. Such “tax surprises” are nothing new -- in fact, inthe early 1990s, growth of receipts fell well short of expectations based on the trends inaggregate income and the tax laws then in place. And, even after the fact, our knowledge aboutthe sources of such surprises has been limited. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that theforces behind last year’s tax surge will prove transitory and dissipate more rapidly than CBO hasassumed, implying lower receipts and renewed deficits for the years ahead. Indeed, all elseequal, had the surprise fallen on the other side -- downward instead of upward -- we would belooking at non-trivial budget deficits at least through the beginning of the coming decade.Moreover, the CBO projection assumes that discretionary spending will be held tothe statutory caps, which allow almost no growth in nominal outlays through fiscal 2002. Giventhe declining support for further reductions in defense spending, keeping overall discretionaryspending within the caps is likely to require sizable, but as yet unspecified, real declines innondefense programs from current levels. Not surprisingly, many observers are skeptical that thecaps will hold, and battles over appropriations in coming years may well expose deep divisionsthat could make the realization of the budget projections less likely. In addition, although lastyear’s legislation cut Medicare spending substantially, experience has highlighted the difficultyof controlling this program, raising the possibility that the savings will not be so great asanticipated -- especially if resistance develops among beneficiaries or providers.Uncertainties such as these argue for caution as you begin work on the 1999budget. We have no guarantee that the projected surpluses will actually materialize. An evenmore important consideration, though, is the need to address the erosion of the budget after thenext decade, a task that will become increasingly difficult the longer it is postponed. Thefavorable budget picture over the next decade, unless steps are taken, will almost inevitably turnto large and sustained deficits as the baby boom generation moves into retirement, puttingmassive strains on the social security and Medicare programs.Indeed, especially in light of these inexorable demographic trends, I have alwaysemphasized that we should be aiming for budgetary surpluses and using the proceeds to retireoutstanding federal debt. This would put further downward pressure on long-term interest rates,which would enhance private capital investment, labor productivity, and economic growth.The outpouring of proposals for using the anticipated surplus does not bode wellfor the prospect of maintaining fiscal discipline. In recent years the President and the Congresshave been quite successful, contrary to expectations, in placing, and especially holding, caps ondiscretionary spending. More recently, they have started to confront the budget implications ofthe surge in retirements that is only a decade away. We must not allow the recent good news onthe budget to lull us into letting down our guard. Although many of the individual budgetproposals may have merit, they must be considered in the context of a responsible budgetstrategy for the longer run.BIS Review   6/1998
- 3 -Over the decades our budgetary processes have been biased toward deficitspending. Indeed, those processes are strewn with initiatives that had only a small projectedbudgetary cost, but produced a sizable drain on the Treasury’s coffers over time. As you are wellaware, programs can be easy to initiate or expand, but extraordinarily difficult to trim or shutdown once a constituency develops that has a stake in maintaining the status quo.In closing, I want to commend Chairman Domenici and the committee for yourinsistence on fiscal responsibility and for years of persistent effort. Your work has contributedimportantly to shrinking the budget deficit and bringing surpluses within sight. Theseprojections of surpluses, which are based on an extrapolation of steady economic growth andsubdued inflation over the coming years, implicitly assume that monetary and fiscalpolicymakers will remain attentive to potential sources of instability. If this is the scenario that,in fact, unfolds and the budget moves into surplus within the next few years, the increase innational saving will pay off handsomely in preparing our economy and our budget for thechallenges of the twenty-first century.BIS Review   6/1998
Mr. Bäckström reports on inflation and the interest rate in Sweden   Speechby the Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Urban Bäckström, at a conference organised by theStockholm Chamber of Commerce and Veckans Affärer in Stockholm on 27/1/98.Thank you for the invitation to talk at this conference about the outlook forinflation and the interest rate. It is now five years since the inflation target was instituted; sobefore considering the current situation for monetary policy, I should like to say somethingabout the intervening period.Five years with an inflation targetIn January 1993 the Riksbank’s Governing Board decided to adopt an explicittarget for inflation and specified that as of 1995 and measured in terms of the consumer priceindex, the rate of inflation was to be limited to 2 per cent, with a tolerance interval of ±1percentage point.The commitment to an inflation target originated from the Riksbank but both theGovernment and the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) expressly support monetary policy’s focuson price stability as well as the inflation target. Last year five of the political parties in theRiksdag agreed that the Riksbank’s objective, to safeguard the value of money, should have theforce of law; a Government bill with provisions to this effect was presented to the Riksdag inNovember. In recent years, monetary policy’s commitment to low inflation has thus beenestablished increasingly firmly.Inflation target and transparencyWhen the Riksbank originally decided to adopt an inflation target, time was shortand did not permit extensive analyses. In my opinion, experience to date of the inflation targetpolicy has been favourable.One major advantage of having an established and distinct inflation target formonetary policy is that this can be combined with transparency. Market agents can form a clearpicture of the grounds for the Riksbank’s actions. It is, moreover, comparatively easy tounderstand how the policy functions, which should help in gaining public support for the target.The inflation target is an instrument for stabilising expectations about the conduct of monetarypolicy; a lack of transparency and distinctness in monetary policy makes it more difficult forinflation expectations to adjust to the target. This in turn can make it more difficult to achievehigh, stable growth.In recent years the Riksbank has accordingly been aiming for greatertransparency. A highly qualified staff has been built up, intensive efforts have been devoted todeveloping models and analyses, routines have been constructed for monetary policypreparations and decisions, and a new interest rate management system for monetary policy hasbeen launched.The endeavour to promote transparency is evident in the Riksbank’s participationin public hearings by parliamentary committees, in inflation reports, speeches, discussions andseminars of various kinds, and in the publication of specialist reports. This has led, I believe, to aBIS Review   5/1998
- 2 -better awareness—among market agents as well as a wider public—of how monetary policyworks. One indication of this is that agents’ expectations about monetary policy have becomeincreasingly congruent with the Riksbank’s monetary policy intentions. In addition, thefive-party agreement on the new Riksbank Act is a manifestation of broad political support forthe low-inflation policy. It is our ambition, moreover, to continue the process for increasedtransparency as far as is reasonable and feasible.Criticism of monetary policyMonetary policy has, of course, come in for some criticism. A common issueinitially was whether striving for 2 per cent inflation was reasonable and feasible. Thatdiscussion seems to have dried up. Inflation is currently around 2 per cent and more and morepeople understand the advantages of this.Another question has been why the Riksbank does not have the task of promotingother objectives, growth, for example. Here, too, there is a growing awareness, though it doesnot include everyone. In the long run monetary policy is only capable of influencing inflationand there is absolutely no long-term trade-off between inflation and growth. If anything, highinflation tends to impair real economic development.In the short run, however, the situation is somewhat different. In this perspective,inflation and growth are largely two sides of the same coin, at least as long as inflationexpectations are stable around the target. Weaker growth implies a diminishing risk ofinflationary impulses from demand, which normally warrants a less restrictive monetary stance.Conversely, demand that is excessively strong in relation to potential output implies a risk ofrising inflation and a need to raise the repo rate.The current discussion seems to be about whether the Riksbank actssymmetrically. In other words, is the Riksbank as concerned about under-shooting the inflationtarget as it is about preventing inflation from exceeding the target? My answer to that question isdefinitely “Yes”. The Riksbank aims to keep the rate of inflation at 2 per cent, neither more norless.The issue of monetary policy asymmetry seems to be linked mainly to twomatters. One is the question of monetary policy’s central concern. Is this inflation’s prevailingrate or the rate that assessments point to one to two years ahead? The answer is that the Riksbankis guided by the assessment of future inflation. If inflation is currently running at 2 per cent andthe predicted rate (based on an unchanged instrumental rate) one to two years ahead is, say, 1per cent, then the instrumental rate should be lowered. The reason for this is quite simply thatmonetary policy acts with a time lag of one to two years. Using the prevailing rate of inflation asa guide would involve adjusting the instrumental rate more frequently and markedly, therebyentailing undesirable economic instability. But how can we be sure that the assessments arealways correct? Of course we cannot. But the Riksbank does not simply assess the future, adjustthe instrumental rate and then sit back and wait two years for the outcome. Instead theassessments are continuously reconsidered in the light of new information and the monetarystance is adjusted accordingly. In this way we work systematically to fulfil the 2 per centinflation target and aim to avoid unnecessarily large changes in the repo rate. Even so, themonetary stance may have to be altered more markedly from time to time if a situation arisesthat is considered to call for this.BIS Review   5/1998
- 3 -The other matter that may underlie the discussion about monetary policyasymmetry is, I believe, the question of transitory effects on inflation. Such effects may come,for example, from changes to taxes and subsidies, rising or falling house mortgage interest costsin connection with monetary policy measures, or external shocks that affect the price level viasudden changes in the price of oil, for instance. Such changes in the price level show up as atemporary increase or decrease in the rate of inflation; with the methods that are used to measureinflation, the impact on the price level will last for twelve months. The Riksbank has declaredthat such transitory effects should be of secondary importance for monetary policy in so far asthey do not affect inflation expectations and thereby generate a more lasting impact on inflation.Two episodes with transitory effectsThe issue of transitory effects first arose around the turn of 1994, when the effectshad to do with altered indirect taxes and subsidies in connection with the consolidation ofgovernment finances. This entailed a transitory increase in inflation.In a number of addresses that winter I considered the issue at some length. In aspeech to the Economics Association in February 1995, for instance, I noted that there areshocks, such as altered indirect taxes and subsidies, which may affect the price level at shortnotice and cause inflation to deviate from the target. While such effects are usually absorbedinside the tolerance interval, they may sometimes be so pronounced that inflation fluctuatesmore widely. In such situations it is up to monetary policy to ensure that the deviations from thetarget do not have permanent consequences for the rate of inflation and inflation expectations.While drastic countermeasures might produce quick results, they would destabilise the economy,which is not desirable.In various contexts I made it clear that monetary policy would be conducted sothat price effects from the consolidation of government finances would be left to materialise inthe price level. At the same time, it was important to ensure that the transitory effects were, infact, temporary and did not colour inflation expectations.At that time, however, survey data indicated that the level of inflationexpectations was already around 4 per cent. The overall assessment of inflation, based on anunchanged instrumental rate, accordingly pointed to a risk of the inflation target being exceededas economic activity became stronger. Moreover, the high inflation expectations contributed toexcessively high wage settlements in the spring of 1995. It was partly this—not the price effectsfrom budget consolidation—that warranted the upward adjustments of the instrumental rate fromAugust 1994 to July 1995.Transitory effects again conditioned the rate of inflation during 1996 and 1997but now in a downward direction via falling house mortgage interest costs. The krona’sappreciation, in connection with the rapid enhancement of confidence in budget policy, alsotended to lower the CPI.Had the Riksbank continued to reduce the instrumental rate—after the earlier cutshad had a transitory downward effect on inflation’s current rate—it would have tended todestabilise the economy. The Riksbank would, as it were, have been chasing its own tail, withinterest rate cuts that became increasingly large and frequent. Inflation expectations and actualinflation would ultimately have risen, obliging the Riksbank to swing to a markedly restrictivestance. As interest rate increases also have transitory effects on inflation, the Riksbank wouldBIS Review   5/1998
- 4 -again start to chase its own tail but now in an upward spiral. This illustrates how absurd it wouldbe to raise or lower the instrumental rate as a response to the direct, but transitory, effects of theRiksbank’s own monetary measures. As long as inflation expectations are unaffected, there is noreason to suppose that the effects on inflation will be permanent.Transitory effects account for inflation target deviationsAn explicit inflation target has the advantage of enabling us to evaluate howmonetary policy is conducted. Consequently the Riksbank cannot implement an asymmetricapproach to the inflation target without this being detected.Two curves are presented in the diagram below. One represents CPI inflation andthe other is one of the various indicators of underlying inflation, in this case the CPI excludingtransitory effects from house mortgage interest costs, changes in indirect taxes and subsidies,and prices of imported goods.1Actual and underlyinginflation 1995 – 199712-month change figures, per cent0123495969798CPI"Underlying" inflationSource: Statistics Sweden and the Riksbank.Note.Underlying inflation is represented here by one of the indicators (UNDINH) used by theRiksbank; it shows the CPI excl. changes in indirect taxes and subsidies, housemortgage interest costs and prices of goods and services that are mainly imported.                                                  1The use of this indicator in the present context does not signify that it is particularly significant or the bestapproximation of underlying inflation in every case; instead, it happens to be the indicator where all theexcluded items had a marked influence on price movements in the period 1995–97. The reason for excludingimport prices here is that the exchange rate fluctuations in this period mainly reflected rapid changes in thedegree of confidence in the consolidation of government finances.BIS Review   5/1998
- 5 -Since 1995, when the inflation target first applied, the annual increase in the CPIaveraged 1.5 per cent. This outcome is thus relatively close to the targeted rate and well insidethe tolerance interval. Underlying inflation, as measured in the diagram, has averaged 2 per cent.In other words, the transitory effects that lowered inflation have been somewhat stronger than thupward effects. In the absence of any transitory effects, inflation would accordingly havefluctuated around 2 per cent.After only three years with an inflation target policy, it is too early for a finalevaluation. But when allowance is made for transitory effects, it is difficult to demonstrate thatthe Riksbank has acted asymmetrically.What this does show is that CPI inflation sometimes deviates from the target andmay even move outside the tolerance interval. It is then important that the Riksbank can make itcredible that inflation will gradually return to 2 per cent. This can be done either by showing thatthe forces at work have been mainly transitory effects or, if the effects in question are morepermanent, by using the instrumental rate to pilot inflation back to the target rate in the timeframe with which monetary policy operates.At times during 1996 and 1997 the 12-month change figure for the CPI wasbelow the tolerance interval’s lower limit of 1 per cent. On a number of occasions the Riksbankpointed out that this was mainly an effect of the repo rate cuts during 1996. In that it was not aquestion of more permanent effects and the inflation assessment pointed to a future increase,there was no need for further repo rate cuts. During the summer and autumn of 1997 inflationdid, in fact, move up fairly rapidly, as expected, in that these transitory effects successivelydropped out of the 12-month figures. As a result, actual inflation has moved closer to theunderlying rate. In describing this tendency, the Riksbank has been far from alarmist.The latest inflation reportThis brings me to the future development of inflation and the current situation formonetary policy.Our December inflation report provides a natural point of departure. Theassessment there was that during 1998 inflation would somewhat exceed the target, with agradual acceleration to a rate of about 2.5 per cent in 1999. Underlying inflation was likewiseexpected to move up and reach just over 2.5 per cent at the end of 1999. This assessment wasbroadly in line with the more or less concurrent forecast from the National Institute of EconomicResearch, for example, as well as with the figures that forecasters in general presented lastNovember and December.The basis for the Riksbank’s assessment included the prospect of a continuedstrengthening of economic activity, now with increased support from domestic demand. GDPgrowth was put at about 3 per cent in 1998 and over 3 per cent in 1999. Inflation expectationswere considered to be largely in line with the inflation target.Compared with the September report, the Riksbank’s assessment in Decemberrepresented a minor upward adjustment (by some tenths of a percentage point) of inflation in1999, mainly in view of higher wage costs and lower productivity. Of greater practicalimportance for monetary policy was the forward shift of the time perspective by one quarter,which meant that the inflation forecast now included a period when capacity utilisation andBIS Review   5/1998
- 6 -inflationary pressure were calculated to be somewhat higher. The picture of the real economicfuture had not changed appreciably during the autumn.The December report also presented two alternative scenarios that were judged tobe equally probable. One envisaged stronger inflationary pressure due to higher wage increasesand weaker productivity growth. The other involved stronger effects than expected from theAsian crisis and consequently a smaller increase in inflation.It has been claimed in the public debate that the Riksbank played down the Asiancrisis. That is not so. Certain effects were allowed for in the main scenario for the Decemberreport. But above all, the risk of the crisis becoming more profound was highlighted in a riskscenario as an important factor for monetary policy to consider.A general assessment was that in the Swedish economy’s present cyclical phase, itis important that monetary policy does not remain expansionary for too long. Considering thetime lag associated with monetary policy’s effects, a change to a less expansionary stance mustbe made in good time before resource utilisation becomes excessively high. The stated aim wasthat this would provide better conditions for more sustained increases in production andemployment.Against this background, when the inflation report had been presented, the reporate was increased in December by 25 basis points, from 4.10 to 4.35 per cent.In periods of financial unrest in international markets there is often a “flight toquality”; savers and investors experience uncertainty and rearrange their portfolios in favour ofwhat are perceived as secure assets. In connection with the Mexican crisis in the spring of 1995,Sweden’s currency depreciated sharply and bond rates rose substantially; this amounted to aflight from Sweden. In view of the krona’s recent weakening tendency, it would be going too farto talk of a flight to Sweden but the fact remains that the situation differs from earlier occasionswith international financial unrest. Even so, a correction of the present under-valuation of thekrona would be a good thing.The conclusion from this is that the increased confidence which Swedisheconomic policy has earned in recent years must be nurtured continuously, not least to make usresilient to turbulent times. All those with a say in price and wage formation must also realisethat the Riksbank’s endeavour is to fulfil the inflation target. The repo rate increase in Decemberwas therefore important when the overall assessment of future inflation pointed to the targetbeing exceeded.Inflation outlook somewhat more favourableInformation of some relevance for the assessment of future inflation has becomeavailable since the December report. It concerns the crisis in Asia, the early stages of the wagenegotiations, and the rent negotiations.The crisis in Asia has deepened both in terms of its effects on financial marketsand as regards its probable consequences for global economic growth and inflation in thecoming years. The extent of the effects cannot yet be assessed reliably but there are manyindications that they will be greater than most people envisaged at the end of last year. ThisBIS Review   5/1998
- 7 -suggests that in the coming months the statistics will point to a more subdued growth of Swedishexports and industrial production.Some wage agreements have been concluded, for instance for the paper industry.They still cover just a small segment of the labour market but many observers consider that theexisting settlements will serve as a guide elsewhere. It is difficult to arrive at a definiteassessment of what these settlements imply for total wage increases but a cautious conclusioncould be that the outcome will be somewhat below the Riksbank’s estimate in the main scenario,at least for 1998. It should be added, however, that agreements are still pending in many casesand the degree of wage drift in various industries also has to be considered. Still, the probabilityof the report’s alternative scenario with higher inflation should have decreased.Rent costs account for 11 per cent of the CPI and are the largest main item. For1998 and 1999, final agreements are in place for about 65 and 25 per cent, respectively, of thestock of rented dwellings. They give average increases of just over 2 per cent for 1998 andalmost 3 per cent for 1999. The 1998 figure is somewhat lower than expected. There are signs,moreover, that rents for 1998 may be re-negotiated, which has some downward implications forthe assessment of inflation this year.No reason at present to alter the repo rateAll in all, then, in the period of relevance for monetary policy, global economicdevelopment will probably be somewhat weaker than estimated earlier. For this reason theoutlook for inflation is somewhat more favourable. To some extent, stronger competition fromimports has a similar effect. Somewhat lower inflation in 1998 may also result from a lowerincrease in rents.For the construction of monetary policy it is equally important at present toconsider the altered spectrum of risks. The probability of an outcome for wages that isappreciably above the main scenario has diminished. At the same time, the effects of the Asiancrisis are highly uncertain. Much depends on how the crisis is managed. On the other hand, thefundamentals for growth are in place, particularly in Europe.The conclusion is that at present there is no reason to alter the repo rate.BIS Review   5/1998
Statement by Mr. Dai Xianglong on the stability of the Chinese yuan and ona number of other regional issues   Statement by the Governor of the People’s Bank of China,Mr. Dai Xianglong, at a press conference held on 16th January 1998, on the stability of theChinese yuan, the lessons of the financial crisis in South-East Asia, the linked exchange ratesystem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the impact of the collapse ofPeregrine on domestic business.The commitment to hold the current yuan exchange rate steadyJudging from the balance of payments position and macroeconomic performance,there is no possibility for the Chinese yuan to depreciate. I believe that the yuan will remainstable and will not depreciate for the following reasons. First of all, over the past years, the valueof the yuan has appreciated and the exchange rate at the end of last year stood at around yuan8.29 for a dollar. The trade surplus of last year reached $43 billion, and capital inflow was ashigh as $60 billion, which, put together, contributed to the rise of foreign exchange reserves.Following a successive increase over the years, the total amount of foreign exchange was $139.9billion. In addition, this reserve position does not include another $2.5 billion to support theSouth-East Asian countries to overcome their financial crisis and $2 billion otherwise retainedby foreign trade corporations. In the wake of the drastic currency depreciation for a number ofcountries in South-East Asia, the pace of increase for China’s foreign exchange reserves sloweddown, which in the end reduced the upward pressure for yuan. Second, the macroeconomicprospects for this year look quite favourable. With continued price stability, GDP for this year isexpected to grow over 8%, which can be seen as another contributing factor for a steadyexchange rate. Third, the level of exchange rate is determined overall by foreign exchangedemand and supply. It is true that the currency depreciation in some South-East Asian countriesdoes increase the pressure on our export. But such a pressure is quite limited given the fact thatcommodities from China and their destination are different from those of South-East Asiancountries. Fourth the labour cost in China is significantly lower in comparison with South-EastAsian countries, and in fact 50% of our export is in the form of processing of imported material,which is not subject to the influence of exchange rate fluctuation. Indeed, Chinese exportbusinesses can enhance their competitiveness via reducing cost and improving product mix. Itcan be said with a high degree of certainty that prospects for the country’s exports this year willremain favourable. I would like to reaffirm our commitment to hold the yuan exchange ratesteady with no consideration for depreciation and to stand ready for the test of the market. Thiscommitment can be seen as our contribution to financial stability in Asia.Over 8% GDP growth in 1998The financial crisis in some South-East Asian countries will have some impact onthe growth rate for China, for example trade between China and South Korea. However, Chinalargely depends on its domestic market for growth. In 1998, China will continue to expand itsexport market and increase its domestic investment. With continued price stability, GDP isexpected to grow over 8% in 1998. The slowdown of the GDP growth to 8.8% last year isattributed to international factors and the sluggish growth of township and village enterprises.We believe that supported by the vigorous measurers to address the adverse influence, we willbe able to maintain GDP growth over 8% in 1998.To be specific, first of all we shall continue to pursue a moderately tight monetarypolicy and make timely adjustment as necessary. Broad money will be expected to grow byBIS Review   4/1998
- 2 -16-18%, narrow money by 17% and injection of cash by yuan 140 billion. More discount andrediscount activities will be expected for commercial papers. Second, banks will be expected toimprove their services in support of new growth areas. The financing service for residentialhouses will be improved so as to strongly support the growth of the market for residentialhouses, to expand the scope of residential lending and remove the lending quotas imposed onpublic housing projects for less privileged people. Loans denominated in foreign exchange willbe actively developed on the domestic market with a projected increase of 10-15% of foreigncurrency denominated lending. The input for agriculture, railway, highway and high-techindustry will be increased under the precondition of ensuring the service of loans. Finally, theinterest rate instrument will be used appropriately to adjust the money supply, but at thismoment the central bank has no intention to lower interest rates.Toward the establishment of a modern financial system and a regulatory/supervisory systemIn 1997 the financial sector functioned in a sound manner and contributed in asignificant way to economic development and social stability. In 1998 we will continue topursue a moderately tight monetary policy and make strong efforts toward the establishment of amodern financial system and a regulatory/supervisory system to the extent that all financialinstitutions will be properly regulated/supervised by law, and financial risks are properlyreduced in the interest of significantly improving the order in the financial industry andpromoting a high and steady growth of the economy. In so doing, the most crucial policymeasure is to reform the organisational structure of the central bank. The number of provincialbranches of the central bank will be reduced in a well-planned approach. A number of first-tierbranches across the judicial administrative line will be created so as to enhance independence,authority and expertise of the central bank. In addition, with regard to commercial banks, theirprovincial branches and branches located in provincial capital cities will be consolidatedgradually and the grassroots branches with overlapped businesses with their counterparts thathave incurred sustained losses will be removed. When conditions allow, urban commercialbanks will be created in 300 city centres with equity shares from local fiscal authorities with aview to establishing a multi-layered financial system comprising different financial institutions.The underlying nature of financial institutions requires the existence of a set of rules andregulations for the management of the institutions. All these institutions shall function incompliance with laws and regulations and no government agencies or individuals shall beallowed to interfere with the business management of financial businesses. Again, theseinstitutions shall be required to assume managerial responsibility and risk inherent in thebusiness. Their internal control system shall be strengthened. The supervisory board shall beestablished for all state-owned commercial banks. The lending quota imposed on these bankswill be removed and they will gradually adopt the basic asset and liability ratios and riskmanagement techniques for managing their balance sheets. With reference to internal practicesand in consideration of the country circumstances, we will improve the existing system for assetclassification and loan loss provisioning. Efforts will be made to improve the system for capitalreplenishment in order to increase capital adequacy of financial institutions. In maintaining theorder in financial industry, we shall follow the principle of segregating commercial bankingfrom securities and trust businesses and close all unlicensed financial institutions. All thesemeasures will be phased in during the next three years according to a well designed plan. By thedecision of the State Council, we shall build a modern enterprise system, a modern financial andregulatory system within a time framework of three years. I feel optimistic that state-ownedcommercial banks and other commercial banks will operate under an new mechanism at the turnof the century.BIS Review   4/1998
- 3 -The lessons from the financial crisis in South-East Asian countriesSerious lessons can be drawn from the financial crisis in South-East Asiancountries. This is also true for China despite the fact that the country started early in 1993 to capthe bubbles in the economy. The major lessons for us can be summarised as follows: first of all,it is essential to maintain an equilibrium for aggregate demand and supply, and especially to beon guard against the bubbles in the real estate and stock market; second, the structure of externalborrowing should be proper and external borrowing by domestic businesses should be wellregulated. Before the crisis, fiscal deficits were small, economic fundamentals were sound andcentral bank reserves were high. The underlying cause for the crisis is the over indebtedness ofbusiness entities, especially the large amount of short-term borrowing not necessarily reported tothe central bank. Given what has happened, China will continue to favour foreign directinvestment and long-term commercial borrowing as a general policy. At the same time, externalborrowing by domestic businesses shall be reviewed very carefully and subject to a ceiling;third, efforts shall be made to actively pursue the development of capital market and graduallyachieve capital account convertibility for the renminbi. On top of that, the country must maintainsubstantial foreign exchange reserves; fourth, a safe and sound financial system must be in place,and no government agencies or individuals should interfere with the business operations ofcommercial banks. In an effort to ensure the stability of financial industry and reduce financialrisk, a dozen policy measures have been introduced. A better structured financial system is sureto emerge in China three years later.A strong commitment to an open policyWe shall not abandon the open policy simply because of the financial crisis inSouth-East Asia. By the end of 1997, 173 foreign financial institutions were licensed to operatein China with total assets amounting to $36 billion. The Chinese banks, insurance and securitiescompanies had 687 overseas establishments actively developing businesses abroad. We willcontinue to grant licenses for foreign banks and insurance companies and authorise more foreignbanks to do local currency business on a trial basis. However, we would be more cautious in thisregard.China as a safe haven for foreign investment in AsiaWith good reason, China can be expected to maintain its status as the secondlargest recipient for foreign direct investment. Although the contractual amount of FDI hasdecreased to a certain extent, the amount of actual investment has been on the rise, particularlyby big multinational corporations. China has a stable political situation, a strong currency and agood climate for foreign investment and lower tariffs. A new policy was announced recentlywhereby the import of equipment by investing foreign businesses shall be exempt from valueadded tax for imports. Therefore, China is very attractive for foreign investment.The commitment of the government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to hold theHong Kong dollar steadyThe financial crisis in South-East Asia is not over yet and the possibility ofanother attack on Hong Kong’s financial market still remains. So far, the government of theHong Kong Special Administrative Region has introduced a number of measures to protect theBIS Review   4/1998
- 4 -stability of the Hong Kong dollar and its financial market, one of which is to maintain the HongKong dollar peg. The linked exchange rate system introduced more than ten years ago hascontributed in a significant way to stabilising the Hong Kong economy. At present, Hong Konghas strong economic fundamentals, a sound banking system, large foreign exchange reserves andsufficient experience in regulating the economy. Therefore, the linked exchange rate system willremain unchanged and experience has shown that this can be done and will be done. Indefending the exchange rate, interest rates in Hong Kong rose and caused the drop of prices onthe stock market. Although banks’ profitability has declined, the profitability ratio for HongKong banks remains the highest in the whole world. Indeed, 30% drop of the real estate price isa correction of overvalued real estate in Hong Kong and can prove to be conducive to improvingthe competitiveness of Hong Kong.BIS Review   4/1998
BIS Review   56/1998Mr. Patrikis discusses the implications of the Year 2000 computer problem forinternational banking and finance   Statement by the First Vice-President of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, Mr. Ernest T. Patrikis, before the Committee on Banking and Financial Servicesof the US House of Representatives on 23/6/98.I am pleased to appear before the Committee today to discuss the implications of theYear 2000 computer problem for international banking and finance. I am appearing in my capacityas Chairman of the Joint Year 2000 Council, which is sponsored jointly by the Basle Committee onBanking Supervision, the G-10 central bank governors’ Committee on Payment and SettlementSystems, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, and the International Organizationof Securities Commissions (collectively referred to as the “Sponsoring Organizations”).The international financial community has much work to do to prepare itself for thechallenges posed by the Year 2000 (“Y2K”) problem. While much good work is being done andprogress in many areas is evident, more needs doing. The Sponsoring Organizations believe thatmutual cooperation and information sharing can play a key role in helping individual marketparticipants carry out these preparations and limit the scope of Y2K-related disruptions. Our majorconcern, of course, will be the possible impact of the Y2K problem on the functioning of theinternational financial system as a whole.Federal Reserve Governor Edward W. Kelley, Jr. has recently elaborated on theactivities of the Federal Reserve System in connection with the Y2K problem, as well on possiblemacroeconomic implications.1 I will not attempt to cover those topics again here. Instead, thismorning I will begin with some background on the possible implications of the Y2K problem forinternational banking and finance. Second, I will describe how various supervisory initiatives led tothe formation of the Joint Year 2000 Council a little more than two months ago. Third, I will discussthe actions being taken by the Joint Year 2000 Council, particularly in the areas of raisingawareness, improving preparedness, and contingency planning.Background on the International Implications of the Y2K ProblemThe Y2K bug potentially affects all organizations that are dependent on computersoftware applications or on embedded computer chips. In other words, nearly all financialorganizations worldwide are potentially at risk. Even those whose own operations remain strictlypaper-based are likely to be dependent on power, water, and telecommunications utilities, whichmust themselves address possible Y2K problems. Also, many non-financial customers havedependencies on technology.All countries of the world, therefore, need to address the Y2K problem and itspotential effects on their domestic financial markets. In some cases, it is said that computer systemsin particular countries are not much affected because their national calendars are not based on theconventional Gregorian calendar used in the United States and many other countries. I do not derivemuch comfort from these statements because in most cases operating systems and the softwareapplications running on them count internally with a conventional date system that may not beY2K-compliant. These systems typically also need to connect and interact with other systems thatuse conventional dates, so these interfaces must be tested for Y2K-compliance. More broadly, mereassertions that computer applications are unaffected cannot be seen as a substitute for the rigorous                                                     1 See Testimony of Governor Edward W. Kelley, Jr. Before the Committee on Commerce, Science, andTransportation, U.S. Senate.  April 28, 1998.
- 2 -BIS Review   56/1998assessment, remediation, and testing efforts that should be undertaken by financial marketparticipants worldwide.The increasing extent of cross-border, financial-market activity has been muchremarked on in recent years. Perhaps less well known is the fact that this activity is dependent on alarge, geographically diverse, and highly computer-intensive global infrastructure for each of the keyphases of this activity -- from trade execution through to payment and settlement.As an example, consider the daily financial market activities of a hypotheticalUS-based mutual fund holding stocks and bonds in a number of foreign jurisdictions. Such a mutualfund would likely execute trades via relationships with a set of securities dealers, who themselvesmight make use of other securities brokers and dealers, including some outside the United States.The operational integrity of the major securities dealers in each national securities market is criticalto the smooth functioning of those markets. In addition, securities trading in most countries is relianton the proper functioning of the respective exchanges, brokerage networks, or electronic tradingsystems and the national telecommunications infrastructure on which these all depend. Financialmarkets today are also highly dependent on the availability of real-time price and trade quotationsprovided by financial information services.For record-keeping, administration, and trade settlement purposes, our hypotheticalmutual fund would also likely maintain a relationship with one or more global custodians (banks orbrokerage firms), who themselves would typically maintain relationships with a network ofsub-custodians located in various domestic markets around the world. Actual settlement of securitiestransactions typically occurs over the books of a domestic securities depository, such as theDepository Trust Company (“DTC”) or the Fedwire National Book-Entry System in the UnitedStates, or at one of the two major international securities depositories, Euroclear and Cedel.Additional clearing firms, such as the National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) and theGovernment Securities Clearing Corporation (“GSCC”) in the United States, may also occupycentral roles in the trade clearance and settlement process.Payments and foreign exchange transactions on behalf of the mutual fund wouldinvolve the use of correspondent banks, both for the US dollar and for other relevant currencies.These transactions would typically settle over the books of domestic wholesale payment systems,such as the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (“CHIPS”) or Fedwire in the United States,and the new TARGET system for the euro. Correspondent banks are also heavily dependent on theuse of cross-border payments messaging through the network maintained by the Society forWorldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (“S.W.I.F.T.”) to advise and confirm payments.To provide some sense of the magnitudes involved here, consider that the Fedwire and CHIPSsystems process a combined $3 trillion in funds transfers on an average day (split roughly evenlybetween the two systems). While S.W.I.F.T. itself does not transfer funds, its messaging networkcarries over three million messages per day relating to financial transactions worldwide.The many interconnections of the global financial market infrastructure imply thatfinancial market participants in the United States could be affected by Y2K-related disruptions inother financial markets. In assessing the scope of any such potential problems, we should be realisticin accepting that some disruptions are inevitable, while also recognizing that not all countriesconfront Y2K problems of similar magnitudes. The problem simply affects too many organizationsand too many systems to expect that 100 percent readiness will be achieved throughout the world.Nor are the best efforts of supervisors and regulators capable of completely eradicating the risk ofdisruption. Ultimately, the work of fixing the Y2K problem rests with firms themselves, and evensome of the most determined and well-funded Year 2000 efforts may miss something.Global Year 2000 Round Table
- 3 -BIS Review   56/1998Recognizing the global nature of the issues surrounding the Y2K problem, each ofthe Sponsoring Organizations undertook initiatives in 1997 to raise awareness, enhance disclosure,and prompt appropriate action within the financial industry. Their decision last fall to organize aGlobal Year 2000 Round Table was motivated by a growing sense of the seriousness of the Y2Kchallenges posed in many countries and of the potentially severe consequences for financial marketsthat fail to meet these challenges. The Global Year 2000 Round Table was held at the Bank forInternational Settlements on April 8, 1998. It was attended by more than 200 senior executives from52 countries, representing a variety of private and public organizations in the financial, informationtechnology, telecommunications, and business communities around the world.2The discussions at the Round Table confirmed that the Y2K issue must be a toppriority for directors and senior management, and that the public and private sectors should increaseefforts to share information. The importance of thorough testing, both internally and withcounterparties, was emphasized as the most effective way to ensure that Y2K problems areminimized. Round Table participants identified the need to continue the widening and strengtheningof external testing programs in many countries.The communiqué issued by the four Sponsoring Organizations at the close of theRound Table recommended that market participants from regions that have not yet vigorouslytackled the problem should consider the need to invest significant resources in the short time thatremains. The Sponsoring Organizations further recommended that external testing programs bedeveloped and expanded and that all financial market supervisors worldwide should implementprograms that enable them to assess the Y2K readiness of the firms and market infrastructures thatthey supervise. The Sponsoring Organizations urged telecommunications and electricity providers toshare information on the state of their own preparations and encouraged market participants andsupervisors and regulators to consider the need to develop appropriate contingency procedures.At the Round Table, a new private-sector initiative known as the Global 2000Coordinating Group was announced. The aims of the Global 2000 effort are to identify and supportcoordinated initiatives by the global financial community to improve the Y2K readiness of financialmarkets worldwide. For example, current Global 2000 projects include the development ofrecommendations for financial infrastructure testing and guidelines for addressing Y2K complianceissues related to vendors and service providers. The Global 2000 Coordinating Group, whichincludes representatives from over 75 financial institutions in 18 countries, represents an extremelyvaluable private-sector attempt at cooperation on this important issue. At the same time, however,the international financial supervisory community recognized that it would be useful to establish apublic-sector group, called the Joint Year 2000 Council, that would work with the private sector andalso maintain a high level of attention on the Y2K problem among financial market supervisors andregulators worldwide.                                                     2 A videotape containing highlights of the Global Year 2000 Round Table is available free of charge from theBank for International Settlements.

- 4 -BIS Review   56/1998Joint Year 2000 CouncilThe formation of the Joint Year 2000 Council was announced at the end of theGlobal Year 2000 Round Table on April 8, 1998. The Joint Year 2000 Council consists of seniormembers of the four Sponsoring Organizations. Every continent is represented by at least onemember on the Council. The Secretariat of the Council is provided by the Bank for InternationalSettlements. I am honored to serve as the Chairman of the Joint Year 2000 Council.The mission of the Joint Year 2000 Council has four parts: First, to ensure a highlevel of attention on the Y2K computer challenge within the global financial supervisorycommunity; second, to share information on regulatory and supervisory strategies and approaches;third, to discuss possible contingency measures; and fourth, to serve as a point of contact withnational and international private-sector initiatives. After their meetings on May 8-9, 1998, the G-7finance ministers called on the Joint Year 2000 Council and its Sponsoring Organizations to monitorthe Y2K-related work in the financial industry worldwide and to take all possible steps to encouragereadiness.The Council has met twice since being formed in early April and plans to meetfrequently, almost monthly, between now and January, 2000. At our first meeting, we organized ourwork projects and approved our mission statement. At our second meeting, we met for the first timewith an External Consultative Committee consisting of international public-sector and private-sectororganizations. Meeting with this External Consultative Committee is intended to enhance the degreeof information sharing and the raising of awareness on different aspects of the Year 2000 problem byboth public and private sectors within the global financial markets.The External Consultative Committee includes representatives from internationalpayment and settlement mechanisms (such as S.W.I.F.T., Euroclear, Cedel, and VISA), frominternational financial market associations (such as the International Swaps and DerivativesAssociation, the International Institute of Finance, and the Global 2000 Coordinating Group), frommultilateral organizations (such as the IMF, OECD, and World Bank), from the financial ratingagencies (such as Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s), and from a number of other internationalorganizations (such as the International Telecommunications Union, Reuters, the InternationalFederation of Accountants, and the International Chamber of Commerce). This diversity ofperspectives led to an extremely valuable discussion with the Joint Year 2000 Council andstimulated work on several projects to be taken forward with input from both the public and privatesectors, for example, the initiatives on Y2K testing and self-assessment that I will describe shortly.Further sessions with the External Consultative Committee are planned on a quarterly basis.It is important at the outset for me to be clear that the Joint Year 2000 Council is notintended to become a global Y2K regulatory authority, with sweeping powers to coordinateinternational action or to take responsibility for ensuring Y2K readiness in every financial marketworldwide. Through our ability to serve as a clearinghouse for Y2K information, however, I believethat the Joint Year 2000 Council will play a positive role in three areas: (1) raising awareness,(2) improving preparedness, and (3) contingency planning. In the next portion of my remarks, Iwould like to address each of these roles in turn.Efforts to Promote AwarenessThe Joint Year 2000 Council is undertaking a series of initiatives that may bedescribed under the heading of promoting awareness. By this term, I do not mean to include onlythose initiatives aimed at raising general awareness, although that too is still needed in some cases. Imean to include efforts to promote better awareness of the many efforts currently under way to
- 5 -BIS Review   56/1998tackle the Y2K problem. I have found that, while many organizations are working hard on variousaspects of the Y2K challenge, in many cases these efforts would be enhanced by a greater degree ofinformation sharing with others. For example, at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we havebeen holding quarterly Y2K forums with a diverse set of financial organizations in the area.Participants have requested that we continue to hold these meetings -- in fact, to hold them evenmore frequently -- because they believe that the contacts and the exchange of views are broadlybeneficial. We hope to use the Joint Year 2000 Council to achieve similar goals.Each of the members of the Joint Year 2000 Council has committed to help play aleading role in promoting awareness of Y2K initiatives within their region. Each of us will help incoordinating regional Y2K forums or conferences and will publicly promote the goals of the JointYear 2000 Council in speeches and on conference programs.The Joint Year 2000 Council will also maintain extensive world-wide-web pages thatcan be accessed freely over the Internet.3 These pages are being maintained through the support theCouncil has received from the Bank for International Settlements, in particular from the GeneralManager, Andrew Crockett. These web pages will maintain current information on the activities ofthe Joint Year 2000 Council.  The most extensive aspect of the Council’s web site will be a series of countrypages, one for each country in the world. For each country, the page will contain contact informationfor government entities (including national coordinators), financial industry supervisors andregulators (including central banks, banking supervisors, insurance supervisors, and securitiesregulators), financial industry associations, payment, settlement and trading systems, chambers ofcommerce, and major utility associations or supervisors. For each of these organizations, a name,address, phone number, fax number, electronic mail and web site address will be provided. Otherrelevant information on an organization’s Y2K preparations may also be included, for example,whether it has a dedicated Y2K contact or has taken specific action with respect to the Y2Kproblem.The motivation for developing these country pages is to increase awareness of thework that is being done to address the Y2K problem and to enable market participants to easily findout more information about the state of preparations worldwide. Establishing these national contactswill also help to develop the informal networks and arrangements that may be needed in addressingother Y2K-related issues, for example, in formulating contingency measures. Finally, of course, thepresence of the country pages may exert pressure on those countries where more vigorous action isneeded. A blank or uninformative country listing would probably not be seen as a good sign by somefinancial market participants.In addition, the web pages of the Joint Year 2000 Council will also providesummaries of the efforts being undertaken by its Sponsoring Organizations as well as links to therelevant web sites. For example, reports on Y2K surveys of supervisors and regulators beingundertaken by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision and by the International Organizationof Securities Commissions are planned to be made available on the Joint Year 2000 Council website. Public papers produced by the Joint Year 2000 Council will also be available on the web site. Alisting of international conferences and seminars related to Y2K will be posted on the web site,together with links to other Y2K web sites and documents.At this stage, each member of the Joint Year 2000 Council is in the process offinalizing the country page for its respective country. Last week, I wrote to every contact provided by                                                     3 The web pages of the Joint Year 2000 Council can be reached at the web site of the Bank for InternationalSettlements (www.bis.org).  These pages will also be registered under the name jy2kcouncil.org in the nearfuture.
- 6 -BIS Review   56/1998the four Sponsoring Organizations (almost 600 contacts in over 170 countries), asking for assistancein coordinating the development of their country page. This also provided a further opportunity toraise the awareness of the Year 2000 problem at the most senior levels of financial marketauthorities and supervisors in countries around the world. Through the effort to develop this web siteand other similar efforts by the Joint Year 2000 Council, I believe we can succeed at keeping theawareness of the issue at a very high level within the global financial supervisory community.Efforts to Improve PreparednessOf course, awareness of the Year 2000 problem is only the first step in addressing it.Global efforts to prepare for Year 2000 vary widely, and many countries believe that morecoordinated national action will be necessary to tackle the problem as effectively as possible. At oursecond meeting of the Joint Year 2000 Council, a strong consensus emerged that a nationalgovernment body in each country could play a helpful role in coordinating preparations for Y2K.While the Council did not have a strong view on what particular form or what specific authority sucha body would require in each specific country, the Council members felt strongly that involvement insome fashion by the national government could be beneficial.Accordingly, the Joint Year 2000 Council plans to issue a statement in the near futureproviding general support for the concept of a national-level coordinating body for the Y2Kproblem. In the United States, of course, the White House has established the President’s Council onYear 2000 Conversion, headed by John Koskinen. This effort, as well as those of this committeeunder the leadership of Chairman Leach, and of the other Congressional committees that haveaddressed the Y2K problem, has shown that national government bodies have a very important anduseful role to play in encouraging progress in addressing the Y2K problem.Turning now to the question of how financial supervisors can implement effectiveY2K programs, the Joint Year 2000 Council intends to promote the sharing of strategies andapproaches. For example, the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has prepared a papercontaining “Supervisory Guidance on Independent Assessment of Bank Year 2000 Preparations”.This document is aimed at moving supervisors worldwide from a level of general awareness to aspecific, concrete program of action for overseeing Y2K preparations, both on an individual bankbasis and on a system-wide basis.The Joint Year 2000 Council intends to adapt this paper for use by financial marketregulators and supervisors more broadly and to issue it as rapidly as possible with the endorsementof all four Sponsoring Organizations. The goal will be to provide guidance in developing specificYear 2000 action plans for all types of financial market authorities. Supervisors in countries thathave gotten a head start on the issue can thereby provide the benefit of their experience to those whoare starting later.  Those supervisors getting a late start have a need for tools of this type.The Joint Year 2000 Council will also be working with the members of our ExternalConsultative Committee, particularly the Global 2000 Coordinating Group, to build on this effortand develop a Y2K self-assessment tool that could be used broadly by the financial industry incountries around the world. We also intend to develop additional papers on a variety of Y2K topicsthat might be of interest to the global financial supervisory community.At this point, I am sure that members of the Committee have questions regarding thestate of Y2K preparations in various parts of the world. I think that it is fair to say that most believe aspectrum exists, with the United States at one end of the spectrum, and emerging market andundeveloped countries at the other end. There are likely exceptions of course; some developed
- 7 -BIS Review   56/1998countries are probably less far along than they should be. Some emerging market countries, on theother hand, appear to be quite advanced in their preparations.Overall, however, there is still not nearly enough concrete, comparable informationon the preparations of individual institutions to be able to make any confident statements about thestate of global preparations in any detail. Over the time remaining until January 2000, we hope to usethe Joint Year 2000 Council as a means of gathering a better picture of the state of globalpreparations, and to help direct resources and attention to those regions that appear to be faltering intheir efforts. We will use the information provided for our web site and the discussions withmembers of our External Consultative Committee as our primary resources in seeking to identify“hot spots” where more urgent efforts are needed.If we identify regions where more needs to be done, our first step will be to workthrough the relevant national financial supervisors and regulators to increase the urgency of efforts intheir jurisdiction. We may also involve multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank, to helpincrease national attention on the issue. I do not believe that calling public attention to problems inspecific countries would be a constructive step for us to take at this stage as we are still trying tobuild cooperation and our current information is incomplete. In this context, I would also point outthat the market itself will begin to bring strong pressures to bear on specific firms and markets thatexhibit signs of being ill-prepared during the course of 1999.In conjunction with preparations for Y2K, the recent discussion of the Joint Year2000 Council with the External Consultative Committee raised several important issues. First, inevery national market there is the question of the dependence of the banking and financial sectors oncore infrastructure such as telecommunications, power, water, sewer, and transportation. In all cases,it seems that it is not an everyday occurrence for representatives of these differing sectors to gettogether with financial sector representatives and discuss their mutual concerns. Yet, this must bemade a priority if financial firms and their counterparties are to achieve comfort that their ownefforts to prepare for Year 2000 will not be compromised by the failures of systems beyond theircontrol.A representative of the International Telecommunications Union is a member of ourExternal Consultative Committee. At our meeting earlier this month, he provided useful factualinformation on the preparations being undertaken by telecommunications firms and indicated that afurther global survey and report on this topic is due to be completed soon. This is the type ofinformation sharing that helps all parties understand the scope of the problem, as well as the effortsthat others are undertaking. We intend to encourage further information sharing between thefinancial sector and core infrastructure providers at future meetings of the Joint Year 2000 Counciland the External Consultative Committee. I would also strongly encourage such mutual cooperationon Y2K preparations within each national jurisdiction.Another issue that some participants in our Joint Year 2000 Council are concernedabout in regard to preparations in their countries relates to the availability of human resources. Insome regions, the supply of available information technology professionals may be hard-pressed tomeet the challenges posed by Y2K. For each organization facing resource constraints, this situationclearly indicates the need to develop action plans for Y2K that set clear priorities among systems andprojects.More broadly, we must also recognize that the lack of available programmingresources will be a significant overall constraint on the scale of Y2K remediation efforts globally. Asa result, the cost of hiring computer professionals capable of addressing the problem will continue torise. Wealthy countries are undoubtedly in a better position to bear these increasing costs than arepoor countries.
- 8 -BIS Review   56/1998A number of participants from our External Consultative Committee cited the recentgrant of £10 million sterling by the British Government to the World Bank as a positivedevelopment. Among other projects, the World Bank intends to use this grant to fund a variety ofeducational and awareness-raising events related to Y2K over the next several months. Given thepotential consequences of a failure to prepare for Y2K, the World Bank indicated to the Joint Year2000 Council that it intends to take on an aggressive role in promoting and assisting Y2K efforts incountries around the world. The Joint Year 2000 Council intends to work closely with the WorldBank to enhance our mutual efforts on the Y2K problem.The subject of appropriate Y2K disclosure was also discussed by members of theExternal Consultative Committee. Many of those present agreed that greater disclosures would behelpful. However, there was skepticism that a standardized disclosure format would be effective ineliciting meaningful information for a wide class of financial firms, given the complexity and varietyof Y2K issues facing these firms worldwide. It was also noted that disclosure which relies primarilyon a firm’s own subjective assessments of its Y2K problems inevitably will suffer from an optimisticbias.In addition, most Y2K efforts will not reach the serious testing phase until 1999. Thepurpose of the testing will be to uncover areas where additional work is required, so that the firstround of tests can be expected to encounter problems. In this environment, it may be difficult forfirms themselves to assess the true state of their Y2K preparations. Also, firms who believe they aregoing to be ready will be directed by legal counsel not to make too strong a statement to avoidliability claims in case of unforeseen problems. On the other hand, firms that do not believe they canget ready in time will seek to avoid stating this clearly to protect their activities during 1999. For allof these reasons, I am doubtful that specific, reliable information on the state of Y2K preparations byindividual firms worldwide will become publicly available.Finally, in the area of improving preparedness, I have saved the most important topicfor last -- namely, testing. Testing programs, particularly external testing programs, are universallyregarded as the most critical element of serious Y2K preparations in the financial sector. The JointYear 2000 Council encourages all firms and institutions active in the financial markets to engage ininternal and external testing of their important applications and interfaces. To this end, many majorpayment and settlement systems around the world have developed extensive testing programs andprocedures for their participants. In the United States, for example, Fedwire, CHIPS, and S.W.I.F.T.have coordinated shared testing days for the purpose of testing the major international wholesalepayments infrastructure for the US dollar. The Securities Industry Association (“SIA”) has been atthe forefront of an ambitious program to develop a coordinated industry-wide test of all aspects ofthe trading and settlement infrastructure for the US stock market. The FFIEC’s efforts have also beenextremely beneficial in stressing the importance of testing within the banking sector generally.Yet, external testing programs globally need to be dramatically extended andexpanded. To that end, the G-10 Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems last year started tocollect information on the state of preparedness and testing of payment and settlement systemsworldwide. To date, over 150 systems in 47 countries have responded to the framework and postedsuch plans.4 The Joint Year 2000 Council intends to expand the coverage of this framework toexchanges and trading systems, as well as major financial information services providers, and hopesto expand the number of countries and systems that are included. We will also collate and present theinformation graphically to help highlight anomalies in testing schedules, and to facilitate the effortsof systems to coordinate test scheduling where feasible.                                                     4 The relevant information can now be found on the pages of the Joint Year 2000 Council.
- 9 -BIS Review   56/1998Primarily, I see this as an exercise in peer pressure. If we list every country in theworld on our web site and the public can see that some countries have scheduled mandatory externaltests of their major trading and settlement systems, while other countries do not provide anyinformation, that second country may come under greater pressure to organize an external testingprogram. This is our stated goal. We will simply have blanks for those countries that do not respondto our requests for information.Of course, if the Joint Year 2000 Council is going to encourage testing to such anextent, then it is only appropriate that we also help provide some tools for those countries trying toget a serious testing effort underway in a short amount of time. This is another of our high-priorityprojects. We will be working with members of the External Consultative Committee -- includingrepresentatives of the Global 2000 Coordinating Group, S.W.I.F.T., and the World Bank -- to rapidlydevelop a series of documents that help countries set up testing programs and overcome commonobstacles. We intend to issue these documents broadly by the end of the summer, and some partswell before that.In closing this section of my statement, I do not think it is possible to over-emphasizethe importance of testing to help improve readiness. To illustrate this point, I would like to draw onour experiences with Fedwire, the Federal Reserve’s wholesale interbank payments system. Much ofthe current Fedwire software application was written in the last five years, with the Y2K problem inmind. Nevertheless, some of the older software code that was carried over into the new applicationwas not Y2K-compliant. Without the rigorous internal Y2K testing program that the Federal Reserveadopted, our Y2K remediation efforts might, therefore, have been incomplete. I think of thisexperience whenever I hear it said that some countries are immune to Y2K because they have onlyrecently introduced information technology and that recent software programs are less affected byY2K. I ask whether those programs have truly been thoroughly tested for Y2K compliance.Contingency Planning EffortsThe third major role of the Joint Year 2000 Council will relate to contingencyplanning. In this context, I should note that contingency planning is something that most financialmarket authorities, particularly central banks, undertake regularly with regard to a wide variety ofpotential market disruptions. Most private-sector financial firms, as well, have well developedcontingency and business continuity plans in place for their operations.Nevertheless, it is clear that contingency planning for Y2K problems has a number ofunique characteristics. First, of course, is the fact that one cannot rely on a backup computer site forY2K contingency if that site also uses the same software that is the cause of the Y2K problem at themain site. In some cases, it is impractical to build a duplicate software system from scratch simply toprovide for Y2K contingency. In these cases, as a senior banker explained at one of our New YorkY2K forums, contingency planning amounts to, “Testing, testing, and more testing.”Contingency planning can also be separated into components that are firm-specificand those that are market-wide. Each individual firm will need to develop its own contingency plansdesigned to maintain the integrity of its operations during the changeover to the Year 2000. TheFFIEC has recently issued guidance to banks in the United States regarding the core elements oftheir own contingency planning.5 The Joint Year 2000 Council will also be developing a paper oncontingency planning for the benefit of the global financial supervisory community. This paper willseek to address firm-level contingency as well as issues of market-wide contingency.                                                     5 See www.ffiec.gov/y2k/contplan.htm
- 10 -BIS Review   56/1998Market-wide contingency refers to the planning by participants and supervisors doneto ensure that individual disruptions can be managed in ways that will prevent them from causingdisruptions to critical market infrastructures. For instance, we at the Federal Reserve have gone togreat lengths to ensure that barriers are in place to prevent Y2K problems with a Fedwire participantfrom causing problems on the Fedwire system itself. We are also now actively researching additionalsteps that the Federal Reserve could take to better prepare the financial markets as a whole tofunction in spite of disruptions at individual firms.It is also important to realize that contingency planning for Y2K is not solely anoperational issue. Financial firms may seek to adopt a defensive posture in the marketplace wellahead of Monday, January 3, 2000 (the first business day of the new year in the United States). Forexample, market participants may seek to minimize the number of transactions that would bescheduled for settlement on January 3 or January 4, or that would require open positions to bemaintained over the century date change weekend.Contingency planning involves a series of elements, many of which must be put inplace well before January 2000. For example, we must consider many possible sources of disruptionand determine what approaches could be available to limit the impact of each possible disruption.The sooner such thinking occurs, the more opportunity we have to plan around the possibledisruptions. In this context, members of our External Consultative Committee noted that one of thekey obstacles to effective contingency planning is the inability to list and consider all possibledisruption scenarios. Several of these participants noted that their firms were engaging consultants orother procedures to expand the number of scenarios for inclusion in their Y2K contingency planning.In New York, we will be using our Y2K forum next month to discuss contingencyplanning with a diverse set of market participants. These local market participants will providehelpful insights for the Joint Year 2000 Council. Clearly, more work is needed on contingencyplanning for Y2K, especially at the international level. Once we get beyond the early fall of this year,I believe that these efforts will begin to receive much greater focus and attention, and -- togetherwith testing -- will dominate our discussions of Y2K during 1999.Closing RemarksIn closing, I would like to thank the Committee for the opportunity to appear andsubmit a statement on this important issue. I hope that the efforts of the Joint Year 2000 Council willhelp to make a difference in improving the state of Y2K preparations in the international financialcommunity. Realistically, however, I believe that it is important to understand the limits of whatfinancial market supervisors can accomplish, either individually or collectively. Only firmsthemselves have the ability to address the Year 2000 problems that exist within their ownorganizations. Only firms working together can assure that local markets will function normally.Supervisors and regulators cannot guarantee that disruptions will not occur.Given the sheer number of organizations that are potentially at risk, it is inevitablethat Y2K-related disruptions will occur. Today it would be impossible to predict the precise natureof these disruptions. However, we do know that financial markets have in the past survived manyother serious disruptions, including blackouts, snow storms, ice storms, and floods. We will alsohave a very interesting case at the end of this year with the changeover to monetary union in Europe.We will all be watching carefully to see whether the extent of operational problems related to thisevent is greater or less than expected.
- 11 -BIS Review   56/1998I would also like to say at this point that my discussions with other members of theJoint Year 2000 Council and with members of the External Consultative Committee have convincedme that successful efforts to address the Y2K problem will be dependent on the credibility of thosecalling for action. Those of us — such as members of this Committee as well as others inCongress — who are seriously engaged and concerned need to be able to persuade others of the needto take appropriate actions promptly. It would be unfortunate if general perceptions of the Y2Kproblem are driven primarily by unofficial commentators whose rhetoric is seen to exceed the factson which it is based, and therefore easily dismissed.As a central banker and bank supervisor, my major concern must be with the systemas a whole. At this point, I believe that we are doing everything possible to limit the possibility thatY2K disruptions will have systemic consequences in our markets. However, we must all continue towork hard -- both individually and cooperatively -- in the time that remains to ensure that this threatdoes not become more concrete.In that spirit, Mr. Chairman, I would like to end my remarks by commending theCommittee for organizing these hearings on the implications of the Year 2000 computer problem forinternational banking and finance.
BIS Review   55/1998Mr. George comments briefly on the global economy and on recent economicperformance in the United Kingdom   Speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J.George, at the Dinner with the Lord Mayor for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London on11/6/98.The past year, since we last enjoyed the generous hospitality of the Mansion House,on this great City of London occasion, has been a testing time. It has been characterised by majorimbalances in both the global economy and here in the United Kingdom - which have complicatedthe task of policy-makers everywhere, including the task of the Bank of England’s now legitimisedMonetary Policy Committee.Internationally there has been good news in the enviable performance of the UnitedStates - Goldilocks - economy, with continuing robust domestic demand growth and further falls inunemployment, with so far remarkably little inflationary pressure. To the extent that thisperformance can be sustained, it provides substantial underpinning for the global economy as awhole.And there has been encouraging news, too, in the re-emergence of domestic demandgrowth in the Continental European countries as they prepare to take the final step to monetaryunion. That is a promising context for the launch of a strong, credible, currency and I wish theEuropean Central Bank every success in its historic task. Domestic expansion with monetarystability within Europe is in the interest of us all.Elsewhere though the international situation has been decidedly less benign. Acombination of financial fragility and weak business and consumer confidence has weighed heavilyon the Japanese economy, and on the Yen; and the financial thunderstorms, which broke initially lastyear over a number of other countries in Asia, are still intermittently rumbling around the region andelsewhere. The economic fallout from these developments poses a serious downside risk to thegrowth of world activity and threatens the emergence of potentially large international paymentsimbalances. It is a dangerous environment.All of this has prompted a far-reaching re-examination of the international monetarystructure, and in the meantime it presents the international monetary authorities with some difficultimmediate management challenges. It also, of course, represents an uncertain internationalbackground for the conduct of monetary policy in this country.Our own overall economic performance over the past year was again veryencouraging. Output growth (on the latest data, to the first quarter of this year) was 2.9% -significantly above the rate of inflation (measured by the GDP deflator) for the fourth time in thepast five years - which I think is unprecedented in post-war British experience. On this basis over thepast five years annual output growth has averaged some 3.1% while annual inflation has averaged2.2%. And unemployment - on the conventional claimant count basis - fell further last year, to 4.8%on the latest figures, the lowest since the summer of 1980.The task, of course, is to sustain this pattern of relatively steady growth with lowinflation into the medium and longer term. And that task has certainly become much tougher.At the aggregate level - looking at the economy as a whole, while no-one - and Imean no-one, whatever they may claim - knows with any great precision just where current demandand output is in relation to the underlying supply capacity of the economy, there is no doubt that weare now at least much closer to full capacity output than we have been - and the actual rate of growth
- 2 -BIS Review   55/1998over the past year was, on almost anyone’s calculation, above the rate of underlying capacity growth.So we have been at greater risk of overheating than for some time.The consequence - if we were to overheat - is quite clear. Inflation would accelerateand we would then need to impose an abrupt slowdown on the economy to bring it back undercontrol - to meet the Government’s inflation target. It was, of course, to avoid accelerating inflationand the associated need for an abrupt slowdown that the members of the Monetary Policy Committeelast year had no difficulty in agreeing upon a significant policy tightening.But there was - and is - a significant complication. The aggregate position takes noaccount of the serious imbalance within the overall economy between external and domesticdemand. The internationally exposed sectors of the economy were already confronted last year withan exaggeratedly strong exchange rate, particularly against the core European currencies - whichcould only be partly explained by cyclical and monetary policy differences. It appeared to have agood deal to do with market scepticism - I would argue misplaced scepticism - about the prospectivestrength of the euro. The internationally exposed sectors faced a further battering as a result of theeconomic impact of the developments in Asia and elsewhere - which I mentioned earlier.These pressures have had - and are having - a seriously depressing effect on demandand output in the exposed sectors of the economy - particularly large parts of manufacturing industryand agriculture - which is contributing to a sharp deterioration in our balance of payment and a fallin the net external component of aggregate demand.At the same time, the strong exchange rate, and the weakness of world commodityprices, is having a direct dampening impact on costs and prices in this country - particularly at thewholesale, producer, level but also affecting retail prices.Meanwhile the domestic economy has been unsustainably strong. Privateconsumption, in particular, was growing at an annualised rate of over 5% last summer, and stillgrowing at an annualised rate of 4% by the first quarter of this year. This compares with alonger-term trend rate of some 2½%. But for the dampening impact of the external influences onaggregate demand and on costs and prices, this could already have resulted in accelerating inflation.The complication for monetary policy, in this situation of external/domesticimbalance, has, of course, been that a tightening of monetary policy to slow the pace of the domesticeconomy would have been likely to aggravate the appreciation of the exchange rate, intensifying alsothe restraining external demand and price effects, and putting even more intense pressure on theinternationally exposed sectors.Now, there is no question but that the strength of the domestic economy mustmoderate further - as indeed we expect that it will. But the external influences - which we cananyway not do much about, but which will in time wear off - made this moderation of domesticdemand growth less immediately urgent than it would otherwise have been. In these circumstances,with some evidence that growth in the domestic economy was in fact slowing, and given the evidentpressures on the internationally exposed sectors, we needed, in my view, to be more than usuallyconfident in our judgement as to the need to tighten policy further.The questions with which the MPC has been struggling this year then are: just howmuch shelter the external situation would in fact give us, and for how long; and just how much time,therefore, we had to bring about a sufficient slow down in domestic demand to prevent inflationaccelerating and the economy from overheating. Now these are immensely difficult judgements.They depend in part upon one’s perception about the starting position - that is how close we are to
- 3 -BIS Review   55/1998full capacity utilisation to begin with. And they depend upon not just the direction, but the rate ofchange and the timing, of changes in the different components of aggregate demand. It is hardlysurprising that the various members of the MPC should - within this common framework ofanalysis - reach, essentially marginally, different conclusions, reflecting their individual judgementsas to the balance of risks. Indeed it would have been incredible if they had not reached marginallydifferent conclusions. What is unusual - and what outside observers are I think still getting used to -is that different possible interpretations of the data and different possible judgements are openlydisplayed in the minutes of our meetings, which also record the way in which each member votes.Some people now seem to find this open discussion of alternative views confusing.My own view is that it can only contribute to the effectiveness of monetary policy if the public atlarge better understand the nature of the issues and the uncertainties surrounding them. But ourprocedures have had one, by me at least, unforeseen, and I think regrettable, consequence, in that ithas focused excessive attention upon the way in which individual members of the Committee vote -leading to their over-simple categorisation as either hawks or doves. It is as if their judgements wereexpected to be consistently instinctive rather than objectively based upon their individual,open-minded, assessment - reached after careful analysis - of the most recent information availableat the particular time. As a result serious economic commentary seems - perhaps temporarily - tohave ceded some ground to ornithomancy - which, as of course you know, is the ancient practice ofdivining the future by observing the behaviour of birds - especially their flight patterns!This I suspect contributed to the surprise reaction to last week’s further rise ininterest rates - which proved once again that “Hell hath no fury like a wrong-footed financialcommentator”! It should not have been such a great shock. In the Inflation Report which wepublished a month ago we set out the analysis as I have described it to you this evening, and we drewattention to the fact that the outlook for monetary policy remained finely balanced - as it has clearlybeen for some months. We drew attention also to the major uncertainties surrounding the centralinflation projection. These uncertainties included both the level of the exchange rate anddevelopments in the labour market. It was - as we explained in our press notice last Thursday - thesubsequent “news” essentially on these fronts, and particularly the sharp acceleration in privatesector earnings growth, that caused the Committee to conclude that the necessary slowdown indomestic demand growth had become more pressing. The interest rate decision showed simply thatwhat were always fine judgements changed with the facts - as I can assure you they will in future, ineither direction.
BIS Review   53/1998Mr. King looks at the UK economy and monetary policy   Speech by Mr. MervynKing, an Executive Director and Chief Economist of the Bank of England, at the Building SocietiesAssociation Annual Conference in Bournemouth on 27/5/98.Next Monday - 1 June - sees the start of the statutory basis for Britain’s new monetarypolicy regime. An independent Bank of England will, through its Monetary Policy Committee (or MPC),set interest rates to achieve an inflation target of 2½%. For over 30 years economic policy in Britain hasbeen bedevilled by inflation and the resulting instability of output and employment. Stability - of bothprices and macroeconomic performance more generally - requires a credible commitment to a monetaryand fiscal framework embracing low inflation and sustainable public finances. That we now have.But stability of the economy is not the same as stability of interest rates. Short-terminterest rates must go up and down according to the state of the economy if the inflation target is to bemet. In contrast, if monetary policy is successful in achieving the inflation target then, precisely becauseshort-term interest rates will have moved over the economic cycle, long-term interest rates will berelatively stable. And, from the perspective of your borrowers, whether on fixed or floating ratemortgages, what matters is the predictability of the cost of a loan over the life of the mortgage rather thanfluctuations, within reason, of monthly payments. Timely movements in short-term interest rates are themeans by which both the average cost of a mortgage, and its variability, can be reduced to the minimumnecessary to attract loan finance. In so doing we should be able to avoid crisis - and inevitably large -changes of interest rates of the kind that we have seen so often in the past. Indeed, since the inflationtarget was adopted in October 1992 there have been no changes of interest rates of that kind - all changeswere decided at the regular monthly monetary meetings. Moreover, the switch last May to a fixedtimetable of meetings for the Monetary Policy Committee - with all interest rate decisions announced at12 noon on the Thursday on which the MPC meeting concludes - was a major step forward in reducinguncertainty in financial markets.Through the Looking Glass .....So if interest rates must be flexible, in which direction are they likely to move next? Iwish I could tell you. Inflation, as measured by RPIX, rose to 3.0% in April, compared with 2.6% inMarch. But that jump largely reflected the Budget changes to excise duties which took effect earlier thisyear than last. That will drop out of the index in the third quarter of this year when RPIX inflation islikely to fall back towards its target level of 2½%.However, this relatively optimistic short-term outlook reflects an extraordinarily benigninflation environment. The combination of a strong exchange rate (still about 25% above its level ofAugust 1996), a 20% fall in dollar oil prices over the past year, and an average fall of 9.5% in othercommodity prices, is holding down retail price inflation. Domestically generated inflation is significantlyhigher than RPIX inflation. As the one-off effects of the rise in sterling wear off over the course of thenext year or so - as indeed they will unless sterling appreciates further - inflation will start to rise abovethe target unless domestically generated inflation declines.In the long run, domestically generated inflation is likely to be close to the rate ofincrease of unit labour costs. At present unit labour costs are rising at about 3½% a year. The earningsfigures released earlier this month - which showed that average earnings in the economy grew by 4.9%and in the private sector by no less than 5.6% - were undoubtedly disappointing. It is too soon to judgehow far they reflect the impact of higher bonuses this year than last. In any event, to hit the inflationtarget those rates of earnings growth will have to fall back.These high levels of earnings growth are not the underlying cause of inflationarypressure; they are a symptom of a tight labour market. Equally, the prospects for earnings growth dependcritically on the future path of output and on inflation expectations. The MPC’s central projection in theMay Inflation Report is that the pace of output growth will slow. But a slowdown in economic growth isnot, in itself, sufficient to hit the inflation target. The central issue for monetary policy is whether total
- 2 -BIS Review   53/1998nominal demand will slow sufficiently quickly to prevent retail price inflation rising when the favourableeffects of a high exchange rate and lower commodity prices wear off.The extent to which domestic demand growth slows down is crucial. At present, we arerelying on a sharp deterioration in the trade balance to keep output growth down to levels that do not leadto rising inflationary pressure. But in the longer-run domestic demand growth must fall from its presentrate of 3½ - 4% to something closer to trend. During 1997 as a whole, consumption grew by 5%. Thatgrowth rate is already moderating. And the MPC’s central projection is for a further slowdown indomestic demand during this year. That is likely to be brought about by a combination of the fiscal andmonetary tightening that has been put in place over the past year or so. But there are real uncertainties.There is a risk that consumption may prove stubbornly buoyant. Real personal disposable incomeincreased by 4.2% last year, and the ratio of net financial wealth of households to their income reachedan all-time high of over 3. Those factors will support consumption. The latest retail sales figures providesome comfort with volume growth below that in the middle of last year when consumption wasstimulated by windfall gains, predominantly from the conversion of building societies. (Rarely have somany, been so grateful, to so few building societies.)Highs and lows in house pricesIn the past, domestic demand has been sensitive to developments in the housing market.In the late 1980s house prices increased by 40% in two years, while consumption rose by over 9%.Borrowing using housing as collateral - so called equity withdrawal - amounted to almost 50% of theincrease in consumption over that period. The impact of rises in house prices on consumption - which iscause and which is effect - remains hotly contested by economists. A rise in house prices leads not onlyto an increase in wealth but also to an increase in the cost of housing services. Or, to put it another way,if the price of your home goes up, you will not be able to spend more on other things if you wish to carryon living in your home. So it is not at all clear that changes in house prices will in fact have a significantimpact on household spending.Perhaps of greater importance is the role which house prices play in signalling consumerconfidence about the future. In common with other assets, such as equities, house prices can respondquickly to news about future economic prospects. And house prices and consumer confidence do seem tobe closely correlated. So house prices may be a leading indicator of sentiment about the economy andhence of consumption and domestic demand. But, just like equities, house prices also reflect changes inreal interest rates. Since long-term real interest rates have fallen from over 3½% to below 3% over thepast year, it is not surprising that house, and other asset, prices have risen.Precisely because housing is an asset, its price is more volatile than most goods andservices in the retail price index. As such, it is important to look at house price levels as well as at theirrates of change. Although house prices have been rising quite rapidly over the past couple of years, theyreturned to the peak reached in the late 1980s only at the end of last year, and exceeded it for the firsttime in the first quarter of this year. That, of course, followed the sharp fall in house prices in the early1990s - house prices fell by over 10% between 1990 and the end of 1992.For most families, apart from future earnings and pensions, their wealth is dominated byone asset and one liability. The asset is their home and the liability is the mortgage on it. But thedifference between these two is sensitive to the state of the economy. In a low inflation world, houseprices are likely to rise and fall whereas the mortgage liability is fixed in money terms. This mismatchhas the potential to create large swings in household net worth which may well exacerbate fluctuations indemand and output. The upside consequence was seen in the consumption boom of the 1980s, and theopposite was evident in the bust of the early 1990s when falls in house prices meant that as many as1½ million families had negative net equity resulting in higher precautionary saving and lowerconsumption.The forward-looking information contained in house prices underlines the importance theMPC attaches to measuring them accurately. The recent divergence between the rates of house price
- 3 -BIS Review   53/1998inflation implied by the Halifax and the Nationwide indices is both puzzling and unfortunate. The ratesof house price inflation recorded by the two indices began to diverge at the beginning of 1997. The mostrecently published data suggest that house prices, as measured by the Nationwide index, rose by 12.0%in the year to April 1998, whereas, according to the Halifax index, they rose by only 5.6%. Grosshousehold wealth in the year to April 1998 rose by £80 billion more according to the Nationwide thanthe Halifax index. Such differences matter in our assessment of the economy.The Bank of England, together with representatives from the Halifax and Nationwide andfrom the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), have spent a great deal of timeand effort trying to understand the cause of this divergence and to assess what is really happening tohouse prices.The answer to the first question - what accounts for the divergence? - remains largely amystery. The Bank’s preferred explanation, reached I have to admit via a process of elimination of otherplausible explanations rather than by the existence of incontrovertible evidence, is that the divergencereflects the way in which house prices are “mix adjusted” to take account of the different characteristicsof the houses bought and sold in any one month. Changes in the relative composition of the loanportfolios of the Halifax and the Nationwide over the last year or so are likely to have magnified thiseffect.To answer the second question - what is really happening to house prices? - the Bank hasdeveloped an alternative measure of house price inflation using data from the Land Registry. These datahave the advantage that they cover nearly all housing transactions in England and Wales and so are morecomprehensive than the data used by either the Halifax or the Nationwide. However, the Bank estimate isfar from ideal. The published Land Registry data are not ‘mix adjusted’. And, although the Bank staff doapply a simple mix adjustment to take account of the basic type of property brought and sold and thecounty in which the property is located, it is less sophisticated than that used by either the Halifax orNationwide.So I would not want to claim in any way that we at the Bank have found the true measureof house price inflation. Rather, the Bank estimate was developed in the spirit of trying to give someguidance to the members of the MPC on the relative weights that they should attach to the conflictingpictures painted by the Halifax and Nationwide indices. The house price index constructed by theDepartment of Environment, Transport and the Regions is also helpful in this respect. That index has theadvantage that it is constructed using a more complete method for adjusting for the mix of housestransacted than the Bank estimate, but it is based on only a small sample - approximately 5% - ofmortgage-backed transactions.The Bank estimate suggests that house prices increased by 9.0% in the year to 1997 Q4,compared with 6.9% measured by Halifax and 12.9% by Nationwide. The Bank estimate is broadlyconsistent with the DETR index, which shows a 7.9% increase over the same period. But further work isrequired on this issue which is of importance to us all.“Divided we stand, united we fall”That brings me to the Monetary Policy Committee and the prospect for interest rates. Thetransparency of the new process means that the debate about monetary policy within the MPC isexplained clearly to the world at large. Hence the reasons why monetary policy is so finely balanced are,I believe, now widely understood.But it is not just the policy debate which is now more transparent. The voting record ofeach individual member of the MPC is in the public domain. There is a good reason for this. Disclosureis an incentive for individuals to cast their vote for the policy most likely to hit the government’sinflation target. I have little doubt that the prospect of having to defend one’s voting record in publicmakes individual members of the MPC well aware of their responsibilities. There can be no hiding
- 4 -BIS Review   53/1998behind the coat-tails of the chairman, nor disowning a decision subsequently by claiming to have arguedagainst a position adopted by consensus. Transparency should improve both the quality of decisions andthe accountability of Committee members.But there is an additional point which is fundamental to the role of the Monetary PolicyCommittee. Its purpose is to take technical decisions about the level of short-term interest rates. Whenthe issue is one of technical judgment it is better to rely on the collective wisdom of nine people than theviews of only one individual. I have noticed that the highest in the land often rely on teams of doctorswhereas you and I have only one. Of course, it is often tempting to take comfort from the greatconfidence with which any one doctor proclaims his or her diagnosis. But the evidence suggests that indifficult cases reasonable experts can interpret the evidence in different ways. Rather than take comfortfrom one self-confident view, which I would find difficult to challenge, I would like to know where thebalance of professional opinion lies. That is why in the case of essentially technical judgments it issensible to rely upon collective wisdom, and there are other areas in which we do precisely that. The LawLords, for example, reach their decisions by aggregating individual judgments, and the same is true in theUnited States Supreme Court. The MPC is based on the same principle. For such a system to work it iscrucial that the individual members of the MPC give their best judgment and do not try to reach anartificial consensus.When policy is clearly off-track, as in the spring of last year, it is not difficult to reachunanimous decisions, as the Committee did through 1997. But when policy is finely balanced,disagreements about the precise level of interest rate are not only likely but an indication that policy isbroadly on-track. That is why the motto of the MPC should perhaps be “divided we stand, united wefall”.Some commentators have been unable to resist labelling members of the Committee aseither “hawks” or “doves”. There is a fundamental problem with this labelling. It makes no sense in thenew system to describe individuals as hawks or doves. Each member of the Committee has the sameinflation target. Unlike some other central banks, MPC members cannot entertain closet views about theattractions or dangers of slightly higher or lower inflation. Their task - to which they will be heldpersonally accountable - is to hit the Government’s inflation target. So members of the Committee voteon interest rates according to the economic data, which change from month to month, and the analysis ofthose data. No one takes a position that higher interest rates are a good or a bad thing out of principle. Ifyou drove past an infant school at 40mph, you might well be described as driving dangerously fast. But ifyou drove at 40mph on a motorway, you might well be described as driving dangerously slowly. Actionsmust be judged in the light of the circumstances. In terms of monetary policy, that means that thepositions which members of the MPC take on interest rates will change over time according to the waythe economy evolves. But if interest rates themselves cannot be predicted, because they depend onchanging economic data, what should be predictable is the way MPC members respond to those data. Apredictable “policy reaction function”, to use the jargon, should, over time, diminish the interest whichmarket commentators take in the meetings of the MPC and direct that interest to what is happening in theeconomy.So, as the voting record shows, it is seriously misleading to think of the MPC in terms offixed camps of “hawks” and “doves”. As circumstances change, it is easy to imagine that the “hawks”shall be “doves” and the “doves” shall be “hawks”. And, over a five year period, since each member ofthe MPC is trying to hit the same inflation target, I predict that it will be impossible to distinguishbetween “doves” and “hawks”. What will the commentators call us then? If Britain either has or is aboutto join Monetary Union, then the birds may have flown the nest. But if the MPC is still setting interestrates in Britain, then I hope that we shall be seen as a group that is tediously predictable, sometimesraising interest rates, sometimes cutting them, but always moving in response to the economic data inorder to hit the inflation target.
BIS Review   50/1998Mr. Heikensten examines EMU and economic policy in Europe   Speech bythe Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at JP Bank’s Conference atthe World Trade Center, on 29/5/98.This is not the end.It is not even the beginning of the end.But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.Winston Churchill’s declaration in November 1942, after the victory atEl Alamein, is, I think, applicable - in rather different circumstances - to EMU’s consequencesfor economic policy in Europe after the weekend at the beginning of May.Several years of intensive preparations for monetary union now lie behind us. Thiswork, steeped in economic policy premises as well as technicalities, has been carried out in manydifferent European settings. Many of the EU Member States have also worked hard both to beready on time for EMU by fulfilling the Maastricht criteria and to complete the more practicaland technical arrangements. It is now roughly a month since these processes were crowned withthe historic decisions in Brussels to initiate European monetary union with eleven countries. Acouple of days from now, the new European Central Bank will be holding its first meetings.So there are good reasons to shift our attention and look ahead. The convergenceprocess has been successful in many respects and monetary union is to start in little more than sixmonths time. But once it has started, what challenges will EU’s economic policy have to face?What are the rules for this policy? How are the dialogue and decisions likely to develop in thenext few years? These are some of the questions that I shall be considering today.1.  ConvergenceA natural starting-point for a discussion of the current economic situation inEurope is the convergence reports that the Commission and the European Monetary Institute(EMI) presented at the end of March.• The price trend for the EU area in recent years is impressive. The disparities inthe rate of price increases have diminished and in January this year inflationwas below 2 per cent in all the Member States except Greece. Thisdevelopment is fundamentally a consequence of the monetary policy focus onprice stability, backed up by economic policy in general. Other factors havebeen increased international competition and low oil prices.• The picture of government finances in the EU countries has also brightened.Progress has been made in the process of financial consolidation. However, anumber of countries are only just below or at 3 per cent and have qualifiedthanks to measures of a temporary nature.• A high degree of exchange rate stability now prevails in most EU countriesand tensions in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) have been moderate.• The notable convergence of long-term interest rates is another indication ofthe stable situation and EMU expectations.
- 2 -BIS Review   50/1998All in all, the reports from the Commission and the EMI show that convergence inthe Maastricht sense has come a long way. This is important because the chances of the monetaryunion functioning properly are better if rates of inflation are much the same initially andgovernment finances are under control.Besides the matters behind the Maastricht criteria, with monetary union imminentthere are somewhat different issues that need to be considered. Even when the Treaty was beingdrafted, many economists pointed out that the criteria by no means constituted the only, perhapsnot even the most important, requirements for an efficient monetary union.There are now two other matters that seem to be particularly important and theywill no doubt receive more attention, both in the European economic debate and in the EUdecision-making processes in economic policy:• One has to do with the degree of uniformity in cyclical activity and thepossibility of using judicious fiscal stances in different parts of the monetaryunion to make up for the absence of national discretion in monetary policy.• The other concerns the participant countries’ economic structures, not leasthow their labour markets function and to what extent they are sufficientlyflexible both to cope with any shocks to stability and to bring unemploymentdown to more acceptable levels.If the various political systems fail to prevent large imbalances in governmentfinances, internally as well as between countries in the monetary union, then the ECB will beunder strong pressure to consider other objectives than average European inflation. The sameapplies if unemployment were to remain high or become even higher.I shall be returning to these questions in my final section and try to paint a pictureof how they will be handled in the European Union in the coming years. Before doing so,however, it may be in place to look in somewhat more detail at the structure for economic policydecisions in EU/EMU.2.  FunctionsEMU is a historically unique construction, with a common central bank that is toconduct monetary policy across national boundaries. At the same time, however, eleven electedgovernments are to conduct fiscal policies with eleven different budgets, besides making manyother decisions that affect the functioning of their national economies, not least their labourmarkets.Monetary policyIn a monetary union, monetary and exchange rate policy is, by definition, acommon concern. The monetary policy objective is price stability; without prejudice to thisobjective, monetary policy is to support the general economic policies in the Community. Themore budget policies focus on stability - and wages stay in line with productivity - the greaterwill be the room to manoeuvre in monetary policy.
- 3 -BIS Review   50/1998The ECB’s basic tasks will be to define and implement the single monetarypolicy, conduct foreign exchange transactions, hold and manage the official foreign reserves ofthe Member States, and promote the smooth operation of payment systems. The national centralbanks (NCBs) will be able to have an active influence on policy, participate in its practicalimplementation and, perhaps not least, communicate it in their respective countries. But theanalysis of the euro area will be undertaken centrally to a large extent and the level of interestrates will be decided by the ECB Governing Council, which consists of the members of theECB’s Executive Board and the NCB Governors of the, initially eleven, participating countries.The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) has been given a highlyindependent status so as to be in a position to conduct a monetary policy for price stabilitywithout short-run political considerations. But its independence does not relieve the ECB of theduty to inform and communicate. On the contrary, it accentuates the need for a dialogue andexchange of information. The European Parliament has displayed a high profile in these mattersand worked to establish a basis for discussing and monitoring monetary policy continuously.The ECB will be obliged to make difficult decisions in various matters. Oneproblem may arise from cyclical disparities between euro area countries. While these disparitiesmay diminish over time, they are unlikely to disappear completely. Meanwhile, the ECB has toset a single instrumental rate for the whole monetary union. The common interest rate willnormally not be ideal in relation to the economic situation in every country.The national financial structures also differ considerably, which means that, forinstance, interest rate sensitivity varies. There are countries where a large proportion ofborrowing is arranged at a variable interest rate; the national tax systems differ, for example asregards tax relief for interest expenditure; and the time required for bank interest rate adjustmentsvaries. All this means that the impact of a change in the monetary union’s interest rate will differfrom country to country. In Italy, for instance, lending to households is arranged at variableinterest rates to a greater extent than in Germany and the Netherlands. EMU will probably speedup the ongoing integration in these respects, too, so the ECB’s problems may be greatest initially.Many matters to do with the ECB’s working procedures have already beendecided. The broad structure is in place. But in many respects, the way in which the ECB and theESCB will operate and develop in practice is still an open question. Some observers areconcerned that national interests will be excessively influential at the expense of a union-wideperspective. They point out, for example, that the NCB Governors make up a larger proportion ofthe Governing Council than is the case with the regional FED Governors in the United States.Another argument is that the ECB has a limited staff at its disposal. Personally, I do not find thisparticularly convincing. The performance of a clearly defined task - maintaining price stability -in a way that is good for the union as a whole will be a heavy responsibility for each member ofthe Governing Council; in this sense they are all in the same boat. There are also many signs thatpower will gradually shift towards the centre and this in turn will affect recruitment. My guess isthat the ECB will be able to attract personnel who are qualified, which in contexts like this ismore important than their number.Fiscal policyFiscal policy is a national concern but the national room to manoeuvre isconditioned by various EU regulations. The Treaty has general provisions to the effect thateconomic policy is to contribute to the achievement of Community objectives in accordance with
- 4 -BIS Review   50/1998the principle of an open market economy with free competition. The Member States are to regardtheir economic policies as a matter of common concern and are explicitly required to coordinatethem but the decisions are to be made on a national level.Then there are more specific agreements on matters like the scale of rates forvalue-added tax, government subsidies and rules for public procurement. These agreements,which are a limited constraint on the construction of taxes and public spending, have beenconcluded mainly for purposes other than stabilisation policy - to promote competition andestablish a single market for capital, goods, services and labour.The fiscal policy rules that have attracted most attention are those for governmentbudgets and debt. The Maastricht Treaty stipulates that budget deficits are not to exceed3 per cent and that the government debt-to-GDP ratio ought not to exceed 60 per cent. This wasintended to make monetary union candidates put their public finances in order prior toparticipation.The Stability and Growth Pact has clarified what will apply once monetary unionhas begun. The Pact can be said to consist of two parts: a surveillance mechanism for detecting atan early stage that a country is starting to have budgetary problems and is in danger of incurringan excessive deficit, and a mechanism for sanctions on errant countries. The first mechanismcovers all the EU countries and requires them to present a fiscal policy programme. Thesanctions mechanism, on the other hand, applies only to countries in the euro area. The purposeof the Pact is to strengthen political mechanisms at union level so that budget discipline ispermanently maintained. There has been underlying concern that otherwise a country might bestrongly tempted to shift a part of the adjustment costs for consolidating government financesonto the other countries.The Pact requires every Member State to aim for a medium-term budgetaryposition close to balance or in surplus. If the 3 per cent limit is exceeded, the Commission andthe Ecofin Council are to follow a specified plan of action: examination, opinion,recommendation, publication and, as a last resort, sanctions. The Pact has been constructed witha view to generating so much pressure on Member States to put government finances in orderthat sanctions will never be necessary.A knotty problem when constructing the Pact was how to make the requirementssufficiently strict without placing undue restrictions on national fiscal policies. This is all themore important when monetary policy is no longer available at national level, so that the task ofadjustment falls more heavily in practice on fiscal policy. OECD estimates indicate that in a“normal” economic downturn, the cyclical budget balance in EU countries weakens by1-1.5 per cent of GDP. Some budgetary discretion is therefore needed so that there is a marginfor automatic stabilisers to act when activity is falling. The conclusion is that the trade-off seemsreasonable but the Pact does make it necessary to achieve a balanced budget or a surplusrelatively soon. Under these circumstances, the Swedish government’s ambition to establish anannual budget surplus of 2 per cent over the business cycle is commendable.Fiscal policy accordingly faces new challenges and it is not all that easy to tell justwhat may happen. When monetary policy ceases to be a national instrument, fiscal policy willhave to play a greater part in stabilisation policy. At the same time, the scope for budget policywill be curtailed in a sense by the Stability and Growth Pact, though this need not be so much ofa restriction in practice as long as the objective of medium-term balance or surplus is met. Astronger challenge is to be expected from the ongoing integration in the European Union, which
- 5 -BIS Review   50/1998EMU may accentuate. This process can be rather rapid, not least in financial markets. In marketsfor goods, pricing in a single currency may accelerate the existing trend towards smallerdifferences in consumption taxes, for example.Structural and labour-market policyFinally some words about structural and labour-market policy. This policy field ismuch less clearly defined than the two I have already considered. It is affected by many differentrule systems at both national and EU levels, besides belonging to the competence of manydifferent ministers and commissioners. The common agricultural policy and tax harmonisationare two examples.The components of structural policy that concern the internal market - competitionlaws, the whole of the market for goods and services, the mobility of capital, and labour marketmobility - are largely regulated at EU level. The competition laws are one example here.Another component of structural policy is the regulations and other matters thatapply to the labour market. Many initiatives here have recently been taken at EU level in order tospeed things up and comply with political requirements in the Union. In these matters, however,most decisions have to be made at the national level. But the connection with conditions formonetary policy is evident: the better the economy can be made to work, the higher the growththat can be achieved without this generating increased inflation.Monetary union is likely to accelerate the process towards increased integration inEurope. In this way it will also contribute to new demands for structural adjustment. One ofmonetary union’s primary purposes is, in fact, to stimulate competition and structural changes,primarily to the benefit of consumers in the EU area. At the same time, such a development willprobably entail a greater degree of joint action and harmonisation in the Union.3.  InteractionAs I have outlined, monetary union involves a central direction of monetary policyand a broadly national direction of budget policy, though discretion in budget policy isdemarcated by the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability Pact, for instance, and is being furthercurtailed by the gradual extension of international integration. At the same time, structural policyis to varying degrees a common EU concern. This raises the question of how a balanced policycan be constructed in such an environment.Bodies for decision-making and cooperationOne approach to this question involves describing the EU institutions that havebeen set up for economic policy decision-making and cooperation.• Ecofin, as the decision-making body for the ministers of finance and economy,is the principal forum in the field of economic policy. It is in this group that,for example, many of the decisions were taken so that monetary union couldstart on time. The budget policies of the Member States have also beenmonitored here and this will continue under the Stability Pact. Moreover,Ecofin draws up an annual “budget statement”, the Broad Economic PolicyGuidelines, containing the principles for economic policy in the EU area.
- 6 -BIS Review   50/1998• Most of the matters on the Ecofin agenda have been prepared by the MonetaryCommittee, which besides representatives for each of the fifteen MemberStates (normally an under-secretary of state or a deputy central bank governor)includes representatives for the Commission and, more recently, for the EMI.When monetary union starts, the name of the Monetary Committee will bechanged to Economic and Financial Committee but at present it seems that itscomposition will be unchanged apart from the EMI being replaced by theECB.Work on monetary union has been a heavy burden for these bodies in recent years.Meetings have been protracted and business has ranged from major issues like the Stability andGrowth Pact, the new European exchange rate system (ERM2) and legislation for monetaryunion to matters such as the design of the European coinage.Some of the structure is now changing with the advent of monetary union but notits basic features. The preparatory work is over, as is a good deal of the work connected withERM. A number of processes, such as those concerning government finances, are beingmodified. But this is accompanied by an increased need to discuss issues raised by the fact ofmonetary union.Now that the countries which will be participating initially in monetary unionhave been singled out, moreover, an informal group - the Euro 11 Group - is being set up fordiscussions among the ministers of finance and economy in the euro area. The idea is that thisgroup will concentrate on matters that concern just the participating countries and cater to thegreater need for dialogue and cooperation that they perceive in connection with the inception ofmonetary union. However, this is not a decision-making body and all matters considered byEuro 11 are prepared by the Monetary Committee, in which all fifteen EU Member States arerepresented.The crucial institutional change is, of course, that as of next year the conduct ofmonetary policy will be fully centralised. The Treaty explicitly states that the ECB is not to beswayed by political considerations; its task is to concentrate on monetary policy. But naturally adialogue will be needed with the governments in the EU and euro areas, in the first place with theministers of finance and economy. The Treaty actually provides for this in that the Ecofinpresident may participate in meetings of the ECB Governing Council and even submit motions.Moreover, representatives of the NCBs and finance ministries will continue to meet in theEconomic and Financial Committee.Monetary union raises many other institutional questions that I will not be takingup today. Not the least of these is relations with countries and organisations outside the EuropeanUnion. Where, for instance, does the primary responsibility for the exchange rate lie in Europeand what about relations between euro area countries and the International Monetary Fund?I now want to hark back to the issues I touched on earlier: fiscal policy in relationto the business cycle, and how the labour market functions. How will these matters be handled inthe system for economic policy decisions?Cyclical disparities and fiscal policy
- 7 -BIS Review   50/1998The past year has seen a general strengthening of economic activity in the EUarea. This has helped improve government finances and provided better conditions in otherrespects for the start of monetary union. But it has been accompanied by increased cyclicaldisparities between the future euro countries. This is clear from a look at how observers haverevised their growth predictions as compiled, for example, in “consensus forecasts”. A look atthe euro countries divided into two groups with higher and lower predicted GDP growth,respectively, shows that in the past year the gap between these groups has widened. The sameapplies in terms of predicted inflation.One should not make too much of this; the differences have grown but are stillsmall and assessments for 1999 suggest that they will narrow again. But the picture doesillustrate a problem that will have to be addressed. The single monetary policy is incapable ofboth stimulating the economy in some countries and curbing it in others. Pressure on fiscal policywill accordingly vary across countries. For one thing, differences in automatic stabilisers andthus in cyclical sensitivity will automatically lead to country differences in budget trends. Foranother, different degrees of active fiscal policy will be needed to manage tensions that may arisefrom a single interest rate throughout the monetary union.This question has been deliberated informally for some time by economic policydecision-makers in the European Union. It also underlies the discussions that are now held onEU’s broad economic policy guidelines. In a way, it also contributed to the initiative from theGerman finance minister before the weekend at the beginning of May, when some furtherreinforcement of budget policy in the coming year was achieved by agreeing on an earlierimplementation of the Stability and Growth Pact’s objective and an earlier production of theannual convergence and stability programmes.This is ultimately a question for which each country is responsible. Countries thatfulfil the Stability Pact’s criteria will be entitled to a fiscal stance that is more expansionary thanthe ideal for European inflation. Today, moreover, there is cause for concern that current fiscalpolicy may be too expansionary in some countries. But it is also clear that the costs of such apolicy mainly fall on the countries themselves. Higher domestic inflation eventually weakenscompetitiveness; with exchange rates irrevocably fixed, once a cost crisis is there, it may bedifficult to rectify. Improved productivity can provide a remedy but achieving it is not easy. Inpractice, this presumably leaves either fiscal tightening at a later stage to retard the rate of wageincreases or an adjustment of labour taxes, neither of which is simple.For the credibility of the EMU project it is important that no country is already insuch a situation at the start. Countries with a risk of high inflation are therefore likely toexperience strong pressure in various processes, for example in Ecofin. On the whole, it seems tome that the question of adjusting fiscal policies to the ECB’s monetary policy will be a majorissue. The same applies to how any fiscal adjustments are to be allocated across countries.Labour market problemsIt is an established fact that the functioning of the labour market is a problem inmany Member States. A solution to the employment question clearly presupposes that theEuropean labour market is made to work more smoothly than before. The matter is also directlyconnected with monetary union. There will no longer be any possibility of using a nationalmonetary policy to deal with labour market shocks. It is then all the more important that thelabour market functions properly.
- 8 -BIS Review   50/1998Employment growth in the EU area has been weak and unemployment in manycountries has been high for a long time compared, for instance, with the United States. Labourforce mobility is also lower than in the United States. But we also know that the Member Statesdiffer considerably. Some, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have beencomparatively successful in generating new jobs. Others have done considerably worse. Theremedies chosen by the successful countries vary, too. Some have adopted highly decentralisedsolutions and extensive deregulation. Others have sought to build up a consensus and makeminor changes in some public systems.The question of how labour markets in Europe work and how they can beimproved is already very much a part of the European agenda. There have been politicalinitiatives in a variety of contexts in recent years, including national action plans foremployment. These plans include the analysis of labour market laws, effects of tax systems andbusiness conditions. Processes are being built up, inspired by the Maastricht Treaty’s successeswith budget policy. The annual employment guidelines require each Member State to present anational action plan with a view to improving people’s employability, entrepreneurial spirit,flexibility and equality. These national action plans are to be specific, with goals and timeschedules, so that they can be evaluated. Good examples are to be highlighted so that othercountries, if they wish, can adopt them.Structural questions have been brought to the fore during the British Presidencyand there have been somewhat more concrete discussions in various committees about how toget Member States in step here as well. One approach involves finding good examples indifferent fields, just as in the case of employment, and analysing the structural problems of eachcountry. This process generates what the British call peer pressure, which can also contribute tothe desired national changes coming about.Once again, however, the decisions in this field largely have to be made atnational level. But to perhaps an even greater extent than with fiscal policy, the major benefits ofa successful national policy will accrue to the country in question. By itself, this seems hopefuland should facilitate changes. At the same time, the political resistance in most EU countries isstrong.Some believe that the very fact of monetary union will generate desired reforms inlabour markets. Possibly but not necessarily - when high unemployment rates in recent decadesin many EU countries have failed to produce changes, why, it may be asked, would monetaryunion be more successful? In conclusion, I consider that much work at EU level will be investedin political education and a search for methods to gain support for changes in this field. But I donot foresee the same pressure in the joint processes as in the case of fiscal policy; there is lessneed of a common approach.Laborious but successful processI should like to conclude with a summary and some tentative conclusions aboutthe future course of the economic policy debate in the European Union.1.There are important interfaces between monetary policy, fiscal policy andstructural policy. Problems concerning the composition of fiscal policy or theworkings of the labour market affect the room to manoeuvre in monetary
- 9 -BIS Review   50/1998policy. This suggests that a vital dialogue will be needed between differentparts of EU’s economic policy decision-making system that are involved insuch matters. More of a joint appraisal will presumably emerge. Newprocesses and institutions are also likely to develop.2.The growing need for dialogue and a joint appraisal has already led to newtasks and developments for a number of EU institutions. Many observersconsider that this is true of Ecofin, which as a leading actor in the constructionof EMU has responded to new requirements. One example of a completelynew structure is Euro 11, which is designed for the handling of joint issues bythe euro area’s finance ministers. There are many other opportunities fordialogue, so those who fear that the ECB will be operating in something of avacuum are likely to be mistaken.3. Issues concerning fiscal policies in EU/EMU and labour markets have alsoarrived on the agenda in other ways, for example at the Monetary Committee.This is partly because many consider than monetary union has accentuated theneed for a joint European discussion. With monetary union soon to belaunched, moreover, the agenda has more room for other matters. The Stabilityand Growth Pact is one example of earlier initiatives in connection with EMU.Various processes have likewise been started to bring the problem ofunemployment into the limelight.4.There are strong grounds, in the fields I have discussed, for keeping decision-making essentially at a national level. The effects of the policies, for instancein the labour market, mostly occur in the country in question. There are alsoconsiderable country differences in such matters as the premises for fiscalpolicy, the structure of government finances, labour market regulations and soon. Still, the ongoing integration of markets, which monetary union maystimulate, is presumably exerting increased pressure for reform.The process that monetary union is now driving onwards is, in fact, fairly typicalof EU cooperation in general. The European Union is a highly decentralised organisation. Powerand political legitimacy are essentially located at the national level. The joint budget is limited.Matters move forward in a process where external events, for instance in the global economy,and political initiatives modify the agenda. Problems are often managed with arduouslynegotiated compromises between sovereign states. Each new initiative and decision forms aplatform for the next phase. Monetary union, which is now leading to the appearance of newitems on the agenda, is after all largely a consequence in its turn of earlier decisions, for instanceon the internal market.This process may sometimes appear to be rather random and it often providesinstances of uncertainties and risks. But it is a process that has gradually brought the EUcountries closer together. And monetary union is an another, major step.
BIS Review   49/1998Mr. George gives a central banker’s response to the Asian crisis   Speech by theGovernor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at the Foreign and Colonial Emerging MarketsConference, in London, on 28/5/98.Thank you, Mr Chairman. I’m delighted to participate in this Emerging MarketsConference, sharing the platform with such distinguished company. I am particularly pleased to bejoined in this session by Guillermo Ortiz - my colleague from the Bank of Mexico.The particular examination question which you set me is: “How did an OECD centralbanker respond to the Asian crisis?”. I have to confess that it’s a somewhat embarrassing question. IfI’m brutally honest I have to acknowledge that I didn’t see it coming; I played a modest role inhelping to contain its immediate impact on global financial stability; and I’m still struggling tounderstand its implications, in terms both of its economic after-effects, and of the lessons we mustall learn to reduce the risks in the future. I would only plead in mitigation, your honour, that I was byno means alone in all of that; and I beg leave to join in my defence all my central bankingcolleagues, governments and Finance Ministry officials, in Asia and elsewhere, the internationalfinancial institutions, and the world’s financial markets.The storm last year in Asia struck essentially the ASEAN four - Thailand, thePhilippines, Malaysia and Indonesia - spreading subsequently to South Korea and intermittentlybattering Hong Kong and elsewhere.It is still not wholly clear - to me at least - quite why the storm struck suddenly whenit did. Most crises of this sort have their origins in some evident macro-economic policy failure. Atleast in hindsight there are usually fairly clear tell-tale signs of expanding fiscal deficits and/or laxmonetary policies, classically accompanied by evidence of imbalance in the form of acceleratinginflation or a rapidly deteriorating balance of payments. There were such signs, perhaps most notablyin Thailand; but they were not for the most part particularly pronounced in Asia. Some of youperhaps understand better than I do why the initial infection proved to be so contagious. It was afterall your money!In fact through the first half of the 1990’s, and in some cases for much longer, thecountries in question had been remarkably successful. They attracted, by their very success, hugeinflows of capital from the rest of the world, where yields had fallen, in the hope of achieving higherreturns.There is no question that this capital inflow made a very big contribution to theremarkable economic expansion in Asia and hence to the global economy; but with the benefit ofhindsight, the accelerating scale of the inflow, and particularly the forms that it took, became animportant part of the problem. It was not all in the end productively employed. There wasover-investment in some sectors; much went into ambitious property development; and much wentinto financial assets, including short-term foreign currency claims, rather than into real assets. Thehoped-for higher returns could not be maintained.Again with the benefit of hindsight, it is possible to identify a number of structuralweaknesses in the mechanisms for financial resource allocation in the recipient countries. There was,for example, a general lack of reliable financial information, and a lack of transparency in relation tothe financial position, of both public and private sectors. Complex and opaque links betweengovernment, financial institutions and non-financial companies made it difficult for outsiders tounderstand the real nature of their exposures. Financial markets were not well developed, leaving thesystem heavily dependent upon the banks. There was inadequate regulatory or supervisory oversight.
- 2 -BIS Review   49/1998There was widespread, often informal, government influence over financial flows, which importantlyalso contributed to a perception that much of the borrowing was implicitly under-written by thegovernment. The list could go on.The problem was compounded by the absence of any real perception of exchange raterisk. Borrowers were evidently confident that governments would maintain their exchange rate pegsagainst the dollar, even when the dollar itself began to strengthen, so that unhedged foreign currencydebt, much of it at short-term, appeared to be a cheap alternative to domestic currency borrowing.The result was a build-up of short-term foreign currency liabilities, by banks and non-banks, whichwas not fully appreciated, and which left the Asian economies especially vulnerable to a flight ofcapital in the event of a change in sentiment. The particular problem is that while national authoritiescan create their domestic currency, if they choose to do so, even if it leads to inflation, they cannotsimply create foreign currencies in the same way.So, once the run started, it was violent and contagious. For a time around the end oflast year there was a significant possibility of a chain of default emanating from Asia that could havereverberated right through the global financial system. The immediate task was to contain that risk.Essentially there are two broad options for dealing with a foreign currency crisis. Oneis simply to allow financial markets - exchange markets, interest rates, and stock and bond prices - totake the strain, and to seek to restore confidence, and to moderate the impact of market movements,by restrictive macro-economic policy adjustment in the affected country. The second is to try to limitthe financial market impact and the extent of the associated macro-economic adjustment byproviding or arranging alternative external financing. In practice these options are not, of course,mutually exclusive and the real question is the appropriate balance between them.Where a country has transparently been pursuing an unsustainable macro-economicpolicy, most people find it easy to accept that that country should bear the burden and adjust, painfulthough that may be. Many people find this harder to accept where, as in the present case,conventional macro-economic policies had, for the most part, been relatively responsible. Therewere certainly adjustments to macro-economic policy that needed to be made - a more flexibleexchange rate regime in some cases, for example, or a somewhat tighter overall macro-economicstance, with perhaps some adjustment between fiscal and monetary policy. And, once the capitaloutflow had started, macro-economic adjustment had to be harsher than might otherwise have beennecessary, in order to re-establish confidence. But there are real dangers in extreme marketmovements or in excessively severe macro-economic adjustment to contain them. The political andsocial consequences are all too apparent in parts of Asia; but even without that there is a danger of avicious circle of domestic default and systemic financial weakness in the affected country. And thatcould have seriously adverse implications - in terms of both financial and economic knock-on-effects- for the global economy.That, essentially, is why it may be in the self-interest of the international communityto attempt to mitigate the market and macro-economic adjustment pressures by providing financialsupport. It is why the international community responded to the crisis in Asia by promptly offeringvery large amounts of official assistance - $17 billion in the case of Thailand, $43 billion forIndonesia and $57 billion for South Korea. This kind of official assistance of course is essentially forthe international financial institutions and for governments - though central banks are often thechannel for bilateral financing, as the Bank of England is, for example, in the case of the UK’scontribution to the bilateral support for Korea.But such official financial help cannot be unlimited and it cannot be provided withoutstrings. It, too, has real dangers. If it were too readily forthcoming it could encourage “moral
- 3 -BIS Review   49/1998hazard”, especially by encouraging commercial lenders - particularly foreign currency creditors - inthe belief that they will be bailed out if things go wrong. That would be likely to add to the problemof potentially volatile capital inflows next time around. Not surprisingly, too, there is strong politicalresistance in many countries, including notably the United States, to the idea that public - taxpayers’-money should be used to bail out private creditors, especially foreign creditors.External financing need not come solely from the public sector. Private financewould serve the same purpose, and in many situations market price adjustments may be sufficient tostem the capital outflow. But, given the extent of the loss of confidence in the Asian case, organisingprivate financial support meant in practice persuading existing creditors that their assets would bebetter protected if they were prepared to leave them in place, especially if other major privatecreditors agreed to do the same, and if official support were made available in parallel. But in thiscase, too, difficult judgements have to be made. There is a danger that, if private creditors have ineffect to be coerced into staying put, they will immediately cut their positions elsewhere, while theystill could, thereby adding to the international contagion.In fact, in the critically important case - because of its size - of Korea, the promise ofmassive official support failed to restore market confidence. And when it became apparent that theofficial bilateral financing was in practice available only as the very last resort we - again with thecentral banks as the immediate intermediaries - had to turn to the commercial bank lenders in themajor creditor countries and persuade them to extend the maturity of their loans. Like most U-turns,it was a dangerous moment. But the banks’ constructive response went a long way to stabilising theimmediate situation in relation to Korea - and thereby to the region as a whole. The creditor banksare also now in negotiation with Indonesia’s bank and commercial non-bank debtors.I can’t pretend that we are completely out of the wood in terms of the externalfinancial crisis in Asia, but there is now at least a good deal more light between the trees.International attention is now extending to managing the economic fall-out from lastyear’s financial disturbances, against the background of the longer-standing financial and economicfragility in Japan - which is of course the largest economy in the Asian region. The concern relates inpart to the implications for global economic activity; but it relates importantly, too, to theprospective external payments imbalances within the global economy which will need to be handledvery carefully if they are not to lead to trade frictions and/or exchange rate volatility.But attention has also turned to an intensive reappraisal, in all sorts of internationalfora, of more effective means of preventing, and managing, such situations in the future.It would have been understandable in the light of the Asian experience if there hadbeen some turning back from the path towards greater freedom of international capital movements,and there has been some suggestion of this. But on the whole the international debate - in whichcentral banks as well as governments are actively involved - continues to recognise the long-termbenefits of free capital movements and the contribution that they can make to global economicprosperity. The mood is to continue cautiously down that path, but to emphasise the need, not onlyfor sound macro-economic policies, which everyone accepts as a sine qua non, but also for steps toaccompany capital account liberalisation designed to reduce the risks of volatility.These relate in part to the process of capital account liberalisation, where there isnow a good deal more stress on ‘sequencing’ - that is on liberalising potentially more stable,longer-term, capital inflows initially, rather than short-term borrowing denominated in foreigncurrency.
- 4 -BIS Review   49/1998But they relate particularly to three key conditions for living with free capitalmovements.The first is “transparency”. In a broad sense a need for greater transparency isrecognised in relation to public policy, to the relationship between the public and private sectors, tocorporate governance, accounting standards, and so on. In a narrower sense there is seen to be a needfor more reliable, and greater and more timely disclosure of, financial information generally, at thelevel of individual borrowing entities, but especially also in relation to countries’ true foreignexchange short-term asset and liability positions. This is especially important in relation to theforeign currency liquidity position of the monetary authorities and of the banking system. Thegeneral point is that we cannot reasonably expect markets to make a proper assessment of the risksof their investments, including particularly their short-term lending if they do not have adequateinformation in accessible form, so that we need to provide appropriate incentives for countries toprovide such information. The corollary is that where they do have adequate information, financialmarket participants can be expected to accept the penalty if their judgements prove ill-founded - asindeed they largely do already in respect of many forms of overseas investment.The second condition for more stable capital flows is stronger financial systems. Thatincludes for example the broadening of capital markets so that the allocation of capital is lessconcentrated on local banking systems. It includes robust financial infrastructure - for examplepayments and settlements systems. And it includes crucially more effective financial regulation andsupervision. A key feature of future arrangements for me in this area is the encouragement, not justof more published information about the short-term foreign currency assets, relative to liabilities, ofthe public sector and the banking system, but more positive management of the country’s foreigncurrency liquidity position, taking account of the nature of the exchange rate regime. It wasweaknesses in this area, above all, in my view that turned the Asian financial problem into a panic.These various steps - which need a great deal of elaboration and refinement - inthemselves represent a huge agenda for the future. But however much we try to prevent accidents weneed nevertheless to be prepared for them to happen. The third condition for living with freedom ofcapital movements, therefore, is a more consistent view of how, when a crisis does break, the burdenmight be expected to be shared in future between official and private sector financing.In this context, one thing seems clear: given the evidence of public resistance, wecannot assume that massive official financing packages will in fact be deliverable in the future tobail out private foreign currency creditors. Various ideas have been put forward for involving privateforeign currency lenders in an extension of maturities in case of a serious foreign exchange crisis -perhaps within a framework of insolvency principles or some other form of code of practice. Theseideas, too, need to be developed and refined; and we need to establish suitable incentives andconditions to ensure that the financing burden is in fact shared between official and private sectorcreditors. The general point here is that it may help to discourage excessive, potentially volatile,short-term foreign currency lending in future if the lenders clearly understand from the outset thatthey will indeed be expected to carry a substantial part of the load.Mr Chairman, the debate on all these issues is still at a relatively early stage, and isbeing carried forward seemingly whenever two or more monetary officials, or indeed private sectoranalysts or commentators, are gathered together in one place. It is a key part of the presentinternational monetary agenda, and as the debate crystallises into policy consensus, it will become animportant element in the environment in which you take your decisions on investment in theemerging markets. I have no doubt that massive capital flows to the emerging markets will be acontinuing feature of the financial landscape - it is in the long-term interests of the recipient
- 5 -BIS Review   49/1998countries, the investing community, and the world economy that they should. The task is to try tointroduce greater stability into the process.
BIS Review   48/1998Mr. Carse gives a banking supervisor’s perspective on control issues in financialinstitutions   Speech by the Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,Mr. David Carse, at the BanComp ’98 conference in Hong Kong on 25/5/98.I am pleased to be here this morning to speak to you at the start of this conference oninternal controls and anti-money laundering. The advertised title of my speech is “Understanding therole and needs of the regulator in all authorised financial institutions”. This is a very broad subjectand I have therefore narrowed it down to focus on the banking supervisor’s perspective on controlissues in financial institutions. I am sure there are many compliance and audit professionals in theaudience today, so I trust I should not have too hard a hard job persuading you that good internalcontrols are not only important, but crucial to the success of financial institutions. Just consider, forexample, what poor internal controls did for BCCI, Daiwa Bank and Barings.So what advice can I offer you today to help you ensure that your institution will notmeet the same fate? Well, what I will do is to share with you my thoughts on the key elements of afinancial institution’s control systems, and highlight some of the areas where other institutions havegone horribly wrong. I will also talk about one of the key areas of a financial institution’s controls -its controls against being used for money laundering.So let me start by giving you a banking supervisor’s view of internal controls. Butfirst, what exactly do we mean by “internal controls”? The definition I would suggest, which isborrowed from the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, is that internal controls refers to theongoing process by which the Board of Directors and management of an institution ensure that theinstitution meets three key sets of objectives. First, operational objectives - the efficiency andeffectiveness of the institution in using its assets and other resources and in protecting the institutionfrom loss. Second, information objectives - the reliability and completeness of financial andmanagement information needed for decision-making within the institution and for regulatory andother external uses. Third, compliance objectives - compliance with applicable laws and regulations,supervisory requirements, and internal policies and procedures, in order to protect the institution’sfranchise and reputation.What, then, are the main elements of the sort of control systems needed to achievethese objectives? Basically, there are five inter-related elements: management oversight and thecontrol culture; risk assessment; control activities; information and communication; and monitoringactivities. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has recently put all this together into a setof fourteen principles for regulators to use in evaluating institution’s internal control systems. I donot propose to run through these one by one, but I would like to pick out one or two points so as togive you an idea of what I, as a regulator, see as the key ideas.First, on management oversight and the control culture, the starting point is that theBoard of Directors need to understand the risks run by the institution, to set the acceptable limits onthese risks, and to ensure that senior management takes the steps necessary to identify, monitor andcontrol these risks. Senior management must then take the responsibility to implement the strategiesapproved by the Board, to set appropriate internal control procedures, and to monitor theeffectiveness of these procedures.This makes it quite clear where the main responsibility for controls rests - and that isfairly and squarely on the shoulders of the institution’s Board of Directors and its seniormanagement, not just on its compliance and audit departments. However, having said that, everyonein an institution shares the responsibility to some extent. A key task for the Board and seniormanagement is to establish the right culture within the institution, a culture in which the importanceof internal controls is stressed, and high ethical and integrity standards are promoted. This culture
- 2 -BIS Review   48/1998will be determined not simply by what the top levels of management say but what they do. Forexample, do the institution’s remuneration policies reward risk-taking at the expense of prudence?Does senior management display a casual attitude towards breaches of limits? Do they encourage theright attitude towards regulatory compliance? Is there backing and respect at senior levels for theinternal audit and compliance functions? The response of the senior levels of the organisation tothese kind of issues will determine how personnel lower down actually behave in practice, includingtheir attitude to control issues.Moving on to risk assessment, the important thing is to identify and evaluate everyfactor that could adversely affect the achievement of the institution’s objectives. This means not justthe familiar risks of credit risk and liquidity risk, but also risks such as operational risk, interest raterisk, market risk, country and transfer risk, legal risk and reputational risk. And this needs to be anongoing process, continually re-evaluating the risks and reviewing the control systems to addressthese risks.Regarding control activities, the point I would stress is that control activities need tobe an integral part of the daily operations of an institution. Examples of this include: top levelreviews of performance and risk exposure; appropriate activity controls that monitor performanceand exceptions at the departmental or divisional level; segregation of duties; physical controls onaccess to assets; periodic checking for compliance with exposure limits; a system of approvals andauthorisations for transactions over certain limits; and a system of verification and reconciliation oftransaction details and activities. The objective should be to ensure that all areas of the institution arecontinually in compliance with established policies and procedures.On information and communication, it should be self-evident that an institution needscomprehensive and timely financial, operational and compliance data, and so needs to have goodinformation systems. But having the information is only the first step. Equally important is thesecond step, that the information should get to the right people at the right time.Finally, on monitoring, it cannot be overstressed that that monitoring of theeffectiveness of an institution’s internal controls should be a continual and ongoing process, and thatmonitoring of key risks should be an integral part of the daily operations of the institution. Effectiveand independent internal audit and compliance functions have an important role to play here. Thisrequires these functions to have direct access to senior levels of the organisation so that potentialcriticisms of systems or transactions cannot be blocked by the line management concerned.These, then, are what I would regard as the key elements of a financial institution’sinternal controls. As regards how these are applied to individual institutions, my expectation as abanking supervisor is that any financial institution, regardless of size, should have an effectivesystem of internal controls that is consistent with the nature, complexity, and risk of its activities andthat responds to changes in the institution’s environment and conditions. I am not saying that Iexpect every institution to be using state-of-the-art risk management and control techniques. Butwhat I do expect is that every institution should have control systems that adhere to the basicprinciples I have just discussed, and which are as state-of-the-art as they need to be given thatparticular institution’s activities. I also expect these systems to be kept under review as thingschange.Let me now move on to discuss some of the things that can go wrong when controlsbreak down. I will not go into particular case studies, but will try instead to draw together some ofthe common threads of recent problem bank cases. The Basle Committee paper that I mentionedearlier suggests five such common threads, and I will draw on this in the following remarks.
- 3 -BIS Review   48/1998The first, which I have mentioned already, is lack of adequate management oversightand accountability, and failure to develop a strong control culture within the institution. Withoutexception, a common feature of recent problem bank cases has been management inattention to, andlaxity in, the control culture of the institution, insufficient guidance and oversight by the Board ofDirectors and senior management, and a lack of clear management accountability through theassignment of roles and responsibilities. These cases also reflect insufficient incentives to carry outstrong line supervision and maintain a high level of control consciousness within business areas.The second thread is inadequate assessment of the risk of certain banking activities,whether on or off balance sheet. Many banking organisations that have suffered major lossesneglected to continually assess the risks of new products and activities, or update their riskassessments when significant changes occurred in the environment or business conditions. Manyrecent cases highlight the fact that control systems that function well for traditional or simpleproducts are unable to handle more sophisticated or complex products.The third thread is the absence or failure of key control activities, such as segregationof duties, approvals, verifications, reconciliations, and reviews of operating performance. Lack ofsegregation of duties in particular has played a major role in the significant losses that have occurredat banks.The fourth thread is inadequate communication of information between levels ofmanagement within the bank, especially in the upward communication of problems. To be effective,policies and procedures need to be effectively communicated to all personnel involved in an activity.Some losses in banks occurred because relevant personnel were not aware of or did not understandthe bank’s policies. In several instances, information about inappropriate activities that should havebeen reported upward through organisational levels was not communicated to the Board of Directorsor senior management until the problems became severe. In other instances, information inmanagement reports was not complete or accurate, creating a favourable impression of a businesssituation that was in fact problematic.The fifth and final thread is inadequate or ineffective audit programs and othermonitoring activities. In many cases, audits were not sufficiently rigorous to identify and report thecontrol weaknesses associated with problem banks. In other cases, even though auditors reportedproblems, they were not corrected by management.From these common threads, it should now be clear why, in the first part of myremarks today, I stressed the things I did - management oversight and control culture, riskassessment, control activities and monitoring, and information and communication. These are theareas that institutions need to focus on to avoid becoming a “problem bank case” themselves.Let me move on now to consider the role of the banking supervisor in ensuring thatan institution’s internal controls are adequate and effective. This is an area on which there has beengreatly increased emphasis in recent years. Of course supervisors, like the management of financialinstitutions, have always been concerned with the quality of control systems. However, the approachhas been rather piecemeal, and has focused on certain types of risk which are easily quantifiable,rather than the more intangible types of risk. What we are trying to do nowadays is to move towardsa more systematic identification and assessment of the risks facing a bank across the whole range ofits activities and the adequacy of the controls over these risks.This “risk-based” approach is intended to focus our attention on what we see as theinstitution’s key risk areas. Of course, the correct identification of the institution’s key risk areas iscrucial in this. For most of Hong Kong’s local banks, credit risk, liquidity risk and perhaps
- 4 -BIS Review   48/1998reputational risk remain the highest risk areas, but for individual institutions other forms of risk suchas interest rate risk and market risk also come into the equation. If an institution engages in types ofbusiness that we regard as being at the higher end of the risk scale, such as share margin financing orlending for property development, this will also attract our attention. Other things that will attractour attention include major changes in the operating environment, including new technology; areasor activities which are experiencing rapid growth; the introduction of new lines of business, productsor activities; and domestic and foreign acquisitions. In each case we would want to be assured thatany necessary enhancements to the control environment have been made so as to reduce the chanceof adverse and unforeseen effects on the institution.Different risk areas require different approaches, but essentially our approach is tostart by reviewing the written policies and procedures setting down the controls over a particulararea, and then to look at how the controls work in practice. This may involve a combination ofreviews of documentation, discussions with staff, and some testing of transactions. The end-resultwill be a judgement as to whether we believe the controls are effective or need improvement. Ifimprovement is needed we will discuss our recommendations with the management and agree anaction plan and time-scale for the remedial action.This may sound to you quite similar in some respects to the work of an institution’sinternal audit department and external auditors. I would agree that there are certainly some commonfeatures, and indeed we would usually review as part of our own work the work done by the auditdepartment on identifying areas of potential risk and control problems. Similarly, external auditors’observations and recommendations are often very useful to us in coming to a judgement on theeffectiveness of an institution’s internal controls. However, to supervise an institution effectively asupervisor needs, in my opinion, a means of independently verifying that internal controls are soundand that all substantive risks have been identified and considered. For this reason, our ongoingdialogue with institutions, and our periodic on-site examinations of institutions’ activities, areinvaluable.I believe this oversight can also be beneficial in a practical way to the institutionitself. For example, we may have insights that the institution does not. We may be able to give aninstitution feedback on how it compares vis-à-vis its peers in similar areas and to indicate respects inwhich, from our experience, its controls and risk management processes are falling behind the game.I would not want to overplay this “management consultant” type role, but I think it can be beneficial,perhaps especially to the smaller, less sophisticated financial institutions. Of course, this presupposesthat we have the necessary expertise to offer useful advice. This is a constant challenge in today’senvironment of rapid technological change and product innovation. We have therefore tried todevelop our own treasury and securities specialists whose task it is to review and assess moreleading-edge and sophisticated areas such as value at risk and treasury and derivatives riskmanagement.Let me move on now to the subject of the prevention of money laundering. This is akey concern for the supervisors of all major international financial centres, and is something thatshould be high on the agenda for the management of every financial institution.Here in Hong Kong considerable time and effort has been put in over a period ofyears into ensuring that the banking system follows best international practice on the prevention ofmoney laundering. Principally, this means following the recommendations of the Basle Committeeon Banking Supervision and the Financial Action Task Force, whose guidance notes on theprevention of money laundering we have used to develop our own detailed Guidelines to institutions.The basic thrust of these Guidelines is to provide that institutions should have in place adequate andeffective policies, procedures and controls to combat money laundering, covering essential areas
- 5 -BIS Review   48/1998such as procedures for account opening, customer identification and record keeping as well as propersystems for reporting suspicious transactions and training of staff.Please be in no doubt as to how seriously we regard adherence to these Guidelines.The reason for this is simple. To paraphrase the health warning on a packet of cigarettes, “Moneylaundering can seriously damage your health”. Being associated with money laundering canseriously undermine confidence in an individual financial institution and potentially in a financialsystem as a whole. We are presently seeing this demonstrated in the case of the Mexican bankingsystem, which is embroiled in a money-laundering scandal.So what steps can a banking supervisor take to ensure that institutions are doingeverything they can to protect themselves from being used for money laundering? The first thing isto make sure that the Guidelines issued to institutions are kept up-to-date as techniques and patternsof money laundering evolve, and to ensure that institutions revise their own internal guidelinesaccordingly. We have recently revised our Guidelines and issued them as a convenient booklet. I ampleased to say that demand for this has been high and we have issued over 5000 copies of thebooklet. However, Guidelines need to be put into practice. To ensure that senior management arefocused on the need for this, money-laundering controls are a regular agenda item for our prudentialmeetings with management. They are also a regular topic for our on-site examinations. During theseexaminations we review an institution’s policies and procedures, look at their records of suspicioustransactions, and interview staff at random to check that they have been trained to identify suspicioustransactions and to follow the appropriate procedures for account opening and customeridentification. We may also commission external auditors’ reports if we think it necessary.So how do institutions in Hong Kong rate on combating money laundering? Perhapsthe best indicator of their vigilance against money laundering is the number of reports of suspicioustransactions made to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (JFIU). These numbers suggest thatinstitutions are certainly improving, as both the number of reports, and the number of institutionsmaking reports, has been increasing over time. The number of reports made to the JFIU rose fromonly 264 in 1992 to 4210 in 1997. Our own on-site examinations also suggest that the level ofawareness, and the training of staff, is improving. So, overall, institutions are doing well. However,there is always room for improvement, and I would urge those with responsibility for this area not torelax their guard.This brings me to my concluding remarks. I started out today by talking about theimportant elements of a control system, and how banking supervisors assess the effectiveness ofinstitutions’ controls. I discussed some of the common threads of recent “problem bank” cases, andthe control issues they highlighted. Finally, I stressed the importance of controls in the area of moneylaundering prevention. While I hope this was of interest to you, and at least gave you a slightlydifferent perspective on some familiar issues, I think I should end by saying that I certainly lay noclaim to having all the answers. Please do not sit back and expect the banking supervisors to issueguidelines telling you exactly what you need to do. While I hope my advice may be of some help, theresponsibility for ensuring that your institution has the right controls and the right culture is yours.So I hope this conference provides you with some useful, practical ideas for improving yourinstitutions’ controls when you return to work.
BIS Review   47/1998Mr. Heikensten examines economic policy and the fight against inflation in SwedenSpeech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at the Meeting ofAlmega-Affiliated Employers’ Associations on 27/5/98.Thank you for the invitation to attend your meeting and talk about economic policy andinflation. Today I shall begin with a brief review of the historical background to the fight againstinflation in the Swedish economy. It is worth recalling that more than eight years have passed since itwas decided in Sweden that combating inflation would have top priority. This policy has been pursuedconsistently ever since. After a couple of initial years that were troublesome in many ways, the resultshave been encouraging and Swedish stabilisation policy now looks good even in a European comparison.This will be followed by a discussion of three policy fields—fiscal policy, labour market and wageformation—that are closely linked to monetary policy, as well as some remarks about competitiveconditions in Sweden’s economy. Successful results in these policy fields enlarge the room to manoeuvrein monetary policy. In conclusion I shall consider some topical monetary policy issues, including ourcurrent appraisal of inflation and monetary policy’s construction.1.  The fight against inflation and its resultsHigh inflation characterised Sweden’s economy for a number of years in the 1970s and1980s, a period that clearly illustrates an inflation economy’s negative consequences. Repeated attemptswere made to rectify the economic imbalances by means of devaluations and fiscal stimuli butdevelopment remained unstable. The problems with inflation were then accentuated when the financialmarkets were deregulated. Prices and wages rose steeply and Sweden was caught in wage-price spirals.The occurrence of price bubbles made investment decisions more hazardous and led to weakproductivity. A high level of inflation became a permanent feature of our economy. As monetary policyat that time was focused on maintaining a fixed exchange rate, fiscal policy ought to have been tighter.Bit by bit, there was a growing awareness across party political lines that in the longerrun this economic policy strategy was not viable, a perception that had already dawned on most countriesin our part of the world in the early 1980s. It was now that low inflation in Sweden came to be seen as anecessary condition for achieving stable and sustained growth and thereby high employment. This wasclearly expressed officially for the first time in the Budget Statement in January 1991. Combatinginflation was given pride of place on the economic policy agenda. The final policy objectives were thesame as before but the perception of the conditions that were needed to attain them had changed.This realignment of stabilisation policy occurred, however, at a time when the earlierpolicy’s negative consequences had begun to leave their mark. Due to the high level of costs inmanufacturing, for example, economic growth in Sweden was weak. In addition, a rising real interest ratecoincided with a period when the tax reform made savers and investors more sensitive to interest rates.All this had a marked downward effect on domestic demand.The drop in output—almost 6 per cent in the course of three years—meant in turn thatgovernment finances worsened dramatically. From a surplus at 4.2 per cent of GDP in 1990, the budgetbalance swung to a deficit of 12.3 per cent in 1993. In this period, moreover, registered unemploymentshot up from 1.7 to 8.2 per cent.In a way, the economic crisis in the early 1990s can be said to have been generated bypolitical decisions. The combination of a stabilisation policy realignment with some structural reformsdid play a part in the course of the crisis. But it should also be underscored that such measures werebroadly essential. The problem was not so much the measures that were implemented when aninflationary bubble had already developed as the fact that policy had not been realigned earlier.In recent years, economic developments in Sweden have been favourable. Growth hasbeen stronger than in the high phase in the late 1980s and it has proved possible to combine good growthwith low inflation. A couple of years after the realignment of economic policy, inflation had fallen
- 2 -BIS Review   47/1998sharply to around 3 per cent. Moreover, the reduction of current inflation has been accompanied by adownward revision of inflation expectations. Today, neither households, firms nor financial marketagents perceive any serious threat from inflation in the coming five years.Government finances have also improved markedly since the effects of the acute crisis inthe early 1990s were overcome. After rapid budget consolidation, a surplus of 1.6 per cent is forecast for1998. Government debt has been reduced since 1995. Still, the restoration of confidence did take a longtime. There were strong and persistent doubts about both the determination and the ability of theGovernment and the Riksdag (Sweden’s parliament) to carry out the proposed measures.Finally it is worth noting that the steps for reorienting economic policy on stability weretaken with a consensus that was considerably broader than is sometimes suggested by the politicaldebate. A good foundation for the years ahead has now been laid, although high unemployment is still aserious problem for Sweden’s economy. The positive picture is underpinned by institutional reforms tothe budget process and the status of the Riksbank.2.  Three fields of importance for monetary policyNow I should like to turn to some issues or policy fields that are of major practicalimportance for monetary policy. They are: fiscal policy, the labour market, wage formation andcompetitive conditions in the Swedish economy. It is generally the case that the more price stability issupported by other policy fields, the greater the contribution monetary policy can make to othereconomic policy goals.Good fiscal foundation but storing up for lean years is advisableFiscal policy is relevant for monetary policy in a number of ways. Fiscal decisions affectthe room to manoeuvre in monetary policy not only via their direct impact on demand—and hence oninflation—but also by how they influence economic policy’s credibility. A fiscal policy that is perceivedas being untenable in the longer run can raise doubts about the overall policy commitment to lowinflation and stability. To this should be added fiscal policy’s influence on the macro economy. The waysin which taxes are levied and public revenue is spent influence the behaviour of households and firms,which may thereby—generally in the longer run—alter the economy’s inflation propensity. Today,however, I shall not be developing this aspect.In the first respect—fiscal policy’s impact on economic activity—the picture is clear-cut:in recent years the fiscal stance has been very tight. Of course, this has contributed to the low rate ofinflation and in this sense it has assisted monetary policy. With the current fiscal proposals for the yearsahead, however, the stance will not be as tight as before. But to some extent the growth of householdincome is still being restrained by the overall change in taxation and public spending.As regards credibility, there has been a marked improvement. Last year the Governmentlaid down a long-term objective for government finances which goes further than the average of thecorresponding commitments in Europe. Over the business cycle the budget balance is to average asurplus of 2 per cent of GDP. The Riksdag has approved this objective.The Riksbank finds this objective reasonable. A budget surplus over the business cyclecan contribute to a speedier reduction of government debt, which is currently high. This will creategreater freedom of action for future economic policy, which is particularly important in that Sweden’spublic finances are no doubt still relatively sensitive to the cyclical economic situation. But the future hasfurther challenges in store for fiscal policy. An ageing population implies new and growing requirements,for example. Another matter that may alter the conditions for fiscal policy is the increased mobility of taxbases, which in some respects may make it difficult to maintain present levels of taxation.Better wage settlements but what about the next round?
- 3 -BIS Review   47/1998As things now stand, fiscal policy will continue to provide good room to manoeuvre inmonetary policy in the coming years. So what about the contributions from the labour market and wageformation?Of the aggregate value-added in the Swedish economy, wages make up almost 70 percent. Wage trends are therefore crucial for the path of inflation. For many years, the wage rise in Swedenhas been above the rate in most other countries in Europe. But as we all know, instead of this givingSwedish employees a better real wage, the outcome has been the reverse. In the 1990s the rate of wageincreases in Sweden has been curbed but the negotiated increases in the 1995 round were above theEuropean average.As I mentioned earlier, economic policy in Sweden has been focused on low inflationsince 1991. A consistent implementation of this policy, with an inflation target, clarifies the rules of thegame for wage formation. High wage increases are liable to boost inflation, which necessitates higherinterest rates.The inflationary consequences of the wage increases can be modified if productivitygrowth is good, as has been the case in recent years. But at least a part of this productivity growth isachieved at the expense of jobs; this is one aspect of the process whereby higher labour costs generatestronger rationalisation and maybe also an increased capital input. In this way, too, and not just becausethe higher interest rates directly affect demand and employment, a rapid wage rise is liable to endangerjobs.Against this background, the outcome of the latest wage negotiations is better than inearlier years. Agreements for the next three years have been concluded at levels around 3 per cent a year.It has been said that this takes wage drift into account but that is probably not entirely the case. Insteadone should no doubt count on wage drift averaging around 1 per cent. The average annual wage outcomein the period 1998–2000 would then be 3.5 to 4 per cent. This does still represent some downward shiftin the rate of wage increases, which in turn assists the Riksbank’s task of ensuring low inflation. All elseequal, we can allow ourselves a somewhat lower level of interest rates and a somewhat stronger growthof demand.Speaking to you, it seems natural to take up two more aspects of this issue:-  The outcome of the 1998 wage round does not appear to be sufficiently low to make amajor contribution to employment in Sweden. But our wage level is still rising faster, if anything, thanthe European average. This may prove to be manageable as regards inflation and Sweden’s competitiveposition, thanks to good productivity growth, but what will it then entail for employment?-  Neither is it easy to feel really confident about the next wage round. What was reallyresponsible for the better outcome this year compared with 1995? The greater credibility of the inflationtarget can be cited as one explanation but is it the whole story? And if not, what were the otherarguments on this occasion and will they still hold good in two to three years time? These are importantquestions that need to be analysed and answered, in the first place by the parties in the labour market.Better competition and price formation but there is more to doA third issue, which presumably has had practical consequences for monetary policy andthe fight against inflation in recent years, although it is seldom discussed in these contexts, is thecompetitive situation in the Swedish economy.In work at the Riksbank on monitoring prices in the Swedish economy, we could not failto notice some positive changes in competitive conditions and pricing in recent years, as well as somemore negative patterns that seem to be persisting.
- 4 -BIS Review   47/1998Let me take the positive aspects first. One is the favourable price trend for importedgoods in recent years. This is particularly notable in that for much of this period the exchange rate hasbeen comparatively weak, which by itself should push import prices up. A favourable price trend has alsobeen observed for food products, for example; this seems to be a consequence, at least in part, ofSweden’s membership of the European Union. Today, moreover, there are many indications that thecombination of European monetary union and increased IT-based trade, for instance, will makecompetition even stronger.There is a general difference between the development of administered prices and marketprices for goods and services. The administered prices have risen faster. This may be a result ofincreased fee setting in the public sector in recent years, both in connection with structural moves awayfrom tax financing and to fill existing “holes” in public finances. Then there is the classic explanationthat it is not so easy to raise productivity growth in some parts of the services sector. This no doubtapplies in particular to a number of the services that are mainly provided under public auspices, such asmedical care and care of the aged.I have raised the questions of competitive conditions and price formation today mainly soas to help initiate a debate on these matters. For monetary policy it is self-evidently the case thatincreased competition, by keeping costs and prices down, can lead to better inflation prospects. This inturn can improve the conditions for monetary policy.In recent years there have been indications of tendencies in this direction, in Sweden aswell as globally. At the same time, it is difficult to tell just how much of the reduction of inflation can beattributed specifically to changes in competition and price formation. Neither is it clear for how longsuch a process can continue and whether the same potential exists for keeping prices down over a seriesof years. These are matters to which we intend to return.3.  Some monetary policy issuesSweden has had good experience, as I demonstrated earlier, of efforts to establishcredibility by means of a direct inflation target. Inflation is currently low and the level is expected toremain low in the coming years. The conditions for continuing with monetary policy’s focus on stabilityare being further improved by the far-reaching delegation of monetary policy that is involved in theRiksbank’s enhanced status from the turn of this year. Against this background, I should like to commenton some of monetary policy’s topical issues.The exchange rateThe part played by the krona’s exchange rate is a matter for debate that surfaces fromtime to time. A recent instance is, for example, the run up to European monetary union and the attentionthis drew to Sweden’s commitments as a member of the European Union. Some observers believe thatthe Riksbank may have an (unacknowledged) exchange rate target. That is a misconception. TheRiksbank does not target the krona’s exchange rate.In a flexible exchange rate regime with a price stability target, the exchange rate isadmittedly a major factor, but only one of many factors that impinge on inflation. A permanentappreciation or depreciation of the krona affects inflationary pressure via import prices, for example. Agiven exchange rate trend may well support monetary policy’s drive for price stability; when this is notthe case, however, the Riksbank has to intervene and adjust the repo rate.At the same time, the exchange rate is the price of an asset that is current throughout theeconomy; the value of the krona is highly important in many economic decisions, not least for exportcompanies. This makes a stable exchange rate fundamentally desirable. It is then easier for all economicagents to make decisions. All else equal, this should lead to higher growth.
- 5 -BIS Review   47/1998To this basic endeavour to keep the price of the krona stable should be added ourEuropean undertakings. As a member of the European Union we are committed to treating our exchangerate policy as a matter of common interest. Opinions in the Union presumably differ from time to timeabout the practical application of this commitment but the basic requirement is that policy focusesconsistently on stability.The Riksdag has left the door open for Sweden’s participation in the monetary union at alater date and stated that in connection with such a move it can be relevant to join the European exchangerate mechanism (ERM). In this perspective, too, it is an advantage if the krona is more or less stable.Monetary policy in the euro area is to have the primary objective of price stability. Wedo not yet know just how the European Central Bank (ECB) will formulate its target but it is unlikely todiffer from the norm that has applied in Germany since the mid 1980s. This means that inflation is not toexceed a medium-term level of 2 per cent. In practice, therefore, the differences in this policy fieldbetween the ECB and Sweden will probably not be so great as to have any real consequences for theexchange rate.With policy focused on price stability both in Sweden and in the monetary union, thereshould be good possibilities of a stable exchange rate between the krona and the euro. This is supportedby the path of the krona relative to the German mark in recent years. As measured, for example, by thelong-term interest rate differential with Germany, confidence in Swedish economic policy has been highsince 1996. In this period there have been only two occasions when the krona has fluctuated more than 2per cent against the German mark.Managing transitory effectsThe subject of the Riksbank’s attitude to the inflation target is also raised from time totime in the media. It has been claimed that the Riksbank shows less concern about inflation movingoutside the tolerance interval’s lower limit than it does about the upper limit being exceeded.That is not the case. A couple of years is too short a period on which to base argumentsthat deviations from the targeted rate are a sign that policy has not been symmetric. Monetary policywork involves a lot of uncertainty, which is no doubt inevitable when the interest rate has to be set on thebasis of forecasts that extend several years into the future. At present, moreover, assessments areparticularly difficult so soon after the changeover to a low-inflation regime, with all that this may involvein the form of altered behaviour by households and firms. Another complication is that in recent years,inflation throughout the world has been lower than expected.Another aspect of this issue is the Riksbank’s choice of a target variable. Everyconceivable indicator of inflation has its shortcomings and these have to be weighed against theadvantages when choosing monetary policy’s target variable. The consumer price index (CPI) has theadvantages of being well-known and established among economic agents and people in general as ameasure of inflation. It also covers a large proportion of household consumption. These were centralarguments when the CPI was chosen as the target variable in the beginning of 1993.A disadvantage with the CPI, however, is that it combines information about inflation’sunderlying trend with transitory price movements. In the period in which the inflation target has been inforce, transitory factors have had a marked effect on the CPI on a number of occasions. Examples of suchfactors are tax changes (most recently the increases to and subsequent cuts in property and tobacco taxes)and fluctuations in interest rates (which affect the CPI in the form of house mortgage expenditure).During 1996 and 1997 in particular the CPI has been relatively markedly below not just the targeted ratebut even the tolerance interval. This has faced the Riksbank with educational problems.Transitory effects on inflation ought to be a secondary consideration in monetary policyand be absorbed inside the tolerance interval of 1–3 per cent. That is one of the interval’s functions. And
- 6 -BIS Review   47/1998provided it is a question of temporary price movements around a stable rate of inflation, there is noreason to counter such movements with repo rate adjustments. On the contrary, that might have adestabilising effect in the real economy. Instead, monetary policy’s central concern is the direction ofinflation’s long-term trend. It is this trend which can be affected more directly by total demand and henceby monetary policy.Against this background, the Riksbank has contacted the CPI Enquiry, set up by theGovernment, to obtain assistance in specifying an indicator of underlying inflation that is likely to bewidely accepted and can be published regularly by Statistics Sweden. In the future, such an indicatormight be able to have a more direct function in monetary policy, either by replacing the CPI as the targetvariable or by serving as an operational target or aid in the continuous work of constructing policy. TheRiksbank has also asked Statistics Sweden to publish, for the time being, one or more indicators ofunderlying inflation together with the CPI. Perhaps I should emphasise that in no way do these initiativesalter monetary policy’s fundamental commitment to price stability.The current situation for monetary policyThe question of transitory effects leads me on to current monetary policy. Transitoryeffects are playing a major part in the CPI’s present development. As a result of tax changes, lowerinterest rates and a lower oil price, since December the Riksbank has had to revise the 1998 CPIprediction downwards by about 1.2 percentage points. In 1999, too, transitory effects mean that CPIinflation will be lower than we envisaged earlier.Thus far, however, the altered picture of inflation need not have any sizeableconsequences for monetary policy. It is now too late to influence this year’s path for inflation more thanmarginally. Moreover, some of the transitory effects entail a risk of higher inflation, if anything, during1999; tax cuts and lower interest rates leave households with more money to spend and the same appliesto cheaper oil.But underlying inflation also shows signs of being weaker than expected even thougheconomic activity seems to be relatively strong and in line with the paths we have counted on for sometime, with a further increase driven by domestic demand and supported by strong activity in Europe.The better picture of prices comes from a variety of factors. The rate of wage increases islikely to be somewhat more advantageous than we counted on earlier, even though we have consistentlybeen cautiously optimistic in this respect. Of greater importance is productivity, where good growth inrecent years has helped to brighten prospects. Somewhat lower import prices together with a slightlystronger exchange rate also contribute.Work on our next Inflation Report is nearing completion. There are several indicationsthat in the two years horizon that is relevant for monetary policy, CPI inflation may be somewhat belowour target. The picture of underlying inflation is much the same. Neither are these positive inflationprospects modified by the various risks that lie ahead. In a perspective that extends to the middle of 2000the element of uncertainty is obviously high; if anything, however, the main risk seems to be thatinternational activity will be marginally weaker and inflation accordingly somewhat lower.This is a pleasant situation to be in. The Swedish economy appears to be growing at arate that is reasonable and broadly expected. At the same time, inflation is lower than expected. Theprospect that the Riksbank faced last autumn, of inflation two years hence being half a percentage pointabove the target, no longer seems probable.For monetary policy, the outlook has accordingly changed. The present inflationprospects clearly imply that the need to raise interest rates has disappeared for now. A strictinterpretation of the Riksbank’s rule that monetary policy is to focus primarily on the second of thecoming two years could even indicate some downward adjustment of the instrumental rate. What the
- 7 -BIS Review   47/1998Riksbank now has reason to consider is whether a minor downward interest rate adjustment would leadto good conditions for a stable economic development in the future.4.  ConclusionStabilisation policy in Sweden was realigned in the early 1990s and focused on lowinflation. The background was our own and other countries’ experience in the 1970s and 1980s.Repeated attempts to stimulate demand, with a view to boosting employment, and accept the associatedincrease in inflation had failed to produce the intended results. On the contrary, economic activity hadbecome more unstable and growth in the longer term had, if anything, weakened.In recent years the results of the policy realignment have been good in many respects.Economic growth in Sweden has been higher than in the latter part of the 1980s and it has provedpossible to combine this with low inflation. Government finances have also undergone a rapidimprovement. Moreover, revised rules for both fiscal and monetary policy have provided betterconditions for future stability. This means that a good foundation has also been established for futureeconomic development.The 1998 round of settlements agreements represents a step in the right direction in thesense that, compared with the previous round, the agreed rate of wage increases in coming years lookslike being easier to combine with low inflation. Unfortunately, however, there are still reasons for someconcern about the future. Do the wage settlements create really good conditions for increasedemployment and has a foundation been laid for further responsible wage settlements in the nextnegotiating round in two to three years time?Some positive things in the Swedish economy have also happened in recent years asregards competitive conditions and price formation. With the ongoing process of internationalisation,European monetary union and advances in the IT field, there is likely to be a further intensification ofcompetition and downward pressure on prices, to the benefit of Swedish consumers. But there is cause toconsider whether more can be done, which if there is would also assist monetary policy.Finally I considered aspects of monetary policy and the current situation in this respect.In the past six months inflation prospects have improved. Like many central banks in central Europe, theRiksbank has accordingly moved from a situation that pointed to the likelihood of a relatively quicksuccession of continued interest rate increases to one where the need of higher interest rates in the nearfuture seems to have disappeared.With the bright inflation prospects and a strict interpretation of the Riksbank’s rule formonetary policy decisions, today there may even be grounds for considering a minor downward repo rateadjustment. What the Riksbank now has reason to consider is whether such an adjustment would lead togood conditions for stable economic development in the future.*       *       *

BIS Review   45/1998Mr. Tietmeyer discusses the benefits, opportunities and pitfalls of financialand monetary integration   Address by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank,Prof. Hans Tietmeyer, at the 1998 Mais Lecture at the City University Business School, inLondon, on 18/5/98.First of all, I wish to thank you very much for your kind invitation.  I am pleasedto have the opportunity to give this year’s Mais Lecture and to share with you some of mythoughts. It is a great honour for me to be invited to continue the sequence of outstandingpersonalities who have established and maintained the tradition and reputation of the MaisLecture with their talks.At the same time, I am happy to be here in London once again. For every visitorLondon is a wonderful city full of culture and history.  For a central banker, London is, inaddition, a large and efficient financial centre. Its strong points include, not least, the academicinfrastructure in economics and business. The City University Business School is making animportant contribution to that.I should of course like to add: I come from a financial centre on the continentwhich likewise has some strong points. And experience shows: competition is always stimulatingfor both sides. Thus, the two financial and monetary centres, London and Frankfurt, go some waytowards symbolising tonight’s topic: Financial and Monetary Integration: Benefits, Opportunitiesand Pitfalls.II should like to begin with the hypothetical question: What will historians of thefuture regard as the most important, forward-looking features of the close of the twentiethcentury? Perhaps they will point to the following three features:  Firstly: following the outcomeof the competition between the political systems, the competition of the economic systemsbetween a market economy and a centrally planned economy likewise seems to have come to anend. At any rate, the state socialist model as a competitor of the free market economy hasfoundered - not only because it was dissolved in and together with the Soviet Union and itsformer sphere of influence; what is more, it is no longer a serious reference model for thedevelopment of emerging economies; not even for China.Secondly: economic historians may, later on, perhaps see the present time as aperiod of dramatic technical and economic upheaval - of “creative destruction” in Schumpeter’sphrase. In particular, basic innovation in microelectronics is being reflected in lots of proceduralinnovations which are now more and more reaching application status and in many productinnovations becoming increasingly marketable.And thirdly: we contemporaries are speaking more and more of an era ofprogressive economic integration, at both a regional and a global level. Globalisation is thekeyword in today’s discussion.These three features are of course interlinked. The victory of the market economysystem and the decline in transportation and communication costs are fuelling global integration.Global competition, in turn, is fostering the search for new applications of the technicalpossibilities. And especially in a dynamic period with large adjustment requirements in almost
- 2 -BIS Review   45/1998all sectors of the economy, a centrally planned economy is especially inferior to a marketeconomy.All three features have a common thrust. They work in the direction ofovercoming national frontiers and administrative barriers. The old dream of internationalismtherefore holds out the promise of coming true.But the more this open, increasingly barrierless world becomes reality, the moreevident it grows that this is not a perfect or simple world. On the contrary: in the wake of theformer east-west conflict, conflicts within countries or in individual regions have not becomeless common. Indeed, some conflicts which had previously been obscured have only now cometo light. And the technological changes and economic globalisation are not only a source ofgreater prosperity. They at the same time pose huge challenges. The developed industrialcountries are particularly feeling the need for reform in their labour markets and social securitysystems. This is especially true of countries in continental Europe.IIProgressive economic integration is, of course, not a new phenomenon. But thereare many indications that this process has accelerated and intensified in the last ten years, bothquantitatively and qualitatively.Economic integration is a comprehensive process. It is increasingly affecting thereal economy. The international interdependence of national economies is increasing. A newquality is emerging. For the growing interdependence is no longer based solely or primarily ontrade in finished products or commodities. Especially, the process of developing and producinggoods is being increasingly split up internationally. This is possible because national frontiershave become increasingly permeable and communications have become more intensive, becausetransportation and communication costs have fallen sharply, and because, in particular, theemerging economies have likewise become more integrated in the world economy; this, aboveall, markedly facilitates direct investment there.The front runners of such integration are of course the global financial markets.They are able to take the best advantage of the disappearance of transaction barriers and the newtechnological options. In a world of increasing real economic interdependence, and with globalfinancial markets, the question of monetary integration is also becoming more urgent.The calculability and appropriateness of monetary relationships is becoming moreimportant. Globalisation therefore increases the overall pressure to pursue a stability-orientedmonetary policy everywhere. If a country, especially a bigger one, drops out, this may lead, in anintegrated world economy, to serious damage due to volatile financial market prices. And this iswhy many countries are switching over to monetary cooperation, or even to pegging theirexchange rates.One part of Europe is now going a radical step further. Eleven EU countries willenter into monetary union on a durable basis at the end of this year. That union will then pursue asingle supranational monetary policy decided by a supranational and politically independentcentral bank.
- 3 -BIS Review   45/1998A number of countries will closely watch the outcome of this experiment, whichmay change Europe considerably. This is true in particular of those countries of the EuropeanUnion which do not wish to join the monetary union as yet. Accession candidates in central andeastern Europe, too, will of course watch developments with keen interest. But countries in otherparts of the world as well will focus their attention on the euro area. This is because somecountries in South America or Asia are beginning at least to contemplate the option of amonetary union. Even if they still have a long way to go.IIIWhat is it that prompts sovereign states to follow this basic trend towardseconomic integration, even if of course it does not always lead as far as is planned for Euroland?Essentially, three more or less major benefits may be derived from any form ofeconomic integration: Firstly, more integration leads to more competition. Competitive pressureenhances efficiency. Secondly, integration changes market structures. Markets become larger.Enterprises are able to exploit economies of scale. National economies can specialise to a greaterextent. Resources are fed into a larger pool, from which they can be allocated more efficiently.And market breadth increases. The consumer can choose from a wider range of products offered.Thirdly, integration reduces information and transaction costs. This applies in particular tomonetary integration, too.But - what is invariably true is also true of economic integration: there is no suchthing as a free lunch.First of all, it is helpful to distinguish between market integration and policyintegration. Market integration mainly implies dismantling barriers and obstacles. Then nationalmarkets can grow together. Policy integration goes further. It also implies that countriescoordinate or even harmonise the general direction of movement in individual sectors of nationalpolicy, or individual parameters.The countries which join an integration process must clearly appreciate threepotential problem areas:First problem area: market integration going beyond national borders posesincreased domestic challenges. For instance, integration in the international division of labouraccelerates structural change and calls for more internal flexibility, especially on the labourmarket. And liberalising capital movements places demands on the domestic financial sector,which must be able to handle international capital flows that may rapidly change direction.Second problem area: to be really efficient, market integration with theelimination of barriers may require a minimum of policy integration. This applies, for example,to some protection provisions for products and in the production process. Different tax systemsmay of course likewise distort cross-border goods and financial flows. And if capital markets areglobalised, different approaches to monetary policy may contribute to volatility. Such volatilitymay have a strong impact on financial and real investment.But, and this is the third problem area: policy integration is itself a two-edgedsword. It may make markets more efficient. But it can also contribute to curbing policycompetition. That may involve risks: an excessive tendency towards centralisation may arise
- 4 -BIS Review   45/1998which does not take sufficient account of diverging conditions. The delineation ofresponsibilities may become blurred if mixed responsibilities arise with undue bureaucracy. Inthe worst-case scenario, efficient policy solutions may no longer be implemented. Policyinnovation is blocked.Countries must be able to come to terms with these three risks and problem areasin their efforts to coordinate or integrate their policies, if they are to secure the benefits ofintegration. Striking the right balance here is not always easy.IVThe financial markets are something like the flywheels of globalisation. Freecapital movements and efficient financial markets greatly facilitate direct investment. Theyprovide the basis for transactions and for the safety of payment flows, which are the financialequivalent of real integration.The global financial markets promote and strengthen market structures. They alsomake it possible for investment in emerging economies to be funded privately, rather thanofficially, today on a much greater scale than previously. Capital is allocated today, more than itused to be, in accordance with economic, rather than political, criteria.Conversely, the integration of the emerging economies into the global financialmarkets provides new investment outlets for savings. This must also be seen against thebackdrop of the ageing populations in most industrialised countries. They in particular mustaccumulate and invest capital today so as to be able to maintain their relative standard of livingin the future, too.And the global capital markets have assumed a role which is bearing fruit in thedisciplining of national policies. They offer opportunities, but also pose a risk, to countries whichfail to follow the economic constraints. Nowadays they are an effective part of the checks andbalances.These important benefits of the international capital markets are sometimeswrongly disregarded in the ongoing debate.But the financial crises being encountered by some east Asian countries have, ofcourse, highlighted the risks, too. A number of emerging economies have become swiftlyintegrated in the global financial markets. Not all of those countries have adjusted their internalstructures at the same pace and as thoroughly. That makes them vulnerable. Two weaknesses, inparticular, may become their Achilles heel: a domestic financial sector which is unable to handlelarge capital flows in a sufficiently sound manner, and an overly rigid exchange rate pegging toone or more other currencies.Exchange rate pegging can in some cases and for some length of time producepositive effects. An overly rigid exchange rate peg, however, can have problematicconsequences: It may jeopardise the competitiveness of an economy, and especially exports. Itmay fetter domestic interest rate policy. It thereby makes it more difficult to fight inflation inperiods of heavy capital inflows. And it may tempt residents to borrow in foreign currencies atrelatively favourable nominal interest rates. These consequences may make a country vulnerable,as we have seen already in the Mexican case in 1994-5.
- 5 -BIS Review   45/1998In addition, some risk factors are inherent in the market. The internationalfinancial markets mostly have a tendency towards short-termism. A major part of internationallendings and borrowings is at fairly short term. And they quite often tend to follow aself-reinforcing herd instinct in periods both of euphoria and of scepticism.Both factors, any domestic weaknesses and the properties of the internationalfinancial markets, may cause a potential for a reversal in sentiment for a currency to build up.Mostly triggered by some special economic or political change or other, the exchange rate of acurrency may go down very fast, in many cases to an overly low point. An “undershooting” ofthe appropriate relationship occurs. Such a slump in the value of a currency can hit the economyof the country concerned with a massive force, especially if that country is heavily indebted in aforeign currency.What is to be done? Two points in particular are important:Firstly, the functioning of the financial markets must be maintained orstrengthened. On the one hand, to this end the markets need more, better and more up-to-dateinformation on the level, maturity and denomination pattern of the debts of potential riskcountries. Sufficient transparency is of particular significance for the functioning of the financialmarkets. On the other hand, the IMF must not encourage moral-hazard attitudes on the part ofinvestors and recipient countries by bailing out private investors. Losses caused bymisjudgements and enforced adjustment in the event of wrong behaviour are as much an integralpart of a functioning market as are profit opportunities. And crises should not invariably lead to arollback on the part of private investors. Private funding of investment is in principle superior topublic funding. Ways must be found to safeguard the long-term interests of private investors.Though there is probably no panacea, various approaches are being considered, and rightly so.The IMF above all has to act as a catalyst maintaining or restoring countries’ access to privatecapital. A policy of bailing out private investors is heading in the wrong direction.Secondly, it is important for countries to eliminate their domestic weaknesses orprevent them from arising in the first place. This includes: being careful about overly rigidexchange rate pegs, strengthening domestic supervision of the financial system, and above all,strengthening domestic competitive structures in the goods markets and in the financial sector.VCynics might now say that Europe should make sparing use of the advice: “Becareful with exchange rate pegs”. After all, eleven European countries are actually on the roadtowards monetary union. And hitherto they have also largely linked their mutual exchange rates,though not always without any problems in the past.Monetary union does in fact represent a maximum of policy integration in themonetary field. Monetary policy is not merely coordinated, but unified. And that will be forgood, because in practice this step cannot be reversed.There were of course also some other options. With the European MonetarySystem, Europe’s approach has for a long time been that of an exchange rate arrangement withfixed but adjustable parities; at times there have been some considerable difficulties, but in theend the system has proved largely successful. That goes in particular also for the period after the
- 6 -BIS Review   45/1998widening of the  fluctuation margins. Nevertheless, this approach falls short of full monetaryintegration and the strategy of a single currency.At the time, your country above all proposed another, less ambitious solution thanfull monetary union; I am referring to the adoption of a parallel currency, to be used as acommon currency. That would probably have triggered a currency competition. Depending on itsdesign, that solution could, however, also have adversely affected the scope for monetary actionof the central banks of the existing hard currency countries and thus jeopardised theiranti-inflation policy. A parallel currency would presumably have got stuck. It might perhaps havebeen able to crowd out weaker currencies, but whether also a currency of the D-mark’s standingwould at least be doubtful. This is true, at any rate, of the specific form of monetary policyactivities discussed at the time.Be that as it may, in the Maastricht Treaty a more far-reaching solution wasadopted. A large majority in the EU opted not merely for a common currency. It also wanted asingle currency. There are sound economic reasons in favour of a single currency; incidentally,also sound political reasons, at least, if a more thorough-going political integration is beingsought.Above all, the single currency makes it possible fully to exploit the economicbenefits of integration. Competition will be given maximum encouragement in the single marketby the complete transparency of prices. Factor allocation will no longer be impaired by domesticexchange rate uncertainty. Exchange-rate-related information and transaction costs will beminimised by a single currency. The euro financial markets will have an optimum depth andbreadth.But what applies to economic integration in general also applies to monetaryintegration in particular: These benefits will not come automatically and not withoutcorresponding challenges.How can monetary union secure the benefits? What risks are looming?Monetary union is faced with three major challenges: Firstly, the aforementionedbenefits for the goods and financial markets will materialise only if the euro remains lastinglystable. Only then will the euro lead to full price transparency, reduce costs and become anattractive investment currency. Secondly, monetary union must not trigger or exacerbateeconomic tensions. Broadly speaking, an essential requirement that must be met is: one size fitsall. And, thirdly, monetary union must not give rise to political tensions between the participatingstates.These challenges arise against the backdrop of the specific conditions presentedby monetary union. The euro will be legal tender in an area which consists of largely sovereignnational states whose policies - other than monetary policy - will largely remain theirresponsibility. That may lead to a dilemma between the requirements of a supranational currency,and the political pattern in Europe, which will continue to be determined by the national statesand their policies.The euro needs a high degree of flexibility in the economies of the participatingcountries. But there is no European economic and structural policy which can ordain suchnecessary flexibility from above. And even if there were a responsibility at the European level for
- 7 -BIS Review   45/1998doing so, the possibility could not be ruled out that, ultimately, the result would be more rigidity,rather than more flexibility. At the same time, there is no regional revenue equalisation scheme,comparable to the systems operated in a national state. A social and transfer union cannot andmust not make up for any lack of flexibility and competitiveness, for the upshot would probablybe not only less flexibility, but possibly also more political disagreement.At the same time, however, the euro needs discipline on the part of national fiscalpolicy, at least as far as fiscal deficits are concerned. Otherwise there is a risk of conflicts,because large debts in some countries will attract the savings of the euro area as a whole, andcontribute to higher interest rates for everyone. Fiscal policy, however, will largely remain anational responsibility. That is why it is so important that the Growth and Stability Pact shouldprove to be effective in the future.How can the euro function against this background? The “classical” answer of theWerner Group in the early seventies (of which I was a member at the time) was: Europe must setup a political union parallel to the monetary union. Thus, supranational political structures weresupposed to ensure that Europe met the requirements of a supranational currency.Maastricht adopted a different approach. It left the rift between supranationalmoney and national policy structures. To that extent, it has sometimes been dubbed “a constructwith a limp”. If, however, there is no supranational political authority to meet the requirements ofa supranational currency, then the participating countries must do so on their own initiative, oftheir own accord or in their own interest.The Maastricht Treaty therefore also set important rules for the fiscal discipline ofmember countries. And compliance with those rules is likewise jointly monitored. However,what ultimately will be crucial for the functioning of the Stability Pact will, above all, be thecountries’ ability and willingness to abide by those rules on a sustained basis.A monetary union, under the Maastricht Treaty, therefore needs a large measure ofcommon “stability culture” in all participating countries. And another point: the euro canfunction as a depoliticised currency only in this specific form. The ultimate monetary target,i.e. monetary stability, must not be subordinated on a discretionary basis to other goals. Andmonetary policy must be conducted by a politically independent central bank.That may be considered in some quarters to be an overly German postulate. But inmy view this is implied not only by the requirements of a lastingly stable currency, but also bythe logic of a monetary union comprising several countries. For if one country subordinates itsown currency to political objectives other than stability, that may have unpleasant consequencesfor other countries, given globalised financial markets. But still, one could live with that. If,however, eleven countries try subordinating their common currency to their respective primarypolitical objectives, things will really get pretty chaotic in the union.That way, the euro would gain the confidence neither of the citizens nor of thefinancial markets. The upshot would, rather, be all too likely to be permanent political conflict.The euro must not come under the influence of the domestic interests of individual countries.Monetary policy must be geared to the situation in the euro area as a whole, taking responsibilityfor maintaining stability of the common currency. Some of the incidents in Brussels during thefirst weekend in May may in this context have been a timely warning, and a lesson to be learnedby all.
- 8 -BIS Review   45/1998VIThere can be no doubt that monetary union implies the irreversible loss of thesovereignty of the participating countries in the monetary sphere. Some loss of identity and of thesymbolism of a nation state will of course also be associated with giving up the nationalcurrencies. In Germany, this also means the loss of a symbol of economic reconstruction after thewar.Monetary union thus reinforces an overall trend towards global economicintegration, especially also as a consequence of the global financial markets: the nation stateforfeits some of its freedom to shape events. In some countries and some quarters there are alsofears about the immediate forfeiture of sovereign rights, as in the case of the currency, and alsoabout an uncontrolled dynamic integration process which will - automatically, as it were -relegate the nation state into the background.Here in the U.K. (but not only here) there seems to be some concern about anuncontrolled political integration drive in Europe: the fear of a “superstate of Europe”. Even ifthis fear is manifest to some extent in continental Europe, too, there is, at the same time, rather,more concern about an uncontrolled economic integration drive caused by increased competition.In Germany, there is, in addition, concern that the stability of the euro might not match that of theD-mark.At all events, the common underlying question is similar: If European integrationand/or globalisation reduces the economic and social management capacity of the nation state,and if the citizens’ democratic “say” in events remains tied to the institutions of the nation state,does it follow that a democracy problem is emerging?This question is of course much too sophisticated to be answered in a fewsentences. I only wish to note two points:Firstly, regarding the fear of a superstate of Europe. It is without doubt importantthat monetary union must become a success. This means that in the distant future, too, it shouldnot generate crisis situations which then - of necessity - will give rise to tendencies towardsoverly strong centralisation which actually no one wants. The lasting functionality and stabilityof monetary union is a prerequisite for political subsidiarity in Europe. Just as stable money isand will remain an essential prerequisite for internal subsidiarity in society. Even with furtherpolitical ties, that by no means is bound to lead to a superstate of Europe.And secondly: the extent to which cross-border integration and globalisation areseen as a democracy problem depends, not least, on one’s understanding of democracy. It iscorrect that open frontiers make reallocation more difficult. Anyone who regards reallocatingincome and wealth as the essence of democracy must indeed consider integration andglobalisation to be a threat. If, however, democracy is seen rather as a control mechanism againstundesirable political developments, then the international financial markets will be regarded,rather, as a supplement and less as a threat to democracy.Thus, the financial markets may often penalise an undisciplined fiscal policyquickly and massively. The burden arising from a long-term unsound policy therefore becomesevident much more quickly. Democracy in the sense of control can then function better.
- 9 -BIS Review   45/1998VIIThe global financial markets are certain to test the euro, the political andeconomic conditions in the euro area and the stability orientation of the European Central Bankas well. Basically, they are already doing so today, even though the euro and the EuropeanCentral Bank do not exist yet. It would be an illusion to believe that the global financial marketslook critically only at the emerging countries.The vital asset of a central bank is credibility. The decisions taken in Brussels tofill the vacancies on the Executive Board of the ECB essentially enhanced that credibility, ifanything.Actual independence from the influence of political bodies is essential for thefuture credibility of the European Central Bank. In my view, independence does not at allconflict with the requirements of democracy as long as the European Central Bank abides by itsmandate.Of course, adequate transparency of its decisions in the sense of explaining themto the general public and stating the reasons for them, is important. Accountability in this sensevis-à-vis the European political bodies, and especially vis-à-vis the European Parliament, isuseful and right. However, accountability must not undermine the largely apolitical character ofthe euro or its supranationality. Accountability vis-à-vis the national parliaments would not, inmy view, be consistent with the euro’s supranationality.From the very outset, it will therefore be essential for the European Central Bankto gain and retain the necessary confidence of the markets.Credibility normally develops gradually, on account of one’s own track record. Tothat extent, it seems to be a privilege to be able to inherit credibility from the national centralbanks. In this context, the Bundesbank, as the guardian of the D-mark (the long-standing anchorcurrency of the EMS) naturally plays an important part. This legacy, too, is of course not withoutobligation. Rudi Dornbusch, Carlo Favero and Francesco Giavazzi recently wrote in an article:“The capital markets will be unforgiving if they see anything less than Bundesbank policy.”In various respects the D-mark and the Bundesbank have acted as the model forthe euro and the ECB. Seen from a historic perspective, however - and in conclusion I shouldlike to come back to that point - there are some far more impressive models. As far as longevityand historical consistency are concerned, I hope that the euro and the European Central Bank willalso try to emulate the pound sterling and the Bank of England. This is true, at least, if onedisregards some periods in the Old Lady’s history which were not quite so successful. Viewedover the longer term, anyway, the U.K. has had more success with its currency than Germany,which saw two hyperinflations and the collapse of its currency in the first half of this century.But - if I am rightly informed - in this country, too, the question of whether yourcurrency may one day disappear and be replaced by the euro is no longer completely unthinkable.But that is of course your decision; specifically - if I have got it right - the decision of yourgovernment, Parliament and the British people.

BIS Review   45/1998Bank of Japan’s May report of recent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan communication, 21/5/98.The Bank’s view2Japan’s economy remains stagnant with continued strong downward pressures oneconomic activities.With respect to final demand, public-sector investment seems to have bottomedout.  However, growth in net exports has virtually peaked out as exports to other Asian countriesdecline.  Business fixed investment has been on the decline.  Private consumption shows no signof recovery although the deterioration has slowed.  Housing investment remains weak.  Againstthe background of weak final demand, inventories have accumulated further and industrialproduction continues to decline.  As a result, not only corporate profits but also employment andincome conditions have worsened significantly.The above indicates that production, income, and expenditure show negativeinteractions with one another.  In these circumstances, the economic stimulus package wasdecided, and the fiscal 1998 supplementary budget bill was submitted to the Diet.  Thesemeasures are expected to boost demand through additional fiscal expenditure and special incometax-reduction and thereby alleviate the downward pressures on the economy.  In order for theJapanese economy to resume a self-sustained recovery, improvements in corporate andhousehold confidence are vital.  Hence, the overall economic activity and the effects of theeconomic stimulus measures should be carefully monitored.With regard to prices, wholesale prices continue to fall, and the year-to-yearincrease in consumer prices (excluding the effects of institutional changes such as the rise in theconsumption tax rate) has been declining close to zero.  As for the future, the downward pressureon domestic prices, induced by the decline in import prices including overseas commodity prices,is weakening.  Also, the expansion in the output gap in the economy is expected to slow as theeconomic stimulus package is implemented.  In the immediate future, however, prices are likelyto weaken reflecting the present high inventory level and the relatively large output gap.In the financial markets, both long and short-term interest rates followed adeclining trend with the releases of weak economic indicators.  Yields on long-term governmentbonds have recorded a historical low and stock prices remain soft.  The yield differential betweenbonds issued by the private sector and those by the government, as well as the so-called “Japanpremium”, has remained at the relatively high level and shown no significant decrease, indicatingthe continuing cautious attitudes of market participants toward credit risk.With respect to monetary aggregates, the growth in M2+CDs, which had picked upfrom the end of 1997, slowed in March and April.  Also, the growth in broadly-defined liquidityhas been declining since the middle of 1997.                                                     1 This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meetingwas held on May 19, 1998.2 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the MonetaryPolicy Meeting held on May 19, as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
- 2 -BIS Review   45/1998Private bank lending remains sluggish.  Although corporate financing via thecapital markets and government financial institutions continues to expand, the increase in overallcorporate financing seems to indicate a clear slowdown under the stagnant economic conditions.Banks remain cautious in extending loans with a view to improving theirmedium-term profitability and financial soundness.  In the capital markets, the difference infund-raising costs of firms has remained relatively large according to their creditworthiness.  Insuch circumstances, some firms, especially small and medium-sized firms, have been facingdifficult financing conditions and this influence on the economy continues to warrant a carefulmonitoring.*       *       *NB   This BIS Review is available on the BIS World Wide Web site (http://www.bis.org)._____________________________
BIS Review   43/1998Mr. Stals elucidates monetary policy objectives in South Africa in theenvironment of financial globalisation   Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of SouthAfrica, Mr. C. Stals, at the Monthly Meeting of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle on11/5/98.1.  BackgroundMajor political and social reforms in South Africa in recent years created newexpectations, and many demands are being made on the Government for the social upliftment ofthe people. In defining its macroeconomic strategy, the South African Government first produceda Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) in 1994 in which legitimate needswere identified. The total cost of implementation of the RDP, however, as could have beenexpected, by far exceeded what was affordable. This was confirmed by the publication inmid-1996 of a Macroeconomic Strategy for Growth, Employment and Redistribution(GEAR), which concentrated more on the supply-side of the economy. GEAR provided aprogramme for macro-economic restructuring that is intended to raise the growth potential of thecountry over a five-year period from 3 to 4 per cent to 6 per cent per annum.In the Government’s macroeconomic strategy, monetary policy was tasked withthe responsibility of maintaining overall financial stability, or of protecting the value of thecurrency. It was assumed that the objectives of neither the RDP nor GEAR would be attainableunless overall financial stability is maintained.The instruction to the Reserve Bank to secure financial stability also appears inthe South African Reserve Bank Act, and was recently written into the new Constitution of theRepublic of South Africa. In terms of Section 224(1) of the Constitution:“The primary object of the South African Reserve Bank is to protectthe value of the currency in the interest of balanced and sustainableeconomic growth in the Republic”.The Constitution also provides for the protection of the independence of theReserve Bank:“224(2)  The South African Reserve Bank, in pursuit of its primaryobject, must perform its functions independently and without fear,favour or prejudice, but there must be regular consultation betweenthe Bank and the Cabinet member responsible for national financialmatters”.The macroeconomic strategy of the Government, and particularly the GEAR partof it, is often criticised and there are strong pressures, emanating mainly from labourorganisations, for the total rejection of this programme. The disciplined monetary policiesapplied in terms of the above mandates from the Government are also often denounced by thesepressure groups. The Reserve Bank is from time to time castigated for not following a policy thatwill provide more money at lower interest rates for the purpose of financing the social upliftmentprogrammes of the country.
- 2 -BIS Review   43/19982.  The main objective of monetary policyThe mandate from Parliament to the Reserve Bank is not explicit on what“protection of the value of the currency” really means. This obviously opens up the way formalignant attacks on the Bank, whatever objectives might be pursued.The main objective of the Bank, however, is to bring inflation down. Over thetwenty years from 1972 until 1992, inflation in South Africa fluctuated between 10 and 20 percent per annum, with an average of about 15 per cent. This was obviously too high, and therewas general public support for determined efforts by the Bank since 1990 to reduce inflation to asingle digit level. Since 1992, the rate of inflation has been contained within the single digitlevel, fluctuating between 5 and 10 per cent. Over the twelve months up to March 1998, theconsumer price inflation equalled 5.4 per cent, and at the production level, prices rose on averageby 2.3 per cent.In the absence of a formal quantified guideline from the Government, the ReserveBank defined its goal for inflation as a rate that will be more or less in line with the average rateof inflation in the economies of South Africa’s major trading partners and competitors. In thepresent world environment, this will require a rate of inflation of even lower than 5 per cent.The Reserve Bank is often criticised for being obsessed with inflation, and forunnecessarily depressing the domestic economy, in its efforts to reduce inflation. Studies likethose recently produced by Michael Sarel, an economist at the International Monetary Fund, arethrown against the Bank.3.  The monetary policy model of the Reserve BankIn 1986, South Africa introduced the M3 money supply as an anchor for monetarypolicy. Annual targets, or guidelines, for an acceptable rate of growth in M3 were announced bythe Bank, and decisions to influence overall liquidity in the banking sector, or to change the Bankrate, were triggered by substantial deviations in actual money supply growth from thepredetermined guidelines.To control the money supply, the Reserve Bank obviously had to manage theamount of liquidity available within the banking sector, and had to accept realistic interest rates.With fairly stable relationships between the money supply and aggregate demand, the modelserved South Africa well for a relatively long period of time. In 1987/88, for example, the rate ofgrowth in M3 was close to 30 per cent, and the rate of inflation 20 per cent. In 1992, growth inM3 was reduced to 8 per cent, and inflation declined to a single digit figure for the first time in1993.In recent years, however, with the major changes particularly in South Africa’sinternational financial relationships, the money supply model lost some of its usefulness. Overthe past four years, the rate of increase in the money supply has persistently stayed around thelevel of about 15 per cent, being about 5 full percentage points above the annual guidelines of theReserve Bank. Over the same period, total bank credit extension increased by about 16 per centper annum, a rate of growth that is also regarded as excessive by the Reserve Bank.And yet, gross domestic expenditure declined from 5 per cent growth in 1995 to1½ per cent last year, and inflation remained well under control. After a depreciation of the rand
- 3 -BIS Review   43/1998of 22 per cent in 1996, inflation rose correspondingly from 5 per cent to almost 10 per cent a yearlater. Over the past twelve months, however, inflation has come down again to the level of about5 per cent per annum.These developments forced the Reserve Bank to reconsider its monetary policymodel and to follow a more eclectic approach in which a strict financial (monetary) package isused as a basis for monetary policy decisions. This financial package includes:nmovements in the money supply and its components M1, M2 and M3;nchanges in total bank credit extension, both to the Government and theprivate sector;nthe level of interest rates and the structure of the yield curve;nchanges in the gold and foreign exchange reserves;  andnmovements in the exchange rate of the rand.In terms of Reserve Bank analyses, the main reasons for the breakdown in themoney supply model in recent years have been:n the almost explosive increases in volumes on the various financialmarkets;n the reintermediation in the banking sector of certain financial transactions,such as direct lending by foreign banks to South African non-bank privatesector institutions;n the absorption of many new workers from the subsistence sector in themarket economy;  andn the effects of large and volatile international capital flows on bankliquidity, interest rates and the money supply.The debate in South Africa at this stage about the monetary policy model iswhether South Africa should not, at this juncture, follow the example of many other countriesand introduce a formal inflation target as an anchor for its monetary policy.4.  Other objectives of monetary policyEffective monetary policy is, for obvious reasons, not only dependent on soundprinciples applied by the central bank, but also on the infrastructure or the architecture withinwhich we operate. In summary, over the past few years, we had to restructure our banking sector,our financial markets, and the national payment, clearing and settlement system to support theprocess of gradually introducing the South African financial system in the global markets.Bank regulation and supervision are, at this stage, a responsibility of the ReserveBank, but there are serious proposals for following the recent examples of the United Kingdomand Australia to remove these functions from the central bank. The present regulatory system isvery much based on the risk management approach as prescribed by the Basle Committee, andon the Core Principles. The major change in the South African banking sector in recent years wasthe introduction of more than 20 new foreign banks and additional foreign competition by theopening of more than 60 representative offices of foreign banks in South Africa.The financial markets were also encouraged to modernise. The JohannesburgStock Exchange (JSE) introduced major reforms to provide for corporate ownership, foreign
- 4 -BIS Review   43/1998ownership (of stockbrokers), dual capacity trading, negotiated commissions, and electronicscreen trading. It is continuing to improve its facilities by providing for the immobilisation anddematerialisation of stock, and for improved clearing and settlement arrangements. The totalturnover on the JSE last year amounted to about US $45 billion.Major changes were also introduced in bond trading, and the total turnover in theBond Exchange of South Africa last year amounted to the equivalent of US $927 billion.Non-residents accounted for $257 billion.The daily turnover in the market for foreign exchange in South Africa nowexceeds $10 billion.A Euro-rand market developed in Europe where the total amount of outstandingEuro-rand bonds now exceeds R37 billion.To stay in step with the financial globalisation process, the Reserve Bank recentlyalso upgraded the national payment, clearing and settlement system. The new system nowprovides for:nan electronic on-line real-time link between participating banks;nsecure fund transfers between banks through Reserve Bank settlementaccounts;na better management on a continuous basis of the liquidity positions ofbanks;nelectronically managed end-of-day settlement of interbank transactions;andnfrom the beginning of October, settlement of large transactions on a grossbasis as and when instructions are received by the system.5.  The financial globalisation processThe implementation of sound monetary policies and the establishment of a soundand well-managed banking sector, effective financial markets, and an efficient national payment,clearing and settlement system, were regarded as important preconditions for the extension ofSouth Africa’s participation in the process of financial globalisation.As a further important element of the process, South Africa is also removingexchange controls on a gradual and structured basis. There are, at this stage, no more exchangecontrols on any current account transactions; all controls were removed on non-residents who arenow free to bring funds into South Africa and to repatriate funds for any purpose; restrictions onresidents to make investments outside of the country have been eased for corporates, institutionalinvestors and private individuals, who may make foreign investments within fairly generousprescribed limits. These limits are being raised gradually until they will become ineffective.The South African approach on financial globalisation is that it is in the interest ofthe country to have access to foreign funds, and that we must therefore apply domestic financialand other macroeconomic policies that will make the country attractive to the foreign investor.
- 5 -BIS Review   43/1998Furthermore, policies in South Africa must be flexible enough to adjust quicklyand decisively to changes in foreign investor sentiment. When capital inflows subside, or switchinto outflows, as a minimum:nthe exchange rate must be allowed to absorb part of the shock;nan outflow of capital must reduce liquidity in the banking sector;ninterest rates must be allowed to rise;  andnsome inflationary pressures will develop that will require, almostimmediately, more restrictive monetary and fiscal policies.These adjustments will obviously not be painless, but will provide a basis forre-establishing confidence in the shortest possible time.
BIS Review   42/1998Mr. Tietmeyer discusses EMU – after the Brussels Summit   Address by thePresident of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof. Hans Tietmeyer, at the spring meeting of theInstitute of International Finance in Rome on 7/5/98.IIn Brussels last weekend some momentous decisions were taken.Now we can be sure about-the participation of eleven countries,-the bilateral rates at which the participating countries will irrevocably fixthe exchange rates of their currencies upon the start of monetary union, and-the candidates for the offices of the President, Vice-President and the otherfour members of the Executive Board. This means that the composition ofthe ECB Governing Council, in future comprising 17 members, is likewiseclarified.It is, I think, advisable to distinguish between the substance of the decisions andsome of the events in Brussels. Not everything that happened last weekend in Brusselscontributed to the necessary expectation that the euro will be a really supranational anddepoliticised currency. I hope, however, the learning process will go on and some of the thingsaccompanying the weekend decision will be forgotten shortly. For the future what counts mostis the substance of the decisions.The suggestions with regard to the nominations of the Executive Board of theECB are to be viewed favourably overall. The persons involved are acknowledged experts onmonetary and banking issues, and for the most part have many years of experience in the field ofmonetary policy. And the reactions by the markets were clearly positive. Some analysts are eventalking of a “dream-team”. But, of course, even the most promising dream-team has to make thebig points in reality.The EMI has already endorsed the nomination. And we are sure: the EuropeanParliament will do the same in the next few days, so that the ECB can be established asscheduled on the first of June.IIIn several respects, the Brussels decisions already alter European monetarypolicy-making today (and not merely in January 1999). The policies of the national centralbanks - although national responsibility still reigns, formally speaking, until the end of thisyear - are from now on influenced even more by European considerations.The phrase of “de facto monetary union” was used sometimes in the past. Afterall, many observers spoke of a “de facto monetary union” in connection with the EMS back in1991-92 - a notion that soon turned out to be an illusion. But during the seven-month interimperiod until the start of formal monetary union, there is certainly far more justification for thephrase than there was then.
- 2 -BIS Review   42/1998Firstly, subject to the well-known time-lags, the monetary policies of all theparticipating national central banks exert an impact on the entire euro area. Hence it is essentialnot to introduce any national inflationary pressures into the monetary union.Secondly, upon the entry into monetary union at the end of the year, if not before,uniform money market rates will pertain. On account of the increase in mutual interdependencein Europe, monetary policy cooperation between the national central banks will have to bereinforced, even though final responsibility will rest with the individual national central banks.There will presumably also be a further convergence of central bank rates.However, such convergence need not take place at the very beginning of the interim period.Limited interest rate differences and exchange rate movements may well continue to exist forsome time.It cannot yet be predicted where the common level of central bank rates willactually be by the end of the year. That depends primarily on monetary and anti-inflationarypolicy developments throughout “euroland”, with the larger countries naturally bearingparticular responsibility on account of their greater economic weight.In this connection, the future course of the “mix” of fiscal and monetary policy inthe individual countries will certainly play a part. After all, in future undesirable developmentswill not only exercise an impact on the domestic economy. From now on all “euroland”-centralbanks have to take that into account.IIIAs soon as the European Central Bank has been set up, the ECB GoverningCouncil will have a number of important decisions to take before the start of monetary union.For, needless to say, European monetary policy must be fully operational from the very first dayof monetary union. In particular, that calls for-a forward-looking, empirically-backed strategy, and-an effective arsenal of instruments.The European Monetary Institute has already done a good deal of preliminarywork on both those subjects. Although a consensus has been reached on most issues, a numberof options and details are still unresolved. It is on these that decisions are still required - if needbe, majority decisions. In any case, the new ECB Governing Council will in part be composeddifferently from the existing EMI Council.As regards the monetary policy strategy, two models have emerged from theEMI’s preliminary work: the strategy of direct inflation targeting and that of targeting the moneystock. We at the Bundesbank believe that our proven monetary targeting strategy is appropriatein principle for the euro area, too. At all events, studies suggest that the demand for money inthe euro area is actually likely to be even more stable than that in national markets.Above all, a monetary targeting strategy has the advantage that it involves aninherent commitment on the part of the central bank, and sets a standard by which the centralbank must let itself be judged. Hence a monetary targeting strategy may be a major element inbuilding up the European Central Bank’s reputation. Moreover, a monetary targeting strategy
- 3 -BIS Review   42/1998provides a dependable framework to which the markets’ expectations can be geared. It isforward-looking and indicates unwelcome developments at an early stage. However, initially itmay not be possible to rule out major volatilities in the movement of the money stock. Thatowes something to the existing differences in countries’ financial market patterns.Hence it no doubt makes sense to supplement the monetary targeting strategy bysome features of direct inflation targeting. Then the European Central Bank would have toelucidate its policies against the background of its money stock target and its price expectations.Such a twofold transparency, in which it seems to me the money stock target should have acertain primacy, could help the single monetary policy to build up a reputation swiftly in theinitial phase.The European Monetary Institute has also elaborated some proposals relating tothe range of policy instruments and its structure. The central banks are broadly agreed on anumber of instruments. That applies in particular to-the marginal refinancing facility,-the deposit facility, and-the open market instruments in the form of repo transactions (with fixedmaturities).Repo transactions have meanwhile been accepted by all the national central banksas an effective policy instrument consistent with market conditions.The marginal refinancing facility is intended as a safety valve in the event ofshort-term liquidity bottlenecks in the money market. It restricts upward swings in moneymarket rates and thus steadies the money market. The deposit facility likewise has a steadyingeffect, by offsetting short-term liquidity surpluses. It constitutes a floor for money market rates.Hence the two facilities virtually lay down the limits of the interest rate corridor.I know that the topic of minimum reserves is no favourite of the banks. Even so, Iadvise the ECB to make limited use of minimum reserves, not so much as a managementinstrument but rather as a basis instrument. Minimum reserves, as a durable basis instrument,enhance the responsiveness of money demand to changes in interest rates, and thus can makemonetary policy more effective.So as to guarantee the uniformity of the money market in the euro area, themonetary policy operations of the central banks in “euroland” should be settled on a same-daybasis. For that purpose, a cross-border large-value payment system - known as TARGET - isbeing set up. Since TARGET is attractive to the private sector as well, a disagreement has arisenabout the conditions of access. In the main, it revolves around the conditions on which banksand central banks outside the euro area are to be granted intra-day credit.There are good reasons for arguing that participants in another monetary areacannot be granted the same terms of access in every respect as participants within the monetaryunion. It seems to be only logical that those who wish to benefit fully from the advantages ofTARGET will also submit to the monetary policy constraints imposed by the euro area. At allevents, the monetary policy of the euro area must not be undermined by recourse to theTARGET system.
- 4 -BIS Review   42/1998Viewed as a whole, there are signs that the instrumental prerequisites for a euromonetary policy consistent with stability will soon all be met. Although that is not a sufficientcondition, it is certainly a necessary condition, for a stable euro. And the euro must be stable if itis to unfold in full its undoubtedly great potential for economic benefits. It is only as a stablecurrency that in future it will be able to play a major role as a global reserve and investmentcurrency, alongside the dollar. And it is only as a stable currency that the euro will make its duecontribution to the stability of the international financial system.IVBut the stability of the international financial system also depends ondevelopments outside Europe. At the moment, after all, international organisations,governments, central banks and private financial institutions (such as the IIF) as well areengaged in drawing conclusions from the dramatic course of events in South-East Asia. Someobservers are debating these conclusions in the rather imprecise terms of a radical reform of thestructure of the international financial system, with ideas ranging from the abolition of the IMFand World Bank - without replacement - to illusionary notions of a new Bretton Woods systemor even a World Central Bank.I am sure that all these extreme positions do not stand a chance in the real world.In point of fact - as the discussions three weeks ago at the spring meeting of the IMF and WorldBank in Washington showed - the key issue is how and in which direction the existing systemcan be strengthened.Unfortunately, the crucial importance of well-functioning markets for soundinternational finance is often underrated. In South-East Asia, at any rate, the functioning of themarkets was obstructed in two respects:-externally, by clinging too long to exchange rate parities which hadbecome unrealistic, and-internally, by investment decisions which were not geared adequately tosustained profitability.Any contribution to the prevention and solution of such crises cannot but enhancethe markets’ ability to function. And in this context it is not very helpful if the IMF undulyemphasises its financing role and steps in at an early stage with overly large financial packages.That only creates moral hazard problems. This is because such financing may easily bemisconstrued as an invitation to the countries concerned, as well as to other endangeredcountries, to refrain from undertaking essential structural reforms.Private investors, too, are tempted to pay less heed to the risks. Charles Dallarawas quite right to draw attention to these moral hazard problems in his recent letter to thechairman of the Interim Committee.In my opinion, improving surveillance is a much more promising approach.Besides macroeconomic data, financial market data should be monitored more closely than hasbeen the case hitherto. What we chiefly need, in my view, is more, and more up-to-date, data oncountries’ foreign currency debt. This is a challenge addressed to borrowers and lenders alike.
- 5 -BIS Review   42/1998The IMF should endeavour to obtain more, and above all better, data especiallyfrom the debtor countries. For the markets’ ability to function, it is essential that the businessdata collected should be more transparent, more complete and more up-to-date. It is only on thisbasis that the IMF can perform its primarily catalytic task. That strengthens the structure of theinternational financial system. And it should also be considered whether governments that fail tocomply with such transparency requirements should be publicly admonished.The challenge extends to creditors, too. At the BIS we are discussing at themoment how the time-lags in the provision of data can be substantially reduced. In particular,the crises in South-East Asia have demonstrated how important timely information on thematurity and the currency of loans may be.I greatly appreciate the fact that the Institute of International Finance activelybuttresses efforts to bring about greater transparency among creditors. After all, this also impliesa certain extra workload on creditor banks. But the responsibility for crisis prevention naturallyrests on both sides - on the multilateral organisations and the private financial institutions alike.And if a crisis does erupt despite all the efforts at prevention, it can mostly only be overcome ifprivate investors, too, pull their weight - pull their weight, that is, in a spirit of enlightenedself-interest.Charles Dallara was therefore undoubtedly right when he wrote:“In this era of globalization, both market participants and multilateralinstitutions have crucial roles to play; the more they understand each other,the greater the prospects for better-functioning markets and financialstability.”Of course, both sides have their own rules and responsibilities. But they havetheir common interests and responsibilities too.In the market-based financial world of today and tomorrow multilateralinstitutions can only play a limited role. Bailing out the private investors would not only bebeyond the limits of the available reserves; it would - and this is even more important -undermine the proper functioning of the private markets. I am happy to mention that theIIF-members seem to share this view.
BIS Review   42/1998Mr. Gunnarsson reports on some aspects of economic conditions andcurrent prospects in Iceland   Address by the Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland,Mr. Birgir Isl. Gunnarsson, at the Bank’s Annual Meeting on 31/3/98.On behalf of the Board of Governors of the Central Bank I welcome you to this37th Annual Meeting of the Bank. The Bank’s Annual Accounts for 1997 have today beenratified by the Minister of Commerce, and the Bank’s Annual Report has been published. TheReport gives an overview of the Bank’s operations and a detailed description of economic andmonetary developments in the past year, as well as of the Bank’s monetary policy objectives andmeasures. I will discuss some aspects of economic conditions and current prospects, mainlythose that are most closely linked to the Central Bank’s areas of responsibility.Economic GrowthGDP grew sharply in 1997 for the second year in a row. It is estimated thatgrowth was 5 percent, compared with 5.5 percent in 1996. Economic growth in Iceland duringthese two years has been far higher than in other industrial countries. In the European Uniongrowth was 2.6 percent and in the United States 3.8 percent; in Japan, which has faced adversityin recent times, growth was only 1 percent. The British economy has strengthened in recentyears and growth is estimated to have been 3 percent in 1997. The rapid growth of the domesticeconomy inevitably raises the question of whether this is consistent in the long run with theeconomic stability that has been achieved in recent years. The growing current account deficitclearly preaches caution and underscores the need for sufficiently tight monetary and fiscalconditions.Growth in 1997 was primarily driven by growing private consumption and fixedinvestment. Private consumption rose by 6 percent and fixed investment by 9.9 percent. Overthe last two years fixed investment has increased sharply following many years of contraction.Investment in power-intensive industry has played an important role, as has investment incommercial buildings. Housing investment has also begun to recover during the last two yearsbut not sufficiently to offset the decline in the previous year.Current Account DeficitThe current account deficit turned out smaller in 1997 than had been expected, orjust in excess of 8 billion kronur. Merchandise imports grew by 5.9 percent in volume terms,with consumer goods accounting for three-fifths of the increase and investment goods for lessthan a third. Here it needs to be borne in mind that it may have been mere coincidence whetherimports for power-intensive industrial projects were recorded in 1997 or 1998. More appear tohave been recorded in 1998 than expected. Merchandise exports grew by less than 2 percent involume terms, which is not a particularly good performance. The growth of exports is in fact tooslow in relation to, for example, the expansion of world trade. Thus, it can be said that slowexport growth is as much the cause of the current account deficit as the expansion of domesticdemand.Business Profitability and the Labour MarketThe external conditions of the economy in 1997 were largely unchanged from1996, and were on the whole favourable. Business profitability seems to have been fairly good,although not as favourable as in 1996, because of the wage increases at the beginning of the year
- 2 -BIS Review   42/1998and large depreciation and interest charges related to the high levels of investment in recentyears, especially in the fisheries. The labour market situation improved further andunemployment declined to 3.9 percent on average, having come down from a peak of 5 percentin 1995. Real wages grew by 5.7 percent in the course of 1997, and were at year-end at theirhighest level since 1989.PricesInflation remained subdued in 1997, or 2.2 percent in the course of the year, and1.8 percent on average between 1996 and 1997. The Central Bank had, in the wake of the wagesettlements, forecast somewhat higher inflation but wage increases did not translate into priceincreases to the extent shown by past experience. Productivity growth was higher than expectedand the rise in import prices lower. In addition, the Central Bank’s measures restrained priceincreases, as I will discuss in greater detail shortly. In January, the Bank forecast that inflationwould average 2.6 percent between 1997 and 1998, and 2.3 percent in the course of the year. Itseems clear that inflation during the first quarter of this year has been lower than expected inJanuary.Government FinancesIn 1997, the Treasury recorded a welcome surplus of 1.3 billion kronur on a cashbasis despite tax cuts, a rise in the wage bill and special interest payments associated withgovernment bond redemptions. In order to compare the outcome with the budget it is necessaryto exclude the special interest payments of 3.5 billion kronur. Thus adjusted, the Treasury’ssurplus was 4.7 billion kronur. A Treasury surplus had not been recorded since 1984. On anaccrual basis, which includes accrued interest and pension liabilities, the Treasury’s financesappear to have been close to balance in 1997. The Treasury repaid debt during the year.Amortization of foreign debt exceeded new borrowing by 6.5 billion kronur, or the equivalent of5 percent of the Treasury’s foreign debt; this marked the first time since 1986 that amortizationof foreign debt exceeded new borrowing. Domestically, new borrowing exceeded amortizationby 3.4 billion kronur.While this turnaround in the Treasury’s finances is certainly to be welcomed, itis, nonetheless, a somewhat mixed blessing. It is a matter of concern that the budgetedimprovement in the Treasury’s finances in 1998 is less than warranted by the automaticstabilizers alone and that, all other things equal, the degree of fiscal restraint on domesticdemand in 1998 will be less than last year. In preparations for the 1999 budget it is therefore ofparamount importance, in light of economic conditions, to aim for a substantial Treasurysurplus. The same considerations, of course, apply to the implementation of the 1998 budget,and any excess revenue should be used to improve the financial balance rather then end up asextra spending. I say this because there are limits on what monetary policy can accomplish torestrain domestic demand in the current circumstances.Local government finances deteriorated somewhat in 1997. The combinedrevenue deficit of the 14 largest municipalities was 2.9 billion kronur. It is estimated that localgovernment debt increased from 36 billion kronur to 42 billion kronur in 1997. Generalgovernment debt in relation to GDP declined from 56 percent in 1996 to 52.7 percent in 1997,which, in light of the Maastricht limit on government debt of 60 percent of GDP, is a fairly gooddebt position.Monetary Developments
- 3 -BIS Review   42/1998The Central Bank’s principal target remains price stability. The Bank’s monetaryinstruments primarily influence inflation in the long run, and it is generally accepted that pricestability is an important precondition for economic growth and improved living standards.Domestically there is a good consensus about this goal, as is the case in most countries wherecentral banks pursue the same or a similar objective.In an open economy such as the Icelandic one a stable exchange rate is necessaryfor favourable price developments. A stable exchange rate has, therefore, been an intermediatetarget for monetary policy. The Central Bank implements monetary policy mainly by setting itsown interest rates and by intervening on the money market. In the short run the Bank can alsoinfluence the exchange rate through the purchase and sale of foreign currency.Given the conditions that prevailed in 1997, there was clearly a danger ofoverheating which led the Central Bank to pursue a tight monetary policy. After the Bank hadraised money market rates in the fall of 1996 the differential between domestic money marketrates and those in main trading partner countries widened to 3 percentage points. This was anecessary response to the growing uncertainty about the outcome of the pending wagenegotiations, and it led to an acceptable equilibrium for some time. However, some currencyoutflow was experienced during the first weeks of 1997 until the outline of the wage settlementsbegan to emerge. The wage settlements eased fears of rising inflation and increased confidencein a stable exchange rate. The Central Bank, nevertheless, maintained unchanged interest rates,and considerable currency inflow took place through July. International reserves grew to a peakof 36.2 billion kronur at the end of July, up 5.2 billion kronur from the beginning of the yeardespite the repayment of some of the Treasury’s foreign debt.The Central Bank thought it desirable that the exchange rate of the krona shouldstrengthen somewhat to lessen pressures on the domestic market and dampen inflationpressures. The Bank’s measures undoubtedly contributed to lower inflation than expected.Monetary developments changed course at the beginning of August. Currencyoutflow commenced anew and bond market yields began to rise. This change was the result ofincreased purchases of foreign securities by residents, a stop in the relending of foreign loansand an increase in general bank lending. The differential between domestic and foreign moneymarket rates had also narrowed because of interest rate rises in some neighbouring countries.When it had become clear that this was not a temporary situation, the Central Bank respondedby raising interest rates by 0.3 percent in mid-November. The interest rate had an immediateimpact, the exchange rate of the krona strengthened and the currency outflow stopped. At theend of the year, the exchange rate index was 0.9 percent below the central rate of the fluctuationrange after having strengthened on the whole by 1.4 percent in the course of the year.International reserves stood at 27.8 billion kronur at year-end, down 3 billion kronur from a yearearlier. Reserves are now about 27 billion kronur. The Central Bank’s short-term foreignliabilities were close to zero at year-end, where they in fact remain.The Bond MarketBond market reforms were continued in 1997. In 1996, the Central Bank decidedto withdraw from the long-term market and reached custodian agreements with three securitiesfirms following a bidding process. The Bank handed over to the firms a part of its securitiesportfolio and at the same time ceased to be a market maker in government bonds, governmentnotes and housing bonds. The experience from these agreements is positive and they were
- 4 -BIS Review   42/1998renewed in March 1997. The new agreements were more extensive than the earlier ones, and intheir wake two banks announced that they would engage in market making for certain classes ofgovernment securities in the same manner as the custodial firms. It is not unlikely that suchcustodial agreements will become unnecessary and that the Central Bank will no longer need tobe involved in ensuring adequate market making in the long-term market. Both the Treasury andthe State Housing Authority began to reorganize the classes of bonds they issue, with the effectof improving the price determination of government guaranteed bonds and raising turnover inthe secondary market.The Central Bank’s Monetary Policy InstrumentsIn 1997, the Central Bank began preparing changes to its monetary policyinstruments. The purpose was twofold: first, to level the playing field for domestic creditinstitutions with respect to their access to facilities at the Central Bank, and, second, to adjustthe operating environment of domestic credit institutions to the environment prevailing in theEuropean Economic Area.These changes have been modelled on the instruments designed for theprospective European Central Bank, which will be established on July 1 and formallycommence operations on January 1, 1999. Under the auspices of the European MonetaryInstitute, the precursor to the European Central Bank, work has proceeded on designing themonetary instruments of the bank. The Central Bank has followed this work to the extentpossible. Some issues, such as concerning reserve requirements, will not be resolved until afterthe European Central Bank has been established. The Central Bank may therefore adjust its ruleswhen the situation in Europe becomes clearer.The first step in changing the Central Bank’s instruments was taken on March 1and covered the following. The liquidity requirement of deposit banks was abolished. Weeklyauctions of 14-day repurchase agreements replaced the tap-sale of these agreements. Allgovernment guaranteed securities and the Central Bank’s certificates of deposit qualify ascollateral for repurchase agreements rather than only Treasury bills and certificates of deposit.The Central Bank will auction 14-day certificates of deposit when it feels the need to withdrawliquidity. The direct sale of 45-day certificates of deposit will cease, but 90-day certificates willcontinue to be sold. A new overnight facility for credit institutions subject to reserverequirements was established at the Central Bank. Collateral for overnight loans will beprovided by government guaranteed securities held by the credit institutions.The next step in these changes will take place on April 1 when new rulesgoverning reserve requirements will take effect. The reserve base will be widened to include theforeign borrowing of credit institutions while the reserve requirement ratio will be lowered asthe change is intended to be broadly neutral with respect to required deposits, thus making thechange neutral from a monetary policy perspective. The reserve requirement ratio will be 4percent on obligations under 1 year to maturity but 1.5 percent on obligations tied for longerthan 1 year. Also, the reserve requirement will cover more institutions than before, and onlyinstitutions subject to reserve requirements will have access to facilities at the Central Bank. Itwill be possible to meet the reserve requirement more flexibly than has been the case.Indexation of required deposits will be abolished but the interest rate on them will initially beset on the basis of prevailing yields.
- 5 -BIS Review   42/1998The last step in these changes will be taken on May 21 when the first calculationsbased on the new rules concerning reserve requirements will be done. At the same time, theso-called discount quota, which is a facility that the Central Bank has offered to deposit banks,will be abolished. The Bank will also close the foreign currency accounts of deposit banks it hasheld.Since 1987 the Central Bank has targeted interest rates to achieve its monetarypolicy objective rather than targeting the money supply or base money. The access that depositbanks have to liquidity at the Central Bank is therefore flexible and at their own discretion, withthe Bank’s interest rates among the factors influencing the extent to which the draw on liquidityfrom the Central Bank. At the outset, the long-term market was most important to the CentralBank but as the money market and the foreign exchange market developed during 1992 and1993, the Bank began to focus its activities on them. The Central Bank’s instrument rate is nowthe yield it requires on repurchase agreements with credit institutions. This arrangement issimilar to the most common practice among industrial countries, and is based on the premisethat central bank instrumental rates largely determine money market rates. Money market ratesthen influence price developments, with price stability being the ultimate objective, through twochannels. First, they have a strong direct impact on currency flows and the exchange rate whencapital movements have been liberalized. Second, they affect the interest rates of deposit banksand the entire interest rate spectrum, which in turn influences consumption and investment andthereby affect the level of demand on goods and labour markets. Thus, the Central Bankachieves its objective whether it targets prices directly or indirectly by having the exchange rateas an intermediate target.The changes that the Central Bank implemented at the beginning of Marchconcerning repurchase agreements had two components. On the one hand, the definition of thecollateral that qualified for repurchase agreements was widened to include again, after anintermission, all market listed government guaranteed securities and central bank certificates ofdeposit. The purpose of this change is to level the positions of the various governmentsecurities, as varying positions in regard to liquidity transactions with the Central Bank caninfluence their relative market yields. It is clear that such limitations do not exist amongIceland’s neighbours. In addition, the stock of outstanding Treasury bills has shrunk in therecent period, which has caused a shortage of these bills for deposit banks to use in theirrepurchase agreements with the Central Bank. The other change is, as mentioned before, that thepractice of offering repurchase agreements on tap has been abolished and replaced by a weeklyauction of the agreements, as is done in many industrial countries. The Central Bank can at itsdiscretion choose to auction reverse repurchase agreements instead of straightforwardrepurchase agreements.Neither of these changes alters the course of monetary policy. However, they didhave the effect of reversing the rise in money market rates that had occurred in January andFebruary, when the interbank rate rose to 8.3 percent because of the shortage of Treasury billson the market. This moved money market rates back to the level the Central Bank had aimed forwhen it set its interest rates in November, a range of 7.2-7.4 percent. It is always debatable whatis precisely the right level of money market rates in light of the situation on and prospects forthe foreign exchange market in the short run and for the goods and labour markets 1-2 yearshence. The Central Bank’s current assessment is that the level of the interest rate set inNovember provides sufficient restraint to ensure price stability in the period ahead. However,this assessment is under constant review in light of the development of a host of indicators.
- 6 -BIS Review   42/1998Foreign Exchange MarketThe foreign exchange market was reorganized in 1997. The exchange ratequotation meetings were abolished and replaced by a continuous market. Furthermore, marketparticipants other than the Central Bank, now six institutions, replaced the Bank as marketmakers on this market. The arrangement is now similar to that among many neighbouringcountries. The Central Bank’s transactions on the foreign exchange market are now always at itsown initiative, and should be view as intervention aimed at influencing the exchange rate. Thenew market arrangement has greatly improved the flow of information about market conditionsand made the market more active. Also, all information about pressure on the exchange rate nowappears instantaneously and the volume of transactions has grown sharply. Total turnover on theforeign exchange market was 162 billion kronur in 1997, and had doubled since 1996. Inaddition, the participation of the Central Bank in foreign exchange market transactions fell from82 percent of turnover in 1996 to 37 percent in 1997. So far this year turnover has continued toincrease and the share of the Central Bank has declined to 13.2 percent. Average daily turnoverhas been about 2 billion kronur this year. Daily fluctuations in the exchange rate increased as aresult of last year’s change, but not much when compared to what is common among othercountries. Since mid-1993, or for almost 5 years, the exchange rate of the krona has neverdeviated more than 2.1 percent from the central rate.Yields on Domestic MarketsMoney market yields declined in the course of the year until the Central Bankraised its rates in November after which they rose. Yields on 3-month Treasury bills rose to 7.22percent where they stood at year-end. A low Treasury borrowing requirement at times caused ashortage of Treasury bills. Demand for Treasury bills was also boosted because of increasedinterest in them for liquidity management.Yields on indexed bonds changed little during the first half of 1997 but duringthe second half the yield on government bonds and housing bonds fell sharply, albeit unevenly.This decline was partly the result of the low Treasury borrowing requirement. The yield onnon-indexed government bonds also declined sharply in 1997, although also unevenly, to 8.3percent at year-end. Yields on both indexed and non-indexed bonds have continued to fall thisyear, with the yield on government guaranteed indexed bonds now well below 5 percent whichsome had regarded as the floor.Although money and bond market yields declined in 1997 the lending rates ofcommercial and saving banks changed little. These rates have now begun to come down.Profitability of deposit institutionsThe profitability of banks improved during 1997. Current information on profitsof the commercial banks shows a substantial increase compared with the preceding year. Theircombined return on equity was 9.2% in 1997, compared with 8.2% in 1996 and 5% in the yearbefore that. Nonetheless, profitability varied widely among them, and the different conditionsthat they faced complicate comparisons. Landsbanki (the National Bank) and Búnaðarbanki (theAgricultural Bank), for example, incurred large irregular expenses related to the final settlementof their pension obligations, which cannot be expected to recur in future. Provisions to reservesfor loan losses have fallen sharply among all the banks. At the same time, the six largest savingsbanks recorded some decline in profitability compared with the previous year, and their return
- 7 -BIS Review   42/1998on equity was 8.5%. I should underline, however, that profitability varied widely amongindividual savings banks.Reforms to the Banking SystemThere now appears to be widespread agreement that efficiency needs to beimproved in the banking system in order to lower costs and make domestic banks morecompetitive in relation to foreign competitors, which will seek a market share in Iceland. It isnecessary to take advantage of the opportunity provided by the incorporation of the state banksinto limited liability companies and the prospective sale of shares in them. Certain goals need tobe kept in mind. Effective competition on financial markets needs to be secured, although themerger of institutions should not be excluded if it can improve efficiency and profitability. Theimportant question arises whether the state as owner of three strong institutions should take thelead in the necessary restructuring or whether powerful institutional investors are needed to dothe job. Foreign investors with experience in banking are one option. The latter approach may,however, prevent the Treasury from realizing the full value of its assets in the bankinginstitutions. The wide distribution of share holdings will also undoubtedly be an issue in thedebate. This is by no means a simple matter and desirable goals may not be fully consistent. Themain goal must be to ensure effective competition and efficiency improvements in the operationof credit institutions.Pension FundsIt is estimated that the assets of the pension funds which are available to paypensions, stood at 345 billion kronur at the end of 1997, an increase of more than 39 billionkronur, or 12.7 percent, in the course of the year. The composition of pension fund assets haschange somewhat. Holdings of market listed securities expanded by 25.6 billion kronur whileholdings of other securities declined by 3.7 billion kronur. At the end of 1997, the pension fundsheld 21.7 billion kronur worth of domestic shares. The pension funds’ holdings of foreignsecurities grew sharply in 1997, or by 12.6 billion kronur, about one-half of which was inshares. At the end of 1997, the pension funds held foreign securities valued at 22.2 billionkronur.Payment IntermediationOver the last two years, the Central Bank has increasingly turned its attention topayment systems, both to specific payment forms and to settlement systems. The Bank hasreleased two reports on this subject, one on electronic payment forms and another on acomparison of payment intermediation in Iceland with international practice. In recent yearsthere has been growing international concern that settlement systems do not adequately take intoaccount settlement risks. Two responses have been adopted. First, strong conditions have beenimposed on net settlement systems which lower risk, and plans have been laid for thecontingency that a settlement party is unable to meet its obligations. Second, net settlementsystems have been abandoned in favour of real-time settlement, in which each transaction isrecorded immediately and permanently, rather than transactions being netted, for example, at theend of the day. It now appears to be generally accepted that settlement systems, where thecentral bank provides settlement services, should be real-time systems. In light of this, in 1997the Central Bank began in co-operation with financial institutions a review of domesticsettlement systems with the view of bringing them into line with best international practice. Theaim is to establish a real-time settlement system in 1999. The operation of a real-time settlement
- 8 -BIS Review   42/1998system will be a precondition for participation in the European Central Bank’s TARGETsettlement system should it become available.Financial System StabilitySecuring the sound operation of financial institutions is a task of steadily growingimportance for the Central Bank. By law, the Central Bank is required to protect the monetarysystem and support sound money and securities transactions. Central banks pursue this task in avariety of ways. They carefully follow those macroeconomic developments, which impactmoney flows and thus the profitability of financial institutions. Securing payment and settlementsystems is a central bank task across the world. Central banks are also lenders of last resort tofinancial institutions and need to be prepared to lend resources in excess of what wouldnormally be required. The Central Bank of Iceland has partly performed this task through itsBank Inspectorate which has been built from the ground up in the Bank and is closely linked tosome of the Bank’s other activities, for example in regard to a joint database. Parliament iscurrently debating draft legislation, which calls for the creation of a new supervisory institution,which would combine all supervision of financial institutions. I cannot deny that the CentralBank is opposed to these ideas for reasons I discussed at this venue last year, and I shall not gointo the issue in any more detail now. However, since the government’s wishes in this matterbecame clear the Central Bank has co-operated wholeheartedly with the Ministry of Commercein preparing the best possible legislation in this area and in securing the necessary link betweenthe Central Bank and the new supervisory institution and also to ensure that The Central Bankwill have all necessary opportunities to guard a sound and effective financial system. In somecentral banks, which do not have supervision among their responsibilities, such as in Swedenand the United Kingdom, much work has been put into defining the relevant tasks of the centralbank. The Central Bank is bound to seek models in these countries when it becomes clear thatthe Bank Inspectorate will depart.European Monetary UnionThere are now 9 months until the member countries of the European Union,which meet the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty and become members of the EuropeanMonetary Union, adopt a new currency, the euro. There is now little to suggest that this will nothappen on January 1, 1999 and the European Central Bank will be established this coming July1. The Central Bank has thought it necessary to follow these developments closely, not least inorder to be able to analyze the impact on Iceland and the options available to Iceland in the newenvironment. In June 1997, the Central Bank released a report European Monetary Union,Creation and Impact. The Bank will release interim reports on this issue as the occasionwarrants. At this stage, it is premature to say what impact the Monetary Union will have onIcelandic exchange rate policy or on the options Iceland will face. I will, nevertheless, say a fewwords about the subject as it appears from the perspective of the Central Bank. The outlook isnow that 11 countries will form the Monetary Union at the outset. These countries account foronly 33 percent of Iceland’s external goods trade. The initial impact will therefore not be nearlyas significant as has been suggested in the domestic debate. Only when the United Kingdomjoins the Monetary Union will more than one half of Iceland’s goods trade be with countries inthe union.But which options will we have as regards exchange rate policy when theMonetary Union has come into existence? Theoretically the options are: 1) the current system;2) a floating exchange rate; 3) a unilateral link with the euro; 4) a bilateral link with the euro;
- 9 -BIS Review   42/1998and 5) introducing the euro as legal tender in Iceland. This list does not include membership ofthe Monetary Union, as that is only available to members of the European Union.Three factors need to be considered when weighing these options: first, thesuccess they will produce in terms of low inflation and economic stability; second, how likelyare they to narrow interest rate differentials vis-à-vis abroad; and, third, the flexibility they offerin case of external shocks, whether positive or negative.The current arrangement calls for the maintenance of a trade-weighted exchangerate index within 6 percent on either side of a central rate. The arrival of the euro will notprevent the continuation of this arrangement. The euro would be assigned a weight in thecurrency basket consistent with the Monetary Union members’ share of Iceland’s external trade.This approach will, however, not yield any progress towards narrowing interest rate differentialsvis-à-vis those abroad beyond the growing credibility that economic stability will achieve on itsown in due course. In addition, the experience of recent years, most recently from Asia showsthat it has become more difficult to maintain a stable exchange rate with the liberalization ofcapital movements and ever larger and more active international financial markets. A responseto this would be to allow the exchange rate to float, but in order to maintain low inflation andachieve narrower interest differential vis-à-vis abroad this would call for the adoption of a directinflation target with the Central Bank entrusted to pursue it.A unilateral link to the euro is hardly an option, as it would yield little in terms ofgreater credibility of stability and narrower interest differential vis-à-vis those abroad. Inaddition it has the drawback of not reflecting the composition of Iceland’s external trade, at leastfor as long as the United Kingdom remains outside the monetary union. A bilateral link wouldbe better, as it would enhance credibility by virtue of the commitment of the European CentralBank to defend the link, and would result in narrower interest rate differentials. The exchangerate risk premium would not vanish entirely because the commitment of the European CentralBank would never be without limits and conditions. It should be pointed out that it is unclear ifand when the European Central Bank will be willing to discuss the possibility of bilateralco-operation with countries outside the union. Exchange rate changes could still take place inthe case of a bilateral link with the euro. Only if the krona were abolished and replaced as legaltender by the euro, in a similar manner as Panama and Liberia have done with respect to thedollar, would exchange rate risk and the associated interest rate risk premium disappear.However, it is good for thought that no country with its economy in good order has chosen thispath. Seignorage then accrues to another country or group of countries and all influence overmonetary policy is surrendered. Nor is it clear that such a path would be acceptable to theEuropean Central Bank. Participation in the Monetary Union would be a preferable option toadopting the unions currency unilaterally as this would allow for a share in seignorage and givethe possibility for influencing monetary policy decisions. This would, however, requiremembership of the European Union as I mentioned earlier and any decision in that regard ofcourse concerns wider issues than only monetary and exchange rate arrangements.This is of course a very general analysis of the options we face, but neverthelessshows that the issue is more complicated than we are sometimes led to believe. All thealternative options have strengths and weaknesses. Also, future developments and what willactually be on offer are still in doubt. One reason is that the European Monetary Institute, theprecursor of the European Central Bank, has not been empowered to discuss linkages with anynon-member of the European Union. The task of preparing Monetary Union has been more thansufficient. Until these matters are clarified, the best thing for Icelanders to do is to contain
- 10 -BIS Review   42/1998inflation and preserve economic stability in order to be able to choose among future optionsfrom a position of strength. The experience of others has shown that there are no instantsolutions when it comes to the exchange rate and that what matters are strong fundamentals andsteady economic management.Concluding RemarksLadies and gentlemen,At present, the Icelandic economy is reasonably well balanced. The outlook isnevertheless for a current account deficit in 1998 for the third year in a row. Price increasesremain very moderate and there are still no signs of general wage drift although it can be spottedin certain sectors. Economic growth will continue to be high. It is likely that the slack thatexisted in the economy when the recovery began has now disappeared. Strong growth willstimulate demand for goods and services and fuel the danger of cost increases being translatedinto price increases. The implications is that there is a danger of overheating. Therefore, theCentral Bank will continue to pursue a tight monetary policy.Finally, I would like to express my thanks for the pleasant co-operation theCentral Bank has had with the government and financial institutions in Iceland.
BIS Review  40/1998˝Mr. Desario reports on growth prospects and implications for supervision ofasset management   Address by the Director General of the Bank of Italy, Dott. Vincenzo Desario,at the conference “Asset management: insurance companies versus banks” held in Rome on 9/4/98.1. IntroductionThe growth of asset management has been a common feature of the financial systemsof all the leading industrial countries. In Italy, the growth has been especially rapid in the last twoyears, under the influence of both cyclical and structural factors.The professional management of savings has always been a characteristic aspect offinancial intermediation. Its scope was originally limited to the management of individual estates andthe provision of financial advice.The mandate to engage in financial investment conferred by savers (assetmanagement) does not place intermediaries under an obligation to repay the nominal value of theprincipal invested, nor does it guarantee the achievement of a given yield. The scope of the activityhas become much broader; it now involves a wide range of different financial intermediaries andinstruments and a much larger pool of investors.The sharp increase in financial flows has led intermediaries to operate in a variety ofmarkets and expand the number of innovative products they offer. The ranks of those involved havegrown: banks and insurance companies have been joined by investment houses and investment fundmanagement companies, the savings of high-income customers by those of lower-income workersand pensioners, and individual investors by institutional investors.The operational overlap between different categories of intermediary and thesubstitutability of different types of instrument have increased. Competition has become fiercer atboth the domestic and the international level. The need to achieve a critical mass in order to operatein a market where the geographical boundaries and the supply of products are changing rapidly hasprompted reorganizations, concentrations and the formation of conglomerates.The expansion of asset management has been a major driving force in financialinnovation and has contributed everywhere to the erosion of institutional segmentation and to thepressure to change the organization of controls.I shall look first at the evolution of asset management at the international level, beforeanalyzing its development in Italy and the role of banks and other intermediaries. In view of theopportunities and risks that this development entails, I shall also address supervisory issues, the newlegal framework established recently with the consolidated law on financial markets and the need forcloser and more effective cooperation between authorities, both in Italy and in international fora.2. Asset management in the industrial countriesThe rapidity of the growth of the international asset management industry is reflectedin the share of the financial instruments it offers in households’ portfolios and the importance ofinstitutional investors.Between 1982 and 1994 - a period for which comparable figures are available - therewas a significant shift in the composition of households’ portfolios in all the leading OECDcountries: while the share of financial assets held as bank deposits declined, that of products offeredby insurance companies, investment funds and pension funds grew steadily.
- 2 -˝BIS Review  40/1998˝Significant differences between countries nonetheless persist within this commontrend. At the end of the period considered, the proportion of households’ financial portfolioconsisting of managed assets was one-sixth in Italy and France, one-fourth in Germany and Japan,two-fifths in the United Kingdom and three-fifths in the United States.During the same period, the assets of institutional investors (insurance companies,investment funds and pension funds) increased in relation to the total volume of financialintermediation and gross domestic product. Differences in the role of institutional investors in thevarious countries are captured by the latter indicator: the assets under their management were equalto 30 per cent of GDP in Italy and Germany but amounted to more than 200 per cent of GDP in theUnited Kingdom and Japan (Table 1).The disparity in the size of the sector in the different countries does not prevent usfrom identifying a number of shared structural determinants of the growth in asset management.The first and most important is the gradual aging of the population, which fuelsdemand for pension-related financial instruments. The difficulties faced by public pension systemsreinforce this trend: asset management has grown the most in countries whose pension systems areprimarily based on private pension schemes; where public systems play a major role, the sector hasdeveloped later and grown more slowly.The tight limits on budget deficits imposed by the stability pact among the countriesparticipating in the Economic and Monetary Union will accelerate recourse to private pensionarrangements, giving additional impetus to the growth of institutional investors in Italy, France andGermany.The liberalization of capital movements at the end of the 1980s was an equallyimportant propulsive factor. New opportunities to diversify financial investments were opened up tosavers in countries that had previously imposed foreign exchange restrictions. It became possible toconstruct portfolios with the desired combination of risk and return; at the same time, it became moredifficult to manage portfolios, increasing the importance of the services offered by specializedintermediaries.The decline in the rate of inflation in recent years, together with the restoration ofmacroeconomic stability, has been another factor contributing to the growth and has encouraged ashift in financial resources towards longer-term assets and, above all, the stock market.The spread of asset management has not had the same features everywhere. In theUnited States, the process has been accompanied by a considerable reduction in the role of banks; inthe countries of continental Europe the latter have retained a significant position and in many caseshave been the main actors in promoting the growth of the sector.In reality, the growth of asset management does not necessarily lead to bankingdisintermediation: the competition triggered by the changed preferences of savers, new technologyand more refined financial instruments, and the evolution of the legal framework does not favour anyone type of intermediary but rather modifies the characteristics of financial intermediation andfinancial products as we know them today.Asset management, defined as the all-inclusive professional management of savings,is destined to produce lasting changes in the structure of the financial system we have inherited, inthree main directions: greater concentration in the production of asset management services, anexpansion of financial assets in relation to real wealth, and an increase in the importance of thesecurities market.
- 3 -BIS Review  40/1998˝The search for optimal size in asset management activities, internationaldiversification strategies and the need to create efficient integrated structures for the production anddistribution of financial products have given rise to mergers between some of the world’s leadingintermediaries.The growth in asset management has contributed to financial deepening in the leadingindustrial countries. Between 1982 and 1994 the ratio of gross financial assets to real wealth rosefrom 0.8 to 1.6 in the United States and from 1.5 to 2.5 in the United Kingdom.Institutional investors are channelling an increasingly large volume of funds towardsthe financial markets. The arbitrage activities they engage in and their ability to trade in highlyvolatile financial assets give breadth and depth to the securities market, reinforcing its role in theallocation of savings and the redistribution of risk. It is worth noting the introduction of derivativecredit instruments and the growing recourse to techniques for securitizing of bank loans.The connection between the development of asset management and the growth of thestock market is shown by the fact that at the end of 1995 the shareholdings of UK pension fundswere greater than the total capitalization of the Italian and German stock markets.In certain circumstances the behaviour of institutional investors could accentuatetensions in securities markets. In markets of insufficient depth, price fluctuations are likely to beamplified by the use of dynamic hedging techniques or the imitative behaviour of managers seekingto reduce the risk of performing less well than their competitors.3. The growth of asset management in ItalyIn Italy, the spread of asset management products has increased appreciably in recentyears, approaching the levels achieved in the other leading countries.Between 1990 and 1997 the aggregate comprising investment funds, portfoliomanagement services, pension funds and life insurance companies’ technical reserves increased from150 trillion lire to just under 1,000 trillion, rising from 8.5 to 33 per cent of total domestic financialassets (Table 2).The increase was especially large in 1997. Net fund-raising by investment fundstripled by comparison with 1996 and amounted to 143 trillion lire. In the first nine months of 1997,the net inflow of resources to portfolio management services nearly doubled to 64 trillion lire, whilepremiums paid in respect of life insurance policies grew more moderately, increasing by 44 per cent.The differences between the products offered by the various categories ofintermediary have narrowed. About one-quarter of the funds raised by portfolio management serviceswere reinvested in investment funds. In the insurance industry there has been strong growth inproducts with a more pronounced financial component, such as single premium policies, sales ofwhich increased by 125 per cent in the first nine months of 1997.The impressive increase in asset management in 1997 was boosted by the decline ininterest rates that accompanied the fall in inflation. Small investors entrusted professional managerswith savings that had previously been invested in government securities as they sought to increasetheir returns, inter alia through capital gains.The shift from personal investment to asset management has led to a greaterdiversification of households’ and firms’ investment portfolios. Nonetheless, considering the total
- 4 -˝BIS Review  40/1998˝assets held directly or indirectly by savers shows that the redistribution of final investmentinstruments is taking place gradually. In the past two years the substantial reduction in households’demand for government securities has been largely offset by the increase in the subscriptions ofinvestment funds. Only in part has it translated into purchases of listed shares and especially foreignsecurities.The preference for asset management is likely to be reinforced by the recent changesin the tax treatment of financial assets. The new procedures for the taxation of financial income,based on an all-inclusive approach, relieves investors in managed asset instruments from having tosend in returns and requires the intermediaries providing the service to settle the related taxliabilities. The new rules also standardize the procedures for individual and collective instruments; asimplification that should enhance operational efficiency.The flow of funds to institutional investors and to the securities market requires anadequate response in terms of the supply of financial instruments. Greater recourse by firms to themarket, through debt and equity issues, will enable the productive economy to benefit from Italy’ssubstantial saving capacity and give intermediaries an opportunity to expand their investmentbanking services.The supply policies of banks, especially the leading Italian banking groups, haveplayed a key role. Capitalizing on professional asset management is now a central strategic objective;it is in line with customer preferences, helps offset the downward trend in interest income, increasesproductivity through a better utilization of labour, and consolidates the fiduciary relationship withsavers.In 1996 managed asset services contributed substantially to banking groups’profitability, producing gross revenue of more than 4 trillion lire or around one-third of pre-taxprofit.In the same year banks and their subsidiaries handled 70.4 per cent of all managedassets in Italy, up from 63 per cent in 1992. Considering investment funds and portfolio managementservices only, at the end of 1997 the volume of assets managed directly or indirectly by banksamounted to four-fifths of the total. Banking groups have strengthened their central role in assetmanagement; overall, there has been no significant impact on the volume of funds intermediated bythe credit system.Over the past five years the fund-raising policies of the bank-controlled assetmanagement companies have transformed the rankings in this sector; the number of bank-controlledcompanies in the top five has risen from two to four.Marketing capabilities and the fiduciary relationship with customers have givenbanks a competitive edge over other financial intermediaries. The expansion of the distributionnetwork in years past through the progressive diversification of channels (branches, financialsalesmen, marketing agreements) has produced very extensive coverage of the territory.A survey of the banking system conducted by the Bank of Italy found that at the endof 1995 portfolio management services were offered by more than 60 per cent of all banks, lifeinsurance products by over 70 per cent, and investment fund units by 80 per cent.Insurance products are increasingly simple and standardized, which has facilitatedtheir marketing via bank networks and financial salesmen. In the first nine months of 1997 the shareof life insurance products sold through bank networks was 33 per cent, compared with 25 per cent inthe same period of 1996; the share marketed through agents dropped from 42 to 36 per cent.
- 5 -BIS Review  40/1998˝4. Banks and other intermediaries: competition and integrationThe Italian financial system was historically bank-oriented rather thanmarket-oriented. It did not offer valid opportunities for portfolio diversification: the scope forinvestment was restricted to one instrument - bank deposits - offering modest yields and a nominalvalue that was stable over time.In the last fifteen years Italians’ high propensity to save, the increasing supply ofgovernment securities, the launch of investment funds and the liberalization of capital movementshave enormously enlarged the role of the financial markets and the opportunities for diversification.There nonetheless remain risks for the economy as a whole that the markets do nothelp to control and which financial theory defines as “non-diversifiable”. Such risks are connectedwith the economic cycle or the alternation of periods of financial euphoria and panic, which tend togenerate broad swings in asset prices and thus affect households’ wealth. In such circumstances, animportant role is played by intermediaries that perform the function of converting risk via theirbalance sheets through the supply of such non-negotiable instruments as bank deposits anddefined-benefit life insurance products.Financial innovation continuously redefines the interaction between markets andintermediaries. It is this process that determines the ability of the financial system to sustain thegrowth of the economy and offer instruments with adequate safeguards for households’ and firms’savings.The growing competition between instruments, types of intermediary, andintermediaries and markets thus does not eliminate some of the features that distinguish theoperations of banks, insurance companies and securities intermediaries.Banks necessarily have a large portion of their assets tied up in non-negotiableassets - loans. They retain a central role in the provision of payment services. They are the mainchannel for the transmission of monetary policy impulses, owing to the convertibility of deposits intolegal tender.Insurance companies are characterized by the production of non-negotiableinstruments that offer customers a guaranteed return even for the long term.Securities intermediaries are geared to efficient trading in securities. The liabilitiesthey issue do not carry the obligation of redemption at face value and are not means of payment.The intensification of competition is a force for the increasing integration ofspecialized intermediaries within group structures.The reasons for integration are often to be found precisely in the field of assetmanagement, where the overlapping between banking, insurance and securities business is mostpronounced.Competition spurs the drive for ever greater size, permitting adequate diversificationand the exploitation of economies of scale in the supply of individual and collective assetmanagement services. The recent wave of mergers among the leading global intermediaries confirmsthe link between the enlargement of the market, the increase in competition and the effort to achievecritical mass. For instance, the merger between Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss BankCorporation, already the third and fifth-largest European banking groups at the end of 1996, created
- 6 -˝BIS Review  40/1998˝an intermediary with some $680 billion of managed assets, nearly three times the total net assets ofItalian investment funds.Competition and concentration are bound to intensify with economic and monetaryunion, which will eliminate the residual segmentations based on the currency of denomination offinancial products.In the drive for efficiency, Italian intermediaries have also begun to centralizefunctions that were once performed by different operational units and not always integrated inoperational or administrative terms. They are rationalizing the production and distribution of theirdifferent asset management services within group structures, but they have not yet attained the sizeneeded in order to compete at the European level.Italian intermediaries can defend their position in the domestic market effectively,capitalizing on their customer relations and distribution capabilities. With respect to certain groups ofinvestors, however, such as firms, foundations and wealthy individuals, the distribution network is ofminor importance, and foreign intermediaries are likely to be increasingly effective competitors.Over the longer run, the spread of electronic sales networks and other marketing innovations willintensify competition in standardized products for the retail market as well.The acceleration of mergers and takeovers within the Italian banking industry and thegrowing recourse to forms of integration between credit and insurance institutions reflect thecommitment to enhance the competitiveness of the financial system and to reposition the sectorwithin the European market.Alongside the major intermediaries there is still room for local operators, but theirsuccess requires highly specialized production strategies, aimed at particular instruments andmarkets. Alternatively, these banks could concentrate on strengthening their distribution capabilities,perhaps through agreements with large-scale asset management institutions that do business in anumber of different financial market centres, in order to obtain more sophisticated products and offertheir customers a broader range of services.5. The new regulation of asset managementThe erosion of the geographical and product barriers between markets, the creation ofcomplex and internationally ramified groups, the increasing competition between different types ofintermediaries and the growth of securities markets have enhanced the investment opportunitiesavailable to vast numbers of small investors; they have also called for a major effort to adapt theregulatory framework and the organization of supervision in order to protect the savings invested andthe stability of intermediaries.The revision of the regulations governing the various financial sectors, partly inresponse to the process of harmonization within the European Community, has eliminated thecompetitive inequalities between different intermediaries operating in the same markets, createdinstruments for exercising control in order to counter the risks arising from the new forms oforganization of financial activity.In Italy, the Consolidated Law on Financial Markets has responded to the problemsposed by the new and diversified structure of supply by thoroughly overhauling the rules governingfinancial intermediaries and markets.
- 7 -BIS Review  40/1998˝The statutory innovations will allow Italian intermediaries to diversify and broadenthe range of services they provide, adopt more flexible organizational structures and compete on anequal footing with foreign firms.The earlier legal framework restricted the scope for innovation, especially in the fieldof collective investment, where new types of investment funds could only be introduced by primarylegislation.The extensive recourse made to secondary instead of primary legislation has removedthe constraints on the diversification of products and services. In particular, the Ministry of Treasuryis charged with the task of defining the principal characteristics of the various types of investmentfunds, with special reference to eligible assets (listed securities, unlisted securities, real estate, etc.),whether the fund is open or closed-end, and the nature of potential customers (small savers orinstitutional investors).The Bank of Italy is charged with regulating the management of investment funds’portfolios. In addition to the earlier tasks associated with the prudential supervision of undertakingsfor collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), it is now responsible for establishing theprocedures and prohibitions for investment activity and for the limitation and diversification of risk.The most important innovation is the elimination of the separation betweenmanagement on an individual basis and that on a collective basis with the creation of a singlemanager, the “asset management company”.Investment firms, banks and trust companies continue to be allowed to provideindividual management services directly, while asset management companies are allowed to provideboth individual and collective management services on an exclusive basis. The possibility ofoperating across the board will enable them to achieve higher levels of productive efficiency.The right to provide the two services jointly, which is consistent with the proposedCommunity directive currently under discussion on the collective management of assets, meets theneeds of intermediaries and puts them in a better position to satisfy the preferences of theircustomers. At the same time, the prohibition on the supply of other services is an important defenceagainst conflicts of interest.Major changes in the direction of greater flexibility have also been introduced at theorganizational level. In particular: the management and promotion of funds may be separated andentrusted to different companies; managers may delegate investment activity within a set of criteriafor the allocation of resources; and in the field of individual management services banks andinvestment firms may entrust the execution of management contracts to third parties, for part of theportfolio or even the entire portfolio, subject to written authorization by the customer. The grantingof considerable autonomy in the organization of production reflects the belief that the supply ofmanagement services is a complex business with high fixed costs and large economies of scale.The importance of group structures in the financial industry and the related need tostrengthen prudential controls suggested extending the scope of the rules on consolidated supervisionto financial groups having at least one investment firm or asset management company.Responsibility for issuing the regulations lies primarily with the Bank of Italy, which is required todefine such groups for supervisory purposes and draw up the prudential rules to be applied on aconsolidated basis.The division of supervisory responsibilities according to purpose has been confirmedand further clarified for all intermediaries. Consob is entrusted with ensuring the transparency,
- 8 -˝BIS Review  40/1998˝correctness and regularity of trading, while the Bank of Italy is responsible for the controls aimed atprotecting investors and ensuring the capital adequacy and stability of intermediaries.Faced with the continuous and at times tumultuous development of financial markets,the debate on the optimal organization of supervisory controls sometimes appears to be conducted atan excessively abstract level. The experience of recent years shows that supervisory arrangementsmust be constantly adapted to the situations created by financial and technological innovation.The transfer of vast sums to the care of professional managers by small saversbelonging to a wide range of social groups raises special issues with regard to financial stability.Naturally, there is no derogation from the principle that the result of delegated investment dependson the performance of the management scheme, which may involve both lower-than-expected ratesof return and capital losses. Managers nonetheless have a special responsibility to safeguard thevalue of such savings. It is indispensable that management choices should correspond to the riskprofiles accepted by investors and, more generally, that the rules on risk diversification should beobserved. The prudential limits on operations established and monitored by the authorities become ofgreat importance.The structural changes under way in the Italian financial system require the differentsupervisory regulators to intensify their coordination efforts. Effective cooperation among authoritiesenhances the effectiveness of controls, and the ability to forestall instability is the key to achievingthe efficiency gains that the growth of financial markets makes possible.The consolidated law imposes an obligation on the authorities to collaborate,inter alia by exchanging information; they cannot invoke official secrecy in their dealings with eachother. The importance of coordination is thus confirmed, in recognition of the dangers that inefficientcooperation is likely to entail for the integrity and efficiency of the financial system. At the sametime collaboration must be informed by the principle of minimizing the costs borne by those subjectto supervision.The globalization and increasing competition between financial centres that haveaccompanied the growth in asset management have also spurred a far-reaching reorganization of thesecurities markets. The consolidated law completes the innovations introduced by Legislative Decree415/1996, which provided for the privatization of the stock exchange and the securities markets. Themanagement of the markets is entrusted to limited companies that have private sector shareholdersand self-regulatory powers in matters such as the admission of financial instruments andintermediaries to the market, as well as their exclusion and suspension.Consob is charged with the supervision of the regulated markets; the Bank of Italyhas been given a primary role for the markets that are important for monetary policy purposes: thescreen-based government securities market (MTS) and the interbank deposit market (MID).6. International coordinationThe response to the growing integration of markets has been to complete the reformof financial regulations, with the creation of a system of controls that is basically neutral with respectto the nature of intermediaries and based on cooperation among supervisory authorities.The internationalization of finance results in cooperation among the authorities ofdifferent countries becoming of fundamental importance. The increasing openness of financialmarkets makes the exchange of information indispensable, requires a flexible interpretation ofcooperation agreements and calls for the coordination of corrective measures. The links between
- 9 -BIS Review  40/1998˝supervisory bodies must be permanent, not restricted to crisis situations, and must involve both theauthorities responsible for controlling intermediaries and those with powers over markets.The growth of asset management, where the activities typical of institutions engagedin banking, insurance and securities investment services intersect, has fostered the rise of financialconglomerates.The presence of these complex organizations creates new channels for the spread ofpossible crises; their international ramification and the existence of different types of intermediariesincrease the difficulty of coordinating the supervisory bodies involved.Generally speaking, the emergence of a small group of very large global operatorswith substantial capital and highly diversified portfolios strengthens the financial system; theemergence of such a group nonetheless faces the international community with the problem offorestalling the possibility of an insolvency and defining instruments on an adequate scale forhandling such an event.The supervision of financial conglomerates is hindered by the existence ofunregulated entities, but problems also arise where all the components are subject to prudentialcontrols. In the case of capital adequacy, it is necessary to avoid double and multiple gearing, whichcan result in the group as a whole failing to have adequate capital even though the individual units allsatisfy their respective capital requirements.The ramification and strategies of groups can reduce the effectiveness of individualsupervisory authorities’ prudential controls and make it less easy to overcome company crises.Risk control in the more complex financial conglomerates is often centralized in asingle operating unit; the correspondence between company structures and lines of business ceases toexist; group activities are no longer covered by supervisory controls, which are divided by country,type of institution and product. Regulators are likely to encounter greater obstacles to the effectiveperformance of their tasks because functions that are crucial to the sound and prudent management ofthe undertaking subject to supervision are carried on in a different jurisdiction.Awareness of these difficulties has led to an intensification of cooperative efforts ininternational fora. At the beginning of 1996 the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, theInternational Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the International Association ofInsurance Supervisors (IAIS) set up the Joint Forum on financial conglomerates and charged it withthe task of addressing the supervisory issues raised by these complex financial organizations.In particular, the Joint Forum has studied the practical means of facilitating theexchange of information among supervisory authorities, at both the national and the internationallevels, and has examined arrangements for facilitating the coordination of control activities both inordinary circumstances and in crises. It has also drawn up a list of principles aimed at permittingmore effective supervision of regulated institutions within financial conglomerates.The proposals put forward by the Joint Forum primarily concern the methods forevaluating the capital adequacy of conglomerates and verifying the integrity and experiencerequirements for corporate officers and significant shareholders. Common reporting formats havebeen prepared for use by authorities in order to improve their understanding and analysis of thestructure and operations of conglomerates.The possibility has been examined of identifying one authority to act as coordinatorwith the aim of facilitating the exchange of information, permitting an overall assessment to be made
- 10 -˝BIS Review  40/1998˝of the riskiness and capital adequacy of groups, and improving the consistency of prudential controlsand the timeliness of corrective measures. This hypothesis nonetheless requires that consideration begiven not only to the benefits just mentioned but also to the danger that supervisory action will bemade more complex and the safety net seen as having been extended to all the components ofconglomerates, including those that are unregulated.As things stand today, coordination among supervisors has to rely on their practice ofexchanging information, the knowledge each has of the others’ operating procedures and objectives,and trust in the opinions they express.Last February the documents prepared by the Joint Forum were distributed tosupervisory authorities and market participants for them to put forward their observations andsuggestions. It is important that financial industries, including Italy’s, analyze the proposals verycarefully, in order to contribute to enhancing their effectiveness and utility, to the benefit ultimatelyof all market participants.7. ConclusionsThe growth in asset management represents a major structural change and is commonto all the leading industrial countries. In Italy, the growth of the industry has accelerated sharply inconjunction with the fall in interest rates over the last two years. The shifts in intermediaries’strategies, the recomposition of their assets and the links created between the different types ofintermediary suggest that the growth will not peter out once Italian interest rates come into line withthose prevailing in the other countries that will be part of the European Monetary Union.The management of savings by institutional investors benefits from the developmentof the securities markets and, at the same time, contributes to their efficiency. It does not necessarilyimply the disintermediation of banks. In Italy, the supply policies of the major banking groups havesustained the expansion of management services. The increasing competition, at the international aswell as the domestic level, is stimulating the search for larger size through mergers and equity stakesthat often give rise to financial conglomerates.The changes under way modify the exposure to systemic risk, the channels for thepropagation of crises and the latter’s potential impact. The greater ramification of the financialmarket is likely to reduce the probability of a single intermediary’s difficulties spreading to the restof the system. Nonetheless, the number and size of today’s financial markets and institutions meanthat it may prove more difficult to limit the effects of a crisis where one does occur.Despite the progress made in adjusting the regulatory framework to the new reality offinancial markets, supervisory authorities are faced with new challenges; the most importantconcerns the coordination of their action, both domestically and internationally.The crises that have occurred in the last few years show how fast tensions can betransmitted across countries, markets and intermediaries. Macroeconomic instability is likely tointeract with elements of financial instability, spreading to the jurisdictions of several supervisoryauthorities, central banks and governments and involving international organizations. Asglobalization proceeds, the asymmetry between the integration of markets and the multiplicity ofregulatory authorities increases the difficulty of carrying out supervision, calls for a parallelintegration of supervisory action.Coordination and the timely exchange of information can increase the ability toforestall crises and help overcome them when they do occur.
- 11 -BIS Review  40/1998˝The reform of the securities market and the opening of finance to internationalcompetition have broadened and strengthened the structure of Italy’s financial system and improvedits allocative efficiency. Firms and households can turn to new intermediaries and new instruments.Firms can tap a wider range of sources of external finance, raise long-term debt and,above all, make greater use of equity capital. In this way they can achieve a more solid financialstructure that is better able to sustain investment. Households have greater scope to diversify theirfinancial portfolios with products that in the long run permit higher real rates of return.In today’s new conditions of monetary stability, the possibility of earning high returnsat low risk that was a feature of the last twenty-odd years will no longer exist. In order to take fulladvantage of the opportunities offered by the development of the securities markets, intermediarieswill have to make their investment choices keeping a close eye on economic fundamentals and firms’capital solidity and earnings prospects.It is not only intermediaries who must be fully aware of the growing complexity offinancial intermediation and of the related risks, but also the investors who entrust them with theirsavings.

BIS Review   38/1998Mr. Hartmann reports on the driving forces behind current changes in paymentand settlement systems   Speech by Mr. Wendelin Hartmann, a member of the Board of theDeutsche Bundesbank, delivered at the 6th Annual Conference on International Payment Systems inLondon on 20/4/98.There are several driving forces behind current changes in payment and settlementsystems.As a political factor, we are all aware of the start of stage three of European MonetaryUnion (EMU) on January 1, 1999 with the introduction of a single currency and a Europeanmonetary policy.Change is also being caused by developments in the highly liquid and mobilemarkets. Volume and value of transactions in these markets are still increasing and markets’liberalisation and interdependence is continuously growing. Last but not least, technologicaladvances are leading to an improvement in communications technology and a lowering of costs. TheInternet is likely to become universally comparable to the telephone nowadays.Let us now take a look at the current situation in international payment and settlementsystems. The use of correspondent relationships is customary for the execution of cross-borderpayment orders. This results, for example, in larger banks having hundreds of correspondents inEurope. One cause of this can be seen, for example, in the fact that banks mutually attend to creditcustomers and to large-value payments between third countries (such as Japan and Hong Kong). Butthis variety of relationships may lead to a complicated liquidity management and high costs.European cross-border retail payments could almost be said to be still in the “MiddleAges”: they are characterised by high fees, long execution times and very little transparency. Thissituation led to the EU Directive on cross-border credit transfers (Transparency Directive) cominginto force early 1997, the outcome of which has, up to now, regrettably been mediocre. As anexample, if we compare the cost and time taken for a credit transfer of FRF 5.000 from Frankfurt toParis, the fee charged by the different German banks varies - according to a German newspaper -from DEM 20.00 to DEM 60.00 and the processing time takes between two and 14 days. Thestatistical reporting requirement of cross-border orders cannot be construed as an adequateexplanation for this. On the contrary, the European market will require considerable improvements inthis field.Another obstacle is, for example, the lack of a common European bank-code number,branch identification and account number. The European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS)is pursuing several activities such as the introduction of an International Bank Account Number(IBAN). But, due to problems in the implementation of developed standards, its work has so far beennone-too effective. Another approach to cross-border payments is the linkage of automated clearinghouses. This solution has been hindered in Germany by the banking associations protectingprofitable fees and hampering a strategic cooperation. As far as the European banking associationsare concerned, they are not yet ready to design a common standard for retail payments. At all events,some progress can be identified in in-house, club and special associations’ solutions.Owing to their global availability, the card market is dominated by the Americancredit card systems. The eurocheque card as a strategic European response is widely used only in afew countries. The Maestro functionality will allow a gradual expansion worldwide. At all events,the eurocheque cards are still successful as an access medium for ATMs and in their direct debitfunction. Especially in Germany, they are quite important: approximately 60 million cards using ec
- 2 -BIS Review   38/1998technology are in circulation. Prepaid cards are a logical development of the eurocheque card with acommon security access and clearing standard. But their system faces drawbacks due to relativelyhigh transaction and turnover fees charged to retailers. Since there are only national solutions,American cards have expanded their global dominance, despite well designed European systems.Attempts to cooperate internationally, for example, by the French and German banking industry onthe major German prepaid card system seem to have stagnated.Not only chips on cards but also networks have gained in importance for payment andsettlement systems. The Internet is inevitably moving from a pure access medium (for home banking,for instance) into an independent carrier of payment systems on a local, regional, and global basis.As part of electronic commerce, the Internet is even governmentally subsidised, as it is in the UnitedStates, for example. International financial authorities are gradually taking an interest in a controlleduse of the Internet.Chip cards used on the “Net” will go beyond their function as a pure access or storagemedium. But this inevitably requires a common security strategy. Current barter clubs might alsospread globally by using the Internet.Central banks regard the dissemination of this electronic money to be in its earlystages at present. But they suspect a possible loss of control over the money stock and interest ratemovements if the amounts transferred through these systems become significant. They are thereforecalling for non-banks to be excluded from the issuance or administration of electronic money units.The European central banks made this approach concerning prepaid cards public in the 1994European Monetary Institute (EMI) report.At all events, the creation of fully private systems such as “Microsoft money” canonly be successfully regulated by a worldwide cooperation on the part of governments and centralbanks.The introduction of different electronic cashless payment instruments has not reducedthe high demand for cash. This is partially due to inadequate financial systems and the fear ofinflation in foreign countries, such as in East Europe or South America. Thus, the USD currency incirculation abroad is assumed to be about 70% and, for the DEM currency, to be approximately 30%of the total amount in circulation.An increasing consolidation in the respective countries might reduce internationaldemand. But retailers, for instance, still consider cash payments to have comparative commercialadvantages over cashless payment and combined high bank fees.The criticism that central banks subsidise the use of cash is not valid. The DEM 260million or so in bank notes have to be “bought” from the Bundesbank. Assuming an interest rate forrefinancing of 3%, this would result in a benefit DEM 7.8 billion per year.The high demand for cash also supports the transformation process of the centralbanks’ interest policy. Therefore, central banks do not consider it necessary to push back cashdemand beyond the already existing impact of technological developments. Progress in this field isfully accepted by them.With regard to the replacement of cash, retail transactions in coins of alldenominations and in lower value banknotes at vending machines or service terminals are most
- 3 -BIS Review   38/1998likely to be replaced by electronic payment means. This evolution might even be fostered by thedelayed changeover to the euro cash.Let us now take a look at an important driving force in more detail: Stage Three ofEMU.Implementation of the single monetary policy will then require a single moneymarket in the participating countries and secure and efficient payment and settlement systems.Therefore, the central banks, in particular, are paying interest to interbank and commerciallarge-value payments. For that reason, they are setting up TARGET, the Trans-European AutomatedReal-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system, which will link the national RTGS systems inEurope. Non-participating countries can also be connected to TARGET.Monetary policy transactions have to be fully collateralized. Securitisation will alsobe needed for payment systems. Since the European systems for the cross-border use of securities arenot yet fully designed, the central banks are preparing the what is known as Correspondent CentralBanking Model (CCBM), with the foreign central bank acting as correspondent. The CCBM willserve as an interim solution for the cross-border use of securities until a private sector system hasbeen put in place. A private system of this kind is the solution of the European Central SecuritiesDepository Association (ECSDA), using bilateral links between the domestic and foreign centralsecurities depositories with an efficiency comparable to that of TARGET.Taking an overall view of payment systems at the beginning of next year, TARGETwill not be the only European scheme; there will also be several net settlement systems.Owing to their net characteristics, those systems cannot provide an immediate finalityof payments. Participants not fulfilling their due payments may - under certain circumstances - evencause an unwinding of all transactions. Allowing, on the one hand, for liquidity-saving through thenetting of payment orders, there is, on the other hand, the risk of a liquidity trap since the settlementis final only at the end of the business day.The operators of net settlement systems, which are for example the EBA Clearing, theEAF 2 and SNP (système net protégé) have their own individual strategy for preparing for StageThree of EMU. At all events, some changes will be brought about by the Lamfalussy standards andthe requirement for cross-border net systems to settle in central bank money.The choice and, ultimately, the success of the different schemes will depend on issuessuch as liquidity demand, early finality, security and, last but not least, availability characterised byexecution times, operating hours and days. Cost and fees for participation in payment systems areanother factor which cannot be considered unimportant.Looking at the European payment systems of the future, allow me to make a forecastfrom my personal point of view.At the moment, the future development of coexisting payment and settlement systemsis still undecided. But some trends towards the respective systems can be identified.TARGET as the central banks’ gross system will be the basis for all large-valuemonetary policy transactions. 
- 4 -BIS Review   38/1998Bearing in mind that all cross-border payments of large amounts will be best servedby processing through TARGET due to the immediate finality of payments in this system, centralbanks will also act as a settlement provider for other large-value payments of the banking industryand their customers. The European landscape for the banking industry’s system might be highlydiversified. The EBA Clearing, EAF 2 and SNP, as examples of these, might dominate the marketfor commercial large-value payments with Europe likely to remain a polycentric area needing severalfinancial centres. Cross-border retail payments are likely to be gradually integrated into net settlementsystems owing to the lack of European standardisation. But there will still be a need fortransformation into national standards. Considering the fact that smaller banks will not have direct access to majorcross-border oriented netting systems the sole use of big business partners might ultimatelyjeopardise their independence.
BIS Review   38/1998Mr. Greenspan examines the crises in Asia, considers the existence and provisionof safety nets and ponders possible policy responses to problems in the international financialsystem   Remarks by Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the34th Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicagoon 7/5/98.Events in Asia over the past year reinforce once more the fact that, while ourburgeoning global system is efficient and makes a substantial contribution to standards of livingworldwide, that same efficiency exposes and punishes underlying economic imprudence swiftly anddecisively. These global financial markets, engendered by the rapid proliferation of cross-borderfinancial flows and products, have developed a capability of transmitting mistakes at a far faster pacethroughout the financial system in ways that were unknown a generation ago. Today’s internationalfinancial system is sufficiently different, in so many respects, from its predecessors that it canreasonably be characterized as new, as distinct from being merely a continuing evolution from thepast.As a consequence, it is urgent that we accelerate our efforts to develop a sophisticatedunderstanding of how this high-tech financial system works. Specifically, we need such anunderstanding if we are to minimize the chances that we will experience a systemic disruptionbeyond our degree of comprehension or our ability to respond effectively. We need it if we are tocontinue to make progress in reducing settlement risk in foreign exchange markets and to ensure asound infrastructure for payments and settlement systems generally. And we need it if we are to haveconfidence in our processes of supervision and regulation.In this regard, I intend to focus my remarks this morning on three related topics: I willstart by examining the crises in Asia, which, along with the one in Mexico just a few years ago,provide the first evidence of how crises arise in the new system, especially the central role that banksplay. I will note that, while the support provided to banks by public safety nets appears to be anelement of stability in the new system, it has also been part of the process that engendered recentcrises. Next, I will consider why, if the existence of safety nets can encourage crises, we continue toprovide them. Finally, I will consider possible policy responses to some of the system’s evidentproblems and tensions. Put differently, can we learn to stabilize our burgeoning, sometimes frenetic,new international financial system so that we can realize its full potential?***Let me start with Asia. In hindsight, it is evident that those leveraged economiescould not provide adequate profitable opportunities at reasonable risk in the 1990s to absorb thesurge in capital inflows. That surge reflected in part the diversification of the western equity markets’huge capital gains to a sector of the world which was perceived as offering above average returns.Together with distortions caused by a long-entrenched government planning ethos, the flood ofinvestment resulted -- some would say inevitably -- in massive deadweight losses. As activityslowed, burdened by fixed-cost obligations that were undertaken on the presumption of continuinggrowth, business losses and nonperforming bank loans surged. The capital of banks in Asianeconomies -- especially when properly accounted for -- eroded rapidly. As a consequence, fundingsources dried up as fears of defaults rose dramatically.In an environment of weak financial systems, lax supervisory regimes, and vagueassurances about depositor or creditor protections, the state of confidence so necessary to thefunctioning of any banking system was torn asunder. Bank runs occurred in several countries andreached crisis proportions in Indonesia. Uncertainty and retrenchment escalated.
- 2 -BIS Review   38/1998In short, the slowing in activity in Asia exposed the high fixed costs of a leveragedeconomy, especially one with fixed obligations in foreign currencies. Failures to make paymentsinduced vicious cycles of contagious, ever rising, and reinforcing fears.It is quite difficult to anticipate such crises. Every borrower, whether a bank or anonbank company, presumably structures its balance sheet to provide a sufficient buffer against theemergence of illiquidity or insolvency. The scramble by borrowers to protect their balance sheetswhen this buffer is unexpectedly breached can lead to a surge in the demand for liquidity that in turnproduces a run on the financial system. At one moment, an economy appears stable, the next it issubject to an implosion of fear-induced contraction.In this context a preventive effort to lessen the probabilities of such crises arising --for example, by bolstering the financial system’s buffer through more capital or improved banksupervision -- may not in itself further insulate a country from crisis if financial institutions, nowfaced with a lower cost of capital or lower spread on their debt, leverage away the increased buffer.Indeed, one form of moral hazard is that an initially sound financial system that attracts low riskpremia could merely induce a ratcheting up of the risks that a nation’s borrowers choose to take on.This is not to disparage endeavors to bolster financial systems. But we should keep in mind thatsome of the advantages of such initiatives could be drained away by moral hazard.What is becoming increasingly clear, and what is particularly relevant to thisconference, is that, in virtually all cases, what turns otherwise seemingly minor imbalances into acrisis is an actual or anticipated disruption to the liquidity or solvency of the banking system, or atleast of its major participants. That fact is of critical importance for understanding both the Asian andthe previous Latin American crises. Depending on circumstances, the original impulse for the crisismay begin in the banking system or it may begin elsewhere and cause a problem in the bankingsystem that converts a troubling event into an implosive crisis.The aspects of the banking system that produce such outcomes are not particularlyopaque.First, exceptionally high leverage has often been a symptom of excessive risk-takingthat left financial systems and economies vulnerable to loss of confidence. It is not easy to imaginethe cumulative cascading of debt instruments seeking safety in a crisis when assets are heavilyfunded with equity. Moreover, financial (as well as nonfinancial) businesses have employed highleverage to mask inadequate underlying profitability and did not have adequate capital cushions tomatch their volatile environments.Second, banks, when confronted with a generally rising yield curve, which is moreoften the case than not, have had a tendency to incur interest rate or liquidity risk by lending long andfunding short. This has exposed banks, especially those that had inadequate capital to begin with, to acollapse of confidence when interest rates spiked and capital was eroded. In addition, when financialintermediaries, in an environment of fixed exchange rates, but still high inflation premiums anddomestic currency interest rates, sought low-cost, unhedged, foreign currency funding, the dangers ofdepositor runs, following a fall in the domestic currency, escalated.Third, banks play a crucial role in the financial market infrastructure. A soundinstitution can fend off unexpected shocks. But when they are undercapitalized, have lax lendingstandards, and are subjected to weak supervision and regulation, they have become a source ofsystemic risk to both domestic and international financial systems.
- 3 -BIS Review   38/1998Fourth, recent adverse banking experiences have emphasized the problems that canarise if banks, especially vulnerable banks, are almost the sole source of intermediation. Theirbreakdown induces a marked weakening in economic growth. A wider range of nonbank institutions,including viable debt and equity markets, can provide important safeguards of economic activitywhen the banking system fails.Fifth, despite its importance for distributing savings to their most valued investmentuse, excessive short-term interbank funding, especially cross border, may turn out to be the Achilles’heel of an international financial system that is subject to wide variations in financial confidence.This phenomenon, which is all too common in our domestic experience, may be particularlydangerous in an international setting. I shall return to this issue later.Finally, an important contributor to past crises has been moral hazard, that is, adistortion of incentives that occurs when the party that determines the level of risk receives the gainsfrom, but does not bear the full costs of, the risks taken. Interest rate and currency risk-taking, excessleverage, weak financial systems, and interbank funding have all been encouraged by the existenceof a safety net. The expectation that national monetary authorities or international financialinstitutions will come to the rescue of failing financial systems and unsound investments clearly hasengendered a significant element of excessive risk-taking. The dividing line between public andprivate liabilities, too often, has become blurred.***Given that the existence of safety nets generates moral hazard, and moral hazarddistorts incentives, why do we continue to provide safety nets to support our financial systems?It is important to remember that, notwithstanding the possibility of excessiveleverage, many of the benefits banks provide modern societies derive from their willingness to takerisks and from their use of a relatively high degree of financial leverage. Through leverage, in theform principally of taking deposits, banks perform a critical role in the financial intermediationprocess; they provide savers with additional investment choices and borrowers with a greater rangeof sources of credit, thereby facilitating a more sophisticated allocation of resources that appears tocontribute importantly to greater economic growth. Indeed, it has been the evident value ofintermediation and leverage that has shaped the development of our financial systems from theearliest times -- certainly since Renaissance goldsmiths discovered that lending out deposited goldwas both feasible and profitable.In addition, central bank provision of a mechanism for converting highly illiquidportfolios into liquid ones, in extraordinary circumstances, has led to a greater degree of leverage inbanking than market forces alone would support. Traditionally this has been accomplished bymaking discount or Lombard facilities available, so that individual depositories could turn illiquidassets into liquid resources and not exacerbate unsettled market conditions by the forced selling ofsuch assets or the calling of loans. More broadly, open market operations, in situations like thatwhich followed the crash of stock markets around the world in 1987, satisfy marked increased needsfor liquidity for the system as a whole that otherwise could feed cumulative, self-reinforcing,contractions across many financial markets.To be sure, we should recognize that if we choose to have the advantages of aleveraged system of financial intermediaries, the burden of managing risk in the financial system willnot lie with the private sector alone. As I noted, with leveraging there will always exist a possibility,however remote, of a chain reaction, a cascading sequence of defaults that will culminate in financial
- 4 -BIS Review   38/1998implosion if it proceeds unchecked. Only a central bank, with its unlimited power to create money,can with a high probability thwart such a process before it becomes destructive. Hence, central bankswill of necessity be drawn into becoming lenders of last resort. But implicit in the existence of such arole is that there will be some form of allocation between the public and private sectors of the burdenof risk, with central banks responsible for managing the most extreme, that is the most systemicallysensitive, outcomes. Thus, central banks have been led to provide what essentially amounts tocatastrophic financial insurance coverage. Such a public subsidy should be reserved for only therarest of disasters. If the owners or managers of private financial institutions were to anticipate beingpropped up frequently by government support, it would only encourage reckless and irresponsiblepractices.In theory, the allocation of responsibility for risk-bearing between the private sectorand the central bank depends upon the private cost of capital. In order to attract, or at least retain,capital, a private financial institution must earn at minimum the overall economy’s marginal cost ofriskless capital, adjusted for firm-specific risk. In competitive financial markets, the greater theleverage, the higher the rate of return, before adjustment for risk. If private financial institutions haveto absorb all financial risk, then the degree to which they can leverage will be restrained, thefinancial sector smaller, and its contribution to the economy more limited. On the other hand, ifcentral banks effectively insulate private institutions from potential losses, however incurred,increased laxity could threaten a major drain on taxpayers or produce inflationary instability as aconsequence of excess money creation.Once a private financial institution infers the amount of capital it must devote toensure against, first, illiquidity and, finally, insolvency, the size of its balance sheet for maximumrate of return on equity, adjusted for risk, is determined. That inference depends on the institution’sjudgment of how much of the tail of its risk distribution requires a capital provision. The central bankis presumed to respond to the remainder of the risk tail by lending freely and reducing the danger ofilliquidity. Protecting private financial institutions’ solvency through guarantees of liabilities riskssignificant moral hazard.In practice, the policy choice of how much, if any, of the extreme market risk thatgovernment authorities should absorb is fraught with many complexities. Yet we central bankersmake this decision every day, either explicitly or by default. Moreover, we can never know for surewhether the decisions we made were appropriate. The question is not whether our actions are seen tohave been necessary in retrospect; the absence of a fire does not mean that we should not have paidfor fire insurance. Rather, the question is whether, ex ante, the probability of a systemic collapse wassufficient to warrant intervention. Often, we cannot wait to see whether, in hindsight, the problemwill be judged to have been an isolated event and largely benign.Thus, governments, including central banks, have been given certain responsibilitiesrelated to their banking and financial systems that must be balanced. We have the responsibility toprevent major financial market disruptions through development and enforcement of prudentregulatory standards and, if necessary in rare circumstances, through direct intervention in marketevents. But we also have the responsibility to ensure that private sector institutions have the capacityto take prudent and appropriate risks, even though such risks will sometimes result in unanticipatedbank losses or even bank failures.Our goal as supervisors, therefore, should not be to prevent all bank failures, as I havesuggested to this conference many times, but to maintain sufficient prudential standards so thatbanking problems that do occur do not become widespread. We try to achieve the proper balance
- 5 -BIS Review   38/1998through official regulations, as well as through formal and informal supervisory policies andprocedures.To some extent, we do this over time by signalling to the market, through our actions,the kinds of circumstances in which we might be willing to intervene to quell financial turmoil, andconversely, what levels of difficulties we expect private institutions to resolve by themselves. Themarket, then, responds by adjusting the risk premium addition to the riskless cost of capital availableto banks.***To return to the question I raised at the beginning: Can we learn to stabilize ourburgeoning, sometimes frenetic, new international financial system so that we can realize its fullpotential? What types of regulatory initiatives appear fruitful in achieving the benefits andminimizing the costs of the new system?In addressing those questions, I will confine myself again to issues related morenarrowly to banks: in particular, to bank supervision and to possible ways in which the behavior ofindividual banks could be improved. I will not discuss the important issues concerning the need forefficient bankruptcy procedures or for alternative means for coordinating debtors and creditors, bothin the domestic context in many countries and in the cross-border context, that may be required inour new system.While failures will inevitably occur in a dynamic market, the safety net -- not tomention concerns over systemic risk -- requires, to repeat, that regulators not be indifferent to howbanks manage their risks. To avoid having to resort to numbing micromanagement, regulators haveincreasingly insisted that banks put in place systems that allow management to have both theinformation and procedures to be aware of their own true risk exposures on a global basis and to beable to manage such exposures. The better these risk information and control systems, the more riska bank can prudently assume. In that context, an enhanced regime of market incentives, involvinggreater sensitivity to market signals and more information to make those signals more robust, isessential.In this rapidly expanding international financial system, the primary protection fromadverse financial disturbances is effective counterparty surveillance and, hence, governmentregulation and supervision should seek to produce an environment in which counterparties can mosteffectively oversee the credit risks of potential transactions.Here a major improvement in transparency is essential. To be sure, counterpartiesoften exchange otherwise confidential information as a condition of a transaction. But broaderdissemination of detailed disclosures of governments, financial institutions, and firms is required ifthe risks inherent in our global financial structure are to be contained. A market system can approachan appropriate equilibrium only if the signals to which individual market participants respond areaccurate and adequate to the needs of the adjustment process. Among the important signals areproduct and asset prices, interest rates, debt by maturity, and detailed accounts of central banks andprivate enterprises. I find it difficult to believe, for example, that the crises that arose in Thailand andKorea would have been nearly so virulent had their central banks published data prior to the crises onnet reserves instead of the not very informative gross reserve positions only. Some inappropriatecapital inflows would almost surely have been withheld and policymakers would have been forced tomake difficult choices more promptly if earlier evidences of difficulty had emerged.
- 6 -BIS Review   38/1998Increased transparency can expose the prevalence of pending problems, but it cannotbe expected to discourage all aberrant behavior. It has not prevented reliance on real estate forcollateral from becoming problematic from time to time. East Asia has been no exception. When realestate values fall sharply, as they do from time to time, such collateral tends to become highlyilliquid. Removal of legal impediments to more widespread forms of collateral and to prompt accessto collateral would be helpful in dealing with these problems.It is increasingly evident that nonperforming loans should be dealt with expeditiouslyand not allowed to fester. The expected values of the losses on these loans are, of course, asubtraction from capital. But since these estimates are uncertain, they embody an additional riskpremium that further reduces the market’s best estimate of the size of effective equity capital.Funding becomes more difficult. Partly reflecting uncertainties with respect to their nonperformingloans, Japanese banks in London, for example, are currently required to pay about a 15 basis pointadd-on over what markets require for major western banks for short-term deposits denominated inyen. It is, hence, far better to remove these dubious assets and their associated risk premium frombank balance sheets, and dispose of them separately, preferably promptly.A predicate to addressing nonperforming loans expeditiously is better and moreforceful supervision, which requires more knowledgeable bank examiners than, unfortunately, manyeconomies enjoy. In all countries, we need independent bank examiners who understand banking andbusiness risk, who could in effect, make sound loans themselves because they understand theprocess. Similarly, we need loan officers at banks that understand their customers’ business -- loanofficers that could, in effect, step into the shoes of their customers. Lack of a cadre of loan officerswho have experience in judging lending risk can produce debilitating losses even when lending is notdirected by government inducement or the need to support members of an associated group ofcompanies. Experienced bank supervision cannot fully substitute for poor lending procedures, butpresumably it could encourage better practice. Apparently even that has been lacking in manyeconomies. And training personnel and developing adequate supervisory systems will take time.I pointed earlier to cross-border interbank funding as potentially the Achilles’ heel ofthe international financial system. Creditor banks expect claims on banks, especially banks inemerging economies, to be protected by a safety net and, consequently, consider them to beessentially sovereign claims. Unless those expectations are substantially altered -- as when banksactually incur significant losses -- governments can be faced with the choice either of validatingthose expectations or of risking serious disruption to payments systems and to financial markets ingeneral.Arguably expectations of safety net support have increased the level of cross-borderinterbank lending from that which would be supported by unsubsidized markets themselves. Thiswould suggest resource misallocation. Accordingly, it might be useful to consider ways in whichsome added discipline could be imposed on the interbank market. Such discipline, in principle, couldbe imposed on either debtor or creditor banks. For example, capital requirements could be raised onborrowing banks by making the required level of capital dependent not just on the nature of thebanks’ assets but also on the nature of their funding. An increase in required capital can be thought ofas providing a larger cushion for the sovereign guarantor in the event of a bank’s failure. That is, itwould shift more of the burden of the failure onto the private sector. Alternatively, the issue of moralhazard in interbank markets could be addressed by charging banks for the existence of the sovereignguarantee, particularly in more vulnerable countries where that guarantee is more likely to be calledupon and whose cost might deter some aberrant borrowing. For example, sovereigns could charge anexplicit premium, or could impose reserve requirements, earning low or even zero interest rates, oninterbank liabilities.
- 7 -BIS Review   38/1998Increasing the capital charge on lending banks, instead of on borrowing banks, mightalso be effective. Under the Basle capital accord, short-term claims on banks from any country carryonly a twenty percent risk weight. The higher cost to the lending banks associated with a higher riskweight would presumably be passed on to the borrowing banks. Borrowing banks, at the margin,might reduce their total borrowing or shift their borrowing to nonbank sources of funds, perhaps withthe shift facilitated by the lending banks, who might advert to securitization of short-term interbanklending if regulatory capital charges exceeded internal requirements. In either case, there would tendto be a reduction in interbank exposures, a significant source of systemic risk. To be evaluated in anysuch initiative is whether such regulation would disrupt liquidity in the interbank market to a pointwhere such costs exceed the benefits of reduced interbank exposure.***We are interacting every day with an emerging new international financial structure,one with great potential for facilitating the creation of wealth and rising standards of living. Ourunderstanding of the new system continues to improve, as does our ability to gauge and managerisks. Still, the new system will doubtless at times appear threatening and unstable. But that is theprice of progress. In my judgment, at the end of the day, it will be a price well worth paying.
BIS Review   39/1998˝Mr. Gaddum discusses the euro, US dollar and the world economy   Dinnerspeech by the Deputy Governor of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Mr. Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, on theoccasion of the Joint Conference of Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung and Aspen-Institut, Berlin inWashington DC on 6-8/5/1998.There is no doubt about it. The European Central Bank will come into operation onJuly 1.That also means that the euro is on its way, and that will bring about changes inEurope. But is it only Europe that will be affected?I very much appreciate having this opportunity to explain the views of the DeutscheBundesbank on this matter to such a well-informed audience here in Washington.Recently, in a well-known US newspaper, I saw a cartoon which captured what - tomy mind - is the widespread ambivalence concerning the future prospects of the euro.The cartoon showed a group of experts (presumably economists) sitting at a roundtable and apparently discussing the future outlook for the euro. The chairman of this group finallygets carried away and exclaims: “I bet you 10 to 1 that the euro will be a success!” Each of theothers at the table nods vigorously in agreement with this forecast, replying: “I think so, too.” Onlyone of the group adds somewhat timidly: “But in dollars.”Begun as a foreign policy concept, the idea of European monetary union (EMU) hastaken on economic significance during the past few years as a result of the globalisation of themarkets. So far, there has been little discussion of this international dimension of EMU.EMU will create a currency area which, when all 15 states of the European Unionhave become members, will have a population of approximately 370 million whose gross domesticproduct will represent about 38.3% of the GDP of all OECD states. This will change the respectiveimportance of the world’s currencies.It therefore seems reasonable to suppose that, when stating what we expect ofmonetary union, we have to explain, firstly, what the European Central Bank will mean for Europeand particularly for Germany and, secondly, what it may mean for our friends and partners in otherparts of the world.IIKonrad Adenauer always incorporated the idea of European cooperation into Germanpolicy, and since then - yes, right up to the present day - this has been a central feature of Germanpolicy.All German governments have had this objective in mind. And the idea of amonetary union has always  played an important role in this.In the light of this it is not surprising that in Germany both the government and theopposition support the project of monetary union - despite the considerable reluctance of thepopulation.
- 2 -BIS Review   39/1998˝Both prior to and after the signing of the (Maastricht) Treaty the Bundesbank hasoutlined in its statements what monetary union will mean for Germany (and for the otherparticipating states).At the request of the Federal Government the Bank issued a further comment onMarch 26, that is to say, shortly before the decision taken last weekend.It was only to be expected that the Bundesbank’s analysis of the degree ofconvergence reached within the European Union incorporates light and shade, opportunities andproblems. This comment by the Central Bank Council was anything but an excuse for euphoria.The Bundesbank has not  resolved to reject monetary union because of the inherentproblems. In addition to making its analysis, it has nevertheless made it clear what responsibilitiespolicy makers will incur as a result of monetary union.First of all, I shall outline the positive points:• Exchange rate tensions within Europe have declined appreciably.• Inflation rates are very similar and are no more than somewhere between 1.0%and 2.0%.• Capital market rates are now very close to the German rate.The challenges, however, are as follows:When their bilateral exchange rates are fixed irrevocably, the participants inmonetary union are giving up not only an economically compensatory mechanism - the exchangerate - for ever. They have also to accept an adjustment over the long term of the different economicand political traditions in the member states to the new supranational framework and to put asidenational interests in favour of this new dimension.In a monetary union, which by definition transcends the sovereignty of theparticipating nation states, discrepancies may arise time and again that must be solved throughnational economic, fiscal and social policy measures and not through the monetary policy applyinguniformly throughout the union.EMU will increase the competition for inward investment in the participating states.The more flexible a country’s goods, financial and labour markets are the better it will be able tocompete.For this reason, the policy of reform which has been in force over the past few yearsmust not be abandoned or applied less vigorously. On the contrary, it must be intensified.Fiscal policy has a particular role of responsibility in monetary union.Fiscal policy, in contrast to internal and external monetary policy, which is aunion-wide responsibility, will remain the responsibility of the member states. Consequently, it isparticularly important that the public authorities can prove that their financial position is on apermanently sound footing.If they are to fulfil this requirement, some member states will have to make aparticular effort.
- 3 -BIS Review   39/1998˝A permanently sustainable financial position on the part of member states is essentialif conflicts between them are to be avoided and, moreover, if conflicts between the respective statesand the single stability-oriented monetary policy are to be avoided.So much for the Bundesbank’s basic concern.We have always thought it was important to make it clear that, if European monetaryunion was a worthwhile objective, it could not be achieved without a measure of sacrifice.Monetary union provides all the advantages of a fairly large homogeneous marketfreed from exchange rate fluctuations. But from its participants it demands economic and politicaldiscipline.The combination of monetary policy uniformity and political diversity posesproblems.It was in this connection that President Chirac spoke of an adventure.The two largest member states of the union, Germany and France, have differenttraditions.On the one hand, there is Germany’s fortunate experience with a Bundesbank that isindependent in its monetary policy decisions.Conflicts with the government of the day, whether it be Adenauer’s, Schmidt’s orKohl’s, have done nothing to change that. In the event, they have actually strengthened theBundesbank’s standing.France, on the other hand, sees monetary policy as an instrument of the governmentin power. The recent amendments to the statutes of the Banque de France represent a change inapproach which was necessitated by the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and which was largelyunpopular.The political compromise reached in the dispute concerning the appointment of thefirst president of the ECB has to be seen against this background.The aim of the eight-year term of office which is laid down in the Treaty and whichcannot be extended is to ensure the independence of the incumbent. The fact that it is precisely thisruling that has been called into question confirms fears that not all of the ramifications implied by anindependent monetary policy have yet been finally accepted by the governments concerned. Like theindependence of the Bundesbank, it is something that we shall probably still have to fight for.IIIAlthough the integration of the world economy began a long time ago, a significantacceleration occurred in the 1980s and 1990s.This is seen in the trends in international capital flows and in the financial markets toan even greater degree than it is in foreign trade.
- 4 -BIS Review   39/1998˝However, a gigantic step is now being taken with the introduction of a singlecurrency in a large part of the global financial market.The fragmentation into many national capital markets, a phenomenon which isparticularly apparent in the case of the bond markets and which has arisen as a result of the existenceof different currencies (and therefore of different interest rates), will be a thing of the past.The national markets in Europe will compete with each other more intensively thanthey do now. They will gradually lose the specific national features that they now have.The large cross-border euro capital market will accelerate the trend towardsglobalisation. This will encourage processes of concentration and yet provide opportunities tospecialise in market segments which need a particularly intensive degree of management know-how.The volume of transactions on the future euro bond market will approach the size ofthe undisputedly dominant US market today.If today’s US market is about six times larger than the German market, it will only beabout 1.6 times larger than the euro market.The euro will take over the role of the D-Mark.  The tripolar world capital marketconsisting of the dollar, the euro and the yen is gradually emerging.The depth and breadth of the euro market, which will be greater than the depth andbreadth of the present national markets, will become more attractive to internationally operatingcustomers for and suppliers of capital.In contrast to the situation in the United States, we will have several sovereignissuers in one single currency area. This competition with respect to creditworthiness need not be adisadvantage.The greater attractiveness of the European market will increase its efficiency and theprofessionalism of the market players. What does all of this mean for the German capital market?With the loss of the D-Mark, Germany, and particularly the German bond market,will lose a major competitive advantage.The currency which has been the anchor for the European Monetary System andwhich over a period of some decades has become the most important investment and reservecurrency after the dollar will disappear.We have been trying for some years now to make up for the approaching loss of thecompetitive advantage we have as a result of the D-Mark.The German capital market had to be prepared for the euro. Structural weaknesseshad to be removed.The German capital market is now in a strong starting position and is equipped tomeet the competition from other financial centres.
- 5 -BIS Review   39/1998˝German bonds set the benchmark for the yield curve in Europe. Repo business hasswitched back from London to Frankfurt.The German futures exchange now handles more than 70% of the FederalGovernment’s contracts. The Bunds, too, have returned from London to Frankfurt.However, one thing is clear to us:  in the long run only a stable euro will have a goodchance of taking over the role of a reserve, investment and transaction currency.Only a stable single currency will provide the European Community with theopportunity to play a major role in the world economy and to do so with correspondingly greaterinfluence than it has today.IVWhat does this mean for our friends and partners in other parts of the world? Manyhardly showed any interest in the European debate on monetary union at first; then, in the end, whenthings had taken on a more concrete shape, they reacted in astonishment. For a long time the EMUproject was regarded in non-European countries as having no chance of success.A sarcastic but not at all untypical comment which I would like to quote may serveas an example of this attitude:“It’s a lunatic idea but, to be honest, one that I thought would collapse of its ownstupidity. Unfortunately, it hasn’t, and so here goes.” (Samuelson, January 1997)Even US economists for the most part reacted sceptically to the idea of a singlecurrency in Europe when they considered its economic justification.On the other hand, the European advocates of the EMU project were seldomprepared to answer this criticism.Presumably the reason for this was that from the outset they had suspected thatAmericans were being particularly critical about European efforts at integration because they viewedthis development through the eyes of competitors.However, internationally successful currencies are not simply established bypoliticians by decree. They have to stand their own in competition with other currencies on thefinancial markets.I am certain that it will take some time before the euro will be able to assert itself inthe international markets and represent a genuine competitor for the US dollar.At least in the past structural changes in the international currency pattern occurredonly very slowly. One only needs to think of the time it took for the dollar to replace the poundsterling.It was no different when the D-Mark was being established as an internationalcurrency: that took years, if not decades.In its competition with the dollar the euro will have to acquire for itself a certaindegree of trust. This is something it will not inherit.
- 6 -BIS Review   39/1998˝However, Americans and Europeans alike can only benefit from the competitionbetween these two major currencies for the confidence of investors.The disappearance of exchange rate risks on the European market will provideinteresting investment opportunities in Europe for US enterprises, too.The increase in world trade that can be expected from EMU will also benefit the USeconomy.The European economies which enter into this monetary union will be compelled todismantle market rigidities (especially in the labour markets) if they want to survive in theintensified international competition and be able to meet the consequences of external shocks in thecurrency area.The IMF is right in describing the labour markets as the Achilles’ heal of the EMUproject.Politically, the development of a system of transfers between the participating stateshas no chance at the moment. The unsatisfactory situation in the labour markets therefore makes achange in policy inevitable.This will ultimately have positive repercussions for Europe’s trading partners, too,including the United States.Another reassuring point is that the Maastricht Treaty rules out the possibility ofpolicy makers using the exchange rate of the euro as a foreign trade policy instrument.A more productive European economy with sound monetary and fiscal policies islikewise not only in Europe’s interests but also in the United States’.I am quite sure that the entire international monetary system will profit from morepredictable monetary and fiscal policies in European monetary union.VIn Washington it is naturally impossible to speak of the international monetarysystem without addressing yet another aspect of European monetary union, namely the impact of theimminent European monetary union on the debate that is currently being held - especially in thelight of the east Asian crisis - in the United States (and elsewhere) on the future role of the IMF.Now and again one hears fears voiced, especially in the United States, about thepotential threat the EMU poses for the global leadership role of the Bretton Woods institutions. Iagree with those who urge reforms at the IMF and the World Bank.The need for reform may be due just as much to the structural changes in thefinancial markets as to the changes in the importance of world trading partners.Europe still has to find its role in this process of reform. Where these partners arenation states, each of the member states of the EU acts in its own right; whenever central banks areconcerned, the ECB acts as the European central bank.
- 7 -BIS Review   39/1998˝I admit that this is a complicated arrangement. No easy answer has yet been found.What is necessary in the interest of the international monetary system is a cleardeclaration of belief in an open world economy which does not attempt to support hegemoniesthrough hidden regulations.Surveillance and rules, however carefully they are fomulated, are no substitute forthe self-imposed sense of responsibility of the market players themselves.Instead, a promising approach may be to refrain, when attempting to reform, fromgiving the IMF a never ending series of new tasks to perform but to restore the role of the IMF to itsoriginal function, namely that of a catalyst.VII hope that during the next two days this conference will provide you with manyopportunities to take part in interesting discussions which will afford you additional information andnew material for coming to your own conclusions.When you leave Washington again at the weekend, you should be in no doubt - if Imay return to the cartoon I mentioned at the beginning - at least about the currency you use whenmaking a bet.
BIS Review   37/1998˝Mr. Kelley discusses the Year 2000 issue   Testimony ofMr. Edward W. Kelley, Jr., a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation at the US Senateon 28/4/98.I am pleased to appear before the Committee today to discuss the Year 2000computer systems issue and the Federal Reserve’s efforts to address it.  The stakes are enormous,nothing less than the preservation of a safe and sound financial system that can continue tooperate in an orderly manner when the clock rolls over at midnight on New Year’s Eve and themillennium arrives.  So much has been written about the difficulties ascribed to the Year 2000challenge that by now almost everyone is familiar with the basic issue - specifically, thatinformation generated by computers may be inaccurate or that programs may be terminatedbecause they cannot process Year 2000 dates.  The Federal Reserve System has developed and isexecuting a comprehensive plan to ensure its own Year 2000 readiness, and the bank supervisionfunction is well along in a cooperative, interagency effort, to promote timely remediation andtesting by the banking industry.  This morning I shall first focus on the potential macroeconomicconsequences of the Year 2000 issue.  Then I shall discuss actions being taken by the FederalReserve System to address its internal systems, including Reserve Bank testing with depositoryinstitutions, and its bank supervision efforts.The Macroeconomic Effects of the Millennium BugThe Year 2000 (“Y2K”) problem will touch much more than just our financialsystem and could temporarily have adverse effects on the performance of the overall USeconomy as well as the economies of many, or all, other nations if it is not corrected.  Thespectrum of possible outcomes is broad, for the truth of the matter is that this episode is unique.We have no previous experiences to give us adequate guideposts.  A few economists already aresuggesting that Y2K-related disruptions will induce a deep recession in the year 2000.  That isprobably a stretch, but I do not think that we shall escape unaffected.  Some of the morefrightening scenarios are not without a certain plausibility, if this challenge were being ignored.But it is not being ignored.  While it is probable that preparations may in some instances prove tobe inadequate or ineffective, an enormous amount of work is being done in anticipation of therollover of the millennium.  It is impossible today to forecast the impact of this event, and therange of possibilities runs from minimal to extremely serious.  In that spirit, let me review withyou some of the ways in which the millennium bug already is influencing the US economy anddiscuss some of the possible outcomes for economic activity early in the next century.Corporate business is spending vast amounts of money to tackle the Y2Kproblem.  To try to get a handle on the magnitude of these Y2K expenditures, we have reviewedthe most recent 10-K reports filed with the SEC by approximately 95 percent of the firms in theFortune 500.  These are the largest businesses in our economy, with revenues of around$5½ trillion annually, and are likely to be on the cutting edge of efforts to deal with themillennium bug.  Before the end of the decade, these firms report that they expect to spend about$11 billion in dealing with the Y2K problem.  (Of this total, financial corporations are planningexpenditures of $3½ billion, while companies in the nonfinancial sector have budgeted funds ofaround $7½ billion.)These estimates undoubtably understate the magnitude of the Y2Kreprogramming efforts.  In culling through the 10-K reports, we found that many companies
- 2 -BIS Review   37/1998˝reported incurring no additional costs associated with Y2K remediation efforts.  I doubt suchfirms are unaware of the problem.  Rather, I suspect that some firms did not view their Y2Kspending as having a “material” effect on their bottom line, and some companies probably havefunded Y2K programs with monies already budgeted to their information technology functions.Making an allowance for all costs - whether explicitly stated or not - and recognizing that theseFortune 500 firms are only part of the picture, an educated guess of the sunk cost of Y2Kremedial efforts in the US private sector might be roughly $50 billion.  To put this number intoperspective, the Gartner Group has estimated that Y2K remediation efforts will total $300 to$600 billion on a worldwide basis.  The US economy accounts for about one-fifth of worldoutput, and thus our estimate seems broadly consistent with the lower end of their range.  Giventhe experience of our own Y2K efforts to date, I would expect to see costs rise further once allthese Y2K programs are fully under way - ultimately pushing costs up within the Gartner Grouprange.Corporate efforts to deal with the Y2K problem are affecting economic activity ina variety of ways.  On the positive side, an important element in some Y2K programs is thereplacement of aging computer systems with modern, state-of-the-art hardware and software.Such capital expenditures - which I should note are not included in the $50 billion cost estimate -will raise the level of productivity in those enterprises, and, in general, the need to address theY2K problem has increased the  awareness on the part of senior executives of the complexityand importance of managing corporate information technology resources.  The increasedreplacement demand also has contributed to the spectacular growth recently in this country’scomputer hardware and software industries - a process that I would expect to continue for awhile longer.  But, ultimately, we are largely shifting the timing of these investmentexpenditures:  Today’s added growth is likely “borrowed” from spending at some time in thefuture.  And, if analyzing the dynamics of this situation were not already complicated enough,some firms may “freeze” their systems in the middle of 1999 - effectively forgoing theinstallation of new hardware and software systems just before the millennium.  This, too, couldinfluence spending on computer equipment - shifting some of it from 1999 into 2000.While Year 2000 remediation efforts may give a temporary boost to economicactivity in some sectors, the net effect probably is negative.  I suspect the majority of Y2Kexpenditures should be viewed as increased outlays for maintenance of existing systems, whichare additional costs on businesses.  Other than the very valuable ability to maintain its operationsinto the year 2000, few quantifiable benefits accrue to the firm - and overall productivity gainsare reduced by the extra hours devoted to reprogramming and testing.  Conservative estimatessuggest that the net effect of Y2K remediation efforts might shave a tenth or two a year off thegrowth of our nation’s overall labor productivity, and a more substantial effect is possible ifsome of the larger estimates of Y2K costs are used in these calculations.  The effects on realgross domestic product are likely to be somewhat smaller than this but could still total a tenth ofa percentage point or so a year over the next two years.The United States is not alone in working to deal with the millennium bug.Efforts by our major trading partners also are under way, although in many cases they probablyare not yet at so advanced a stage as in this country.  In Europe, the need to reprogram computersystems to handle the conversion to the euro seems to have taken precedence over Y2K efforts,although there may be efficiencies in dealing with the two problems at once.  The financialdifficulties of Japan and other Asian economies certainly have diverted attention and resourcesin those countries from the Y2K problem, increasing the risk of a Y2K shock from one or moreof these countries.  But, on the positive side, large multinational corporations are acutely awareof the Y2K problem, and their remediation efforts are independent of national boundaries.  There
- 3 -BIS Review   37/1998˝also are anecdotal reports that many of these companies are extending their influence bydemanding that their extensive networks of smaller suppliers prepare  themselves as a conditionof maintaining their business relationship.Obviously, a great deal of work either is planned or is under way to deal with theYear 2000 problem.  But what if something slips through the cracks, and we experience thefailure of some “mission critical” systems?  How will a computer failure in one industry affectthe ability of other industries to continue to operate smoothly?  The number of possible scenariosof this type is endless, and today no one can say with any confidence how severe any Y2Kdisruptions could be or how a failure in one sector would influence activity in others.We have many examples of how economic activity was affected by disruptions tothe physical infrastructure of this country.  Although the Y2K problem clearly is unique, some ofthese disruptions to our physical infrastructure may be useful in organizing our thinking aboutthe consequences of short-lived interruptions in our information  infrastructure.  In early 1996, amajor winter storm paralyzed large portions of the country.  Commerce ground to a halt for up toa week in some areas but activity bounced back rapidly once the roads were cleared  again.Although individual firms and households were adversely affected by these disruptions, in theaggregate, the economy quickly recovered most of the output lost due to the storm.  In thisinstance, the shock to our physical infrastructure was transitory in nature, and, critically, therecovery process was under way before any adverse “feedback” effects were produced.  Lastsummer’s strike by workers at the United Parcel Service is a second example.  UPS is a majorplayer in the package delivery industry in this country, and the strike disrupted the shippingpatterns of many businesses.  Some sales were lost, but in many instances alternative shippingservices were found for high-priority packages.  Some businesses were hurt by the strike, but itseffect on economic activity was small in the aggregate.  Hopefully, any Y2K shock to ourinformation infrastructure would also be transitory and would share the characteristics of theseshocks to our physical infrastructure.What can monetary policy do to offset any macroeconomic effects?  The truthfulanswer is “not much”.  Just as we were not able to plow the streets in 1996 or deliver packagesin 1997, the central bank will be unable to reprogram the nation’s computers for the year 2000.The Y2K problem is primarily an issue affecting the aggregate “supply” side of the economy,whereas the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy works mainly on aggregate “demand”.  We allunderstand how creating more money and lowering the level of short-term interest rates gives aboost to interest-sensitive sectors (such as homebuilding), but these tools are unlikely to be veryeffective in generating more Y2K remediation efforts or accelerating the recovery process if acompany experiences some type of Year 2000 disruption.  We will, of course, be ready if peoplewant to hold more cash on New Year’s Eve 1999, and we will be prepared to lend to financialinstitutions through the discount window under appropriate circumstances or to provide neededreserves to the banking system.  But there is nothing monetary policy can do to offset the directeffects of a severe Y2K disruption.  As a result, our Year 2000 focus has been in areas where wecan make a difference: conforming our own systems, overseeing the preparations of the bankingindustry, preparing the payments system, and contingency planning.  Additionally, we are doingall we can to increase awareness of this problem and to energize preparations both here at homeand in other parts of the world.Background on Federal Reserve Year 2000 PreparationsThe Federal Reserve operates several payments applications that process andsettle payments and securities transactions between depository institutions in the United States.
- 4 -BIS Review   37/1998˝These systems are critical national utility services, moving funds much as the national powergrid moves electricity.  Fedwire is a large-value payments mechanism for US dollar interbankfunds transfers and US government securities transfers primarily used by depository institutionsand government agencies.  These applications, as well as the supporting accounting systems andother payment applications such as the Automated Clearing House (ACH), run on mainframecomputer systems operated by Federal Reserve Automation Services (FRAS), the internalorganizational unit that processes applications on behalf of the Federal Reserve Banks andoperates the Federal Reserve’s national communications network.The Reserve Banks also operate check processing systems that provide checkservices to depository institutions and the US government.  In addition to centralizedapplications on the mainframe, the Reserve Banks operate a range of applications in a distributedcomputing environment, supporting business functions such as currency distribution, bankingsupervision and regulation, research, public information, and human resources.  The scope of theFederal Reserve’s Year 2000 activities includes remediation of all of these processingenvironments and the supporting telecommunications network, called FEDNET.  Our Year 2000preparations also address our computerized environmental and facilities management systems,such as power, heating and cooling, voice communications, elevators, and vaults.Year 2000 Readiness of Internal SystemsThe Federal Reserve is giving the Year 2000 its highest priority, consistent withour goal of maintaining the stability of the nation’s financial markets and payments systems,preserving public confidence, and supporting reliable government operations.  The FederalReserve completed assessment of its applications in 1997; our most significant applications havebeen renovated; and internal testing is underway using dedicated Y2K computer systems anddate-simulation tools.  Changes to mission critical computer programs, as well as system anduser-acceptance testing, are on schedule to be completed by year-end 1998.  Further, systemssupporting the delivery of critical financial services that interface with the depository institutionswill be Year 2000 ready by this July and a depository institution test program will be in place atthat time.  This schedule will permit approximately 18 months for customer testing, to which weare dedicating considerable support resources.Our Y2K project is being closely coordinated among the Reserve Banks, theBoard of Governors, numerous vendors and service providers, approximately 13,000 customers,and government agencies.  We are stressing effective, consistent, and timely communication,both internal and external, to promote awareness and commitment at all levels of our ownorganization and the financial services industry, more generally.A significant challenge in meeting our Y2K readiness objectives is our reliance oncommercial hardware and software products and services.  Much of our information processingand communications infrastructure, as well as our administrative functions and other operations,is composed of hardware and software products from third-party vendors.  As a result, we mustcoordinate with numerous vendors and manufacturers to ensure that all of our hardware,software, and services are Year 2000 ready.  In many cases, compliance requires upgrading, or,in some cases, replacing, equipment and software.  We have a complete inventory of vendorcomponents used in our mainframe, telecommunications, and distributed computingenvironments, and vendor coordination and system change are progressing well.  We areparticularly sensitive to telecommunications, an essential infrastructure element in our ability tomaintain a satisfactorily high level of financial and business services.  We have been workingwith our financial institutions and our telecommunications servicers to find ways to facilitate
- 5 -BIS Review   37/1998˝preparations and testing programs that will ensure Y2K readiness.  Nonetheless, this is an areathat many financial institutions regard as needing attention.  We strongly support the FCC’sprogram to draw increased attention to the Y2K issue and the progress of thetelecommunications companies in the United States.Oversight of Banking Industry PreparationsUltimately, the boards of directors and senior management of banks and otherfinancial institutions must shoulder the responsibility for ensuring that the institutions theymanage are able to provide high quality and continuous services beginning on the first businessday in January of the Year 2000 and beyond.  This critical obligation must be among the veryhighest of priorities for bank management and boards of directors.  Nevertheless, banksupervisors can provide guidance, encouragement, and strong incentives to the banking industryto address this challenge.  Accordingly, the Federal Reserve and the other banking supervisorsthat make up the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the FFIEC, have beenworking closely to orchestrate a uniform supervisory approach to supervising the bankingindustry’s efforts to ensure its readiness.  Detailed information about our supervisory program isattached as an Addendum to this testimony and is readily available on a web site maintained bythe Federal Reserve on behalf of these agencies.Preparing the Payments SystemsIn order to ensure the readiness of the payments system, the Federal Reserve hasprepared a special central environment for the testing of high-risk dates, such as the rollover tothe Year 2000 and leap year.  Testing will be conducted through a combination of future-datingour computer systems to verify the readiness of our infrastructure, and testing critical futuredates within interfaces to other institutions.  Internal testing is expected to be completed by July,and external testing with customers and other counterparties will then commence and continuethroughout 1999.  Network communications components are also being tested and certified in aspecial test lab environment.  We have published a detailed schedule of testing opportunities forFedwire, ACH transactions and other services provided by the Federal Reserve.  Our testenvironments have been configured to provide flexible and nearly continuous access bycustomers.  The Reserve Banks are implementing processes to identify which depositories havetested with us, so that we may follow up on any laggards.We are also researching, in conjunction with our counterparties, the benefits ofY2K testing that would span the entire business process.  As part of this effort, the FederalReserve is coordinating with the Clearing House for Interbank Payment Systems (CHIPS) andthe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) to provide acommon test day for customers of all three systems on September 26, 1998.  The New YorkClearing House is coordinating an effort to establish common global test dates among majorfunds transfer systems during April and May 1999.We are also coordinating with the international community of financial regulatorsto help mobilize global preparations more generally.  These efforts are discussed more fully inthe Addendum.  In particular, through the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements,international regulators for banking, securities, and insurance along with global paymentsspecialists recently jointly hosted a Year 2000 Round Table, which was attended by over 50countries.  A Joint Council was formed that will promote readiness and serve as a global clearinghouse on Year 2000 issues.  In the final analysis, however, the regulatory community recognizesthat it cannot solve the problem for the financial industry.  Every financial institution must
- 6 -BIS Review   37/1998˝complete its own program and thoroughly test its applications with counterparties and customersif problems are to be avoided.Contingency PlanningDespite our intensive efforts to prepare our computer systems, we must also makeplans for dealing with problems that might occur at the Year 2000 rollover.  As you know, theFederal Reserve has been involved in contingency planning and has dealt with various types ofemergencies for many years.  In response to past disasters we worked closely with the affectedfinancial institutions to ensure that adequate supplies of cash were available to the community,and that backup systems supported our operations without interruption during the crisis period.These efforts primarily focused on the orderly resumption of business operations resulting fromhardware failures or processing-site problems.  In addition to disruptions to hardware orprocessing sites, Y2K contingency planning must be directed at potential software failures andinterdependency problems with financial and non-financial counterparties.  Within this context,business resumption is made more difficult because we cannot fall back to an earlier version of asoftware package as this version itself may not have been readied for the Year 2000.  Y2Kdisruptions to utility services or depository institutions can also directly affect the FederalReserve’s ability to conduct business.  So, in order to plan for the continuity of services, it maybe necessary to consider available alternate ways to provide services if a Year 2000 problem isidentified.The Federal Reserve has formed a task force to address the contingency readinessof our payments applications.  Although we have no grounds for anticipating that specificfailures could occur and we cannot act as an operational backstop for the nation’s financialindustry, we view it as our responsibility to take action to ensure that we are as well positionedas possible to address major failures should they occur.  We are currently focusing oncontingency planning for external Y2K-related disruptions, such as those affecting utilitycompanies, telecommunications providers, large banks, and difficulties abroad that affect USmarkets or institutions.  The Federal Reserve has established higher standards for testinginstitutions that serve as the backbone for the transactions that support domestic andinternational financial markets and whose failure could pose a systemic risk to the paymentssystem.We recognize that, despite their best efforts, some depository institutions mayexperience operating difficulties, either as a result of their own computer problems or those oftheir customers, counterparties, or others.  These problems could be manifested in a number ofways and could involve temporary funding difficulties.  The Federal Reserve plans to beprepared to provide information to depository institutions on the balances in their accounts withus throughout the day, so that they can identify shortfalls and seek funding in the market.  TheSystem will also be prepared to lend in appropriate circumstances and with adequate collateral todepository institutions when market sources of funding are not reasonably available.Our preparations for possible liquidity difficulties extend as well to the foreignbank branches and agencies in the US that may be adversely affected directly by their owncomputer systems or through difficulties caused by the linkage and dependence on their parentbank.  Such circumstances would necessitate coordination with the home country supervisor.Moreover, consistent with current policy, foreign central banks will be expected to provideliquidity support to any of their banking organizations that experience a funding shortfall.Closing Remarks
- 7 -BIS Review   37/1998˝To sum up, the macroeconomic effects of Year 2000 preparations are quitecomplex.  As I have discussed, some industries may benefit in the near term from increased salesassociated with the accelerated pace of replacement of obsolete computer systems, and theircustomers presumably will have more productive systems in place sooner than might otherwisehave been the case.  But, in the aggregate, preparing for the Y2K problem is likely exerting aslight drag on the US economy.  The Y2K problem, in effect, raises the rate of depreciation ofthe nation’s stock of plant and equipment.  It forces businesses to devote additionalprogramming resources simply to maintain the existing flow of services from its computers.As a provider of financial services to the economy, we are on schedule with ourown internal remediation efforts and will shortly begin testing our interfaces with financialinstitutions.  While we have made significant progress in our Year 2000 preparations, ourchallenge now is to ensure that our efforts remain on schedule and that problems are addressed ina timely fashion.  In particular, we shall be paying special attention to the testing needs ofdepository institutions and the financial industry and are prepared to adjust our support for themas required by experience.As a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve will continue to address the financialservices industry’s preparedness, monitor progress, and target for special supervisory attentionthose institutions that are most in need of assistance.  In addition, we shall track the Y2Kprogress of external vendors and critical infrastructure suppliers, such as telecommunicationsand electrical power utilities.The problems presented to the world by the potential for computer failures as themillennium arrives are real and serious.  Because these problems are unique to our experience inmany ways, and because the impact of computer-driven systems has become so ubiquitous, theevent is unlikely to be trouble free.  While we can’t predict with any certainty, there clearly is thepotential for problems to develop, but these need not be traumatic if we all do our part inpreparation.  As the world’s largest economy, the heaviest burden of preparation falls on theUnited States.  But it is truly a worldwide issue and, to the extent that some are not adequatelyprepared and experience breakdowns of unforeseeable dimension, we shall all be affectedaccordingly.  There is much work to be done.  We intend to do our utmost, and hope and trustthat others will do likewise.In this spirit, Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the Committee for inviting thispanel to testify together on Y2K issues.  This is the first time that the Board has testified next torepresentatives of the Departments of Commerce and Transportation, and the FCC.  This iswholly appropriate because our success in preparing for the millennium will ultimately dependvery much on one another’s efforts.Addendum:  Supervisory Elements of the Federal Reserve’s Year 2000 Preparations1. Interagency Statements and Other GuidanceThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council(FFIEC) - composed ofthe Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit Union Administration -has issued a series of six advisory statements since June 1996, including statements on the
- 8 -BIS Review   37/1998˝Year 2000 effect on computers, project management, business risk, readiness of serviceproviders, guidance to address customer risk, and testing for readiness.  An advisory oncontingency planning is being prepared.  As a result of these advisory statements, the industry’sawareness and the extent of its remediation efforts have significantly increased over the past twoyears.  The FFIEC is considering additional guidance to financial institutions on the developmentof customer awareness programs and the need to communicate with and address questions ofretail customers regarding Year 2000 issues.2. Supervisory ReviewsIn May 1997, the banking agencies committed to conduct a supervisory review byJune 30, 1998, of all insured depositories to assess the state of their Y2K readiness.  Subsequentreviews and examinations will continue throughout 1999.  Through March 31, 1998, the FederalReserve has conducted reviews of approximately 1,100 organizations.  The Federal Reserve andthe other agencies appear to be on schedule to meet their stated goal.  These reviews haveresulted in a significant focus of attention on the subject matter within the industry and theagencies as well.Deficient organizations are subject to increased monitoring and supervisoryfollow-up including more frequent reviews.  Restrictions on expansionary activities byorganizations that are deficient in their Year 2000 preparations have also been put into place.3. Assessment of Supervision Review ResultsThe Federal Reserve has been conducting Year 2000 supervisory reviews offinancial organizations subject to our supervisory authority, coordinating closely with statebanking departments and other federal banking agencies that may share responsibility for thebanking organizations.  Based on these reviews, we conclude that management awareness of,and attention to, the Year 2000 problem has improved notably since the Federal Reserve and theother banking agencies escalated efforts in early 1997 to focus the industry’s attention onensuring Y2K readiness.  Banking organizations are making substantial progress in renovatingtheir systems and, with some exceptions, are on track to meet FFIEC guidelines.  Most largeorganizations are actively engaged in the renovation and testing of their mission critical systems.Smaller organizations are working closely with their service providers in an effort to confirm thereadiness and reliability of the services and products on which they depend.  Similarly, many ofthe US offices of foreign banks are heavily dependent on their parent bank for their Year 2000readiness.4. Supervision Follow upTo address deficient organizations, the Federal Reserve is issuing a confidentialDeficiency Notification Letter to those rated less than satisfactory with respect to their Y2Kreadiness program.  We call for a corrective action plan and put the organization on a 30-dayreporting regimen to monitor its progress.  Given our concern that the organization needs to useits resources to address its deficiencies, rather than expanding, the Federal Reserve also asks theorganization for advance notification before entering into any contractual commitments ormaking public announcements pertaining to prospective acquisitions that require FederalReserve approval.  The agency can then determine the possible effects of the expansionary
- 9 -BIS Review   37/1998˝proposal on the organization’s deficient Y2K readiness efforts, and possibly discourage or denyexpansion if financial and managerial factors are inconsistent with approval of the application.5. Outreach InitiativesThe Federal Reserve is actively participating in numerous outreach initiatives withthe banking industry, trade associations, regulatory authorities and other groups that are hostingconferences, seminars and training opportunities that focus on the Year 2000 and helpparticipants understand better the issues that need to be addressed.  Throughout the country, thefederal banking agencies have been working with state banking departments and local bankersassociations in order to develop coordinated and comprehensive efforts to improve the local andregional programs intended to focus attention on the Year 2000.  These efforts will continueconsistent with the requirements contained in the  Examination Parity and Year 2000 Readinessfor Financial Institutions Act (Public Law 105-164), enacted March 20, 1998, which call, in part,for the banking agencies to conduct seminars for depository institutions on the implications ofthe Y2K problem on their ability to conduct safe and sound operations.6. International ScopeThe Federal Reserve has worked actively within the Bank for InternationalSettlements (BIS) to ensure that financial regulators around the world are aware of the dangersposed by the Year 2000 and are working to see that the markets and institutions they oversee areready for the century date change.  Last September, the G-10 Governors issued a Year 2000advisory that included a paper prepared by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (BasleSupervisors) describing the serious nature of the problem, identifying the issues that must beaddressed, and outlining how programs to address the issue should be structured.  The BISCommittee on Payment and Settlement Services (CPSS) has established a web site on whichpayment systems around the world are posting short reports describing the status of theirreadiness in order to promote the transparent sharing of Year 2000 information.We continue to participate in international meetings focusing on the Year 2000issue in order to increase awareness and promote greater understanding and cooperation.  Earlierthis month, the BIS was the site for the Year 2000 Round Table sponsored jointly by the CPSS,Basle Supervisors, the International Organization of Securities Commissioners, and theInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors.  This meeting, which was attended byfinancial supervisors and representatives from the private sector from more than 50 countries,highlighted cross-border dependencies and the need for international cooperation to ensure thatthe issue is managed to minimize any disruptions and possible economic ramifications.As a result of the Round Table, a Joint Year 2000 Council of financial regulatorswas formed with the First Vice-President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York serving asthe chair.  The Council will serve as a contact point between the financial market regulators andmarket participants including private sector groups specifically focused on international issues.It will also promote readiness, identify sound practices for dealing with the issue, and serve as aglobal clearing house on Year 2000 issues more generally.A survey by the Basle Supervisors conducted late last year indicated that globalawareness of the issue is increasing rapidly but that much work remains to be done.  While mostcentral banks and regulators express cautious optimism that their payments systems and financial
- 10 -BIS Review   37/1998˝institutions will generally be ready, there is increasing recognition that some problems areinevitable.  To this end, increasing attention is being focused on the need to identify likelypotential problems before reaching the century date change and to develop contingency plans toensure the stability of global financial markets.The majority of foreign central banks are confident that payment and settlementapplications under their management will be Y2K ready.  Like the Federal Reserve, however, theoperation of foreign central bank payment systems is dependent on compliant products fromhardware and software suppliers and the readiness of telecommunication and electric powerinfrastructures.  Foreign central banks consider Y2K readiness testing to be a critical andcomplex issue.  The approach of foreign central banks toward raising banking industryawareness varies widely.  We are aware that many European banks are stretched for resources asa result of the world-wide demand for information technology staff resources and theirconversion to a single currency.  Similarly, Asian financial institutions are focusing on theirwell-known problems, possibly placing full Y2K preparations in jeopardy.7. Communications EffortsWe have been working intensively to address the issues faced by the industry andto formulate an effective communications program tailored to those issues.  Our publicawareness program concentrates on communications with the financial services industry relatedto our Y2K readiness, our testing efforts, and our overall concerns about the industry’s readiness.We have inaugurated a Year 2000 industry newsletter, have published periodic bulletinsaddressing specific technical issues, and have established an Internet Web site that can beaccessed at the following Internet address:  http://www.frbsf.org/fiservices/cdc.  In addition, wehave published a set of guidelines for small businesses, including depository institutions, onYear 2000 issues and project management.On behalf of the FFIEC, the Federal Reserve has developed a Year 2000information distribution system, including an Internet Web site and a toll free Fax Back service(888-882-0982).  The Web site provides easy access to policy statements, guidance to examiners,and paths to other Year 2000 Web sites available from numerous other sources.  It can beaccessed at the following Internet address:  http://www.ffiec.gov/y2k.The Federal Reserve has also produced a ten-minute video entitled “Year 2000Executive Awareness”, intended for viewing by a bank’s board of directors and seniormanagement, that presents a summary of the Year 2000 five-phase project management planoutlined in the interagency policy statement.  In introductory remarks on the video, it is stressedthat senior bank officials should be directly involved in managing the Year 2000 project toensure that it is given the appropriate level of attention and sufficient resources to address theissue on a timely basis.  The video can be ordered through the Board’s Web site:http:\\www.bog.frb.fed.us/y2k.
BIS Review   36/1998Mr. Brash speaks on monetary policy in New Zealand   Address by the Governorof the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Dr. Donald T. Brash, before the Auckland Chamber ofCommerce, in Auckland, on 20/4/98.I very much appreciate this opportunity to address such an important Aucklandaudience at this time.  We all know that, on 18 March, the Reserve Bank announced a further easingof monetary policy, an easing which was rather larger than most people had been expecting.  Sincethen, the exchange rate has fallen and interest rates have risen (especially at the short end of the yieldcurve).These developments have led to a great deal of puzzlement and some anger.  Whatkind of easing is it which leads to an increase in interest rates?  Hasn’t Don Brash become just likeRob Muldoon, interfering in the market and manipulating first this lever and then that - perhapsinitially focused on keeping inflation low but now, worried by the balance of payments deficit,pushing down the exchange rate to help reduce that deficit and pushing up interest rates to punishAuckland house buyers?  Why do we need the Reserve Bank interfering in financial markets at all,now that we have a largely deregulated economy?  Surely the easing was totally ‘botched’?This morning I want to answer those charges.  (I will not be making any comments onthe current level of the MCI, or about what the Bank might or might not do about it.)Central banks are an ‘intervention’, but the RBNZ is not ‘Muldoonist’Let me begin by stating at the outset that central banks are an intervention in theeconomy.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand probably has less direct control over financial marketprices than any other central bank in the world - we haven’t intervened in the foreign exchangemarket for 13 years, for example, and don’t fix any single interest rate - but I do not deny for amoment that we intervene to influence overall monetary conditions.I do not want to be side-tracked into a long debate about the virtues of having acentral bank, beyond simply observing that for all practical purposes we either have our own centralbank, as the great majority of countries do, or we abandon our own currency and use the services ofsome other central bank, such as Hong Kong and Argentina effectively do (they use the services ofthe US central bank of course).  As long as we want to retain our own money, we need to have amonetary policy, and some institutional structure with which to implement that monetary policy.The key issue is what that institution, typically a central bank, should try to achievewith its powers.  I presume that those who accuse us of having become ‘Muldoonist’ believe that wehave given up our single-minded pursuit of price stability and have instead started using monetarypolicy to achieve other objectives, perhaps trying to help to reduce the balance of payments deficit ortrying to deflate property prices.  Some people have of course welcomed this ‘more pragmaticapproach’.  I don’t think even our worst critics have accused us of manipulating monetary policy forpolitical purposes, which of course was one of the accusations levelled against Rob Muldoon.So let me say it again: monetary policy has been exclusively focused on deliveringlow inflation in accordance with the target agreed with Government (initially 0 to 2 per cent, now0 to 3 per cent) since at least the time I was appointed Governor, now almost 10 years ago.Monetary policy remains focused exclusively on that objective.  Indeed, any other focus formonetary policy would be inconsistent with the legislation under which the Reserve Bank operates,passed without dissent in 1989.But it is important to recall that price stability was not chosen as the single objectiveof monetary policy because Parliament thought that other objectives were unimportant.  Rather, bythe late eighties it had become increasingly recognised here and abroad that the best contribution
- 2 -BIS Review   36/1998which monetary policy could make to those other objectives - social justice, growth in employment,growth in output - was to deliver predictably stable prices.  And indeed, this point is now recognisedquite explicitly in the wording of the Policy Targets Agreement between the Treasurer and myself.Monetary policy aimed at stable prices assists social justice by avoiding the kind ofcapricious transfers of income and wealth which are the inevitable result of inflation.Monetary policy aimed at stable prices assists growth in output and jobs by helpingthe price system, which is at the heart of the market economy, work more effectively.And monetary policy aimed at stable prices assists the economy by helping to smoothbusiness cycles.  Ah, you say, he admits it: the Reserve Bank is using monetary policy to try tosmooth the business cycle.  No, I am not saying that at all.  What I am saying is that when monetarypolicy is aimed at delivering stable prices it has the ancillary benefit that the business cycle may besmoothed to some degree also.  Why?  Because the situations where inflationary pressures areincreasing are by their nature usually situations where demand in the economy is running ahead ofthe economy’s long-term capacity to supply, so that monetary policy aimed at restraining thoseinflationary pressures inevitably tends to dampen down booms.  And conversely, those situationswhere demand falls short of the economy’s long-term capacity to supply are usually situations whereinflationary pressures are falling towards zero, so that monetary policy aimed at preventing inflationfalling below zero (as required by my agreement with the Treasurer) inevitably tends to work tomitigate those downturns.In determining the stance of monetary policy, we are inevitably trying to assess whatfuture inflation pressures will be.  That means we are always trying to assess how demand pressureswill evolve relative to the economy’s ability to supply.  Are we primarily trying to smooth businesscycles?  No, we are trying to maintain consistently low inflation within the target we have agreedwith Government, but one of the corollaries, one of the ancillary benefits, is that, if we get it right,the business cycle will be somewhat moderated also - less vigorous booms and less recessionarybusts.  As one of America’s leading monetary policy economists, Larry Ball of Johns HopkinsUniversity, has recently argued, even if you were mainly concerned to smooth output andemployment cycles, focusing monetary policy on delivering predictably low inflation would be themost sensible way of running monetary policy.So let’s make this abundantly clear.  The Reserve Bank has not had some sort ofroad-to-Damascus experience.  We have not decided that inflation matters less and that we have to‘go for growth’.  We have not decided to fix the current account.  We have not decided to get thefarmers back in the black.  And we have certainly not, as columnist Chris Trotter put it, anticipated‘the National Government’s political needs’.  The easing process that is now underway is absolutelyintrinsic to, and an inevitable result of, the monetary policy framework that has applied inNew Zealand since the passage of the 1989 Reserve Bank Act.  More precisely, it is the inevitableresult of an inflation target which has an upper and a lower limit.  Recent events are therefore just‘business as usual’.Recent changes in interest rates and the exchange rateBut, you ask, hasn’t the Reserve Bank just deliberately knocked down the exchangerate and increased interest rates?  Doesn’t that suggest that the Bank has taken its eye off the pricestability ball, and is now trying to manipulate conditions in order to reduce the balance of paymentsdeficit?  That is certainly a widespread perception, but it is totally wrong.For a very long time, the Bank has argued that, while we can tighten monetary policyor we can ease monetary policy, we can not control the way in which these policy adjustments affectmonetary conditions.  Put another way, the mix of monetary conditions is determined by the
- 3 -BIS Review   36/1998decisions and perceptions of countless thousands of individuals, borrowers and savers, both withinNew Zealand and overseas.Let me illustrate that point first by looking not at the events of the last few weeks andmonths but rather at the period during which monetary policy was being tightened to head offemerging inflationary pressures from early 1994.  Graph 1 shows how overall monetary conditionstightened from the beginning of 1994 through to late 1996.  In 1994, that tightening took the form ofboth an increase in interest rates and an increase in the exchange rate, as shown in Graph 2.  Butthrough 1995 and 1996, as exporters and those competing with imports know only too well, interestrates fluctuated through quite a narrow band while the exchange rate continued to increase strongly.Indeed, at times the overall firming of conditions took the form of an actual fall in interest rates,more than offset, in terms of the effect on inflationary pressures, by a strong increase in the exchangerate.GRAPH 1Nominal Monetary Conditions IndexJanuary 1994 - April 1998-400-2000200400600800100012001 Jan 941 Apr 9430 Jun 9428 Sep 9427 Dec 9427 Mar 9525 Jun 9523 Sep 9522 Dec 9521 Mar 9619 Jun 9617 Sep 9616 Dec 9616 Mar 9714 Jun 9712 Sep 9711 Dec 9711 Mar 98Index-400-200020040060080010001200IndexGRAPH 2

In my view they were, and I suspect that most exportersand those competing with imports are in full agreement.Was the situation ideal?  In my view it was not.  From our point of view in the centralbank, it meant that interest rates stayed too low to restrain the very strong growth in borrowing whichoccurred through that period, which in turn meant that there was insufficient disinflationary pressureon those domestic sectors of the economy which were the source of so much of the inflation in thoseyears.  Conversely, the strong increase in the exchange rate was putting more and moredisinflationary pressure on those sectors of the economy in competition with the rest of the world,even though inflation in those sectors was very low.  I occasionally expressed my unhappiness withthat particular mix of monetary conditions, but I recognised that I was not able to change it.Over the last year or so of course the process has been substantially reversed.  TheBank has been progressively willing to ease overall monetary conditions, and the extent of thiseasing since the end of 1996 is also shown in Graph 1.  But as can be seen in Graph 3, all of theeasing, indeed more than all of the easing, has taken the form of a fall in the exchange rate, offset inpart by some increase in interest rates.Is this new mix of monetary conditions surprising?  Not really, given the widespreadperception that New Zealand’s balance of payments deficit has reached a high level and given thestill-strong demand by New Zealanders to borrow.  In other words, our strong demand to borrow andour reluctance to save require us to attract the savings of foreigners.  Since those foreign savers haveseen an increasing risk that the New Zealand dollar might depreciate, we have had to pay increasinginterest rates to offset that perceived risk of currency depreciation.GRAPH 3

I am sure it mustseem so to many indebted companies and households.  On the other hand, I am equally confident thatthere are a great number of people in the export sector, and in companies competing with imports,who are absolutely delighted by the change in the mix of monetary conditions.  So also are thosepeople who derive income from their savings.  Predictably, most of them are not issuing pressstatements expressing their delight, so the overall impression created is that the whole country ismiserable about the change.In my own view, the change in the mix of monetary conditions which we have seenover the last year or so has been a positive development for the economy’s medium-termdevelopment.  It should certainly assist in reducing the currently large balance of payments deficit.Having said that, however, the balance of payments is not an objective of monetary policy - andthat’s just as well because, as I have noted already, monetary policy has no ability to influence themix of monetary conditions.But didn’t the Reserve Bank deliberately change the mix, by projecting a weakerexchange rate and higher interest rates in its quarterly inflation projections?  Certainly, we didproject an easing in overall monetary conditions over the next year or so and, because we have tomake some assumption about how that easing will be reflected in interest rates and the exchange ratein order to complete our inflation projection, we did indicate that we expected that easing to take theform of a somewhat reduced exchange rate and broadly unchanged interest rates (at least through1998).  But we have routinely disclosed the interest and exchange rate assumptions underlying ourinflation projections, and financial markets have understood that these are not assumptions which wenecessarily expect to see realised, let alone assumptions which we can in some way enforce onfinancial markets.  In December 1997, for example, we projected that the exchange rate wouldremain broadly unchanged at 64.2 on the Trade-Weighted Index and the 90 day interest rate wouldstay at around 7.6 per cent through the first half of 1998.  Well before our March projections werepublished, the exchange rate had fallen well below 64.2 and interest rates had risen above7.6 per cent.  Neither in December 1997 nor in March 1998 were our assumptions about the path ofinterest and exchange rates intended to direct financial markets to particular outcomes.
- 6 -BIS Review   36/1998But hasn’t the Reserve Bank’s easing been ‘botched’ in some way?  Has there reallybeen an easing at all?  On those questions I have not the slightest doubt.One can debate whether the Bank’s Monetary Conditions Index is correctlycalibrated, whether a 2 per cent fall in the exchange rate is equivalent to a 100 basis point movementin 90 day interest rates.  One can debate whether the Bank’s Trade-Weighted Index correctlymeasures movements in the New Zealand dollar.  One can debate whether the 90-day interest ratecorrectly measures movements in New Zealand interest rates.  And I am familiar with all of thatdebate.  (We dealt with several of these issues in the March 1998 Economic Projections, and in myspeaking notes for journalists in releasing that document.)  But if we accept, as I believe we must,that in a small, open economy monetary policy works to affect the real economy and, in that way,inflation through both interest rates and the exchange rate, then I don’t have the slightest doubt thatoverall monetary conditions have eased in New Zealand in recent months, and indeed have easedquite considerably.  That easing has taken the form of a sharp fall in the exchange rate which hasbeen partly offset by an increase in short-term interest rates (the increase in longer-term interest rateshas been much more moderate).I have often conceded that the MCI is not a perfect measure of monetary conditions.We will continue to seek ways to improve it.  But as a rule-of-thumb to guide financial marketsbetween quarterly projections it has proven enormously useful.  It has assisted us through a verymajor rebalancing of monetary conditions at a time of great turbulence in financial marketsinternationally, with an absolute minimum of drama.  Yes, interest rates have gone up, but given ourbalance of payments deficit - or in other words, our huge appetite for borrowing and our nationalaversion to saving - that should not be a matter for surprise or regret.  If as a nation we become lessenthusiastic about borrowing or more enthusiastic about saving, we can expect interest rates todecline to the levels which would seem to be justified by our low inflation.In conclusion, I think it is important that we all look at recent events objectively.Right now, the New Zealand economy is having to adapt to a complex set of circumstances,including an increase in government expenditure, a reduction in taxation, a changing housing market,and, coming rapidly over the horizon, the negative implications of the Asian financial crisis.  Yetwhat we see is adjustment to these new circumstances, taking place within existing structures,without great drama.  Monetary policy, with its single focus on price stability and its totaltransparency, has reacted as it must, smoothly and objectively.  The markets too are dealing withchanged circumstances and creating a context within which New Zealand can be more internationallycompetitive.  This is ‘business as usual’.
BIS Review   35/1998˝Ms. Hämäläinen discusses monetary policy in EMU   Discourse by theGovernor of the Bank of Finland, Ms. Sirkka Hämäläinen, at the 1998 Penningpolitiskt Forum inStockholm on 22/4/98.The launch of the single monetary policy at the start of 1999, it now seems, willnot bring any overwhelming shocks to the conduct or instrumental settings of monetary policy inthe euro area.The implementation of monetary policy is already much the same across the EUcountries.  Moreover, work on the detailed harmonization of monetary policy instruments orsystems for payment transfers, needed for smoothing liquidity across the euro area, seems to beprogressing well in the EU countries.As regards the current monetary situation, exchange rates are close to their centralrates in all the prospective EMU countries, led by market forces.  Likewise, long-term interestrates have converged closely as a result of market expectations, and most of the key central bankrates - as well as short-term market rates - have moved into very close alignment.  Thebackground for this is of course the broad economic convergence of prospective EMU countries.We would nonetheless be burying our heads in the sand if we were to overlookthe fact that in some countries there is concern about a possible pickup in inflation, at the corecountries’ interest rate level, unless fiscal policy is tightened in these countries.  These concernsare based on historical experience.  However, it is very difficult to estimate how muchexpectations regarding EMU membership have also changed the behaviour within the inflationprocess.*       *       *Decision-making in respect of the common monetary policy from the start of1999 will take place within the Governing Council of the ECB, which will be made up of thegovernors of member-country central banks and the members of the Executive Board of theECB.  In the decision-making, each member will have one vote, which means that arepresentative of a small country will have the same voting power as a representative of theGerman or French central bank.From the national central banks’ perspective, it is important to note that it is onlymonetary policy decision-making that will shift to the European level.  Other central bankfunctions, such as those concerning the stability of the financial markets and management of thecurrency supply, will remain at the national level as will all monetary policy operations andinvestment of foreign reserve assets.  That is to say that the national central banks will continueto be national institutions, despite their membership in the European System of Central Banks.The national central banks will be the shareholders in the ECB and the role of thegovernors of the national central banks, both in the system decisions and in monetarypolicymaking will be a central one.  Influence in decision-making will be based first on theone-person-one-vote principle but above all on the expertise, professional skills and activenessof each central bank committee representative and eventually of the governor.  This means thatthe national central banks will need to be able to carry out all the analysis and operations thathave been required so far but, in addition to that, to expand their expertise and analyses to theeuro-area level.*       *       *
- 2 -BIS Review   35/1998˝One of the most important matters that the ECB’s governing council will have todecide once it starts operating, is of course its monetary policy strategy.  Credibility in monetarypolicy requires clear targets, so that the aims and objectives of the ECB can be explained ex anteand the implementation of those aims can be explained ex post.  A clear target is an importantmeans of achieving transparency and accountability, i.e. of communicating with the financialmarkets, policy-makers and the general public.Defining the objective will not be an easy matter in the new circumstances.  TheEMI has sketched two alternative strategies for monetary policy in EMU, one based on monetaryaggregates and the other on a direct inflation target.  The former has historically worked well inGermany whereas the latter has produced good results in recent years in countries such as theUnited Kingdom, Sweden and Finland, where demand-for-money functions have not been stableenough for targeting purposes.Although theoretically pure forms of the two strategies can be distinguished, inpractice most central banks rely on elements of both.  Thus, in the light of the internaldecision-making process of the central bank, the strategic choice is not as crucial as it seems onthe surface.  Both strategies are forward-looking and both aim at the same ultimate goal - pricestability.A big challenge concerning the efficiency of the monetary policy is the credibilityof the ESCB.  Besides our lack of empirical evidence on the Europe-wide transmissionmechanism, we have no evidence on the behaviour of the ECB, i.e. the ECB has no track recordof its own.  Fortunately however, the ECB need not be built up from scratch.  First, it will inheritcredibility from the present NCBs, which have all conducted monetary policies aimed at pricestability and convergence in accord with the principles of the Maastricht Treaty.  Secondly, itshigh degree of independence will give the ECB/ESCB a certain amount of institutionalcredibility right from the outset.Recently, we have heard many voices, among political decision-makers, on theone hand, and academic researchers, on the other, who have emphasized the necessity of theaccountability and transparency of the ECB.Central banks and central bankers have since the onset of liberalizationunderstood that one essential ingredient of monetary policymaking is openness.  The morecarefully the central bank explains its thinking to the financial markets, the more readily themarkets’ reactions to monetary policy measures can be predicted.  That is to say, openness easesthe conduct of monetary policy and strengthens its impact.The role of national central banks in accountability and in promoting transparencywithin the ESCB will be that of communicator to national decision-makers, labour marketparticipants and the general public regarding the analyses and views of the ECB, but alsospecifically regarding the domestic monetary policy transmission mechanism.And the national central bank will need to continue analysing and forecasting itscountry’s inflation path in the regime of the single monetary policy and, on this basis, present itsoutlook on possible national imbalances and national needs for corrective measures via othersegments of economic policy, particularly fiscal policy.*       *       *
- 3 -BIS Review   35/1998˝The single monetary policy will of course bring demanding challenges toperipheral countries whose industrial structures, behavioural modes and business cycles havepreviously diverged from those of the core countries.As for Finland, thorough analyses have showed that external shocks have not beenmuch bigger for Finland than for other countries.  Instead, the domestic reactions in the economyand economic policies to these external shocks have greatly strengthened their effects.In the short run, inflation rates may differ somewhat between EMU-membercountries, but in the medium term harmonization is necessary.  The real costs of thisharmonization will be smaller when the common inflation target is more clearly credible andacknowledged and when all sectors are more clearly aiming at it also in the short run.  We haveseen clear improvement in this kind of awareness in Finland during the last few years, but ofcourse it will be acid-tested during the current economic boom.The corporate sector has used a substantial part of its profits from good years toimprove its capital structure.  It has built up a good buffer to be used in bad times and incovering losses without having to cut wages or reduce staff.  Since wage developments are themost important cost factor for these company buffers, their creation is directly connected withwage restraint during economic booms.The creation of buffers is just as important for the public sector as for thecorporate sector, particularly in the central government.  It is necessary to generate budgetsurpluses during economic booms, in order to have room for manoeuvre in bad times and toendure deficits in times of recession within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, andits 3 per cent of GDP limit.Responsibility for curbing the booms and softening the recessions will shift in theEMU world to a much greater extent than before to fiscal policy.  Here political decision-makingwill face strong pressures and challenges, both in Finland and in many other countries.On the whole, it is good to keep in mind that a monetary union country with goodcentral government finances will certainly have far more room for independent economic policymanoeuvring than will a non-monetary union country with a large central government deficit anddebt.
BIS Review   34/1998˝Mr. Meyer discusses the Federal Reserve and bank supervision andregulation   Remarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of theUS Federal Reserve System, presented before the “Spring 1998 Banking and Finance Lecture”,Widener University, Chester, Pennsylvania, on 16/4/98.It is a pleasure to continue what is becoming a tradition of Federal ReserveGovernors speaking at Widener University.When you think of the Federal Reserve, I am pretty sure that, in addition tospeakers at your university, most of you think of monetary policy, interest rates, internationalfinance, and the Fed’s macroeconomic responsibilities in all of these areas.  And, of course,macroeconomics lies at the core of what any central bank does.  However, for a variety ofreasons that I will discuss shortly, the Federal Reserve plays a major role in the supervision andregulation of banks.  Moreover, I believe that the connections between bank supervision andmacroeconomic policy are not only little understood, but also quite close.  No economy cangrow and provide an increasing standard of living for its citizens without also having a stable andefficient banking system.  Recent events in Asia are just the most current reminder of this truth.I will begin my remarks today by summarizing, very briefly, why and how banksare regulated in the United States.  Then I will outline the key trends that I see affecting thebanking and financial sector, and the challenges that these trends pose for bank supervisors.  Inthe final portion of my remarks, I will suggest some directions that I believe we should considerwhen thinking about how bank supervision should evolve over time.Bank Supervision and Regulation in the United StatesWhy do we supervise and regulate banks? The reasons are very straightforward.First and foremost, problems in only a small number of banks can, under the right circumstances,become problems in the entire banking and financial systems, with potentially major risks to thereal economy.  Traditionally, this meant protecting against a panic-driven flight to currencyotherwise known as a contagious series of bank runs, that caused a catastrophic decrease in themoney supply and the collapse of financial intermediation.  Today, largely because of depositinsurance and the Federal Reserve discount window, flights to currency are not a real concern inthe United States.  Rather, the stability of the electronic, large dollar payments system, whichmoves trillions of dollars a day and in which banks play a pivotal role, is critical in limitingsystemic risk.  Other potential pressure points, in all of which banks play a key role, include theliquidity of securities, financial derivatives, and interbank funding markets.Our very success at virtually eliminating the risk of bank runs in the United Stateshas led to a second major reason for supervising and regulating banks.  Deposit insurance, thediscount window, and Federal Reserve payment system guarantees - the very things that haveeliminated bank runs - create what is called a “safety net” for banks.  The existence of this safetynet gives the government a direct stake in keeping bank risks under control, just as a privateinsurance company has a stake in controlling the risks of policyholders.  Because depositinsurance and other parts of the safety net can never be fully and accurately priced, it isnecessary for us to monitor and sometimes to act to control bank risks in order to protect thepotential call on taxpayer funds.  An equally important, if unintended, consequence of the safetynet is that it creates what economists term “moral hazard” incentives for some banks to takeexcessive risks.  That is, the safety net creates incentives for banks to take larger risks thanotherwise, because the safety net, and potentially taxpayers, may absorb most of the losses if the
- 2 -BIS Review   34/1998˝gamble fails.  Such incentives are especially strong if the bank is close to failure since, at thispoint, bank stockholders have virtually nothing to lose.  Moral hazard is surely not much of aproblem today, when banks are healthy and bank capital ratios are high.  But back in the late1980s when over 200 banks were failing each year, moral hazard was a serious concern.All right, you may say, I understand why we supervise and regulate banks.  Butwhy do both the federal and state governments regulate banks, and why do three federalgovernment agencies have bank supervisory responsibilities? And, I hesitate to even ask, whythere are separate federal and state supervisors for thrift institutions and credit unions?  Just incase even the questions confused you, let me step back and outline the structure of the banksupervisory system in the United States.If you want to open a bank in the United States, you must get permission - that is,a charter - from a government agency.  There are two ways to do this: state governments charter“state banks,” and the federal government, through the Office of the Comptroller of theCurrency, charters “national banks.” Thus, each state has a state bank supervisor.  At the federallevel, things get a bit more complicated.  The Comptroller of the Currency supervises nationalbanks.  But since the FDIC insures certain deposits of both state and national banks, the FDICalso has supervisory authority over the state and national banks that it insures.  Moreover,national banks must be, and state banks may be, members of the Federal Reserve System.  Inaddition, most banks are organized in bank holding companies, and the Federal Reserve is theexclusive supervisor of bank holding companies.  Savings and loans and credit unions getseparate charters, and each has its own state or federal supervisor.In reality, the supervisory system is not quite as complex as it sounds, because,believe it or not, both statutes and agreements among supervisors divide up supervisory authorityso that regulatory overlap is, to a significant degree, minimized.  This division of labor involvesthe allocation of primary federal regulator to the Federal Reserve for state member banks, to theOCC for national banks, and to the FDIC for insured state non-member banks.  In addition, thecoordination among the federal regulators in the interest of consistent treatment of banks isfacilitated by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFEIC).  Still, despite thedivision of labor and the coordination through the FFEIC, the U.S.  system is rather complicated.Why do we have such a “Balkanized” structure of bank chartering and supervisionand regulation?  In large part, it is not so much by design as it is the result of reacting to manyindividual problems.  But I believe that there is at least one systematic factor -  the long-standingdesire of many Americans for a decentralized banking system.  An important theme in Americanpolitical philosophy has been distrust of concentrations of power, especially concentrations offinancial power.  Thus, from the start of our republic individual states insisted on being able tocharter their own banks, and were suspicious of the federal government’s efforts to do so.  It wasnot until the trauma of the Civil War that Congress passed a National Bank Act that allowed forextensive federal chartering and supervision of banks.Even after passage of the National Bank Act, virtually all banks were severelyrestricted in their ability to operate across state lines.  Indeed, until passage of the McFadden Actin 1927 national banks could only have one office.  While this restriction was relaxed in 1933,national banks and state banks that were members of the Fed were prohibited from branchingoutside of their home state.  Restrictions on interstate banking were viewed as important formaintaining a “dual” banking system in which both federal and state governments could charterbanks, and in which no one bank, or group of banks, could gain too much power.  Restrictions oninterstate banking only began to be dismantled within the last two decades, and were pretty much
- 3 -BIS Review   34/1998˝entirely gone by the end of 1997.  However, concerns about preserving a viable dual bankingsystem are still very much alive.Today, bank supervision and regulation focus on three primary areas of publicpolicy concern.  Safety and soundness supervision attempts to ensure that banks are managedprudently and in ways that maintain the stability of the banking system.  Enforcement of theantitrust laws in banking seeks to foster open and competitive markets that provide high qualitybanking services at minimum prices.  Consumer protection laws and the CommunityReinvestment Act are aimed at making sure consumers are fully informed about the most criticalcharacteristics of banking products and services, and that banks meet the financial services needsof their local communities, with particular attention to the needs of low and moderate incomeneighborhoods.  Congress has required the Federal Reserve to play an active role in all of theseareas.The fact that the Federal Reserve has responsibilities in all of these areas issometimes strongly questioned.  There has been more than one proposal over the years toremove the Fed from bank supervision and regulation.  I must confess that sometimes when I aminvolved in a complicated supervision issue, I am tempted to feel that someone else should do it.But in my saner and more reflective moments, I remain convinced that removing the Fed frombank supervision and regulation would be a serious mistake.  Let me try to explain why.The central bank, in my experience, needs direct, hands-on involvement in thesupervision and regulation of a broad cross-section of banks in order to carry out the Fed’s coreresponsibilities of conducting monetary policy, ensuring the stability of the financial system,acting as the lender of last resort, protecting the payments system, and managing a financialcrisis.  Meeting all of these responsibilities is not just an academic exercise, it requires practicalknowledge of financial institutions and markets, knowledge that comes with being deeplyinvolved in supervising individual banking organizations.  Without such involvement, theFederal Reserve would be much less able to maintain both its practical knowledge of bankingand other financial markets, and the influence and authority necessary for macroeconomic policyand crisis management.  Ivory towers are great for universities, but they are not desirable forcentral banks.While our supervisory responsibilities make us a better macroeconomicpolicymaker, I believe that our macroeconomic policy responsibilities make us a better banksupervisor.  In the course of designing and implementing our supervisory policies, we mustweigh safety and soundness concerns against the potentially adverse effects on the economy ofexcessively rigid regulations.  As Chairman Greenspan has observed, the optimal rate of bankfailure is not zero.  Banks must be allowed to perform their economic functions of measuring,accepting, and managing risk.  Taking and managing risk mean that sometimes risk will havecosts, including failure.  In my judgement, the central bank is in a unique position to balance thecomplex and sometimes conflicting objectives of financial stability and a growing economy.The Fed is less likely to engage in an unnecessarily restrictive or, for that matter, excessivelyloose, supervisory policy than is an agency focused either solely on bank safety and soundness orsolely on growth.  Finally, the U.S. central bank, because of its extensive and well-establishedrelationships with foreign central banks is ideally positioned to engage in coordinated action inmanaging international financial crises and in supervising institutions that have a substantialinternational presence.  The on-going crisis in Asian financial markets is our most recentexample of the need for such coordination of supervision.
- 4 -BIS Review   34/1998˝The Federal Reserve is the primary bank regulator of only 5 of the largest25 banks, the large, complex and internationally active banks that are the major sources ofsystemic risk.  The Federal Reserve is able, nevertheless, to maintain a flow of information aboutthe risk profiles and risk management practices of all large banking organizations through itsresponsibilities as exclusive supervisor of all bank holding companies.  It is for this reason thatthe Federal Reserve places such a great emphasis on maintaining its role as supervisor of bankholding companies.Key Trends Challenging Bank SupervisorsLet me turn now to a discussion of the key trends in banking and financialmarkets that are challenging bank supervisors.  Surely the most profound force that has beentransforming the financial, and other sectors of our economy, is the rapid growth of computerand telecommunications technology.  In finance, a critical and complementary force has been thedevelopment of intellectual “technologies” that enable financial engineers to separate risk into itsvarious components, and price each component in an economically rational way.  Indeed, NobelPrizes have been awarded for some of these discoveries.Implementation of financial engineering strategies typically requires massiveamounts of cheap data processing; and the cheap data processing would not be useful without theformulas required to compute prices.  The combination of the two has led to a virtual explosionin the number and types of financial instruments.  Key examples include virtually all types offinancial derivatives, such as interest rate and currency swaps and, more recently, creditderivatives.  Asset-backed securities, from mortgage-backed securities to credit card receivablesto collateralized loan obligations, provide additional examples of what can result from themixing of technological and intellectual innovation.  Such products have lowered the cost andbroadened the scope of financial services, making it possible for borrowers and lenders totransact directly with each other, for a wide range of financial products to be tailored for veryspecific purposes, and for financial risk to be managed in ever more sophisticated ways.Financial innovation has been the driving force behind a second major trend inbanking - the blurring of distinctions among what were, traditionally, very distinct forms offinancial firms.  One of the first such innovations, with which we are all now very familiar, wasmoney market mutual funds.  Money market mutual funds took off in the late 1970s as marketinterest rates rose above rates that banks were allowed to pay on deposits.  Eventually the entiresystem of interest rate controls, known as Federal Reserve Regulation Q, was dismantled bymarket realities and then, as a result, by the law.  In the 1980s, banks began to challenge whetherthe Glass-Steagall Act prohibited combinations of commercial and investment banking.  Today,both the regulators and the courts agree that Glass-Steagall does not imply a total prohibition,and bank supervisors have allowed a substantial blending of commercial and investment bankingin the form of so-called Section 20 subsidiaries of bank holding companies.  More recently,traditional separations of banking and insurance sales have also begun to fall, with support fromthe supervisors and the courts.A major result of the continued blurring of distinctions among commercialbanking, investment banking, and insurance is a tremendous increase in competition in marketsfor many financial services.  Greatly intensified competition has also led to increasing pressurefor revisions to many of the banking laws and regulations, such as the Glass-Steagall Act, that,despite some successful efforts at relaxing them, continue to exert outdated and costly restraintson the banking and financial system.  However, the issues involved are often complex and highly
- 5 -BIS Review   34/1998˝political, and so far efforts to achieve “financial modernization” have been more piecemeal thanI would desire.Nevertheless, deregulation has been a major force for change in the banking andfinancial services industries.  Two decades ago we still had Regulation Q, the Glass-Steagall Actwas widely viewed as requiring a virtual prohibition of combinations of commercial andinvestment banking, and interstate banking and branching were barely fantasies even at the statelevel, let alone applications for combinations of insurance and banking.  Just a few days ago, theHouse of Representatives almost voted on a massive re-write of the laws on permissible bankholding company activities and is now scheduled to consider the issue early next month.  It isdifficult to predict the outcome of that bill, and I will not.  But I will note that the pressures ofmarket developments for changes in the rules set up during the Great Depression are immense.If Congress does not act, loopholes and regulatory changes will continue to be exploited - withor without bank participation.  The forces of technology and globalization will deregulate in oneway or another.  I and my colleagues would prefer that the Congress would guide those changesin the public interest, but legislative deadlock will not do the job because the status quo will nothold.The fourth major force transforming the banking landscape is the globalization ofbanking and financial markets.  Indeed, globalization has been reshaping not only the financial,but also the real economy for at least the last three decades.  The interactions of developments inboth the financial and real economies have expanded cross-border asset holdings, trading, andcredit flows.  In response, financial intermediaries, including banks and securities firms, haveincreased their cross-border operations.  Once again, a critical result of this rapid evolution hasbeen a substantial increase in competition both at home and abroad.  Today, for example, almost40 percent of the U.S.  domestic commercial and industrial bank loan market is accounted for byforeign-owned banks.The final significant trend I will highlight is the on-going consolidation of theU.S.  banking industry.  I think that it is fair to say that the American banking system is currentlyin the midst of the most significant consolidation in its history.  As I mentioned earlier, in the lasttwo decades nearly all of the traditional barriers to geographic expansion of U.S.  banks havecrumbled.  While the states took the lead in eliminating these barriers beginning in the late1970s, the final step was taken by the federal government with passage of the Riegle-Neal Act in1994.  Under this Act, virtually full interstate branch banking became possible in June 1997.A few facts will perhaps give you a feel for the profound changes occurring in thestructure of the U.S.  banking system.  In 1980 there were about 14,400 banks in the U.S.organized into about 12,300 banking organizations.  By the end of 1997, the number of bankshad fallen to just under 9,100, and the number of banking organizations to not quite 7,200.  This42 percent decline in the number of banking organizations was due in part, but only in part, tothe large number of bank failures in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  A more important factorwas mergers among healthy banks.  Since the early 1980s, it has not been unusual to see 400 ormore mergers among healthy banks each year.While mergers have occurred, and continue to occur, among banks of all sizes, Iwould emphasize three aspects of the current bank merger movement.  First is the high incidenceof “mega mergers,” or mergers among very large banking organizations.  Several mergers of thelast few years have been either the largest at the time, or among the largest bank mergers in U.S.history.  Examples include the combining of Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank, Wells Fargoand First Interstate, NationsBank and Barnett, and, most recently, First Union and CoreStates.
- 6 -BIS Review   34/1998˝Second, despite all of the merger activity, a large number of medium to small banks remain inthe United States.  Moreover, by most measures of performance these small banks are more thana match for their larger brethren for many bank products and services.  Indeed, when a megamerger is announced it is not uncommon to read in the press how small banks in the affectedmarkets are licking their chops at the business opportunities created thereby.  Research seems tosupport their optimism.  Lastly, while the overall number of banking organizations has fallensince 1980, this does not mean that new, or de novo, entry has not occurred.  From 1980 through1997 some 3,600 new banks were formed in the United States.  My bottom line?  TheU.S. banking structure is highly dynamic, is adjusting to a variety of forces, and defies easygeneralizations.The current wave of bank mergers has led to a substantial increase in bankconcentration at the national level.  For example, the percentage of banking assets controlled bythe top 10 banking organizations rose from about 22 percent in 1980 to 34 percent in 1997.  Thepercentage held by the top 25 increased from 33 to 53 percent.Are these increases in national concentration a public policy concern?  In myview, the answer to this question is “no,” at least at this time, because virtually all the evidencewe have strongly suggests that competition problems almost always arise in banking at the locallevel.  That is, to the extent that banks are able to exert market power, the exercise of such powertends to occur in retail markets that are relatively narrow in geographic scope, and for a fairlywell-defined set of customers, usually households and small businesses.However, a special influence on local market competition may develop as bankconsolidation and interstate branching continue, resulting in the largest banks competing witheach other in an increasing number of local markets.  Such widespread competitive contacts maycause these firms to temper their competitive behavior in individual markets in recognition of thepotential for responses by their rivals in other common markets and in recognition of theirwidespread mutual interests.So, what has happened to banking concentration in local markets since 1980?The answer is, “not much”.  For example, the average three-bank deposit concentration ratio inMetropolitan Statistical Areas, a common measure of local urban markets, hovered between65 and 68 percent between 1980 and 1997.  Concentration measures for rural counties showsimilar results, with the average three-bank concentration ratio remaining at about 89 percentthroughout the period.  Other measures of local market concentration show similar results forboth urban and rural areas.The stability of local market concentration in the face of such a largeconsolidation of the banking industry is remarkable.  While there is no single reason for thisstability, I would point to two factors as being of particular importance.  Many mergers,including some mergers of very large banks, involve institutions that do not compete in the samelocal markets.  In such cases, local market concentration is obviously not affected.  Where themerging banks do compete in the same local markets, enforcement of the antitrust laws has beenan important factor limiting the growth of local market concentration.  Moreover, antitrustenforcement has no doubt deterred some highly anti-competitive mergers from even beingproposed.Why have banks been consolidating in number and expanding in size andgeography?  Again, no one answer is appropriate, and each merger is somewhat unique andreflects more than one factor.  In recent years many banks have been responding to the removal
- 7 -BIS Review   34/1998˝of barriers to interstate banking and branching that restricted entry and divided markets.  In suchcases, the twin desires to diversify risk geographically and to expand sources of “core” depositshave surely been important motivating forces.  Moreover, geographic barriers had constrainednatural market developments; in an important sense their removal has simply allowed the marketto adjust to a new economic equilibrium from a previously legally mandated equilibrium.Beyond such adjustments, scale economies are mentioned frequently by bankersas a causal factor in bank consolidation, although academic research has not tended to find muchevidence of overall economies of scale in banking.  Still, economies of scale certainly exist forsome bank operations, such as many back office functions.  In addition, some lines of business,such as securities underwriting and market making, require large levels of activity to be viable.Increased competitive pressures caused by rapid technological change and the resulting blurringof distinctions between banks and other types of financial firms, lower barriers to entry due toderegulation, and increased globalization are also important factors.  For example, greatercompetition forces inefficient banks to become more efficient, accept lower profits, close upshop, or - in order to exit a market in which they cannot survive - merge with another bank.Other possible motives for mergers include the simple desire to achieve market power, or effortsby management to build empires and enhance compensation.  Some mergers probably occur asan effort to prevent the acquiring bank from itself being acquired, or, alternatively, to enhance abank’s attractiveness to other buyers.No matter why banks are merging, the bottom line is that the United States is wellon its way to developing a truly national banking structure for the first time in its history.  Weare not quite there yet, but I do not think it will take too many more years.  What will thisstructure look like? Well, that is obviously a very complex question, the answer to whichinvolves forecasting years in advance.  And I can tell you from many years of experience,forecasting the economy even one year in advance is a very risky and humbling business.  Thus,any prognostications about future banking structure should be taken with very many grains ofsalt.Still, some economists at the Fed have tried to look through this dark glass to seethe future United States banking structure.  For all of the reasons I have discussed, it seemsreasonable to expect a continued high level of merger activity for the foreseeable future.  Verylarge mergers will not be uncommon.  Studies based on historical experience suggest that inaround a decade there will likely be about 3,000 to 4,000 banking organizations, down fromabout 7,000 today.  Although the top 10 or so banking organizations will almost certainlyaccount for a larger share of U.S. banking assets than they do today, the overall size distributionof banks will probably remain about the same.  That is, there will likely be a few very largeorganizations, and an increasing number of firms as we move down the size scale.  Importantly,a large number of small banks is expected to remain.Future Directions in Bank SupervisionWhat do all of these changes mean for how we supervise and regulate banks?Analysis of competitionClearly, as the banking industry consolidates we need to maintain competitivemarkets.  Competitive markets are our best assurance that consumers receive the highest qualityproducts at the lowest possible prices.  As I discussed earlier, there are many reasons to believethat in recent years competition has increased greatly in markets for a large number of financial
- 8 -BIS Review   34/1998˝products and services.  This is true for many products purchased in local, regional and nationalmarkets.  However, in some cases we still observe potential competitive problems with aproposed bank merger.  Fortunately, the antitrust laws, as written into the banking statutes, giveus the means to maintain competition in such situations.  These laws require that the Boardapprove only those mergers that are not expected to substantially harm competition.  Whenimplementing this policy, the Board may require changes to a merger proposal, and may evendeny an application, if the merger or acquisition would result in a highly concentrated market, oran excessively large increase in concentration.  As I indicated a few minutes ago, the focus ofour analysis is normally on local retail markets for banking products and services.Over the past year or so, quite a few applicants have pushed very hard at theBoard’s frontier for approving merger applications.  Some applicants appear to have held theview that almost any merger could be approved, even if it violated the screening guidelines thatboth the Federal Reserve and the Department of Justice use to decide which mergers requireclose examination.In response, the Board has occasionally felt compelled to remind applicants,especially those proposing a merger that would affect a large number of local markets, thatsubstantial changes in market concentrations will receive careful review.  Moreover, whenmergers would exceed the screening guidelines, “mitigating” factors must be present.  Bymitigating factors I mean conditions that tend to create a more competitive market than issuggested by market concentration alone.  These would include characteristics that make amarket highly attractive for new entry, or situations where nonbank providers of financialservices are unusually strong.  The greater the deviation from the screening guidelines, the morepowerful and convincing the mitigating factors must be.I have been particularly concerned with cases where a large number of localmarkets are affected.  In such cases, even if the adverse effect is fairly small in each of severallocal markets, it seems to me that the cumulative, or total, adverse effect might be significant.Thus, when a large number of markets are affected adversely, I believe that we should beespecially careful to assure ourselves that there are substantial mitigating factors.In addition, when a merger would cause a large change in concentration in amarket that is, or becomes, highly concentrated, I think we need to give special attention to theimpact on competition.  The reason for this is that I think when the change in concentration islarge, the effect on interfirm relationships, market dynamics and thus competition is likely to bemore pronounced, other things equal.Assessing safety and soundnessTechnological change, financial innovation, the acquisition of new powers bybanking organizations, the increasing geographic scope of banks, and the globalization offinancial markets all challenge our ability to examine and assess the safety and soundness ofindividual banking firms.  One way that examiners are adapting to this changed world is to focusmuch of their attention on the information and risk management systems of banks.  The keyquestion they ask is: How effectively are these systems measuring and controlling aninstitution’s rapidly changing risk profile?  The emphasis on risk management is most critical atour largest, most sophisticated, and most internationally active banks.  Many of these banks useadvanced economic and statistical models to evaluate their market and credit risks.  Thesemodels are used for a variety of purposes, including allocating capital on a risk adjusted basisand pricing loans and credit guarantees.
- 9 -BIS Review   34/1998˝The development by some banks of increasingly accurate models for measuring,managing, and pricing risk has called into question the continuing usefulness of one of thefoundations of bank supervision - the so-called risk-based capital standards, or the Basle Accord.The Basle Accord capital standards were adopted in 1988 by most of the world’s industrializednations in an effort to encourage stronger capital at riskier banks, to include off-balance sheetexposures in the assessment of capital adequacy, and to establish more consistent capitalstandards across nations.  The Accord was a major advance in 1988, and has proved to be veryuseful since then.  But in recent years calls for reform have begun to grow.  I will outline brieflyone of the key problems we are currently facing with the Basle Accord.The Basle Accord capital standards divide bank on- and off-balance sheet assetsinto four risk buckets, and then apply a different capital weight to each bucket.  These weightsincrease roughly with the riskiness of the assets in a given bucket.  The basic idea is that morecapital should be required to be held against riskier assets.  However, the relationship is rough.Perhaps most troublesome, the same risk weight is applied to all loans.  Thus, for example, aloan to a very risky “junk bond” company gets the same weight as a loan to a “triple A” ratedfirm.While the Accord has the virtue of being relatively easy to administer and enforce,it also clearly gives banks an incentive to find ways to avoid the regulatory capital standard forloans that their internal models say need less capital than is required by the Basle Accord.Conversely, banks should want to keep loans which their models say require more capital thandoes the Basle standard.  And, guess what, banks have been doing just that.  This so-called“regulatory arbitrage” may not be all bad, but it surely causes some serious problems as well.For one thing, it makes reported capital ratios - a key measure of bank soundness used bysupervisors and investors - less meaningful for government supervisors and private analysts.Finding ways around this problem is a high priority at the Federal Reserve.The arbitraging of regulatory capital requirements is but one of a host of similarconflicts between banks and bank supervisory rules and regulations.  Indeed, one can view muchof the long history of bank supervision and regulation as something of a battle betweensupervisors who want to deter excessive risk taking and banks who seek ways around sometimesinefficient, or just plain uneconomic, regulations.  This long history leads me to seek supervisorystrategies that are, in the economist’s jargon, incentive compatible.  By incentive compatible, Imean supervisory policies and procedures that give banks strong internal incentives to managetheir risks prudently and minimize the exploitation of moral hazard.  Put differently, we need todesign strategies that encourage banks, in their own self-interest, to work with us, not against us.One promising possibility for incentive compatible regulation is what has come tobe called the “pre-commitment” approach to bank capital standards.  The basic idea is to allowthe bank to pre-commit to the supervisor its capital allocation for risks in the bank’s tradingaccount - those assets held as part of the bank’s securities dealing activities.  If the bank’s lossesfor that portion of its total risk exceed the pre-committed amount of capital over some fixed timeperiod, the bank would pay a penalty, or perhaps have to disclose to the market its violation of itspre-commitment.  Such an approach would utilize the bank’s own internal models and riskmanagement procedures to achieve supervisory goals, and give the bank a strong incentive toimprove its risk management, since by doing so it could lower its pre-committed capitalrequirement and not increase the risk of paying a penalty.
- 10 -BIS Review   34/1998˝There are both benefits and difficulties with the approach that we are discussingwith other supervisors both in the U.S. and abroad.  It may well be that some form of anincentive compatible strategy might be linked with a regulatory minimum capital as amodification to the Basle standard for market risk.  Such a modification would be to the existingstandard that, it is important to emphasize, already uses a bank’s internal risk managementmodels to help achieve supervisory goals.  U.S. bank supervisors began last year to require large,internationally active American banks to meet the Basle Accord’s capital requirements formarket risk in trading accounts using their own internal models, with appropriate review andmonitoring by supervisors.As I suggested at the beginning of my remarks, the possibility of a systemicfailure of the banking system, and the moral hazard incentives created by the safety net that isdesigned to contain systemic risk, require some government supervision of banks.  But weshould always remember that the first line of defense against excessive risk-taking by banks isthe market itself.  Market discipline can be, and often is, highly effective at deterring excessiverisk.  Indeed, a primary goal of many of the bank regulatory reforms implemented in the wake ofthe banking and thrift crises of the 1980s and early 1990s was either to increase marketdiscipline or to make supervisors behave more like the market would behave.  Market disciplinewas increased by raising capital standards, thus giving the owners of the firm a greater incentiveto control risk, and by mandating greater public disclosure by a bank of its financial condition.Prompt closure rules that required supervisors to impose increasingly severe penalties on a bankas its financial condition deteriorated, and the adoption of risk-based deposit insurance premiumsare examples of encouraging supervisors to act like the market.The reforms of the early 1990s were a good start.  But I believe that there maywell be more that we can do here.  Such comments may sound out of place today.  Times aregood, and almost everyone seems quite satisfied with the current deposit insurance system.  Butgood times may be precisely when we should develop ideas for an even more effective system.The crucible of a crisis is not always the best time to think up reforms - witness the error wemade in passing the Glass-Steagall Act, an error we have yet to correct after 65 years!  Indeed, itis in part for this very reason that the Board continues to urge Congress to pass financialmodernization legislation.  So, in the spirit of being forward looking, let me attempt to give youthe flavor of what I am thinking about.It may, for example, be possible to increase market discipline by requiring large,internationally active banks to issue a minimum amount of certain types of uninsuredsubordinated debt to the public.  Holders of such debt would have a strong incentive to requirethe bank to manage its risk prudently.  In addition, it would be highly desirable if this debt weretraded on the open market, thereby providing a clear signal of the market’s evaluation of thebank’s financial condition.  Another possibility is further reforms of the deposit insurancesystem.  For example, most observers believe that the current risk-based premiums do notadequately reflect risk differences between banks, in part because current law limits the growthof deposit insurance reserves.  Loosening this constraint might allow for more accurate pricingof deposit insurance.Dealing with globalizationThe final area I will highlight today is a potentially critical implication offinancial globalization for the supervision of large, internationally active banking organizations.In this world of financial globalization, complexity, and rapid telecommunications, it isextremely important that all of the large banking institutions in the developed nations strive to
- 11 -BIS Review   34/1998˝keep up with the state-of-art in risk measurement and management.  If a group of importantinstitutions in only one or two countries fails to keep pace, all banking systems are placed atincreased risk.  This risk, moreover, is not simply that a large bank failure in one country cancause counter-party failures in other nations.  Systematic underestimation of credit and otherrisks can result in underpricing those risks, which can be damaging to all players, not only to thebanks making the risk measurement errors.Fortunately, the free market dissemination of best practices appears to befunctioning fairly well.  No single developed nation has a monopoly on best practice riskmeasurement and management, if innovations in complex financial products are any indication.For example, European banks were market leaders in introducing collateralized loan obligations.In the field of asset-backed commercial paper facilities, U.S. banks were the initiators, butEuropean and Japanese institutions are now significant players.  And, the ubiquitous consultingfirms around the world can be relied upon to spread the word on advances in risk managementtechniques.Still, individual banks in each country, not just the U.S., must face the properincentives to keep up with an ever changing technology.  Lax supervisory practices - or, worse,government support of banks with poor risk practices - do not provide proper incentives.  Thus,each supervisory authority in each developed nation must be vigilant that the disparities betweenthe world’s best practice institutions and those large banks inside the best practices frontier donot grow wider.  Indeed, I believe that an important function of supervisors is to act assomething of a clearinghouse for best practices.  Internationally, supervisors from the majorindustrialized nations have been performing this function more and more through their jointefforts.  In the United States, the clearinghouse function is an important component of the on-siteexamination.ConclusionIn conclusion, I hope that my remarks have helped you to better understand theforces affecting our banking and financial system.  Equally important, I hope that I have givenyou a good feel for the challenges these forces have created for bank supervision, how we aremeeting these challenges today, how we may deal with them in the future, and the role of theFederal Reserve in these complex, dynamic, and exciting issues.  All of us have a very big stakein the continued health, stability, and competitiveness of our banking system.  I encourage eachof you to think deeply about what is required to achieve these goals.˝
BIS Review   55/1998Bank of Japan’s June report of recent economic and financial developments inJapan   BANK OF JAPAN, COMMUNICATION, 16/6/98.The Bank’s View1Final demand remains weak and production continues to decline in Japan. As aconsequence, employment and income conditions have recently shown a significant deterioration.With respect to final demand, public-sector investment seems to have bottomed out.Growth in net exports, however, has virtually peaked out as exports to other Asian countriesdeclined. Business fixed investment continues to be on the decline. Private consumption shows littlesign of recovery, although the deterioration has slowed. Housing investment has decreased further.Against the background of weak final demand, inventories have accumulated further and industrialproduction continues to decrease. As a result, corporate profits have worsened, and employment andincome conditions have deteriorated evidently, as seen recently in the rapid rise of theunemployment rate.As for the outlook of the economy, the implementation of the supplementary budgetfor fiscal 1998 is assumed to boost demand through additional public works and special incometax-reduction, and cease the negative interactions of production, income, and expenditure. However,such positive effects of the fiscal policy may be weakened, if the ongoing rapid deterioration inemployment and income conditions further dampens the overall economic activities. Therefore, theoverall economic activities, including corporate and household confidence, should be carefullymonitored.With regard to prices, wholesale prices continue to fall and consumer prices(excluding the effects of institutional changes) have declined slightly below the previous year’slevel. With respect to the factors affecting the outlook, the downward pressure on domestic pricesinduced by the decline in import prices including overseas commodity prices has already weakened.Also, the expansion in the output gap in the economy is expected to slow in line with theimplementation of the economic stimulus package. However, reflecting the present high inventorylevel and the relatively large output gap, prices are likely to be weak for some time. There may alsobe additional downward pressures if domestic demand weakens further.As for financial markets, rates on term instruments (for both spots and futures) havebeen generally steady in the money markets. Yields on long-term government bonds recordedhistorical lows from late April to early June with the releases of weak economic indicators, and arerecently showing a slight turnaround. Stock prices have been slightly declining, indicating the weakmarket sentiment on the economy.Market concern towards credit risk remains strong, and the yield differential betweenbonds issued by the private sector and those by the government has been significant since the end oflast year.With respect to monetary aggregates, growth in M2+CDs has been slowing andprivate bank lending remains sluggish. This reveals the fall in credit demand following stagnanteconomic conditions as well as the continued cautious lending attitudes of private banks.                                                     1 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the MonetaryPolicy Meeting held on June 12, as the basis of monetary policy decisions.

BIS Review   55/1998Mr. Meyer discusses issues and trends in bank regulatory policy and financialmodernization in the United States   Remarks by Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board ofGovernors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Bank Administration Institute, Finance andAccounting Management Conference held in Washington, DC on 9/6/98.It is a pleasure to be here today, and I thank the Bank Administration Institute forinviting me to be a part of your discussions.When people think of the Federal Reserve, I am pretty sure that most Americansthink of monetary policy, interest rates, international finance, and the Fed’s macroeconomicresponsibilities in all of these areas. And, of course, macroeconomics lies at the core of what anycentral bank does. However, as everyone at this conference appreciates, another major function ofthe Federal Reserve is the supervision and regulation of banks and bank holding companies. I wouldlike to use my time this afternoon to discuss some key aspects of this side of the Fed’s activities.I will begin by outlining, very briefly, some of the key trends affecting the bankingand financial sector. I will then focus on what I see as the most important challenges that thesetrends pose for bank supervisors, and suggest some directions that I believe we should consider whenthinking about how bank supervision should evolve over time. Lastly, I will discuss currentlegislative efforts to modernize our banking system.Key Trends Challenging Bank SupervisorsSurely the most profound force transforming the financial, and for that matter othersectors of our economy, is the rapid growth of computer and telecommunications technology. Infinance, a critical and complementary force is the development of intellectual “technologies” thatenable financial engineers to separate risk into its various components, and price each component inan economically rational way.Implementation of financial engineering strategies typically requires massiveamounts of cheap data processing; and the cheap data processing would not be useful without theformulas required to compute prices. The combination of the two has led to a virtual explosion in thenumber and types of financial instruments. Such products have lowered the cost and broadened thescope of financial services, making it possible for borrowers and lenders to transact directly witheach other, for a wide range of financial products to be tailored for very specific purposes, and forfinancial risk to be managed in ever more sophisticated ways.Financial innovation has been the driving force behind a second major trend inbanking -- the blurring of distinctions among what were, traditionally, very distinct forms offinancial firms. One of the first such innovations, with which we are all now very familiar, wasmoney market mutual funds. In the 1980s, banks began to challenge whether the Glass-Steagall Actprohibited combinations of commercial and investment banking. Today, both the regulators and thecourts agree that Glass-Steagall does not imply a total prohibition. More recently, traditionalseparations of banking and insurance sales have also begun to fall, with support from the supervisorsand the courts.A major result of the continued blurring of distinctions among commercial banking,investment banking, and insurance is a tremendous increase in competition for many financialservices. Greatly intensified competition has also led to increasing pressure for revisions to many ofthe banking laws and regulations that, despite some successful efforts at relaxation or repeal,continue to exert outdated and costly restraints on the banking and financial system.
- 2 -BIS Review   55/1998Indeed, despite its often frustratingly slow pace, there seems little doubt thatderegulation has been a major force for change in the banking and financial services industries. Twodecades ago we still had Regulation Q, the Glass-Steagall Act was widely viewed as requiring avirtual prohibition of combinations of commercial and investment banking, and interstate bankingand branching, let alone combinations of banking and insurance, were barely fantasies even at thestate level.The fourth major force transforming the banking landscape is the globalization notonly of banking and financial markets, but also of the real economy. The interactions ofdevelopments in both the financial and real economies have expanded cross-border asset holdings,trading, and credit flows. In response, financial intermediaries, including banks and securities firms,have increased their cross-border operations. Once again, a critical result of this rapid evolution hasbeen a substantial increase in competition both at home and abroad.The final significant trend I will highlight is the on-going consolidation of the U.S.banking industry. I think that it is fair to say that the American banking system is currently in themidst of the most significant consolidation in its history. In 1980 there were about 14,400 banks inthe U.S. organized into about 12,300 banking organizations. By the end of 1997, the number ofbanks had fallen to just under 9,100, and the number of banking organizations to not quite 7,200.This 42 percent decline in the number of banking organizations was due in part, but only in part, tothe large number of bank failures in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A more important factor wasmergers among healthy banks. Since the early 1980s, it has not been unusual to see 400 or moremergers among healthy banks each year.While mergers have occurred, and continue to occur, among banks of all sizes, Iwould emphasize three aspects of the current bank merger movement. First is the high incidence of“megamergers”, or mergers among very large banking organizations. Several mergers of the last fewyears have been either the largest at the time, or among the largest bank mergers in U.S. history.And, of course, that trend continues.Second, despite all of the merger activity, a large number of medium to small banksremain in the United States. Moreover, by most measures of performance these small banks are morethan a match for their larger brethren for many bank products and services. When a megamerger isannounced it is not uncommon to read in the press how small banks in the affected markets arelooking to take advantage of the business opportunities created thereby. Research seems to supporttheir optimism.Lastly, while the overall number of banking organizations has fallen since 1980, thisdoes not mean that new, or de novo, entry has not occurred. From 1980 through 1997 some 3,600new banks were formed in the United States.In large part because of the continued viability of smaller banks, while the nationalconcentration of banking assets has increased substantially since 1980, measures of local marketbanking concentration have remained essentially unchanged. Indeed, the stability of local marketconcentration in the face of such a large consolidation of the banking industry is remarkable, andbodes well for the competitive vitality of local banking markets.While the reasons for bank mergers are varied, the bottom line is that the UnitedStates is well on its way to developing a truly national banking structure for the first time in itshistory. We are not quite there yet, but I do not think it will take too many more years.Future Directions in Bank Supervision
- 3 -BIS Review   55/1998What do all of these changes mean for how we supervise and regulate banks?Analysis of CompetitionClearly, as the banking industry consolidates we need to maintain competitivemarkets. Competitive markets are our best assurance that consumers receive the highest qualityproducts at the lowest possible prices. As I discussed earlier, there are many reasons to believe thatin recent years competition has increased greatly in markets for a large number of financial productsand services. This is true for many products purchased in local, regional and national markets.However, in some cases we still observe potential competitive problems with a proposed bankmerger. Fortunately, the antitrust laws, as written into the banking statutes, give us the means tomaintain competition in such situations. These laws require that the Board approve only thosemergers that are not expected to substantially harm competition.Over the past year or so, quite a few applicants have pushed very hard at the Board’sfrontier for approving merger applications. In response, the Board has occasionally felt compelled toremind applicants, especially those proposing a merger that would affect a large number of localmarkets, that substantial changes in market concentrations will receive careful review. Moreover,when mergers would exceed the screening guidelines, “mitigating” factors must be present. Bymitigating factors I mean conditions that tend to create a more competitive market than is suggestedby market concentration alone. The greater the deviation from the screening guidelines, the morepowerful and convincing the mitigating factors must be.I have personally been particularly concerned with cases where a large number oflocal markets are affected. In such cases, even if the adverse effect is fairly small in each of severallocal markets, it seems to me that the cumulative, or total, adverse effect might be significant. Whena large number of markets are affected adversely, I believe that we should be especially careful toassure ourselves that there are substantial mitigating factors. In addition, when a merger would causea large change in concentration in a market that is, or becomes, highly concentrated, I think we needto give special attention to the impact on competition.Assessing Safety and SoundnessTechnological change, financial innovation, the acquisition of new powers bybanking organizations, the increasing geographic scope of banks, and the globalization of financialmarkets all challenge our ability to examine and assess the safety and soundness of individualbanking firms. One way that examiners are adapting to this changed world is to focus much of theirattention on the information and risk management systems of banks. The key question they ask is:How effectively are these systems measuring and controlling an institution’s rapidly changing riskprofile? The emphasis on risk management is most critical at our largest, most sophisticated, andmost internationally active banks. Many of these banks use advanced economic and statisticalmodels to evaluate their market and credit risks. These models are used for a variety of purposes,including allocating capital on a risk adjusted basis and pricing loans and credit guarantees.The development by some banks of increasingly accurate models for measuring,managing, and pricing risk has called into question the continuing usefulness of one of thefoundations of bank supervision -- the so-called risk-based capital standards, or the Basle Accord.The Basle Accord capital standards were adopted in 1988 by most of the world’s industrializednations in an effort to encourage stronger capital at riskier banks, to include off-balance sheetexposures in the assessment of capital adequacy, and to establish more consistent capital standardsacross nations. The Accord was a major advance in 1988, and has proved to be very useful since
- 4 -BIS Review   55/1998then. But in recent years calls for reform have begun to grow. I will outline briefly one of the keyproblems we are currently facing with the Basle Accord.The Basle Accord capital standards divide bank on- and off-balance-sheet assets intofour risk buckets, and then apply a different capital weight to each bucket. These weights increaseroughly with the riskiness of the assets in a given bucket. However, the relationship is rough.Perhaps most troublesome, the same risk weight is applied to all loans. Thus, for example, a loan toa very risky “junk bond” company gets the same weight as a loan to a “triple A” rated firm.This aspect of the Accord clearly gives banks an incentive to find ways to avoid theregulatory capital standard for loans that their internal models say need less capital than is requiredby the Basle Accord. Conversely, banks should want to keep loans which their models say requiremore capital than does the Basle standard. And, guess what, banks have been doing just that. Thisso-called “regulatory arbitrage” may not be all bad, but it surely causes some serious problems aswell. For one thing, it makes reported capital ratios -- a key measure of bank soundness used bysupervisors and investors -- less meaningful for government supervisors and private analysts. Findingways around this problem is a high priority at the Federal Reserve.The arbitraging of regulatory capital requirements is but one of a host of similarconflicts between banks and bank supervisory rules and regulations. Indeed, one can view much ofthe long history of bank supervision and regulation as something of a contest between supervisorswho want to deter excessive risk taking and banks who seek ways around sometimes inefficient, orjust plain uneconomic, regulations. This long history leads me to seek supervisory strategies that are,in the economist’s jargon, incentive compatible. By incentive compatible, I mean supervisorypolicies and procedures that give banks strong internal incentives to manage their risks prudently andminimize the exploitation of moral hazard. Put differently, we need to design strategies thatencourage banks, in their own self-interest, to work with us, not against us.When designing supervisory policy, we should always remember that the first line ofdefense against excessive risk-taking by banks is the market itself. Market discipline can be, andoften is, highly effective at deterring excessive risk. Indeed, a primary goal of many of the bankregulatory reforms implemented in the wake of the banking and thrift crises of the 1980s and early1990s was either to increase market discipline or to make supervisors behave more like the marketwould behave. Market discipline was increased, for example, by raising capital standards and bymandating greater public disclosure by a bank of its financial condition. Prompt corrective actionrules that require supervisors to impose increasingly severe penalties on a bank as its financialcondition deteriorates, and the adoption of risk-based deposit insurance premiums are examples ofencouraging supervisors to act like the market.The reforms of the early 1990s were a good start. But I believe that there may well bemore that we can do. Such comments may sound out of place today. Times are good, and almosteveryone seems quite satisfied with the current deposit insurance system. But good times may beprecisely when we should develop ideas for an even more effective system. The crucible of a crisis isnot always the best time to think up reforms -- witness the error we made in passing the Glass-Steagall Act, an error we have yet to correct after 65 years! Indeed, it is in part for this very reasonthat the Board continues to urge Congress to pass financial modernization legislation. So, in thespirit of being forward looking, let me attempt to give you the flavor of one idea that seems worthconsidering.It may be possible to increase market discipline by requiring large, internationallyactive banks to issue a minimum amount of certain types of subordinated debt to the public. Anappealing aspect of this approach is that subordinated debt holders, so long as they are not bank
- 5 -BIS Review   55/1998“insiders,” face only downside risk, and thus their risk preferences are very close to those of theFDIC. Subordinated debt holders would therefore be expected to impose market discipline on thebank that is quite consistent with what bank supervisors are trying to do, including encouragingbanks to disclose more information about their financial condition. Observed risk premiums onsubordinated debt could perhaps be used to help the FDIC set more accurate risk-based depositinsurance premiums, and such debt would provide an extra cushion of protection for taxpayers. Anadditional benefit of having subordinated debt traded on the open market is that price movementswould provide a clear signal of the market’s evaluation of the bank’s financial condition that, even ifit were not used to help price deposit insurance, could serve as an early warning aid to supervisors.Subordinated debt is not, however, without its problems. For example, the riskpreferences of such creditors are aligned with those of the FDIC only when the bank is clearlysolvent. At or near insolvency, subordinated debt holders may be willing to “bet the bank” in orderto increase the chances that they will not suffer a loss. The fact that the bank closure decision is stillin the supervisor’s hands is another complicating factor. In addition, it is unclear just how deep andliquid a market in bank subordinated debt would be, although limiting any requirements to thelargest banks would ease this concern. For example, at the end of last year only one-half percent ofbanks with less than $50 million in assets issued subordinated debt, but 83 percent of banks withtotal assets of $10 billion or more did so. However, it appears that much of existing banksubordinated debt is held by the bank’s parent holding company, not independent third parties. Thus,the question of how deep and liquid a market might evolve remains. For these and other reasons, anoperationally feasible program for mandatory subordinated debt would require a considerableamount of careful thought. Still, in my judgment it is thought that might prove very worthwhile.The Need For Financial ModernizationTechnology and globalization are changing markets all over the world, but perhapsnone have been more affected than the financial markets. Yet in the United States much of our legalframework has essentially not changed since the 1930s. The resultant pressure on financialinstitutions to be able to compete has thus been reflected in the search for loopholes and in efforts byregulatory authorities to find ways within their charter to permit new activities. The process is notonly inefficient, but creates new inequities, institutions that may be producing unintended risks, andthe misallocation of resources. That is why my colleagues and I are such strong supporters of H.R.10, The Financial Modernization Act of 1998, which the House passed last month and the SenateBanking Committee will be discussing next week.This bill brings our financial institutions into the 21st century in a framework thatminimizes risks and inequities. The task it sets for itself is not easy. Each set of our financialinstitutions -- and their regulators -- have special privileges and advantages that they wish tomaintain and limits and restraints that they wish to shed. Balancing these realities results inprovisions in the bill that no one -- including me -- can say that they like completely. But thebalancing in H.R. 10 is, I think, the best that is possible; indeed, in many respects it is so balancedthat most adjustments to address the concerns of one set of institutions would probably eliminate thesupport of another set of institutions. What is critical, it seems to me, is that the bill not only does afine balancing job, but it is in the public interest, something that I am sorry to say that all toofrequently we lose sight of. Let me share with you the specific reasons why I think this is a bill thatdeserves support.First and foremost is that the bill would finally let financial institutions get into eachother’s businesses, and thus widen the scope and range over which institutions can compete for thepublic’s business. Mind you, this is not a statement that says financial supermarkets and/or largeinstitutions will be better or more successful than specialized and/or smaller institutions. But the
- 6 -BIS Review   55/1998benefit is that the public, not regulators, will decide which will prosper as competitors all bend theirefforts to serve the consumer.That is the bottom line. It’s the reason why there should be financial modernization.But the structure that the bill establishes is consistent both with efficient resource allocation and withminimizing risk to the stability of the economy and the taxpayer. Let’s take a closer look at thatstructure.The most critical element is that H.R. 10 would permit banks to conduct in their ownsubsidiaries (so-called operating subsidiaries or “op subs”) only the same activities that they mayalready conduct in the bank and financial agency activities, which by their nature require minimalfunding and create minimal risk. These limitations, it seems to me, are crucial for several reasons.Banks have a lower cost of funds than other financial entities because of the safety net -- the namewe give the collection of deposit insurance, access to the discount window, and access to thepayments system. This subsidy is provided by the government in order to buy systemic stability, butit has a cost: increased risk taking by banks, reduced market discipline, and consequently the needfor more onerous bank supervision in order to balance the resultant moral hazard. The last thing weshould want is to extend that subsidy over a wider range of activities, which is, I believe, exactlywhat would happen if bank op subs could engage in wider nonbank financial activities. Not onlywould that increase the moral hazard -- and the need for bank-like supervision -- but it would alsounbalance the competitive playing field between bank subs and independent firms engaging in thesame business, a strange result for legislation whose ultimate purpose is to increase the competitionfor financial services.The subsidy that is so integral to the op sub would surely induce banks and otherfinancial institutions to organize in a form that would maximize their use of that subsidy. Indeed,stockholders would have every reason to be critical of management that did not avail itself of theopportunity to raise low cost funds. The profits of bank subsidiaries would surely benefit the bankparent since GAAP accounting, economic and legal reality, and common sense all call forconsolidation. But losses, too, would consolidate into the bank parent and such losses would falldirectly on the safety net, and ultimately the taxpayer. These safety and soundness and safety netrisks ultimately would bring with them the need to regulate op subs the way banks are regulated,creating inefficiencies and reductions in innovation, let alone conflicts with functional regulators.The legislation I support would require that organizations that conduct both bankingand other financial businesses organize in a holding company form where the bank and the otheractivities are both subs of the holding company. Profits and losses of the business lines accrue to theholding company and thus do not directly benefit nor endanger the bank, the safety net, or thetaxpayer. The safety net subsidy is not directly available to the holding company affiliates andcompetition is thus more balanced. Moreover, traditional regulators like the SEC and the stateinsurance commissioners still regulate the entities engaged in nonbank activities as if they wereindependent firms. Functional regulation is desirable not only for competitive equity, but is apolitical necessity and a practical reality in the process of balancing that is required to movefinancial regulation. In principle, functional regulation could also be applied to op subs, but thesafety net, I submit, would soon create regulatory conflict with that structure.Importantly, the bill passed by the House would prohibit commercial affiliations withbanks. There is no doubt that it is becoming increasingly difficult to draw a bright line that separatesfinancial services from nonfinancial businesses; it will only become more difficult to do so. But, thetruth is that we are not sure enough of the implications of combining banking and commerce --potential conflicts of interest, concentration of power, and safety net and stability concerns -- tomove forward in this area. Better, I think, to digest financial reform before moving in an area that
- 7 -BIS Review   55/1998will be very difficult to reverse. The bill, by the way, would shut down new unitary thrifts that canaffiliate with non-financial firms, but grandfathers the rights of the over 700 existing unitary thriftholding companies to acquire or be acquired by commercial enterprises. I would hope the Senatewould instead freeze such activities in place until the banking and commerce issue is addresseddirectly; the fact that the House did not simply reinforces my point on how hard it is to reverse suchpowers once gained.Finally, I support H.R. 10 because the holding company framework would keep theFederal Reserve -- the central bank of the United States -- as the umbrella supervisor. I believe thatthe Fed has an important role to play in banking supervision in order to carry out its responsibilitiesfor monetary policy, economic stabilization, and crisis management. I cannot grasp how we couldpossibly understand what is happening in banking markets, what innovations are occurring and theirimplications, and the nature and quality of the risk exposures and controls so critical for crisismanagement and policy formulation without the hands-on practical exposure that comes fromsupervision. An umbrella supervisor is needed for complex organizations in order to assure that theentire organization and its policies and controls are well managed and consistent with financialstability. At least for the large organizations, I believe that supervisor should be the Federal Reserveso that we can play our role as a central bank and international crisis manager. Many people aresurprised to hear that the Fed directly supervises only 5 of the largest 25 banks -- the state members.Our window into banking is through our umbrella supervision of bank holding companies.Unfortunately, but understandably, the view that the Fed wants new activities to be ina bank holding company is often construed as a “turf” issue. I believe that there are two separablearguments. I would prefer the holding company -- for reasons I have discussed -- even if the Fedwere not the umbrella supervisor. But I also think that we have to be involved in bank supervision --again for the reasons I have discussed. Who should be involved in what activities, and who shouldsupervise the resultant organization and its component parts are genuine and important policy issuesthat should be debated and decided by the Congress. To simply dismiss them as turf issues missesthe point, I think, and chokes off that debate.ConclusionIn conclusion, I hope that my remarks have helped you to better understand the forcesaffecting our banking and financial system. Equally important, I hope that I have given you a goodfeel for the challenges these forces have created for bank supervision, how we are meeting thesechallenges today, and how we may deal with them in the future. Even more importantly, I hope that Ihave convinced you to support enthusiastically H.R. 10! In all seriousness, it really is time that wemodernized our financial system and got on with the business of serving consumers and maintaininga healthy, stable, and competitive banking system.
BIS Review   53/1998Mr. Greenspan presents an update on economic conditions in the United StatesTestimony of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. AlanGreenspan, before the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress on 10/6/98.Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to have the opportunity topresent an update on economic conditions in the United States.Such an assessment cannot be made in isolation but rather depends critically on what ishappening in the rest of the world and how those developments affect the performance of the Americaneconomy. In my previous appearance before this Committee last October, my remarks focused mainly onthe turbulence that was then evident in world financial markets and, in particular, on the problems thathad emerged in a number of Asian economies. The tentative assessment offered then was that theeconomies of Asia were in for some trying times but that the situation did not seem likely to threaten theexpansion of this country’s economy.That assessment, I believe, still is essentially correct, although uncertainties about thedegree of restraint that will be coming from abroad remain substantial. Earlier this year, the situations inmost of the Asian countries seemed to be stabilizing in some respects, but, as the events of the past fewweeks have demonstrated, the restoration of normally functioning economies will not necessarily gosmoothly. In some cases, the adjustments that are needed to improve external balances and to correctexisting misallocations of resources have been accompanied by sharp increases in inflation, risingunemployment, abrupt cutbacks in living standards, and increases in uncertainty and insecurity. Theheightened social and political pressures that can develop in such circumstances not only introduce addedcomplications into economic policymaking but also make it even more difficult to foresee how theprocesses of adjustment will play out across the afflicted economies.That the American economy would be affected to some degree by spillover from theproblems in Asia was never in doubt, even though the timing and magnitude of the impact have beendifficult to predict with much confidence. Many months ago, businesses in this country begananticipating a worsening of our trade balance with the Asian countries, and incoming economic data havesince confirmed those expectations. Meanwhile, other influences on trade -- such as the strength ofdemand growth in the United States and a dollar that has been strong against a wide array of currencies --have persisted. In total, US exports of goods and services turned down in real terms in the first quarter of1998, the first such decline in four years, and real imports of goods and services continued to rise veryrapidly. The combined effect of these changes exerted a drag of 2½ percentage points on the annualgrowth rate of real GDP last quarter. Weaknesses in Asia appear to account for approximately one-halfof that deterioration. Not only have export volumes been affected, but producers in both industry andagriculture also are having to adjust to the lower product prices that have come with slower economicgrowth abroad and the increase in the competitiveness of foreign producers induced largely bydepreciations of their currencies.But even with substantial drag from the external sector, the US economy has continuedto expand at a robust pace. In the first quarter, real GDP grew even faster than it had in 1997.Employment has continued to increase rapidly this year, and the unemployment rate has fallen further,reaching its lowest level since 1970. Incomes have continued to climb, and gains in household andbusiness expenditures have been exceptionally strong. Although the data on hours worked suggest thatgrowth of the economy has likely slowed this quarter from the first quarter’s torrid pace, the degree ofslowdown remains in question. Evidence to date of a moderation in underlying domestic spending still issparse.The strength of domestic spending has been fueled, in part, by conditions in financialmarkets. Although real short-term interest rates have been rising, equity prices have moved still higher,credit has been readily available at slender margins over Treasury interest rates, and nominal long-terminterest rates have remained near the lowest levels of recent decades. Rapid growth of money this year is
- 2 -BIS Review   53/1998a further indication that financial conditions are accommodating strong domestic spending, although westill are uncertain how reliable that relationship will prove to be over time.In short, our economy is still enjoying a virtuous cycle, in which, in the context ofsubdued inflation and generally supportive credit conditions, rising equity values are providing impetusfor spending and, in turn, the expansion of output, employment, and productivity-enhancing capitalinvestment. The hopes for accelerated productivity growth have been bolstering expectations of futurecorporate earnings and thereby fueling still further increases in equity values.The essential precondition for the emergence, and persistence, of this virtuous cycle isarguably the decline in the rate of inflation to near price stability. Continued low product price inflationand expectations that it will persist have brought increasing stability to financial markets and fosteredperceptions that the degree of risk in the financial outlook has been moving ever lower. Theseperceptions, in turn, have reduced the extra compensation that investors require for making loans to, ortaking ownership positions in, private firms.To a considerable extent, investors seem to be expecting that low inflation and strongerproductivity growth will allow the extraordinary growth of profits to be extended into the distant future.Indeed, expectations of per share earnings growth over the longer term have been undergoing continuousupward revision by security analysts since 1994. These rising expectations have, in turn, driven stockprices sharply higher and credit spreads lower, perhaps to levels that will be difficult to sustain unlesseconomic conditions remain exceptionally favorable -- more so than might be anticipated from historicalrelationships. In any event, primarily because of the rise in stock prices, about $12 trillion has beenadded to the value of household assets since the end of 1994. Probably only a few percent of theselargely unrealized capital gains have been transformed into the purchase of goods and services inconsumer markets. But that increment to spending, combined with the sharp increase in equipmentinvestment, which has stemmed from the low cost of both equity and debt relative to expected profits oncapital, has propelled the economy forward. The current economic performance, with its combination ofstrong growth and low inflation, is as impressive as any I have witnessed in my near half-century of dailyobservation of the American economy.The consequences for the American worker have been dramatic and, for the most part,highly favorable. A great many chronically underemployed people have been given the opportunity towork, and many others have been able to upgrade their skills as a result of work experience, extensiveincreases in on-the-job training, or increased enrollment in technical programs. Welfare recipients appearto have been absorbed into the work force in significant numbers.Government finances have improved as well. The taxes paid on huge realized capitalgains and other incomes related to the stock market, coupled with taxes on markedly higher corporateprofits, have joined with restraint on spending to produce a unified federal budget surplus for the firsttime in nearly three decades. April’s budget surplus of $125 billion was the largest monthly surplus onrecord. Widespread improvement also has been evident in the financial positions of state and localgovernments.The fact that economic performance strengthened as inflation subsided should not havebeen surprising, given that risk premiums and economic disincentives to invest in productive capitaldiminish as product prices become more stable. But the extent to which strong growth and high resourceutilization have been joined with low inflation over an extended period is nevertheless extraordinary.Indeed, the broadest measures of price change indicate that the inflation rate moved down further in thefirst quarter of this year, even as the economy strengthened. Although declining oil prices contributed tothis result, pricing leverage in the goods-producing sector more generally was held in check by risingindustrial capacity, reduced demand in Asia that, among other things, has led to a softening ofcommodity prices, and a strong dollar that has contributed to bargain prices on many imports. Someelements in this mix clearly were transitory, and the very recent price data suggest that consumer priceinflation has moved up in the second quarter. But, even so, the rate of rise remains quite moderate
- 3 -BIS Review   53/1998overall. At this point, at least, the adverse wage-price interactions that played so central a role in pushinginflation higher in many past business expansions -- eventually bringing those expansions to an end -- donot appear to have gained a significant toe-hold in the current expansion.There are many reasons why the wage-price interactions have been so well-contained inthis expansion. For one thing, increases in hourly compensation have been slower to pick up than in mostother recent expansions, although, to be sure, wages have started to accelerate in the past couple of yearsas the labor market has become tighter and tighter.In the first few years of the expansion, the subdued rate of rise in hourly compensationseemed to be, in part, a reflection of greater concerns among workers about job security. We now seemto have moved beyond that period of especially acute concern, though the flux of technology may stillleave many workers with fears of job skill obsolescence and a willingness to trade wage gains for jobsecurity. This may explain why, despite the recent acceleration of wages, the resulting level ofcompensation has fallen short of what the experience of previous expansions would have led us toanticipate given the current degree of labor market tightness. In the past couple of years, of course,workers have not had to press especially hard for nominal pay gains to realize sizable increases in theirreal wages. In contrast to the pattern that developed in several previous business expansions, whenworkers required substantial increases in pay just to cover increases in the cost of living, consumer priceshave been generally well-behaved in the current expansion. Changes this past year in prices of bothgoods and services have been among the smallest of recent decades.In addition, the rate of rise in the cost of benefits that employers provide to workers hasbeen remarkably subdued over the past few years, although a gradual upward tilt has become evident oflate. A variety of factors -- including the strength of the economy and rising equity values, which havereduced the need for payments into unemployment trust funds and pension plans, and the restructuring ofthe health care sector -- have been working to keep benefit costs in check in this expansion. But, in themedical area at least, the most recent developments suggest that the favorable trend may have run itscourse. The slowing of price increases for medical services seems to have come to a halt, at least for atime, and, with the cost-saving shift to managed care having been largely completed, the potential forbusinesses to achieve further savings in that regard appears to be rather limited at this point. There havebeen a few striking instances this past year of employers boosting outlays for health benefits bysubstantial amounts.A couple of years ago -- almost at the same time that increases in total hourlycompensation began trending up in nominal terms -- evidence of a long-awaited pickup in the growth oflabor productivity began to show through more strongly in the data; and this accelerated increase inoutput per hour has enabled firms to meet workers’ real wage demands while holding the line on priceincreases. Gains in productivity usually vary with the strength of the economy, and the favorable resultsthat we have observed during the past two years or so, when the economy has been growing morerapidly, surely overstate the degree of pickup that can be sustained. But evidence continues to mount thatthe trend has picked up, even if the extent of that improvement is as yet unclear. Signs of a majortechnological transformation of the economy are all around us, and the benefits are evident not only inhigh-tech industries but also in production processes that have long been part of our industrial economy.Notwithstanding a reasonably optimistic interpretation of the recent productivitynumbers, it would not be prudent to assume that rising productivity, by itself, can ensure anon-inflationary future. Certainly wage increases, per se, are not inflationary. To be avoided are thosethat exceed productivity growth, thereby creating pressure for inflationary price increases that caneventually undermine economic growth and employment. Because the level of productivity is tied to animportant degree to the physical stock of capital, which turns over only gradually, increases in the trendgrowth of productivity probably also occur rather gradually. By contrast, the potential for abruptacceleration of nominal hourly compensation is surely greater. Still, a strong signal of inflation pressuresbuilding because of compensation increases markedly in excess of productivity gains has not yet clearlyemerged in this expansion. Among nonfinancial corporations, our most reliable source of consolidated
- 4 -BIS Review   53/1998costs, trends in costs seem to have accelerated from their lows, but the rates of increase in both unit laborcosts and total unit costs are still quite low.Nonetheless, as I have noted in previous appearances before Congress, I remainconcerned that economic growth will run into constraints as the reservoir of unemployed peopleavailable to work is drawn down. The annual increase in the working-age population (from 16 to 64years of age), including immigrants, has been approximately 1 percent a year in recent years. Yetemployment, measured by the count of persons who are working rather than by the count of jobs, hasbeen rising 2 percent a year since 1995 despite the acceleration in the growth of output per hour. The gapbetween employment growth and population growth, amounting to about 1.2 million a year on average,has been made up, in part, by a decline in the number of individuals who are counted as unemployed --those persons who are actively seeking work -- of approximately 700,000 a year, on average, since theend of 1995. The remainder of the gap has reflected a rise in labor force participation that can be tracedto a decline of more than 500,000 a year in the number of individuals (age 16 to 64) wanting a job butnot actively seeking one. Presumably, many of the persons who once were in this group have morerecently become active and successful job-seekers as the economy has strengthened, thereby preventing astill sharper drop in the official unemployment rate. In May, the number of persons aged 16 to 64 whowanted to work but who did not have jobs was 9.7 million on a seasonally adjusted basis, slightly morethan 5½ percent of the working-age population. This percentage is a record low for the series, which firstbecame available in 1970.The gap between the growth in employment and that of the working-age population willinevitably close. What is crucial to sustaining this unprecedented period of prosperity is whether thatclosing occurs in a disruptive or gradual, balanced manner. The effects of the crisis in Asia will almostcertainly damp net exports further, potentially moderating the growth of domestic production and henceemployment. The strength of domestic spending that has been bolstering output growth and the demandfor labor also could ebb if recent indications of a narrowing in domestic profit margins were to prove tobe the forerunner of a reassessment of the expected rates of return on plant and equipment. Reducedprospects for the return to capital would not only affect investment directly but could also affectconsumption as stock prices adjusted to a less optimistic view of earnings prospects. Finally, the clearlyunsustainable rise of inventories that has been evident in recent quarters will be slowing at some point,perhaps abruptly. An easing of the demand for labor would be an expected consequence of a slowdownin either final sales or inventory accumulation. Of course, the demand for labor that is consistent with aparticular rate of output growth also could be lowered if productivity were to continue to accelerate. And,on the supply side of the labor market, faster growth of the labor force could emerge as the result ofdelayed retirements or increased immigration.If developments such as these do not bring labor demand into line with its sustainablesupply, tighter economic policy may be necessary to help guard against a buildup of pressures that couldderail the current prosperity. Fortunately, fiscal policy has been moving toward restraint to some degree,although recent budgetary discussions do not appear to be focused on extending that tendency. Monetarypolicy might need to tighten if demand were to continue to exhibit few signs of abating noticeably,thereby threatening to place still further strains on our labor markets. We at the Federal Reserve,recognizing the powerful forces of productivity growth and global restraint on inflation, have notperceived to date the need to tighten policy in response to strong demand, beyond what has occurredthrough falling inflation’s upward pressure on the real federal funds rate and the modest increase in thenominal rate that we initiated in March of 1997. But, we are monitoring the evolving forces very closelyto determine whether the recent acceleration of costs, albeit moderate, is likely to prove transitory or thestart of a more worrisome pattern that may well require a response.In summary, Mr. Chairman, our economy has remained strong this year despite evidenceof substantial drag from Asia, and, at the same time, inflation has remained low. As I have indicated, thisset of circumstances is not what historical relationships would have led us to expect at this point in thebusiness expansion, and while it is possible that we have, in a sense, moved “beyond history”, we alsohave to be alert to the possibility that less favorable historical relationships will eventually reassert
- 5 -BIS Review   53/1998themselves. That is why we are remaining watchful for signs of potential inflationary imbalances, evenas the economy continues to perform more impressively than it has in a very long time.
BIS Review   50/1998Mr. Erçel speaks on lessons for Turkish policy-makers from the East Asiancrisis   Address by the Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, Mr. Gazi Erçel,at the Euromoney Conference: Investing In The Future, in Istanbul, on 3/6/98.It is a pleasure to address you at this new Euromoney Conference being held inTurkey. I wish to thank Euromoney and its staff for arranging this conference, which has helpedus reach a better understanding of the Turkish economy and the macroeconomic policies pursuedby the authorities.I would like to speak today about “Lessons from the East Asian crisis for Turkishpolicy-makers”. The financial crisis in the East Asian countries has had strong effects on theeconomies of the world, on industrial and emerging market countries alike. Some of these effectshave made themselves felt very quickly, while others will not run their course for another two orthree years. I may say that these effects are strong but not dangerous. One area of particularconcern is capital flows to emerging market economies, which may increase spreads and bringabout a capital market retrenchment.According to a study conducted by the Institute of International Finance, netprivate capital flows to major emerging market economies have slowed only slightly below their1997 level of $223 billion, but are well below their 1996 level of $304 billion. But the sharecoming from commercial banks and direct equity investments from private creditors willdecrease more than was expected, which means that capital flows will be smaller.I do not wish to review the origins of the East Asian crisis in detail, but it showsus that it is the structural weakness of domestic financial systems and the growing foreignperception of that weakness that triggers a crisis in an economy. Like the Mexican peso crisis, theEast Asian crisis was a classic “self-fulfilling prophecy” panic initiated by Jeffrey Sachs.It is widely recognized that both the Mexican crisis and the crisis in the East Asiancountries stemmed from incorrect macroeconomic policies and structural imbalances. Exchangerate policies in particular, combined with irresponsible fiscal policies, put enormous strain on thebalance of payments. Weak domestic financial systems and rapid expansion of domestic credit,combined with pegged exchange rate regimes, deepen the economies’ dependence on short-termexternal borrowing.But it is a distinctive feature of the East Asian crisis that it is based more on theprivate sector than were the public sector crises seen during the 1970s and 1980s. The solutionsfound for the public-sector-based crises of those years were simpler. Programs supported by theIMF, and much less government borrowing from international institutions, were the mainelements in the solution of those crises. The private-sector-based crises of today are morecomplicated and harder to understand.Let me follow up this brief summary by focusing my remarks this morning on fourmain areas where lessons from the recent East Asian crisis may be found.First, it was the countries’ ongoing exchange rate policies that contributed to thebuild up of crisis conditions. The countries of the East Asian region chose to pursue a fixedexchange rate policy, or one pegged to the US dollar, for about a decade after the Plaza Accord.In the beginning these policies contributed to stronger growth and low inflation in these
- 2 -BIS Review   50/1998countries. But starting in 1995, the appreciation of their currencies had begun to threaten theirbalance-of-payments positions.Second, to offset the weakness of their economies, the authorities relied heavilyon much short-term financing, which concealed the weaknesses of their macroeconomic policies.The nature and direction of the flow of short-term international capital had not been properlyanalyzed. The ratios of short-term debt to usable foreign exchange reserves were in the range of170-200 percent for Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines, much higher than the average ratio of70 percent for the other major emerging market economies.Third, transparency of banking systems, including central banks, is essential foranalyzing ongoing developments in countries’ financial sectors. In particular, trends in theiroff-balance-sheet items, cross-border interbank funding and their transactions with offshorecenters should first of all be transparent and second should be available for making judgementsabout the system. The absence of a sufficiently thorough system of banking supervision and thelack of transparency not only became problematic before the crisis, but also caused confidenceproblems later on.Fourth, the quality of the assets of the banking system is vital for the soundness ofmacroeconomic policy. In allocating savings to investment use, the banks should be extremelycareful about the risks that must be taken for a variety of reasons. There are five main types ofrisk that the banking system and of course the appropriate authorities have to deal with: interestrisk; foreign exchange risk; maturity risk; loan risk; and market risk. A sound financial system isthe best assurance of efficient monetary and fiscal policies.In my view, all four of these factors contributed to the change of foreignperceptions and sentiment and produced a cutback in normal financing (in fact, 95 percent ofexternal flows to emerging market countries come from the private marketplace). This cutback,in turn, weakened the external reserve positions of these countries. Then the combination ofweak reserves and a weak financial sector brought on a liquidity crisis.We are now in a position to draw some lessons from the East Asian crisis. First,policy implementation must pursue sound macroeconomic policies in order not to lose theconfidence of the markets. And second, four main principles must constantly be kept in mind:• The currency should not be allowed to appreciate, except as part of a boldanti-inflation program.• Any short-term international capital flows that occur must be carefullyexamined to determine their direction and nature. In addition, the ratio ofusable external reserves to short-term debt must be kept at reasonable andinternationally accepted levels.• Weak banking systems have been the most important contributors to pastcrises. A sound and transparent banking system is an absolute requirement foravoiding future crises. Risk-taking strategies should be appropriate to a marketsystem. Off-balance-sheet items and cross-border lending should be undertight discipline. An independent supervisory authority is the best guarantee ofefficient, sound, and effective banking supervision.
- 3 -BIS Review   50/1998• Last but not least, the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies in alow-inflation environment is an essential precondition for building public andmarket confidence. Confidence also requires that both public and privatesector institutions be guided by strong, high quality governance and acceptedethical rules.The last point that I want to make is that I disagree with those economists whospeak of the difficulty of anticipating the East Asian crisis, since these countries had assembledall the ingredients of a perfect crisis recipe:• An appreciated exchange rate;• A high and worsening ratio of short-term debt to usable foreign reserves;• Untransparent off-balance-sheet items in the banking sector;• A widening current account deficit;• Steep growth of domestic credits;• And a continuous decline, during recent years, in emerging markets’borrowing spreads without matching improvement in their economicfundamentals.If someone should combine all these elements, it is conceivable that they mightsucceed in creating a crisis.But the world’s financial centers turned away from the existence of this perfectcrisis recipe and turned toward the Turkish economy, for which, ignoring the developments inEast Asia, they predicted a crisis during the last couple of years.The Turkish economy does not satisfy the perfect crisis recipe described above. Ofcourse we have high inflation, a high nominal budget deficit, and high short-term domestic debt,but on the other hand Turkey’s exchange rate policy, current account situation, the nature of itsshort-term external debt, and other fundamentals do not indicate an alarming situation.The East Asian crisis should have greatly improved the ability of economists topredict an episode. I would be glad to see some evidence of this improvement.
BIS Review   49/1998Mr. Thiessen reports on globalized financial markets and monetary policyNotes for remarks by Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mr. Gordon Thiessen, before La Conférencede Montréal, in Montréal, on 27/5/98.Globalization - that is, the growing integration and interdependence of nationaleconomies - is changing dramatically the economic landscape. Countries are trading more goods andservices, an increasing number of firms now operate across national borders, and savers andborrowers have greater access than ever before to global financial markets. Over the past decade,world trade has grown twice as fast as world output, foreign direct investment three times as fast,and both currency trading and share trading about ten times as fast.Not everyone agrees that all this is good for individual national economies or for theworld community at large. Among those who take a dimmer view of globalization, one concern isthat the increased influence of international financial markets is eroding the ability of nationalgovernments to set their own macroeconomic policies. They also worry that powerful financialmarkets may be the main cause of crises such as those in Mexico in 1994-95 and in Southeast Asiain 1997.You will probably not be surprised to hear that I do not share these negative views.And today, I would like to discuss one particular aspect of globalization - how national monetarypolicies work in an environment of globalized financial markets. I will draw heavily on Canada’sown experience to support the view that monetary policy can continue to function effectively in thisincreasingly integrated world.  Canada has a long history of being open to global markets for goods,services and capital. This interaction with the rest of the world has proven very successful, in myview, and has benefited Canadians and our foreign partners enormously through the years.With open international markets, Canadians have been able to sell their products andservices abroad and to enjoy a wide variety of imported goods, some of which could not readily beproduced at home. And we have been able to set up businesses and pursue investment opportunitiesabroad. Even more importantly, we have been able to use foreign savings to finance the largeinvestment projects that were necessary to develop our industrial infrastructure and to increase ourproduction potential, especially in the resource and manufacturing sectors. We have also had accessto technological innovations and processes developed elsewhere. This has allowed us to combinenew capital equipment and a skilled labour force more efficiently, thereby improving productivityand, thus, our incomes and standards of living.Nonetheless, there are concerns in Canada, as well as elsewhere, about the rapidincrease in international financial flows and the implications thereof. How does the free movementof capital affect the conduct of national monetary policies?Capital mobility and the implications for monetary policyThe growing integration of national financial markets, as evidenced by the dramaticgrowth in the volume of cross-border capital flows since the early 1970s, has no doubt changed theenvironment in which national economic policies are conducted. Globalization tends to bring suchpolicies under closer market scrutiny and to uncover and draw attention to any deep-seated economicproblems that may exist. But I would not conclude from this that we have become captives of themarkets and that we have lost control of our national monetary policies, as some argue.First, let us be clear as to what “having control” over one’s own monetary policyactually means. When people talk about an independent or autonomous monetary policy, they oftentake it to mean the ability of a central bank to set domestic interest rates without being influenced by
- 2 -BIS Review   49/1998developments outside national borders. This is not realistic - unless of course a country is completelycut off from the rest of the world! The moment a country wants to make use of foreign savings, orinvest a portion of its domestic savings abroad, a link between domestic and foreign interest rates isinevitable. As a major user of foreign capital, Canada has long lived with interest rates that areclosely related to those in the United States and other foreign financial markets.But even with integrated financial markets, there is still room for monetary policyindependence via exchange rate movements. Thus, monetary policy autonomy requires a flexibleexchange rate regime. With a fixed exchange rate, the national authorities essentially adopt themonetary policy of another country - the country whose currency serves as the anchor. If interestrates go up in the anchor-currency country, interest rates will also have to rise sufficiently in thecountry with fixed exchange rates to ensure that the peg is maintained. Thus, if monetary policy isfocused on a fixed exchange rate, the central bank cannot at the same time pursue a domesticobjective.In the case of the European Union, where member countries have decided to adopt asingle currency - the euro - they have essentially opted to give up the potential for an independentnational monetary policy and to transfer the policymaking power to a supranational agency - theEuropean Central Bank (ECB). Of course, the ability of the ECB to follow an independent Europeanmonetary policy will require that the euro float against other major outside currencies, such as theUS dollar and the Japanese yen.Thus, in a world of open and integrated financial markets, the exchange rate is amajor channel through which monetary policy actions are transmitted to the economy. Moreover, itis movements in the exchange rate that permit domestic interest rates to diverge from their foreigncounterparts for a period of time. For example, an increase in official interest rates by the centralbank, in response to demand and inflation pressures in the economy, leads to a stronger currency,which also works to restrain those pressures. At the same time, the appreciation of the currencycreates the conditions for other domestic rates to follow the rise in official rates, to levels that maynow be above those prevailing abroad. This is because the exchange rate is now seen to be above itsexpected value and is thus likely to decline in the future. Under these circumstances, financialmarkets will bid up domestic interest rates to compensate for the anticipated decline in the externalvalue of the currency.Having clarified the issue of monetary policy independence, I would now like todiscuss the effects of increased capital mobility on the conduct of monetary policy. A higher degreeof capital mobility enhances still further the role of the exchange rate in the monetary transmissionprocess. This is not a bad thing. It just means we have to ensure that we always take the exchangerate into account when considering the monetary policy stance that is appropriate for our domesticeconomic circumstances. That is why in Canada we have developed the concept of “monetaryconditions” to keep track of the combined effect on the economy of movements in both interest ratesand the exchange rate.With a flexible exchange rate system, the increased role of the exchange rate in themonetary transmission mechanism also means that it is crucial that investors’ expectations of futurecurrency movements are firmly anchored by clear and credible domestic macroeconomic policies.Thus, the central bank must have a strong commitment to preserving the internalvalue of the currency by keeping inflation low. That is why in Canada we have adopted explicittargets for inflation-control. But this is not enough. The fiscal situation must also be seen to be undercontrol. Otherwise, as fiscal deficits and debts keep accumulating, investors will come to fear thatinflationary policies will be used in the future to reduce the burden of debt.
- 3 -BIS Review   49/1998Canada’s experience during the Mexican currency crisis of 1994-95, and morerecently through the Asian problems, is very instructive in this regard. The Mexican crisis focusedthe spotlight on our fiscal problems at the time, consequently driving risk premiums in our interestrates sharply higher. During the recent Asian crisis, however, with our public finances in bettershape, and with clear, strong policy commitments by both the fiscal and monetary authorities,financial markets have been more stable and our longer-term interest rates have been falling.Of course, pressures on the exchange rate can also be triggered by so-called “realshocks”. In Canada, such shocks are frequently associated with swings in world prices of primarycommodities. In cases like these, a flexible exchange rate can act as a “shock absorber”, allowingsome of the necessary adjustments to the shock to take place through movements in the value of thecurrency.Canada’s long-standing preference for flexible exchange rates has been driven largelyby the benefits such rates offer in facilitating adjustments to external shocks. This is an importantconsideration for us, given our strong reliance on international trade and foreign savings. As a majorexporter of primary commodities, Canada has often been hit by sharp swings in the world prices ofthese products which, in turn, have caused large capital movements. Indeed, the decisions to floatour exchange rate in 1950 and again in 1970 (after a short period of fixed exchange rates), wererelated to strong inflows of foreign capital associated with a surge in commodity prices. In bothcases, we chose to allow the Canadian dollar to float up, rather than try to maintain a fixed exchangerate and risk a destabilizing inflationary monetary expansion.Overall, I am persuaded that a flexible exchange rate regime is the best way for acountry to take advantage of today’s integrated capital markets and to deal with the external shocksthat arise from time to time.Exchange rate fluctuations: Is taxing currency transactions the solution?Some critics have argued that integrated international financial markets have givenrise to large, short-term speculative flows of capital that can cause unwarranted exchange ratepressures. Such speculative transactions, they say, disrupt domestic macroeconomic policies, resultin temporary misallocations of resources, discourage trade, and encourage further unproductivefinancial transactions as businesses and individuals seek to protect themselves.Based on these arguments, some people have resurrected the idea of discouragingcurrency transactions using a tax similar to the one proposed by Professor James Tobin in the 1970s.The case for taxing global financial transactions rests on the notion that such a taxwill discourage short-term flows, which are viewed as destabilizing, without affecting longer-termflows that are presumed to be desirable and based on fundamentals.But short-term flows are by no means all undesirable and destabilizing. And there isno way of discriminating between useful flows and destabilizing speculative ones. For example,because foreign trade and investment inflows and outflows are not always fully offsetting, short-termcapital flows are typically needed to balance out a country’s external accounts. These capital flowsoccur in response to actual and anticipated movements in the exchange rate, and thus serve tosmooth out exchange rate fluctuations. Because such flows are often driven by small differences inperceived rates of return at home and abroad, they could well be discouraged by a transactions tax.On the other hand, speculative flows that actually “bet” on a sharp movement in a currency, haverather large expected returns and are unlikely to be discouraged by the tax. In the end, a transactions
- 4 -BIS Review   49/1998tax would likely increase, rather than decrease, exchange rate volatility, as well as reduce marketliquidity and raise the cost of capital.Needless to say, where financial market fluctuations reflect changes in domesticmacroeconomic policies that put investors at greater risk than before, the tax would be aimed attreating the symptoms rather than the cause of the problem.In all, I find the case for a tax on currency transactions completely unconvincing.Promoting greater financial market stabilityIf a tax is not a good idea, how else can we promote greater stability in internationalfinancial markets and reduce potential disruptions to domestic policymaking?I have already talked about the value of a flexible exchange rate system in facilitatingadjustment to “real” shocks and allowing national authorities to pursue an independent monetarypolicy. Flexible exchange rates can also be helpful in moderating the size of, and aiding in theadjustment to, capital flows.In addition, governments are increasingly coming to the realization that the issue ofinternational financial stability is best addressed not by retreating into isolation or by falling back ondistorting, costly restrictions, but rather through sound and transparent domestic economic policies.International co-operation can also help. It can help by encouraging countries topursue national policies that lead to economic stability, thereby reducing the risk of sudden changesin market sentiment and sharp exchange rate fluctuations. And it can help by setting widely acceptedstandards for transparency and disclosure. Such standards should support more informed marketjudgments about the riskiness of investments, especially in emerging market economies, and thushelp avoid the crises that can be triggered by the sudden uncovering of problems.Following the G-7 Halifax Summit in 1995, a series of international initiatives toimprove the functioning of financial markets have been undertaken, mainly under the auspices of theInternational Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements. These initiatives seek toenhance the transparency and disclosure of economic and financial data, strengthen the surveillanceof national and global financial systems, develop mechanisms for support in times of crisis, andprovide training in financial sector supervision.Recognizing the importance of these efforts, Canada has recently proposed thecreation of a new international process to provide “peer review” of national financial regulatory andsupervisory systems. Efficient and prudently managed national financial systems can reduce therisks, and maximize the benefits, of international capital flows. In this regard, national supervisoryauthorities need to ensure that financial institutions have appropriate risk-management systems inplace to help minimize risks, particularly with respect to mismatching of maturities and currencies.This would make it easier to cope in the event that short-term inflows switched to outflows. One ofthe main problems in Asia was that domestic financial institutions were borrowing short-term, inforeign currency, to invest in illiquid domestic assets.Concluding thoughtsTo summarize, globalization has been broadly beneficial to the world economy.International financial markets have facilitated access by borrowers to a larger pool of global savingsand have enhanced investment opportunities for savers worldwide.
- 5 -BIS Review   49/1998Yes, international capital flows have at times disrupted national financial markets.But such episodes more often than not were caused by unsustainable domestic policies and pointedto the need for adjustment.In view of the overall benefits of greater access to global capital markets, it would notserve us well to restrict the free flow of funds. The best way to maximize the benefits of financialglobalization and reduce the risks of disruptions to national macroeconomic policies is to ensure thatthese policies are sound and sustainable. In addition, financial systems need to be prudently managedand supervised - both nationally and internationally.Here in Canada, we are following this advice in our domestic macroeconomicpolicies. And we are also strongly supporting and contributing to global initiatives designed topromote financial market stability worldwide.
BIS Review   46/1998Mr. Greenspan gives a testimony on the global financial system and the role ofthe IMF in the Asian crisis   Testimony of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the USFederal Reserve, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Committee on Agriculture of the US House ofRepresentatives on 21/5/98.The global financial system has been evolving rapidly in recent years. Newtechnology has radically reduced the costs of borrowing and lending across traditional nationalborders, facilitating the development of new instruments and drawing in new players. Information istransmitted instantaneously around the world, and huge shifts in the supply and demand for fundsnaturally follow, resulting in a massive increase in capital flows.This burgeoning global system has been demonstrated to be a highly efficientstructure that has significantly facilitated cross-border trade in goods and services and, accordingly,has made a substantial contribution to standards of living worldwide. Its efficiency exposes andpunishes underlying economic imprudence swiftly and decisively. Regrettably, it also appears tohave facilitated the transmission of financial disturbances far more effectively than ever before.Three years ago, the Mexican crisis was the first episode associated with our newhigh-tech international financial system. The current Asian crisis is the second.We do not as yet fully understand the new system’s dynamics. We are learning fast,and need to update and modify our institutions and practices to reduce the risks inherent in the newregime. Meanwhile, we have had to confront the current crisis with the institutions and techniqueswe have.Many argued that the Asian crisis should be allowed to run its course without supportfrom the International Monetary Fund or the bilateral financial backing of other nations. Theyasserted that allowing this crisis to play out, while doubtless having additional negative effects ongrowth in Asia, and engendering greater spill-overs onto the rest of the world, would not likely havea large or lasting impact on the United States and the world economy.They may well have been correct in their judgment, and some would argue thatevents over the past six months have proved them right; we have so far avoided the type ofcontinuing downward spiral that some feared. There was and is, however, a small but not negligibleprobability that the upset in East Asia could have unexpectedly large negative effects on Japan, LatinAmerica, and eastern and central Europe that, in turn, could have repercussions elsewhere, includingthe United States. Thus, while the probability of such an outcome may be small, its consequences, inmy judgment, should not have been left solely to chance. We have observed that global financialmarkets, as currently organized, do not always achieve an appropriate equilibrium, or at least requiretime to stabilize. Moreover, the effects of the Asian crisis on the real economies of the immediatelyaffected countries, as well as on our own economy, are only now just being felt.Opponents of IMF support for member countries facing international financialdifficulties also argued that such substantial financial backing, by cushioning the losses of imprudentinvestors, encourages excessive risk-taking. There doubtless is some truth in that, though arguably ithas been the expectation of governments’ support of their financial systems that has been the moreobvious culprit, at least in the Asian case. In any event, any expectations of broad bailouts haveturned out to have been disappointed. Many if not most investors in Asian economies have to datesuffered substantial losses.Moreover, the policy conditionality, associated principally with IMF lending, whichdictates economic and financial discipline and structural change, helps to mitigate some of the
- 2 -BIS Review   46/1998inappropriate risk-taking on the part of governmental authorities. At the root of the problems hasbeen poor public policy that has resulted in misguided investments and very weak financial sectors.Convincing a sovereign nation to alter destructive policies that impair its own performance andthreaten contagion to its neighbors is best handled by an international financial institution, such asthe IMF. What we have in place today to respond to crises should be supported even as we work toimprove those mechanisms and institutions. Some observers have also expressed concern aboutwhether we can be confident that IMF programs for countries, in particular the countries of EastAsia, are likely to alter their economies significantly and permanently. My sense is that oneconsequence of this Asian crisis is an increasing awareness in the region that market capitalism, aspracticed in the West, especially in the United States, is the superior model; that is, it providesgreater promise of producing rising standards of living and continuous growth.Although East Asian economies have exhibited considerable adherence to manyaspects of free-market capitalism, there has, nonetheless, been a pronounced tendency towardgovernment-directed investment, using the banking system to finance that investment. Given arecord of real growth rates of close to 10 percent per annum over an extended period of time, it is notsurprising that it has been difficult to convince anyone that the economic system practiced in EastAsia could not continue to produce positive results indefinitely. Following the breakdown, anincreasing awareness, bordering in some cases on shock, that their economic model was incomplete,or worse, has arguably emerged in the region.As a consequence, many of the leaders of these countries and their economic advisorsare endeavoring to move their economies much more rapidly toward the type of economic systemthat we have in the United States. The IMF, whatever one might say about its policy advice in thepast, has played an important role in this process, providing advice and incentives that promotesound money and long-term stability. The IMF’s current approach in Asia is fully supportive of theviews of those in the West who understand the importance of greater reliance on market forces,reduced government controls, scaling back of government-directed investment, and embracinggreater transparency -- the publication of all the data that are relevant to the activities of the centralbank, the government, financial institutions, and private companies.It is a reasonable question to ask how long this conversion to embracing marketcapitalism in all its details will last in countries once temporary IMF financial support has come toan end. We are, after all, dealing with sovereign nations with long traditions, not always consonantwith market capitalism. But my sense is that there is a growing understanding and appreciation ofthe benefits of market capitalism as we practice it, and that what is being prescribed inIMF-supported programs fosters their own interests.Similarly, it is a reasonable question to ask whether the US authorities should notseek greater assurance that the ongoing process of reform in the IMF’s policies and operations willproduce additional concrete results before we agree to augment the IMF’s resources. I have reason tobelieve that the management and staff of the IMF are committed to a process of change. We face asomewhat more difficult task in convincing the IMF’s membership as a whole of the need forchange. However, I am confident that our leverage in this regard would be reduced if the UnitedStates failed to agree promptly to the proposed increases in the IMF’s resources.Accordingly, I continue fully to back the Administration’s request to augment thefinancial resources of the IMF by approving as quickly as possible US participation in the NewArrangements to Borrow and an increase in the US quota in the IMF. Hopefully, neither will turn outto be needed, and no funds will be drawn. Although the tendency in recent months towardstabilization in the East Asian economies is encouraging, clearly those economies are not out of thewoods as recent events attest. Moreover, we have not yet put in place the strengthening of the
- 3 -BIS Review   46/1998international financial architecture that would enable us in the future to place less reliance on theIMF to deal with potential systemic crises. Thus it is better to have the IMF fully equipped if a quickresponse to a pending crisis is essential.
BIS Review   46/1998Mr. Grenville talks on the Asian crisis, capital flows and the internationalfinancial architecture1   Talk by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia,Mr. Stephen Grenville, to Monash University Law School Foundation in Melbourne on 21/5/98.Kindleberger (1978), in his classic study of “Manias, Panics and Crashes”, observedthat: “there is hardly a more conventional subject in economic literature than financial crises.” TheAsian crisis, while unexpected in its timing, spread and severity, contains many familiar elements. Ifwe were to distil a core weakness from the complex causes, it would be the juxtaposition of fragiledomestic financial systems with large and volatile international capital flows. Today, I want to focuson the second element of this fatal combination - the large and volatile capital flows.2The Pros and Cons of International Capital FlowsThere is a strong a priori case that international capital flows are a Good Thing. Theobvious analogy is with international trade. If it is beneficial for nations to trade in goods andservices, then there is a presumption that there will also be advantage in trading in saving. Financialflows supplement domestic saving, allowing more investment to be done in those countries wherereturns are highest; they buffer the variations over time between exports and imports; foreign directinvestment brings the advantages of technological transfer; there are gains for savers fromdiversification; and, to complete the case for free capital flows, we should record the argument thateven speculative capital flows can serve a beneficial purpose.3Capital flows are generally supported by the economic profession, both academicsand practitioners. Open capital markets are part of the widely-accepted Washington Consensus(whose twin elements are that countries should deregulate, and should open their economies to theoutside world), and are endorsed by the IMF.4Why, then, does foreign capital flow rank as a central element in the Asian crisis?The short answer is: painful experience in the practical world. Contrast Keynes’ (1919) views on thepre-WWI world, with his later views on the prospective post-WWII world, transformed by theexperience of the 1930s. He describes pre-WWI London, with evident approval, this way: “Theinhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various productsof the whole earth . . . ; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth inthe natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion oreven trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages . . . He regarded this state of affairs asnormal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviationfrom it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.” (pp. 9-10) This was, as Keynes noted, a “paradise”in which “internationalisation was nearly complete in practice”. Contrast this idyllic civilised picture                                                     1 I am grateful for the help of John Hawkins, Suzanna Chiang and Amanda Thornton in preparing this paper.2 This is not to downplay the deficiencies in domestic policies, which have been discussed elsewhere. For somediscussion of the other “twin” problem - financial sector fragility - see Grenville (1997 and 1998b).3 The best known proponent of this argument is Milton Friedman, who has argued that speculation is inherentlystabilising, as any speculator who does not buy cheap and sell dear (thus driving the price towards its fundamentalequilibrium) will quickly go out of business. More recent literature is less confident of this result.4 The IMF Managing Director recently put forward seven building blocks for a stronger financial system, with the firstthree relating to globalisation: “The first of these building blocks is the tremendous potential for growth and prosperityglobalization provides countries fully integrating into the global economy. Formidable sources of dynamism are there,engendered by new information technologies and unifying financial markets. . . . The second building block isintegration. By integrating themselves into the mainstream of the globalizing world economy, the poorest countries willavail themselves of a most powerful instrument of acceleration of development. . . . The third building block is theuniversal consensus on the importance of an increasingly open and liberal system of capital flows in order forglobalization to deliver on its promises.” (Camdessus 1998).
- 2 -BIS Review   46/1998with the world Keynes envisaged as he wrestled with the problem of reconstruction after the SecondWorld War: “it is widely held that control of capital movements, both inward and outward, should bea permanent feature of the post-War system.”5 “Experience between the Wars clearly demonstratedthe mischief of unregulated capital movements, which take no account of the balance of tradeavailable for overseas investment.” 6, 7The central point here is that some types of capital flows, for all their benefits, arevery volatile. Policy-makers are not just interested in the growth of GDP, but its variance. Largevolatile influences are a policy nightmare.The Asian ExperiencePrivate capital flow into the five troubled economies of Asia (South Korea,Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines) was very large and variable, both up and down. Ithad reached almost US$ 100 billion in 1996 - one-third of worldwide flows into emerging countries.This was a five-fold increase over the 1990-93 average. It reversed in 1997, to record an outflow ofUS$ 12 billion. This turnaround was equivalent to more than 10 per cent of the GDP of thesecountries.Portfolio equity investment into these five countries almost quadrupled in a singleyear - 1993. These flows were huge, compared to the size of the domestic financial sectors. It ishardly surprising that the then-Governor of the Indonesian central bank said: “we started building thefoundations of a house but suddenly we had to host a party”.8 Kindleberger (1989), describing thepost-OPEC period, captures the same point when he says: “multinational banks swollen with dollars,. . . tumbled over one another in trying to uncover new foreign borrowers.” (p. 26)Two other characteristics are worth noting:• almost 60 per cent of the 1996 private flows to the Asian Five were fromforeign commercial banks and 40 per cent were short-term credits. Banklending was flighty indeed - inflows of US$ 56 billion in 1996 turned intooutflows of US$ 27 billion in 1997. Direct equity investment - which might beexpected to be more stable - was quite modest (6 per cent of the total), butportfolio equity investment (which can - and did - quickly reverse) was twice aslarge;9• the flows were driven, to an important extent, from the supply side. The flowsin the 1990s were consistently larger than the current account deficits - i.e. theywere not drawn in by the need to fund the saving/investment gap.Paradoxically, one source of volatility was the high profit opportunities available inthese countries, as they “got their economic act together”, combining technology and cheap labour                                                     5 Treasury memo to the UK War Cabinet’s Reconstruction Problems Committee.6 Proposal for an International Monetary Fund, Annex A of the Washington Conversations Article VII, Memorandum bythe Minister of State, 7 February 1944.7 Bhagwati (1998), distinguished economist and long-time champion of free trade, provides another example, in hisstrong scepticism that the arguments for international freedom of trade can be transposed to capital flows.8 For a description of the measures which Indonesia took in the early 1990s to try to slow the inflows, see IMF (1995, p.14). 9 In the two decades beginning in the mid 1960s, Singapore succeeded in absorbing very large capital inflows withoutdisruption. This was predominantly foreign direct investment.
- 3 -BIS Review   46/1998with capital, to produce high productivity (and high profits) as they moved towards the technologicalfrontier. Hand-in-hand with these high profits go high real interest rates. The international capitalflows came, as a normal part of the working of markets, to avail themselves of these opportunities.These capital flows were not some aberration which could be avoided by better macro policies or byenhanced policy transparency, but were the normal manifestation of the working of capitalmarkets.10The inflows, nevertheless, presented an intractable dilemma for policy. While-everdomestic interest rates were high, this encouraged more foreign inflow which made credit controldifficult and was costly to sterilise; but lower interest rates would have fuelled excess domesticdemand. More exchange rate flexibility has been suggested as the panacea in these difficultcircumstances, but I have argued elsewhere11 that, while it would have helped, the problems weremore fundamental. The one way that an equilibrium (of sorts) could be established was to bid upasset prices so that the high intrinsic profit opportunities were counterbalanced by over-pricedassets - but of course this distorted investment incentives and fuelled over-optimistic expectations.The result, in short, was a widespread perception that borrowing was cheap, with all the resourcemisallocations and distortions that go with this.High saving economies routinely produce another destabilising characteristic - highleverage ratios (Wade and Veneroso 1998), which leave enterprises vulnerable to changes in themacro settings, particularly interest rates. Households do the saving, while companies do theinvesting, so the corporate sector is inevitably highly indebted in fast-growing countries withunder-developed equity markets. When investment is funded from overseas, then one of the parties(either the borrower or the lender) is taking an exchange rate risk, which makes these flows volatileand flighty. In short, high-profit/fast-growth economies are intrinsically more vulnerable to thevolatility of capital flows.This degree of volatility can be ameliorated by better domestic policies. But volatilityis intrinsic to these flows, and there is a long international history in which capital flows were eitherthe catalyst for a crisis, or exacerbated a crisis which was set off by other factors: “the history ofinvestment in South America throughout the last century has been one of confidence followed bydisillusionment, of borrowing cycles followed by widespread defaults”.12We might note also, in passing, that the overall international financial environmenthas been routinely subject to fits, starts and sudden reassessments. The large swings in the yen/dollarexchange rate during the 1990s and the abnormally-low interest rates in Japan were an importantfactor in the capital flows under discussion here.13                                                     10 High levels of international debt and large current account deficits were a reflection of saving/investment imbalances,and to the extent that the economic literature had wrestled with this issue beforehand, the puzzle was that theinternational capital flows had not been larger, rather than that they were somehow too large (the standard referencehere is Feldstein and Horioka (1980)).11 Grenville (1998a). Latin America provides earlier examples of countries whose real exchange rates were driven up bycapital inflows, as a prelude to a sharp substantial fall when confidence changed (see McKinnon and Pill (1995)).12 Royal Institute of International Affairs, quoted by Dornbusch (1985). See also Kindleberger (1989, Chapter 7) andArndt (1998). McKinnon and Pill (1995) provide an interesting account of the interaction between capital flows andfinancial sector weakness in recent Latin American experience. Their final “stylised fact” provides an accuratedescription of the subsequent Asian problems: “The ‘over-borrowing’ episode culminates in a financial crisis, capitalflight and recession - often forcing an uncontrolled deep devaluation of the currency, with a resurgence of inflation.”(p. 6) The characteristics of emerging countries impart to the flows far more volatility than is seen in, say, Australia. Inthe exchange rate problems of Australia in the mid 1980s, capital inflow continued at its underlying average rate.13 For discussion of this point, see Eichengreen and Rose (1998).
- 4 -BIS Review   46/1998Perceptions and ConfidenceIn this fragile world, the critical issue that changed - motivating the volte face ofcapital between 1996 and 1997 - was an extraordinary change in confidence - what Stiglitz calls the“instability in beliefs” and Keynes called “animal spirits”.Such reversals of sentiment are not uncommon, even in the United States: onenotable example was the October 1987 share market shake-out.14 But the opportunities for thesereversals of confidence are greater in the Asian countries, where foreign investors did not know theseeconomies well and the economic fundamentals are not well established. So they were even moresusceptible to herd behaviour - once doubts started, they were self-fulfilling. Over-optimism basedon imperfect understanding could easily change to over-pessimism, equally based onmisunderstanding. Over-inflated asset prices deflated rapidly. A recent Fortune (1998) articlecaptures the post-crisis disillusionment: “You can’t trust the companies, you can’t trust thegovernments, you can’t trust the analysts, and you can’t trust the mutual funds managers. Watchout.” “There was a touch of the absurd in the unfolding drama, as international money managersharshly castigated the very same Asian governments they were praising just months before. . . . But,as often happens in financial markets, euphoria turned to panic without missing a beat.” (Sachs1997)15The recipient countries had only a limited range of instruments that could be used tocounter these changes of confidence. The traditional answer is to raise interest rates.16 But this hadlimited effect: nervous foreign lenders were concerned about the fundamental credit-worthiness ofborrowers, not interest income. Many lenders had provided funds denominated in foreign currency,and higher local currency interest rates were irrelevant, except to the extent they added to concernsabout the local economy. High interest rates in the defence of the exchange rate were moredamaging to these vulnerable economies because of their high corporate leverage. The short-termnature of the flows added to the woes.Proposals for ReformIn short, the size and volatility of the foreign capital flows exacerbated the seriousand fundamental domestic policy problems, fuelled the boom and made the subsequent crash worse.These problems are all the more intractable for economies which are in the process of openingthemselves up to international financial markets, with small inexperienced financial sectors. In thewake of this experience, there is no shortage of reformist proposals.George Soros (1997) - the most famous of the hedge fund managers and a primebeneficiary of the current freedoms of capital flow - has suggested the setting up of an internationalcredit insurance corporation. Henry Kaufman, the doyen of Wall Street economists, has urged thecreation of an international supervisory structure, which would “vet” countries’ prudential systems                                                     14 Greenspan (1998) observed that: “there is no credible scenario that can readily explain so abrupt a change in thefundamentals of long-term valuation on that day.”15 An academic literature is building up around the idea of “rational beliefs”. McKinnon and Pill (1995), referring to thework of Kurz, say: “The rational beliefs approach permits individuals to hold different views about the structure of theeconomy, provided the models implicit in these views are not refutable by observed or observable data. This structureallows the economy to deviate from ‘sustainable’ paths in the short run - which could last for an extended period - untilobserved data demonstrate that the structural model implying this ex post unsustainable behavior was incorrect.” (p.17)16 Kindleberger (1989, p. 153) cites the case where, in 1849, a 2 per cent (200 basis points) rise in the UK discount ratewas enough to cause sailing ships carrying gold to America to turn around and return to the United Kingdom: suchfine-tuning of crises seems to be a thing of the past, along with sailing ships.
- 5 -BIS Review   46/1998before allowing them to borrow in international financial markets. At the other end of the spectrum,there are those who argue that the main problem was “lack of liquidity” in these financial markets,which they identify as causing large price movements on relatively small volume changes. For thelatter group, the solution is simple: to go harder, stronger and quicker towards full deregulation.Larry Summers (1998), US Treasury Deputy Secretary and former leading academic,draws an analogy with the advent of jet travel, which greatly improved convenience and safety ofinternational travel, but when accidents happen, they are more dramatic. Should we, he asksrhetorically, address this problem by banning jet landings? To carry this analogy further, clearly theanswer is to make the infrastructure safer for the most beneficial aspects of the innovation, while notprecluding the possibility that the more dangerous aspects should be constrained.The Asian experience - following, as it does, similar experience in Mexico in1994/95 - has set the agenda for the reform of the international financial architecture. The G22meeting held last month in Washington focused on three requirements:• transparency (i.e. greater information to help markets make more rationaldecisions);• strengthening of financial systems to make them more resilient in the face ofchanges of sentiment;• ensuring that the private sector bears a proper share of the burden of any rescueoperation.All this makes good sense. To argue that more information is better than lessinformation is as close to a truism as we can get in economics.17Nor would any informed observer dispute the need for root-and-branch reform ofprudential supervision in these countries.18 The issues here are not ones of principle, but areoperational: how to put in place an enforceable set of rules which is sufficiently strict to protect thecore of the financial system from crises, without making the rules so onerous that financing shiftselsewhere, to an unregulated but equally-vulnerable channel.The third area - private sector burden sharing - requires some elaboration. Despite thebest endeavours on information/transparency and in building up prudential strength, it is hard tobelieve that the problems will be quickly and fully eliminated. For a start, a good prudential systemwill take many years to develop, considering that it requires counterpart improvement in accounting,legal and bankruptcy arrangements. Transparency is a good thing, but markets can make radicalreassessments even when information is abundant - the October 1987 share market shake-out isevidence of this. And, realistically, domestic policy-makers will never be omniscient andsingle-minded in their pursuit of economic perfection.19                                                     17 At present, the focus is on greater disclosure from capital-receiving countries, but this could be extended to greaterdisclosure from capital suppliers, including private intermediaries and investment funds.18 This focus revives an old issue in economics - the sequencing of reform. The old argument was that financialderegulation should come last, as the financial sector facilitated the exploitation of any remaining regulation-drivendistortions in the economy. The new argument is that if financial deregulation precedes the establishment of a strongprudential framework, the inevitable volatility of capital flows will produce a collapse of the financial system. For aninteresting discussion of the need for a “global standard”, see Sheng (1998).19 Stiglitz (1998) puts it this way: “We must bear in mind too in designing policy regimes (such as opening up capitalmarkets) that we cannot assume that other aspects of economic policy, such as macroeconomic policy or exchangerates, will be flawlessly carried out. The policy regimes we adopt must be robust against at least a modicum of humanfallibility. Airplanes are not designed to be flown just by ace pilots, and nuclear power plants have built into them ahuge margin of safety for human error.”
- 6 -BIS Review   46/1998If we accept that, with all the corrections made and “best endeavours” on thepolicy-making front, there will still be room for sharp breaks in confidence, then this has to behandled in the same way that it is handled domestically in the face of bank crises caused by loss ofconfidence - through the availability of a lender-of-last-resort.Mexico in 1994/95 provides a classic example of the internationallender-of-last-resort in operation, and most observers would regard this as a success. Most peoplewould also regard it as an example of the residual problem of the lender-of-last-resort - “moralhazard”. This type of moral hazard occurs when those who take economic decisions are not requiredto accept the full consequences, when that decision turns out badly. In the case of the sudden capitaloutflow from Mexico in 1994, this outflow was replaced by an IMF/US package of US$ 50 billion,which was enough to pay out the government creditors, until confidence was restored (whichoccurred relatively quickly) There are those who argue that, in doing this, the foreign investors were“bailed out”, and this sets a bad precedent for future investors.20While the problem of moral hazard has long been recognised, and there wassubstantial discussion about how to address it following the Mexican rescue, subsequent events havedemonstrated just how hard it is to avoid. In late 1997, foreign banks which had lent to Koreanprivate banks were given an ex post government guarantee and concerted arrangements were put inplace to avoid the impending default. If Mexico showed that creditors holding government debt canbe bailed out and Korea showed that creditors holding bank debt can be assisted, then Indonesia maybe providing an example, where foreign creditors holding debt of private firms are assisted.21 It isnot hard to see why this occurs: while everyone is against moral hazard in principle, the resolution ofparticular problems often requires that special assistance be given to those who, by their actions,could make the current crisis worse. As Kindleberger (1989, p. 182) noted: “Actuality inevitablydominates contingency. Today wins over tomorrow.” As with bankruptcy, in practice the balanceneeds to be drawn between the need to keep continuity of operations, against the need, also, tomaintain appropriate incentives for risk-taking. While everyone agrees, in principle, that privateinvestors should not be bailed out, administering the appropriate “haircut” is not operationally easy.Hence the question of private sector burden sharing on the G22 agenda.If the combination of moral hazard and the understandable reluctance of governmentsto enlarge the international lender-of-last-resort leaves the feeling that the problems have not beenfully resolved, then a further - more controversial - element is on the agenda in some quarters. Forsome people, the problems of short-term capital flows outweigh their benefits. They argue thatshort-term flows bring little or no technological transfer. William Rees-Mogg (1998), former Editorof The Times, has put it this way: “There is now a huge financial industry which is purelyspeculative in character; it centres on the currency trading of international banks. It is deeplyresented in those countries which have been ravaged by its inflows and outflows, however much theymay have contributed to their own misfortune. Because it is entirely short-term in character, casinocapitalism makes little net contribution to long-term investment.” “It is impossible to pretend thatthe traditional case for capital market liberalisation remains unscathed. Either far greater stabilitythan at present is injected into the international monetary system as a whole or the unavoidablyfragile emerging countries must protect themselves from the virus of short-term lending, particularly                                                     20 It might be worth noting a common terminological confusion: in a “bail out of Mexico”, for example, it is the foreigninvestors who are the direct beneficiaries.21 “Again, the international community faces a dilemma: it often sees no alternative to a bailout - the risks of notundertaking an action seem unacceptable. After each crisis, we bemoan the extent of the bailout and make strongspeeches saying that never again will lenders be let off the hook to the same extent. But, if anything, the “moral hazardproblem” has increased, not decreased, with each successive crisis.” (Stiglitz 1998, p. 18)
- 7 -BIS Review   46/1998by - and to - banks. After the crisis, the question can no longer be whether these flows should beregulated in some way. It can only be how.” (Wolf 1998b) “The evidence now seems clear that anysubstantial net draft on foreign savings creates huge risks. For countries with savings rates as high asthose of the east Asians such risks hardly seem worth running.” (Wolf 1998a) This last point is takenup by Stiglitz (1998, p. 5): “the East Asian countries, with their high savings rates, may have gottenrelatively little additional growth from the surge in capital flows”.With the focus on what might be done on short-term capital flows, there is particularinterest in the experience of Chile, which for a couple of decades has imposed substantial depositrequirements on capital inflow - a quasi-tax which impinges more heavily on short-term flows. Notethat the controls are on inflows, not outflows: the aim is to prevent the problem from arising, ratherthan attempt to clean up afterwards.22 No-one is arguing for countries to cut themselves off from thebenefits of foreign capital. Rather, the aim is to see how the benefits can be reaped while minimisingthe risks from volatility: in short (returning to Larry Summers’ analogy), how to make jet travelsafer. As part of this process, there is more interest in ensuring that there are no positive incentives infavour of short-term flows, for example, via the BIS capital adequacy requirements, or via specificinstitutional arrangements such as the Bangkok International Banking Facility.Where To From Here?The sort of reform discussed here is not going to be easy to implement. There isalways a tension between those who favour a pure laissez-faire version of the market, and those whosee a role for government in the international architecture.23 “It is ironic: the age of globalisationmay well be defined in part by challenges to the nation-state, but it is still states and governments -by the practices they adopt, the arrangements they enter into, and the safety nets they provide - thatwill determine whether we exploit or squander the potential of this era.” (Haass and Litan 1998, p. 6)Stiglitz (1998, p. 20) makes a similar point: “in approaching the challenges of globalization, we musteschew ideology and over-simplified models. We must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.. . . There are reforms to the international economic architecture that can bring the advantages ofglobalization, including global capital markets, while mitigating their risks. Arriving at a consensusabout those reforms will not be easy. But it is time for us to intensify the international dialogue onthese issues.”Australia could, if it chooses, play a role in this dialogue, out of proportion to itsmodest standing in world affairs. The Asian crisis is the starting point of the reassessment of theinternational architecture: while our understanding of Asia and the crisis is imperfect and no doubtdistorted in various ways, it may well be ahead of many of the larger countries which have tended todominate the debate.24 We have well-developed links - across a variety of disciplines - with our                                                     22 The Australian experience with Variable Deposit Requirements in the 1970s is also relevant. There is a common viewthat these were ineffective, and it would certainly have to be acknowledged that regulations such as this are by nomeans watertight. But it is worth noting that, at one stage, they worked too effectively, and were a major reason behindthe monetary squeeze of 1974, where the safety valve of capital flows was effectively blocked by the VDRs.23 Kindleberger (1989, p. 7), again, has a sensibly balanced view: “The position that markets generally work butoccasionally break down is widely at variance with the views at either of two extremes: that financial and commoditymarkets work perfectly in all times and places, or that they always work badly and should be replaced by planning orgovernmental assignments. On the contrary, I contend that markets work well on the whole, and can normally be reliedupon to decide the allocation of resources and, within limits, the distribution of income, but that occasionally marketswill be overwhelmed and need help. The dilemma, of course, is that if markets know in advance that help isforthcoming under generous dispensations, they break down more frequently and function less effectively.”24 In Australia, for example, there was a well-informed and bipartisan discussion when these issues came before theAustralian Parliament recently (House of Representatives, 26 March 1998), with both sides of politics exhibiting adepth of knowledge which has simply been absent from the legislative debate in America. In contrast, see, for example,Far Eastern Economic Review, 26 February 1998, p. 17.
- 8 -BIS Review   46/1998Asian counterparts. An Australian view may be less bound by narrow commercial interests thansome others. We have, ourselves, experienced some of the problems of volatile international capitalflows. We know something, too, of the trials, tribulations and benefits of a flexible exchange rateregime. Not least, because the international landscape matters more to us (as a small country on theperiphery of a culturally-different and diverse region which is fundamental to our economic future),we care more, so we will try harder to improve our international environment.The current international economic architecture has evolved in response to thedemands placed on it: many of these add-ons, lean-tos and ad hoc bricolage serve the purpose wellenough. But the original floor plan was drawn up in an earlier era and - more importantly for us - thebuilding committee was formed long ago and does not always represent today’s economic realities.We are, of course, represented on the IMF Executive Board, but with more than 180 members, ourvoice is small. We have a seat at the Bank for International Settlements, but this remains aEuropean-oriented institution. With the G22, we have a group that represents us and ourgeographical region in a way that did not occur in the older groups such as G10,25 but the future ofthis group is not assured: it represents a recognition that the old groupings need to be reworked, butthis has yet to be done definitively. We have shown a readiness and ability to provide key inputs intointernational economic relations,26 but we need to see this as a priority issue if we are to have ourvoice heard in the Councils of the World, and we need persistence and patience to reinforce ourcredentials.More regionally-focused groups could give us extra leverage. APEC is, of course, theover-arching regional framework. There are, in addition, a variety of smaller and more specialisedgroups - EMEAP (the East Asian central bankers group), the Manila Framework Group, Four/SixMarkets Group27 - which all have memberships relevant to Australia’s regional economic interests.These regional groups might be used, inter alia, to develop more co-ordinated positions and attitudesin worldwide forums, to influence the shape of the reformed structure.The challenge is to use the lessons of the Asian crisis to build a more stable, resilientinternational framework. Australia has good credentials to play an active role in this.                                                     25 Some of the important post-mortem discussions of the Mexican 1994/95 crisis took place within the G10 (e.g. the “ReyReport”), but as G10 includes only one Asian country (Japan), the opportunity for interaction with this region wasminimal.26 The Australian Treasury played a vital role in fashioning one piece of the New Architecture - the still-pending NewArrangements to Borrow, the successor to the narrowly-based GAB.27 For discussion of these regional arrangements, see Grenville (1998c).

BIS Review   45/1998Ms. Hämäläinen discusses achieving a credible currency for Europe   Addressby the Governor of the Bank of Finland, Ms. Sirkka Hämäläinen, at the Frankfurt InternationalBanking Evening on 5/5/98.…First of all I would like to thank the hosts of this evening for giving me theopportunity to address this distinguished audience in these historical surroundings. It is a greathonour and privilege for me.With the historical decision reached at last weekend’s European summit, we nowknow that a common monetary policy will become reality for eleven EU countries at thebeginning of next year. A long, intense process - a process that has had its doubters and criticsalong the way - has now passed an important milestone.Setting forth on this historical project was in itself a tremendous achievement, butthe real challenges still lie ahead. The participating countries must now make this project succeedand achieve its intended objectives. The project must deliver unquestioned monetary stability andefficiency to the euro-area, and thereby provide a solid basis for growth and employment inEurope.As part of the overall stabilization and convergence achieved by the participatingcountries and as a result of the strengthening of market confidence, we have seen wideconvergence in interest and exchange rates. This will ease the transition to a single monetarypolicy, but the crucial question remains: How do we make the euro credible from the start, sothat the ESCB doesn’t have to resort to an unnecessarily tight monetary policy?At the end of the day, strong credibility is what ensures low inflation expectations,low inflation and low interest rates.Credibility is built up from many elements, building blocks if you will. Eventhough the ECB starts its operations without a track record and without its own history ofcredibility, a number of these critical elements already exist. All in all, I would like to identifyseven building blocks that are important for the ESCB’s credibility.1.The first building block is the credibility the ECB may inherit from the national central banksof the participating countries. All NCBs in the euro area have conducted monetary policiesaimed at price stability and convergence in accord with the principles of the MaastrichtTreaty.2.The second building block is the ESCB’s uncontested independence. This will giveinstitutional credibility from the outset.3.The third building block is the transparency and clarity of the ECB’s strategy and aims. TheECB’s primary final objective is price stability. This final objective will before 1999 beoperationalized and quantified in a way that is meaningful and understandable to the marketsand the public at large.The ECB’s monetary policy will be geared towards a “domestic” objective, internal pricestability within the euro area while the euro is allowed to float against other world currencies.The fact is that the share of foreign trade in GDP for the euro area is approximately the same
- 2 -BIS Review   45/1998as for the US, about 10 per cent, so the exchange rate will probably not have much of animpact on the euro area price stability or the monetary policy stance, even indirectly.Certainly, it would be expedient to quantify and to announce the target “ price stability”, forexample, in the form of a target range or an approximate value. This, and what kinds ofintermediate monetary aggregate targets could or should be used to communicate themonetary policy stance to the markets, the public and policy-makers, are still underconsideration. I will therefore not go further into this topic, except to note that formulatingmonetary policy strategy and the definition and specification of its policy will be one of thefirst and most important issues on which the ECB must decide.The problem of intermediate targets is that we lack Europe-wide empirical evidence on thestability of demand-for-money functions and on the monetary policy transmission mechanismin general. What we can say with certainty at this point - and this is not too productive - is thatthe analysis of the monetary policy transmission mechanism will be a truly challenging task.The financial market and structural changes produced by the single currency, as well as thegeneral continuous structural changes in the financial markets due to globalization, aretransforming the transmission processes.All the central banks carefully distill vast amounts of data and examine many differentindicators before they decide on policy. Thus, quantitative targets are not perhaps so importantfor the internal decision-making process of the central bank. But they are very important forcommunication with the markets and the public. How useful they are for this purpose dependsvery much on their predictability.4.The fourth building block - which partly covers the previous one - is the wider overallopenness of the central bank towards the markets, the public and policy-makers, not only in itsstrategy and targeting but also in its analyses and reasoning behind its decisions.A high degree of market transparency is natural for any central bank operating in a marketenvironment, because transparency essentially increases the efficiency of monetary policy.Without doubt, the ESCB has to, and will, consider all possible means and channels toachieve it.Another central aspect of openness is what is loosely called “democratic accountability”.Confidence of the public and the political decision-making bodies that represent the public isof utmost importance for the credibility of an independent central bank. This confidence canonly be achieved if information provided by the central bank to the public is clear, and if thereis a healthy dialogue between the central bank and political decision-making bodies.The Maastricht Treaty provides a framework for accountability at the European level; nationallegislation of the member states provides a similar framework for national accountability. Theeuro will require the acceptance and support of citizens and policy-makers in eachparticipating member state. Thus, accountability at the national level will be very important.In practice, democratic accountability should be the outcome of constructive communicationbetween the central bank and political decision-making bodies - connected with completecentral bank independence. There should not be any genuine conflict between the central bankon the one hand and the other policy-makers and the public on the other hand because they allshare a common ultimate goal under EMU, monetary stability and economic growth.
- 3 -BIS Review   45/19985.The fifth building block, and one of the most important elements in the credibility of the euro,is the stance and discipline of fiscal policies, both in individual member states and in the euroarea as a whole.Fiscal policy affects credibility in two ways. The first has to do with how well national fiscalpolicies cope with differences in the business cycle and in the monetary policy transmissionmechanisms of the member states. Under a single monetary policy, national fiscal policiesneed to be far more active and flexible than at present to deal successfully withcountry specific growth and inflation differences. Both room to manoeuvre at the nationallevel and the Stability and Growth Pact explicitly demand that the public finances of themember state are balanced and healthy.The second aspect of fiscal policy, closely connected to the first, is the overall degree of fiscalpolicy discipline in the euro area. Curbing inflation expectations and achieving the inflationtarget are the more easily attained with low interest rates, the more disciplined the fiscalpolicy at the European level.It is of vital importance that a close and constructive dialogue is organized and establishedbetween the ministers of finance of the participating countries (EURO-11) and the EuropeanCentral Bank. Such a dialogue does not in any way endanger the ECB’s independence topursue its legislated objective price stability.Simultaneously, the role of national central banks and their dialogue with the national fiscalpolicy authorities will continue to be essential; in achieving an appropriate monetary andfiscal policy mix at the European level, and in ensuring balanced economic performance ineach country under the single monetary policy.6.The sixth building block of credibility for the European Central Bank and the stability of theeuro, is a high standard of economic and monetary analysis within the ESCB. High-qualitywork encourages confidence in the expertise of the system in a new environment where thisanalysis and know-how must cover the entire euro area. Here, the skills, knowledge andexpertise accumulated in national central banks will be put to good use in the preparation ofthe single monetary policy.As you have noticed, I have repeatedly stressed the importance of national central banks in theEuropean System of Central Banks. Let me say very firmly that I am not doing it out ofparochial concerns or motives. What we need is an ECB that is strong and efficient. In today’seleven-country constellation the ECB needs to mobilize the support of the national centralbanks.The governors of the national central banks will have a central role in the Governing Councilof the ECB where decisions on monetary policy as well as decisions on systems andinstitutional arrangements will be made. Operations and transactions will be decentralized andcarried out in the national central banks. The skills and accumulated knowledge of thenational central banks will form an integral part of the preparation of joint decisions. TheNCBs will also play a major communications role by providing information at the nationallevel and helping to define the fiscal and monetary policy mix for both the national and theentire euro area. And finally, the national central banks will bear a great responsibility in
- 4 -BIS Review   45/1998ensuring the legitimacy of the independent ESCB through their contributions to transparencyand democratic accountability.7.While I stress here the role of the national central banks, I also want to stress very stronglythat the seventh, and one of the most important building blocks of the credibility and stabilityof the euro and the efficiency of the single monetary policy will be the ability of the governorsof the national central banks to base their analyses, actions and decisions on the interests ofthe euro area as a whole.Although one of the tasks of any governor of a national central bank is to bring nationalinformation and viewpoints into the decision-making process, there is no conflict with theinterests of the euro area.Adopting a euro area-wide viewpoint will be a demanding and immediate challenge for theEuropean System of Central Banks. This challenge makes me believe that it is not a good ideato publish the minutes and the voting positions of the Governing Council meetings, eventhough transparency and accountability of the European System of Central Banks are veryimportant. The publication of the discussions and voting positions could easily lead todramatization of national differences of opinion at the expense of euro-level views.*       *       *During the 1990s, Finland has gone through severe adjustments. We haveconsolidated our public finances and achieved credibility for our monetary policy. For us Finns,the single monetary policy is a natural continuation of this process. In global, expectation-drivenfinancial markets, a small country has poor possibilities to ensure its exchange rate and interestrate stability, even with a highly disciplined fiscal and monetary policy and sound economicfundamentals. For us, the stability and credibility that we expect from EMU, and its discipline,are of vital importance.
BIS Review   44/1998Mr. Liebscher discusses the role of a national central bank within the ESCBas illustrated by the OeNB   Address by the President of the Austrian National Bank,Dr. Klaus Liebscher, held at the 26th Economics Conference of the OesterreichischeNationalbank on the topic “Economic Policy 2000”, in Vienna on 7-8/5/98.IntroductionJust a few days ago, the key political decisions which will pave the way to EMUwere taken at the summit in Brussels. Based upon the preparatory work of the EuropeanMonetary Institute, the Commission and ECOFIN, the Council of the Heads of State or ofGovernment agreed last weekend to start Stage Three of EMU on January 1, 1999, with elevencountries. At the same time, the bilateral exchange rates for the participating currencies, whichare to form the basis for their euro conversion rates, were preannounced. The European CentralBank will be formally inaugurated in Frankfurt on June 30, and EMU will commence onschedule on January 1, 1999. These developments have provided the financial markets withreliable points of reference that will contribute substantially to a calculable development ofexchange rates and interest rates until the onset of EMU.The general public and the financial markets are now convinced that EMU willbecome reality in just a few months’ time. By comparison, people know much less about theinstitutions that will be responsible for the single monetary policy and, in particular, about therelationships among them. Will there still be a place left within EMU for today’s national centralbanks? And if so, which tasks are they going to keep once monetary policy is made in Frankfurt?These are questions that are frequently asked. And the answers are indeed quite complex.The basic institutional framework of the European System of Central Banks as defined in theESCB/ECB StatuteA superficial glance at the ESCB/ECB Statute lets things appear quite simple.• The establishment of the ECB in mid-1998 will coincide with the foundation ofthe European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The ESCB will consist of theECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of the EU member states. FromJanuary 1, 1999, the ESCB will have the sole responsibility for the singlemonetary policy within the euro area. In performing its tasks, the ESCB will beindependent of any political instructions and will be committed to the primaryobjective of price stability.• The ESCB will be governed by the ECB’s decision-making bodies, led by theECB Governing Council, which will consist of six members of the ECBExecutive Board, including the ECB President and Vice-President, as well asthe governors of the NCBs of the euro area. Monetary policy decisions will be
- 2 -BIS Review   44/1998taken centrally, by a simple majority of the ECB Governing Council and basedon the principle of “one member, one vote”.• The ECB Executive Board will conduct monetary policy in accordance with theguidelines and decisions adopted by the ECB Governing Council. In doing so,it will issue the necessary instructions to national central banks.• The national central banks will form an integral part of the ESCB and act inaccordance with the guidelines and instructions issued by the ECB. Inconducting operations within the ESCB’s field of competence, the ECB willrely on the national central banks whenever possible and appropriate.• Finally, a so-called “General Council” will be constituted as a thirddecision-making body. It will assume responsibility for the coordination andexchange of information between the euro area and EU central banks whichhave not yet adopted the single currency, but will not exercise any influence onthe monetary policy of the euro area.Ample room for manoeuvre in practical implementationThis, in a nutshell, is the ESCB/ECB Statute. Its apparently quite straightforwardstructure allows ample room for manoeuvre in actual practice. The European Monetary Institutein fact devoted quite a substantial part of its preparatory work on EMU to the concreteassignment of duties and the establishment of procedures within the ESCB.Let me just quote a few examples of questions that had to be resolved incompliance with the ESCB Statute: Who within the ESCB will conduct monetary policyoperations? Who will intervene in the exchange markets? Who will manage the foreign exchangereserves? Do we, inside the euro area, still need national balance-of-payments statistics? Wherewill the commercial banks keep their central bank accounts? Which bodies within the ESCB areto have access to the TARGET cross-border payment system? Who will issue euro banknotes?Who will print them? Where does the monetary income from the creation of central bank moneyoriginate: at the ECB or at the national central banks? And how is it going to be distributedwithin the ESCB? Who will prepare the documents for the meetings of the ECB GoverningCouncil? Will there still be committees of experts delegated by the national central banks to atleast help prepare the decisions of the ECB Governing Council? How large should the ECB beby comparison to the national central banks and how much staff will it need?Each of these questions – and here I have picked out just a few – has beendiscussed by the EMI at great length. Most of them have been fully resolved – even though initialpositions were sometimes diametrically opposed. In some cases, transitional rules were agreedfor the initial phase of monetary union; they may then have to be adjusted in the light ofexperience gained. Legal instruments have been prepared wherever necessary. When the ECB is
- 3 -BIS Review   44/1998established a few weeks from now, one of its first tasks will be to wind up the discussions andendorse all of this preliminary work done by the EMI.The philosophy underlying the organization of the ESCBHow, in the light of the EMI’s preparatory activities, will tasks and duties bedistributed within the ESCB? What role will the national central banks play?The basic philosophy in organizing the ESCB is to have all decisions takencentrally by the ECB; in effect, decisions on all fundamental issues will be taken by the ECB’sGoverning Council. This is the only way in which the uniformity of the single monetary policycan be ensured across the euro area. The implementation of decisions - that is operations, whichin practice account for most of a national central bank’s work - is effected by the national centralbanks on a decentralized basis, coordinated by the ECB Executive Board. Like a red thread, thesetwo principles – centralized decisions and guidelines, decentralized implementation – govern allthe ESCB’s operations.At this point, three concepts must be explained. The first relates to the ESCB’stasks and functions. The Maastricht Treaty provides a very clear definition of those areas whichfrom Stage Three of EMU will fall within the Community’s field of competence. Thus the basictasks to be carried out by the ESCB are to define and implement the monetary policy of the euroarea, to conduct foreign exchange operations in accordance with the exchange rate policy of theeuro area, to hold and manage the official foreign reserves of the member states, and to promotethe smooth operation of payment systems. In the area of the prudential supervision of banks andfinancial markets, the ESCB only contributes to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by thecompetent authorities. In addition to these basic tasks, the national central banks are free toperform other tasks, provided they are not incompatible with the objectives of the singlemonetary policy.The second item requiring an explanation is the legal form of the ESCB. TheESCB has no legal personality of its own. Only its components – the ECB and the nationalcentral banks – have legal personality. The term ESCB therefore only refers to the fact that theECB and the national central banks are integral parts of a whole that is guided by a common setof rules, objectives and duties in both its internal and external relations. This underlines thefederal character of the ESCB and the institutional role of the national central banks as equalpartners within the ESCB.The third concept that needs to be explained is the principle of “subsidiarity”.Under the principle of subsidiarity, the distribution of all responsibilities and tasks must allowfor a maximum degree of freedom, while at the same time paying due regard to the body politic.Centralized entities should not monopolize tasks that can be performed by decentralized units.The centralized entity is to focus on the functions it has to perform in the interest of society as awhole. The European Union incorporated the principle of subsidiarity in the Maastricht Treaty:
- 4 -BIS Review   44/1998In areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action onlyif and insofar as the objectives of a proposed action cannot be satisfactorily achieved by themember states. How then is the principle of subsidiarity to be applied to monetary union? Thetransfer of monetary policy from the national to the higher Community level is based on theconviction that this is in the general economic interest. Only the actual implementation ofmonetary policy may – and shall – remain the responsibility of the smaller entities, that is, thenational central banks “to the extent deemed possible and appropriate”. Consequently, when wespeak about subsidiarity in the context of EMU, we must distinguish carefully between monetarypolicy decisions and their implementation. In the former case, the principle of subsidiarityprovides the motive for centralization, in the latter it is the incentive for decentralization.Five areas of responsibility of National Central BanksAgainst this background, five key areas of responsibility or functions can beidentified for the national central banks. First, the national central bank governors will activelycontribute to all central decision-making processes within the ESCB. In this context the nationalcentral banks will, second, serve as intermediaries between the single monetary policy andnational economic policies. Third, they will act as the ESCB’s operative entities in carrying outmonetary and foreign exchange policies as well as policies relating to payment systems and incompiling monetary and balance-of-payments statistics. Fourth, the national central banks willcontribute the ECB’s capital and, as “the owners” of the ECB, also receive their share of ECBincome. Fifth, the national central banks, apart from being ESCB member banks, will continue toexist as independent institutions outside the ESCB’s scope of responsibility and as such will befree to perform additional functions on their own responsibility. Let me now explore these fivefunctions in greater detail.1. Participation in decision-making by the ECB Governing CouncilThe first area of responsibility relates to the NCBs’ participation in decision-making processes. As already mentioned, the ECB Governing Council will consist of the sixmembers of the ECB Executive Board and, for the time being, the eleven governors of NCBs. Atthe start, the ratio between members of the ECB Executive Board and national central bankgovernors will therefore be about one to two. This predominance of NCB governors in ECBdecision-making will safeguard that, based on European central banking experience, the requiredmeasure of continuity is achieved in spite of the significant changes on an institutional level.The ECB Governing Council takes monetary policy decisions by a simplemajority. Each member of the ECB Governing Council has one vote. This also applies to NCBgovernors, regardless of whether they are from a small or a large country. This reflects theintention of the Treaty, according to which central bank governors are to serve on the ECBGoverning Council as individuals, not as “country delegates” or representatives of their
- 5 -BIS Review   44/1998institutions. They are committed to Community objectives and the tasks of the ESCB and areexpected to consider the monetary policy needs of the euro area as a whole. The Treaty thereforeattaches particular importance to the independence of the members of the ECB Executive Boardand the national central bank governors. To ensure their personal independence, the ESCBStatute defines certain minimum requirements, including a minimum term of office andprotection from early dismissal. These are additional safeguards against attempts to exertpressure by way of instructions or other influence. The prohibition to issue instructions to NCBgovernors applies in fact to all types of bodies, both external and internal, including thedecision-making body of the respective national central bank. The Treaty deliberately refrainsfrom providing for the disclosure of the minutes of ECB Governing Council meetings and votescast by the individual members of the ECB Governing Council in order to assist them in actingresponsibly, to the benefit of the euro area as a whole.The call on the members of the ECB Governing Council to think “European” hasalso been underlined in economic theory as a necessary prerequisite for defining the best possiblemonetary policy for the entire euro area. Let us assume, for example, that Austria and a numberof other small and medium-sized countries commanding a majority of votes on the ECBGoverning Board together are enjoying a boom. Let us further assume that Germany and France,which together account for well over half of the GDP of the euro area, are passing through aperiod of recession. If in such a situation the central bank governors of the small countries usedtheir majority of votes to raise interest rates in the euro area in order to dampen their overheatedeconomies, they would be opting for a measure inconsistent with the monetary policy needs ofthe euro area as a whole. This example, of course, is mere conjecture, a case which is quiteunlikely to develop, particularly as we may expect the business cycles of the euro area countriesto continue to converge as they have for the past few years. The example nevertheless serves toillustrate the principle that monetary policy decisions of the ESCB must always be to the benefitof the euro area as a whole and must not cater to national interests.This also shows very clearly how important it is for each national central bank tohave its own macro-economic analyses available for the meetings of the ECB GoverningCouncil. The staff of the ECB Executive Board in Frankfurt will certainly draw up a full set ofdata and analyses, which will be available to all members of the Governing Council. NCBgovernors will, however, be well advised to have their own analyses of developments in the euroarea and the global economy, prepared by their in-house staff of economists and statisticalexperts, possibly dealing in greater detail with issues of particular interest from a governor’s ownperspective. The example of the Federal Reserve System in the United States shows thatwell-prepared information is an indispensable decision aid for the participants of meetings atwhich monetary policy decisions have to be taken. The sounder and more compelling thearguments that a central bank governor presents to the ECB Governing Council, the greater his orher chance to convince the other members.
- 6 -BIS Review   44/1998The experience of the Federal Reserve System also demonstrates that national –regional, in the US – central banks can find their own market niches in research and analysis. Forthe OeNB, for example, I would see a comparative advantage in studies on the transitioncountries.2. Public relations agent and interface between the single monetary policy and national economicpoliciesA second important role of national central banks resulting from the first one is toact as public relations agents and interfaces between the single monetary policy on the one handand the public and economic policy-makers on the other hand. The ESCB’s – as indeed anycentral bank’s – successful implementation of the single monetary policy will dependsubstantially on its ability to communicate effectively with the general public and economicpolicy-makers.Like any central bank today, the ESCB will have to keep citizens informed aboutits strategy and the motives behind any action it takes. This is the only way to ensure that theEuropean public will understand, endorse and support its monetary policy. For a number ofreasons, the national central banks will have a central role to play in this context. They are theones best acquainted with their countries’ weak spots and special concerns. They speak thelanguage of the people in the countries they represent – both literally and metaphorically. Theyhave enjoyed the population’s confidence for many years. They have a close network of formaland informal communication channels. And they have the resources required for public relationswork that will reach the general public, a task which may prove time-consuming and make hugedemands on an NCB’s manpower resources. The national central banks are therefore ideallyplaced for conducting the ESCB’s public relations activities in the participating countries. Carewill have to be taken, however, to ensure that such decentralized public relations efforts will stillfollow a clear common line.A second central aspect of the NCBs’ intermediary function is their role as acommunication channel to national economic policy-makers. It is in the nature of EMU that onesingle monetary and exchange rate policy will apply to the entire euro area. Different nationalmonetary policy stances to balance differences in economic developments and structures are nolonger possible. The balance must therefore be achieved by means of other economic policyinstruments, i.e. the national fiscal, income and structural policies.These areas of economic policy are of course beyond the central banks’ immediatescope of competence. It is, however, part of the central banks’ responsibility to alert economicpolicy-makers at the national level as well as the public to any adjustments that may benecessary. This is the only way to make sure that the euro area member states will be able to reapfull benefit from EMU and to minimize potential disadvantages. Here, it will be of centralimportance that budgetary policies are closely coordinated at the national level, that government
- 7 -BIS Review   44/1998budgets are put on a sound footing in accordance with the provisions of the Growth and StabilityPact and more flexibility is aimed at in economic structures.Ideally, EMU will be an incentive for EU governments to tackle pendingeconomic reforms more swiftly and with more determination. Thus, EMU could act as a catalystin European economic development. The significant reform efforts undertaken in the past monthsand years in all of the EU member states in the run-up to EMU make me confident that thispositive scenario is attainable. In fact, to some extent EMU has already had highly beneficialimpacts on economic policy in recent years, although it has not even started yet. We must beaware, however, that the reforms that have been initiated must now be continued and thatparticipation in EMU requires an increased readiness for permanent change and reform.As it has been possible during the last year to convince the Austrian population ofthe benefits of the euro, I trust that it will be equally possible to motivate the citizens of Europeto take up the structural reforms that will have to accompany the euro if its full rewards are to bereaped. Here the NCBs will have to play an important role as mediators, coordinators and publicrelations agents in issues dictated by a single monetary policy within the entire euro area and theeconomic policies of the member states. Drawing on their economic expertise, the nationalcentral banks will be able to provide valuable assistance to economic policy-makers at thenational level in formulating arguments for the reforms needed. Being independent institutions,however, they should also stand ready to act as the voice of reason and alert economicpolicy-makers in due time if necessary.3. The National Central Banks as operative entities of the ESCBLet me now move on to the third key function of the national central banks. TheNCBs will be the operative entities of the ESCB. Preparatory work by the EMI has shown thatdecentralization of a very large portion of the central banks’ operative activities is both“possible” and “appropriate”. Using advanced information technology, money market tenderoperations, for example, can be conducted on a decentralized basis at reasonable expense.At the same time, the benefits of a decentralized approach are quite obvious. Itwill permit the use of the NCBs’ infrastructure and the benefit of their experience in conductingmonetary policy and other operations. Watching their national financial markets evolve, thenational central banks have accumulated a wealth of experience over the decades. At the earlystage of monetary union, these markets will still differ substantially. In order to guaranteenevertheless equal and fair access to central bank liquidity for the large number of the ESCB’scounterparties, the national central banks will assume an indispensable function as intermediariesbetween the ECB’s monetary policy decisions and the counterparties of the ESCB. The nationalcentral banks will also be best placed to monitor, on a continuous basis, the rapid and substantialchanges in the conduct of market players triggered by monetary union itself. This will ensure thatthe ESCB’s monetary policy instruments retain their effectiveness and efficiency even in a
- 8 -BIS Review   44/1998rapidly changing environment.The national central banks will therefore conduct open market transactions andother monetary policy operations with the banks in accordance with instructions issued by theECB. Upon decision of the ECB, they will intervene on the foreign exchange markets. They willprint and issue banknotes. The commercial banks will maintain their minimum reserves with thenational central banks if such reserves are going to be an instrument of monetary policy – which Iwould indeed advocate. The national central banks will supervise payment transactions, acting assystem operators in large-volume payments. They will collect statistical data, and they willcontinue to cooperate in monetary policy-making on an international level, as in the IMF andthe BIS.Let me mention just two examples to illustrate the national centralbanks’ important function in operative business: First, let us consider their role in monetarypolicy operations within the ESCB. As a rule, decisions with regard to instruments used toallocate or withdraw liquidity on the initiative of the ESCB will be taken centrally by the ECB.However, their implementation and administration - carried out in line with the ECB’sinstructions - will largely be the responsibility of the national central banks. Open marketoperations will for the most part remain the exclusive task of the national central banks. Theseinclude regular weekly tender operations with a term of two weeks, regular monthly longer-termrefinancing operations with a term of three months, structural open-market operations and,possibly, the issuance of central bank debt certificates. Only fine-tuning operations, outrighttransactions, foreign exchange swaps and the acceptance of time deposits may in exceptionalcases be executed directly by the ECB upon decision of the ECB’s Governing Council. Asregards standing facilities, i.e., the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility, banks will bedealing only with the NCBs. Minimum reserves will also be held exclusively by the nationalcentral banks.The second example relates to the administration of foreign reserves. The ECBwill be provided with foreign reserve assets for possible interventions in the exchange marketsand to support confidence in the euro. Initially, these foreign reserve assets will amount to a totalequivalent to up to EUR 50 billion (about ATS 700 billion). In the starting phase, the OeNB willtherefore transfer up to about ATS 16 billion of its foreign reserves to the ECB. The nationalcentral banks will continue to manage the transferred foreign reserves on behalf of the ECB on afiduciary basis, in compliance with the ECB’s investment rules. The predominant part ofAustria’s foreign currency reserves will be retained and invested by the OeNB. Transactions bynational central banks involving such foreign currency reserves will be governed by guidelines inorder to prevent any possible undesirable impact on the monetary and foreign exchange policiesof the euro area. Very large foreign currency reserve transactions will even require the approvalof the ECB.
- 9 -BIS Review   44/1998As these two examples clearly illustrate, the operative framework of the ESCB asprepared by the EMI heavily relied on the national central banks’ existing resources and merelyconfers the decision-making powers on the ECB.4. Holders of the capital of the ECBWhat kind of role will the national central banks be playing as the “holders of thecapital” of the ECB? The ECB will have a subscribed capital of EUR 5 billion (aboutATS 70 billion). The national central banks will be the sole subscribers to and holders of thecapital of the ECB. Only the NCBs participating in the euro area member states will pay up theirshare in the capital. The capital subscription of the national central banks is based on a weightingof 50% for the share of the respective Member State in the population of the Community and50% for the share of the respective Member State in the GDP of the Community. The OeNB’sshare will amount to about 2.3% or some EUR 115 million (approx. ATS 1.6 billion). Based oneleven countries participating in monetary union from the start, the OeNB’s share in thesubscribed capital will be 2.9%.Capital subscription entitles the OeNB to a proportionate share in the ECB’sprofit. The key for determining the share of capital to be paid up will also be instrumental indetermining the distribution of monetary income earned by the national central banks from theissuance of central bank money. Under the ESCB’s Statute, the monetary income of allparticipating national central banks will be paid into a common pool and then redistributed inaccordance with the key for capital subscription. This procedure was chosen because it isimpossible to predict the regional distribution of central bank money creation within themonetary union. Incidentally, this is not a problem, as the entire euro area will be a singlecurrency area with identical money market rates and uniformly applicable terms governing theallocation of central bank money. However, to ensure an equitable distribution of income fromthe creation of money within the ESCB, a profit distribution mechanism will be installed. Atleast in the early phase of monetary union, however, there will still be substantial differences inthe central banks’ balance sheets owing to national differences in the use of cash, payments andsavings habits. Consequently, transitional arrangements have to be made for the initial periodbefore the monetary income distribution mechanism can be introduced. Once the structures ofnational financial markets and the circulation of banknotes and coins begin to converge, it willbecome easier to define an appropriate approach to the gradual introduction of the monetaryincome distribution mechanism.5. Other activities remaining within the NCBs’ responsibilityLet me now come to the last area of central bank activities. Beside their functionas an “integral part of the ESCB” the national central banks frequently perform a number ofspecific duties they have grown into in the course of their history. Such public duties above all
- 10 -BIS Review   44/1998include tasks relating to the supervision of banks and financial markets, carried out either directlyin their function as a supervisory authority or as an expert pool supporting the authorities chargedwith banking supervision. Some central banks prepare analyses of the financial statements ofcompanies established in their countries in connection with their use of instruments of monetarypolicy and as a service to the business community. Sometimes, central banks are involved in thegovernment programs for the promotion of exports and research. Beyond that, central banksfrequently provide financial services to public entities. Some central banks manage accounts forprivate-sector customers, much like commercial banks. Other central banks hold interests inproduction or service industries, which may be for commercial or strategic reasons.The Statute of the ESCB does not envisage any forceful dismantling or unificationof the structures that each national central bank has developed in the course of time. They aretherefore free to choose their own legal form and organization. However, it must be clearlypointed out that any national central bank will perform such additional tasks within its ownresponsibility and for its own account and that such tasks are not deemed to be part of ESCBactivities. Furthermore, the ECB Governing Council may decide by a two-thirds majority thatcertain activities fail to comply with the contractual and statutory tasks and duties of the ESCBand may decree their discontinuation. Previous work by the EMI on this issue, particularlystudies on legal convergence, indicate that restrictions will be imposed only if such an activitythreatens to impair the single monetary policy.Restructuring of the OeNB in the Run-Up to Monetary Union…The fundamental reorganization of central banking in Europe associated withmonetary union has also required restructuring of the OeNB, involving several levels:The first of these levels relates to the transformation from a central bank in itsown right to an integral part of the ESCB. The goal and strategy of monetary policy, itsintermediate target as well as the monetary policy instruments must be harmonized with those ofthe ESCB. The OeNB initiated this development already several years ago in order to ensure assmooth a transition as possible for Austria’s financial system. After decades of stability-orientedpolicies, the transition to the monetary policy goal laid down in the Maastricht Treaty actuallyinvolved no change for us. The move from an intermediate exchange rate target to a new strategywas preceded in the OeNB by preparatory studies and the development of the required know-howthrough research work. Moreover, in recent years the OeNB gradually transformed its monetarypolicy instruments into market-oriented instruments. The remaining adjustments to be made incooperation with the banks are already far advanced.A second aspect is the review of the OeNB’s areas of operation. The OeNB will inessence continue its activities in all of its previous areas of responsibility also after Austria’sentry into Stage Three of monetary union. In many fields, however, the focus will change moreor less markedly. The OeNB’s macroeconomic analyses, for example, will cover monetary policy
- 11 -BIS Review   44/1998in the entire euro area in order to provide the best possible briefing to the OeNB Governor aheadof the regular conferences of the ECB’s Governing Council. On the other hand, the impact of asingle monetary policy on the Austrian economy will have to be identified and recommendationsworked out for domestic economic policies. Furthermore, the economic development of ourneighboring countries in the east will remain of key interest to the OeNB’s analytical work. Ialready mentioned the changes in the operative aspects of monetary policy. The OeNB willcontinue these activities within the ESCB. The OeNB will also continue to collect monetary andbalance-of-payments statistics in Austria, albeit in a form that has been harmonized for the entireeuro area. In the area of payment systems, monetary union has provided a fresh impetus to theOeNB. The OeNB has developed and successfully implemented ARTIS (Austrian Real-TimeInterbank Settlement), a new payment system meeting European requirements and ready forintegration into TARGET, the European payment system, from Jan. 1, 1999. The OeNB has alsomade intensive and thorough preparations for the production and distribution of the future eurobanknotes. The design contest for the future euro banknotes was won by a graphic artistemployed with the OeNB. By setting up a new printing works for banknotes, the OeNB has therequired technology in place for the production of euro banknotes. In the field of bankingsupervision, the current responsibilities of the OeNB are in no way affected by the establishmentof the ESCB. Monetary union will, however, intensify and speed up restructuring processes inthe European financial markets. More market transparency, increased cross-border competition,progressive disintermediation and rising financial exposure against a background of much moreclosely knit world financial markets will pose formidable challenges to the bodies responsible forsupervising financial markets and banks. The OeNB responds to this situation with a staff ofqualified employees and active participation in the ever tighter international coordination ofsupervisory authorities.On a third level, the reorganization involves legal and organizational restructuringof the OeNB. The Austrian central bank has a long tradition as an independent institution. Therequirement under the Treaty of Maastricht to harmonize the central bank statutes with theprovisions of the Treaty by the time the ESCB is established therefore implied no major changein the OeNB’s role as a central bank. Nevertheless, two areas required adjustments, spelled out ina recently adopted amendment to the Oesterreichische Nationalbank Act. On the one hand, theinstitutional framework ensuring the independence of the OeNB decision-making bodies had tobe defined in greater detail. The distribution of powers between the OeNB General Council andthe Board of Executive Directors was adapted and the functions of Governor and Vice-Governornewly introduced. Furthermore, the article in the Nationalbank Act which defines the OeNB’stasks and objectives was revised to comply with the formulation of objectives as laid down in theMaastricht Treaty. Secondly, the provisions regulating duties and instruments were revised toensure the OeNB’s integration into the ESCB.Outlook – the road to monetary union as an evolutionary process
- 12 -BIS Review   44/1998…The establishment of EMU and the ESCB is an evolutionary process. Duringthe past few years all of the EU member states have undergone a remarkable process ofeconomic convergence, which has not been confined to compliance with the convergence criteriaalone. More specifically, we have seen a clear approximation of economic policy goals and themeasures considered appropriate for achieving these goals. There is no doubt among thegovernments of EU member states today about the necessity of a stable monetary environmentand sound government budgets as a basis for sustainable growth. Continuation andintensification of the convergence process in the national economies and economic policies overthe next few years will be critical to the success of EMU. There must be further pressure forstructural reforms designed to make the economy more flexible. Fiscal policy must aim at aconscientious implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. Government budgets must bebalanced to recover leeway for fiscal policy that has largely been lost in recent years. Thesechanges do not meet us unprepared. They merely continue reforms initiated in the past andpresent steps that would have been necessary in any case, even without EMU.The beginning of monetary union marks a change in paradigms governing theinteraction of the institutions that shape economic policies in Europe. The change has an impacton the relations between central banks and other economic policy-makers at both the Communityand the national levels. The role played by the national central banks will also changedramatically within the ESCB. However, the change will not come as an unexpected shock, butrather as the result of many years of preparatory activities. All of the institutions involved havetaken part in these preparations, contributing their know-how and experience. Those responsiblefor economic and monetary policies in the national finance ministries and central banks as wellas in the Commission and in the EMI will largely be serving in similar positions within EMU,thereby ensuring continuity.The degree of mutual convergence already achieved is particularly apparent inmonetary policy and central banking. Coordination of monetary and exchange rate policieswithin the EMS over the past twenty years and preparations for monetary union since the early1990s have resulted in an impressive convergence in the perception of the role and tasks ofmonetary policy and of the overruling target of price stability. This was also highlighted veryclearly in the convergence reports of the EMI and the Commission. The financial markets haverewarded these efforts by a convergence of interest rates and stable exchange rates. Today, all ofthe EU central banks participating in the euro area from January 1, 1999, are independent,committed to the primary target of price stability and have already largely adapted their monetarypolicy instruments to the future needs of the ESCB. The ECB will bring together what is best inthe traditions of the European central banks. The same central bank governors who areresponsible today for their countries’ stability-oriented monetary policies will be shaping themonetary policy for the euro in their function as members of the ECB Governing Council. Allthese arguments give me the confidence that the ECB will be able to enjoy, from the very
- 13 -BIS Review   44/1998beginning, the same credibility that the most successful central banks of the ESCB have had inthe past.The principle of evolution will also – and very much so – apply to the futuredistribution of duties within the ESCB and thus to the national central banks’ role within theSystem. The histories of the few existing central bank systems organized on federal principlesshow that the assignment of tasks and duties within such a system may undergo substantialchanges over the years in the light of practical experience. Let us take a final look at the USFederal Reserve System. When this system was first established, it was extremely decentralized.As new experience was gained, decision-making on monetary policies as well as the operativebranch of monetary policy were centralized. By this I certainly do not wish to imply that theoperative activities of the ESCB will be moving towards centralization. The Fed and the ESCBare developing against vastly different historical and political backgrounds. The EuropeanMonetary Union is a union of independent states, whereas the Fed System operates in a unifiednation. Accordingly, unlike the countries within EMU, not every US state has its own FederalReserve Bank. Communications and information technology are, moreover, infinitely moreadvanced today so that the decentralized management of the ESCB’s operative activities will bemuch easier to organize than it was in the Federal Reserve System at the beginning of thiscentury. The history of the Fed would, however, suggest that the organization of the ESCB, too,may be subject to an evolutionary process in the course of time, and that the exact direction ofthis evolution will be influenced by experience gained in the conduct of monetary policy.Much will also depend on the direction in which the European Union will bemoving as a whole. To the extent to which integration advances, to which national bordersbecome more and more insignificant and to which political union increasingly takes shape, aparallel development might take place within the ESCB. Political and general economicintegration of the Community and experience with a single monetary policy will – as I hope andexpect – influence each other in a mutually beneficial process.
BIS Review   43/1998Mr. Camdessus shares his views on a new financial architecture for aglobalized world   Address by the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund,Mr. M. Camdessus, at the Royal Institute for International Affairs in London on 8/5/98.The G-7/G-8 Summit will be held in Birmingham next week. High on the Summitagenda will be the issue of how to renovate the architecture of the international financial systemin the face of the tremendous changes under way in the global economy. The Asian crisis hasbeen so unexpected in many of its aspects, so broad, so cruel in its human consequences that -even before the crisis has run its full course - the leaders of the world want to embark on thedesign of a new architecture. This is certainly the right thing to do, and the venue of this meetingcould hardly be more fitting. Like many other cities in advanced countries, Birmingham hasexperienced the forces of change in the global economy first hand - from the loss of traditionalindustries to the challenge of finding new employment opportunities. Moreover, two centuriesago, this city was at the heart of the Industrial Revolution, an era that, like our own, was a time ofextremely rapid change. At that time, intellectuals of all schools of thought used to meetfrequently in Birmingham - every full moon, I understand - and bring their reflections to bear onthe challenges of their new world. This was the so-called Lunar Society, which included suchpersonalities as Matthew Boulton, James Watt, Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles), andWilliam Small - a friend of Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, all with wide-ranginginterests, all sharing a sense of optimism and responsibility for building a better world. Imaginewhat a blessing it would be if the G-7/G-8 - our new Birmingham group - were to be inspired bysuch an example when dealing with their pressing agenda!As a modest preface to their work, I would like to share with you my personalviews on the need for change the Asian crisis reveals, the building blocks available for a newarchitecture, and the work already under way at the IMF and, in the best traditions of ChathamHouse, to fly a few kites and suggest some further steps for the longer term.*  *  *Change is neededAs in the days of the Industrial Revolution, we are now at a defining moment ofhuman history. The question before us is straightforward: how to utilize the full potential ofglobalization to improve the living standards of all - particularly the poorest - while containingthe risks it entails, such as those we have seen materialize so brutally in Asia, and those at leastequally pernicious, even if less spectacular, of the continuous marginalization of the poorestcountries. What kind of new architecture of the global system could achieve this? The responsemust be deduced from a proper analysis of the most recent crises.Contrary to what we saw during the debt crisis of the 1980s, the problems in Asiawere not almost exclusively macroeconomic in nature; even if these countries suffered, all ofthem, from some deficiencies in this respect, by and large they had long track records ofsuccessful economic management. Rather, in a context dramatically changed by a majorrealignment between the dollar and the yen, and important differences in short-term yields, threeother factors helped trigger the crisis:• the weakness of their public and private banking and financial structures;• an unsustainable accumulation of short-term financing - particularly ofinterbank lending, which Alan Greenspan refers to as the Achilles’ heel of the
- 2 -BIS Review   43/1998international financial system - which made countries particularly vulnerableto a sudden shift in market sentiment.• and, last but not least, deep-seated problems of governance, corruption, andwhat US commentators call “crony capitalism”.Together with the macroeconomic problems, these three major factors had to beaddressed for our response to the crisis to be pertinent. If you examine our programs withThailand, Korea, and Indonesia, you will see that we have tried to deal with these factors, andthey will have to be taken into consideration in the future in whatever efforts are undertaken toavoid the recurrence of crises. But even that will not suffice. In view of the enormous human andeconomic cost of the Asian crisis, no wonder we hear many radical suggestions as to how toavoid such losses in the future. There are calls for us to do a better job of predicting andpreventing crises, addressing their social impact more effectively, stopping speculators andproperly regulating this “casino economy”, seeing to it that investors bear the full costs of theirmistakes, stabilizing the international monetary system, providing for more politicalaccountability of our institution, etc., etc.We cannot deny the basic justification of these - at times vociferous - calls forchange. No doubt there are at least some elements of validity in each of them. Taken togetherthey tell us that, at this stage, world public opinion expects its leaders to design and build a new,common house with an audaciously modern architecture, and not limit themselves to someplumbing and interior decorating of the old mansion.But, as responsible architects, let us start by recognizing the building blocks athand. Indeed, they are substantial.Seven building blocksThe first of these building blocks is the tremendous potential for growth andprosperity globalization provides countries fully integrating into the global economy. Formidablesources of dynamism are there, engendered by new information technologies and unifyingfinancial markets. The question, then, is how to discipline and channel these forces so thatgrowth will be sustainable and more broadly shared and the fundamental desire for greater equitywill be more fully satisfied.The second building block is integration. By integrating themselves into themainstream of the globalizing world economy, the poorest countries will avail themselves of amost powerful instrument of acceleration of development, while, if they preferred to do it alone,they would expose themselves to the risks of marginalization, abandoning several generations toeconomic stagnation and poverty.The third building block is the universal consensus on the importance of anincreasingly open and liberal system of capital flows in order for globalization to deliver on itspromises.The fourth building block is what we could call the “golden rule” of transparency,now truly seen as the key for modern management, economic success, and rational behavior ofglobal markets.
- 3 -BIS Review   43/1998The fifth is good governance, which is equally essential for strong economies andproperly functioning democracies. No doubt, competing for excellence in governance is themodern face of statesmanlike responsibility.The sixth building block could be a set of standards and codes of best practices;this could require a few words of elaboration. More and more we observe an emergingrecognition that the global markets still suffer from the kind of anarchy that afflicted ourdomestic financial markets here in Europe during the nineteenth and the beginning of thetwentieth centuries - that is, until various scandals and crises led to the creation of suchinstitutions and rules as securities and exchange commissions, banking supervision, accountingstandards, disclosure and prudential rules, and so forth. Our challenge today is to disseminatethese good practices in emerging markets and to establish similar checks and balances in globalmarkets. This could appear an impossible task, as many will pretend that the absence of rules orregulations of any kind has been at the very origin of the developments of these markets. Theworld community is now coming to a different view, and looks forward for the definition ofinternational standards and codes of good practices, which would be progressively disseminatedby the IMF through its surveillance, and could help limit the excesses of an international “casinoeconomy”.Last, but not least, the seventh building block is the option for the multilateralapproach to handle problems, which are now more and more global in nature. And the keyinstruments of such an approach will have to be the Bretton Woods institutions themselves. Letme be immodest for a moment. The experience they have accumulated, the quality of their staff,their demonstrated ability to address new economic challenges promptly and efficiently makethem a major asset of the world community and a central pillar of a new architecture, providedthey continue adapting themselves, reforming themselves, to this new world. And suggestions forself-reform are in abundant supply.These seven building blocks have been neglected or unevenly utilized for toolong. Assembled in the right way, they could offer a rock-solid foundation for a new financialsystem. Assembling them, nevertheless, will be hard work, each of them implying that vestedinterests or perverse practices be challenged. Thus, notwithstanding our sense of urgency, we areheading here for an evolutionary change: Athena in her helmet will not spring full-grown fromthe head of Zeus! And, as with all transitions from one era to another, we can expect risks anduncertainties to persist for some years to come. This makes it all the more urgent to get to workon this new architecture right away.Initial steps for a new architectureIn fact, a number of significant steps are already under way. At its April meeting,our governing body, the Interim Committee (of Ministers and Central Bank Governors of IMFmember countries), set the broad agenda for the IMF’s own work - and its work with others - forthe near future. Five areas have been given priority by member governments:• The central role to be played by the IMF in crisis prevention through itssurveillance and its role in encouraging members to strengthen theirmacroeconomic policies and financial sectors.1                                                     1Of course, it is clear that for IMF surveillance to be effective, member countries must provide timely,accurate, and comprehensive data to the Fund. The Interim Committee underscored members’ obligation in
- 4 -BIS Review   43/1998The Interim Committee suggests that the Fund intensify its work in surveillance offinancial sector issues and capital flows, and focus on the risks posed by potentially abruptreversals of capital flows, especially those of a short-term nature. The Fund is also asked toexamine ways to strengthen the monitoring of capital flows, a major and difficult undertakingindeed!• Drawing on the lessons from the Asian crisis, and the frustration thatconfidential warnings from the Fund were not always heeded, the Fund hasbeen asked to develop a “tiered response”, whereby countries that are believedto be seriously off course in their policies are given increasingly strongwarnings. Addressing an audience in this country, where football is a way oflife, or in my own country in advance of the World Cup, I do not need toemphasize how important it is to know exactly when the referee has shown ayellow card and how many yellow cards are permitted! We also have the redcard in our Articles of Agreement, but using this card could precipitate thecrisis we seek to avoid. So we prefer to use the yellow card.• The Interim Committee also called upon the IMF to help members strengthentheir domestic financial systems by encouraging them to develop supervisoryand regulatory frameworks that are consistent with internationally acceptedbest practices, as well as strengthened standards for bank and non-bankinstitutions. Here you will recognize, of course, the “standards and goodpractices” building block. Work in this area is already in progress in variousfora. A notable example is the Basle Committee’s Core Principles forstrengthening banking regulation and supervision, which the IMF is nowhelping to disseminate to member countries. We will now work with otherrelevant institutions that could be responsible for developing similar standardsin areas such as accounting, auditing, disclosure, asset valuation, bankruptcy,and corporate governance. We will also consider how to disseminate suchstandards to member countries through our surveillance and encourage theiradoption. Working with so many institutions, public and private, in addition toour 182 member countries, will be an ambitious undertaking, but we areready - and enthusiastic - to play our full part in this new chapter ininternational cooperation.In the meantime, the IMF has been applying this standards approach to one of itstraditional domains of expertise: fiscal policy. Last winter, following the suggestion of theChancellor of Exchequer, the IMF developed a code of good practices on fiscal transparency towhich members will be encouraged to adhere. Looking ahead, we plan to develop a similar codewith respect to financial and monetary policies in cooperation with the appropriate institutions.                                                                                                                                                                          this regard and suggested delaying the Fund’s reviews of member economies when deficiencies indisclosing relevant information to the IMF seriously impede our surveillance. Indeed, the G-7 countrieshave the opportunity this week to establish leadership by pledging to convey to the IMF and to publishcomprehensive and timely data on both gross and net reserves, including reserve-related liabilities andcentral bank derivative transactions and positions, as well as external debt and data on banking andfinancial sector health.
- 5 -BIS Review   43/1998• But despite these efforts at crisis prevention, crises may continue to arise fromtime to time. In this regard, the Interim Committee also reaffirmed both thecentral role of the Fund in crisis management and the need to develop moreeffective procedures to involve the private sector in forestalling or resolvingfinancial crises.2• Finally, as I have already alluded, the Committee reaffirmed its view that thetime has come to add a new chapter to the Bretton Woods Agreement bymaking the liberalization of capital movements one of the purposes of theFund and extending, as needed, the Fund’s jurisdiction for this purpose. Itrequested the Executive Board to pursue its work on this issue withdetermination, with the aim of submitting an appropriate amendment of ourArticles of Agreement as soon as possible.Greater transparency and availability of economic information, adoption ofstandards and dissemination of best practices, a continuous strengthening of IMF surveillance,the orderly liberalization of capital movements, and better private sector involvement in crisisprevention and resolution - taken together and utilized to their full potential - these first fivepillars could be a very significant contribution to a new financial architecture much more attuneto dramatically modernized and globalized markets. I have no doubt the G-7/G-8 leaders inBirmingham will invite us to build on this basis. One can even imagine that they want to pointout some additional avenues, which, as we have been absorbed by more immediately pressingaspects of our work - we have not, as yet, been able to explore sufficiently.What next?Trying to answer the question of “what next” is a risky endeavor. No doubt withglobalization unfolding its opportunities and risks, new priorities will promptly capture ourattention and overtake our pre-established agendas. But it is always better to try to anticipatethem, particularly when they reflect problems that should already have been addressed, be it:                                                     2 As regards the latter, some follow-up actions are needed, including measures to discourage excessivereliance on short-term financing and strengthen countries’ capacity to withstand sudden shifts in marketsentiment. In addition, the Interim Committee has requested the Fund to consider other ways to strengthenincentives for creditors to use available information to analyze risks appropriately and avoid excessive risk-taking. Possibilities include introducing provisions in bond contracts regarding bondholder representationand voting in case of negotiations on bond restructuring; extending the Fund’s policy of providing financingto member countries in arrears to private creditors; encouraging strong bankruptcy systems for bothdomestic and international capital markets; and advising member countries to exercise greater caution ingranting public guarantees. We also need to examine the possibility of closer contacts with creditors inorder to explain Fund arrangements and, if needed, catalyze private sector financing so as to achieve moreequitable burden sharing vis-à-vis the official sector and limit moral hazard.Establishing closer contacts with private creditors, particularly at an early stage of a crisis, raises difficultissues; thus, it is not surprising that the Interim Committee has not pronounced on this point. Among thevarious options, I would suggest that consideration be given to asking the appropriate authorities in eachcreditor country to arrange for the selection of a representative of its financial community, who could becontacted in a crisis and who could provide a channel for communicating with a wide spectrum of financialinstitutions.
- 6 -BIS Review   43/1998• the integration of the poorest countries in the globalized economy. Asia shouldnot distract us from the pressing problems of the poorest economies;• the stabilization of the international monetary system; or• the issue of the democratic accountability of international financialinstitutions, as far as the IMF is concerned.The issue of the integration of the poorest countries is, of course, already on ouragenda. But, true, the attention of the world has been so focused on the Asian crisis and the needto avoid its recurrence that the immense problem of development and alleviation of poverty,particularly in Africa, seems to have been put temporarily on a back burner. This is no longeracceptable.In this context, I was particularly happy that, in drawing the lessons of an externalevaluation of ESAF, the Interim Committee encouraged us to “strengthen the ability of the Fundto foster sustained growth and external viability in poor countries”. There is more thanconventional rhetoric in these words. This mention, in a document essentially devoted to thehandling of financial crisis, surely testifies to the recognition by the world’s financial leaders thatthe success or failure of poor countries in finding their own way toward integration anddevelopment in an interdependent world will have a major influence on what the twenty-firstcentury will be. This means that the solidity of our new architecture will crucially depend on theway in which, for the poorest countries, monetary and financial strategies, on the one hand, andpoverty alleviation strategies, on the other hand, are made mutually reinforcing.Poverty alleviation is chiefly, of course, the task of the World Bank, the regionaldevelopment banks and bilateral donors. Among the latter, it is quite encouraging, indeed, to seethe energy and enthusiasm with which the British Minister for Development - an MP fromBirmingham, as a matter of fact! - Ms. Clare Short, is promoting the DAC Target of reducing byone half the proportion of the world’s population living in extreme poverty by 2015.3 Theseobjectives are ambitious, but they remain realistic, provided industrial countries join forces instopping the present decline of development assistance and implement their agreed commitmentto support, as needed, countries that truly own their national strategies for sustainabledevelopment. Among the latter, I would agree that particular priority be given to post - conflictcountries where we must join forces to give new chances to reconciliation, peace anddevelopment. Obeying this same imperative of serving together peace and development, I wouldalso suggest that the G-7/G-8 warmly endorse Mr. Koffi Annan’s recommendation to the Africangovernments to reduce purchases of arms and munitions to 1½ percent of GDP and maintain zerogrowth on defense budgets for the next decade. Industrial countries must play their full part inthese efforts, and, here, I must share with you my anxiety.Today’s silence on the crisis in official development assistance is profound anddistressing. It means that Africa, in particular, must rely chiefly for its economic progress onhumanitarian compassion or the benefits of trade. This cannot suffice if human development is tobe intensified and accelerated. Yet, at the present juncture, the macroeconomic and structuralsuccesses of recent years, precisely in the context of IMF-World Bank supported programs, arecreating an opportunity that is too good to miss. Africa has found a way to advance from twodecades of negative per capita growth to positive growth in more than forty of its countries. In                                                     3I hope I am not revealing a state secret in telling you that she inscribed this on her Christmas card!
- 7 -BIS Review   43/1998many African countries, a new generation of leaders is seriously concerned about the need fordemocratization, protection of human rights, promotion of “good governance”, and humandevelopment. Their efforts are in danger of falling short, however, because their domesticsavings rates are still too low to finance the volume of investments needed to boost their rate ofgrowth from approximately 5 percent to over 7 percent, which is not an unrealistic objective; itcould be attained and sustained for a long time if local savings were supplemented by anappropriate mix of public and private foreign support and if a few key conditions were met,notably:• continued modernization of the framework for private investment; and• improvement in public governance through the total commitment of newgoverning teams.Together with the World Bank and bilateral donors, we can make a difference. Buta strong political impulsion by the world’s leaders and the example of their countries’cooperation to development will be of the essence. May their communiqué demonstrate theirvision and leadership in this domain also.The stability of the international monetary system has been on the agenda for morethan 20 years of annual summits. The Asian crisis has highlighted how disruptive developmentsin exchange markets can help trigger a crisis. It is in this domain that efforts to strengthenmultilateral surveillance over the international monetary system could be particularly fruitful.Moreover, the development of the euro into a key international currency could make a majorcontribution to stability of the overall architecture, provided that close cooperation is establishedamong the monetary authorities of the tripolar system that might take shape. Even if it would bepremature at this stage to try to elaborate further on how to maximize the positive effects of thismajor innovation, no doubt the new international monetary equilibrium will have to be keptunder review as a key element of the new architecture. From the outset, effective means ofcoordination will have to be found to avoid excessive misalignments and disruptive corrections.The world is fully justified in expecting a responsible leadership from these major currenciesblocs, which should be actively mindful of their global responsibility and resist the temptation of“benign neglect”. Each of them.Lastly, at a time when de facto more and more responsibilities are being given tothe international financial institutions, and particularly to the IMF, the question of their politicalaccountability will probably be raised with increasing insistence. Indeed, this question alreadyarises from time to time, although not always with full awareness of the nature of our institutionsand of the powerful checks and balances already enshrined in their Articles of Agreement. In thiscontext, and as far as the IMF is concerned, is there anything that could be done to strengthenwhat one might call the political accountability or legitimacy of our institutions? At this stage,this would require at least a few organizational changes, which would make more explicit the tiethat binds us to the governments we depend on. The IMF could, for instance, encourage itsGovernors, in general the Ministers of Finance, to become more actively involved in its work, interms of decision-making and not merely in a consultative capacity in the Interim Committee. Asimilar question faces the G-7, which feels the need to embrace emerging market countries, but isunclear about how to go about it, and finds it difficult to come up with acceptable ways ofchoosing its partners. The design of a new architecture provides, perhaps, a good occasion toaddress these long-avoided questions. Two avenues could be explored.
- 8 -BIS Review   43/1998The first would be to “revitalize” the IMF Interim Committee. It could become anessential structure, because no other can match the scope of its responsibility and the legitimacyof its members, who are collectively responsible for key developments in the world economy. Atpresent, however, it is hampered by the ritualism of its meetings and an insufficient awareness ofits uniqueness and potential. This is why I think that the suggestion of the French Minister ofFinance, M. Strauss-Kahn, to consider its transformation into a “Council” with decision-making,rather than merely consultative, powers, is particularly important. This is not a new idea. Thistransformation, pursuant to Article XII, Section 1 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, couldgive it a new start. This approach was envisaged under the Jamaica accords, but deferred at thetime because of the experimental nature of the Interim Committee. But given the dauntingchanges that have occurred recently in the world economy, and the fact that the IMF has achievedtruly universal status with the accession of the transition countries, perhaps the time has come toconsider it. Without greatly altering the operation of the institution and the pivotal role of itsExecutive Board, such a transformation would give the IMF renewed and very valuablelegitimacy for the increasingly difficult tasks it is called upon to perform.4The second avenue, in the same spirit, would consist of making provisions everytwo years for the G-7/G-8 - on the occasion of their meetings - to join the heads of state andgovernment of the 16 countries holding seats on the IMF and World Bank Executive Boards todiscuss with them and with the heads of those two institutions and the WTO the major economicand financial questions of the day. This new G-24 would have the significant merit of its basiclegitimacy, as it would strictly reflect the system of international representation established formonetary and financial affairs in Bretton Woods. This would clearly represent a step forward notonly in terms of dispelling the current malaise, but also in terms of hastening the adoption ofintegrated policy responses to the challenges of the globalized economy. The Secretary Generalof the United Nations should also be invited to participate to take into account the work of theentire family of UN agencies, which could become a fourth humanitarian and social pillar of theworld system.Such ideas could, of course, be met with skepticism and run up against logisticalproblems that may seem insurmountable. Nevertheless, they need to be discussed, as they couldprovide a concrete way of recognizing that each medium-sized or developing country must havea more equitable share of responsibility for the future of the world economy, a share that theybelieve is unjustly denied them in the present institutional arrangements of the internationalfinancial system.*       *       *Now, at the end of this analysis of a number of key issues confronting the worldeconomy, it is perhaps appropriate to come back for one minute to the central messages of oureminent predecessors of the Lunar Society two hundred years ago. I am told that they included:• the value of drawing lessons and inspiration from various disciplines and fromthe experience in different countries;• the need to establish and disseminate standards so quality would be upheldand trade would flourish; and                                                     4This decision must be taken by an 85 percent majority and thus requires the active support of all G-7members.
- 9 -BIS Review   43/1998• a deep concern for the social implications of economic change and a keendesire to improve education;• and, of course, a strong sense of purpose and confidence in the promises oftheir new world.No doubt these messages could strike a chord with many people today, including -why not? - the stellar group that will assemble in Birmingham. May they share these approachesand concerns. Their confidence in the lasting benefits of globalization will be fully justified as anew world, born from the opening of economies, the unification of markets, and the universalavailability of information and knowledge, has an immense potential for high-quality growth.May they also validate their own message of confidence by a clear demonstration of their senseof universal responsibility and solidarity.
BIS Review   41/1998Mr. Macfarlane reports on monetary policy and financial stability in theAustralian Economy   Opening statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia,Mr. Ian Macfarlane, to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutionsand Public Administration in Melbourne on 7/5/98 (slightly abridged).1. IntroductionMr Chairman,It is a pleasure to be here in front of your Committee for the third time under the newarrangements set out in the Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy. I hope this meeting willbe as successful as its predecessors in helping to lift the level of understanding of monetary policy,financial stability, the Australian economy and, of course, the region more generally. I also hope youhave found our Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy a useful source of information and areasonably clear statement of our views.It is especially pleasing that we are meeting here in Melbourne for the first time. Ifyou remember, Mr. Chairman, the attempt to do so last November was foiled by a clash withMelbourne Cup week and the attendant shortage of hotel rooms. Fortunately, the VictorianGovernment has not been able to put on a sporting extravaganza to foil our plans this time.2. Review of last timeAs on the previous occasion, I would like to start today by recognising thataccountability includes being accountable for what was said last time. I will do this by reviewinghow the past six months have turned out against the background of what I told the Committee wewere expecting last November. At that time, I summarised our expectations by saying that I thought1997 would prove to be a good year for economic growth, with GDP growing by about 4 per cent,that inflation would remain below 2 per cent for a while, but with a tendency to pick up as we wentthrough 1998, and that there was a good chance that unemployment would decline. I said very littleabout the current account and balance of payments, as the outlook for Asia was still very unclear.We had only two quarters’ data on economic growth in 1997 at the time of ourprevious meeting - now we have all four. The ABS records that GDP grew by 3.6 per cent over thefour quarters, and non-farm GDP by 3.8 per cent, slightly less than the 4 per cent that I wasexpecting. I do not think there is any point in making much of this small difference.The other reason that I would not make much of this small difference is that theoutcome for the labour market turned out to be a bit better than we expected. The averageunemployment rate in the first half of 1997 was 8¾ per cent. When we met in November, the mostrecent figure we had was 8.6 per cent. The run of numbers we have received over the past fewmonths have been either 8.2 per cent or 8.1 per cent. So if you look across the past 12 months, Ithink you could see a reduction in the unemployment rate of ½ per cent or so. So over the course of1997 a combination of good growth and moderate outcomes on wages made some inroads into ourunemployment rate.On inflation, I have little to add to what I said last time. Underlying inflation has been1½ per cent over the past 12 months. We are still expecting that it will rise over the next 12 months,largely because falling import prices, which were pushing inflation down, have given way toincreasing import prices. In fact, the fall in the exchange rate has meant that wholesale import priceshave risen by 7.7 per cent over the past 12 months, and import prices made their first positivecontribution at the retail level to the CPI in the March quarter after seven quarters when they
- 2 -BIS Review   41/1998detracted from it. These changes are not alarming, but they do tend to suggest that we have passedthe low point in the inflation cycle.So I feel reasonably comfortable with our earlier assessment, except in one respect -last time we met, the full extent of the Asian slowdown was still uncertain. In fact, it is quiteinteresting that as recently as six months ago, most discussions treated the ASEAN Four as being theknown extent of the Asian slowdown. We did not know at that stage, although the possibility wasflagged, that Korea would join them, that Indonesia would deteriorate significantly further, and thatJapan would suffer a relapse into recession. When we take these developments into account, it isclear that a bigger external contractionary effect now has to be factored in. I will return to thissubject in more detail later.3. Prospects for 1998(a)GeneralSo much for 1997 - what about 1998? In the absence of the external shock from Asia,1998 was shaping up to be, if anything, a stronger year than 1997. There was nothing in the internaldynamic of the economy which was pointing to a slowdown, and we had every reason to expectgrowth of 4 per cent plus. That will no longer be the case, and we are now looking at growth through1998 of something more of the order of 3 per cent. This would probably mean that after a year inwhich the unemployment rate came down, we might be looking at a year in which it flattens out.I have already mentioned the outlook for inflation when I reviewed the previousyear’s results. Broadly speaking, we think that the trough in the inflation rate has passed, it is movingback again into the 2-3 per cent range, but it is not doing so in an alarming way. We expect it to be inthat range by the end of this year, and it probably will rise a bit during next year.(b)Balance of paymentsAnother part of the economy which in Australia has always been closely watched isthe current account of the balance of payments. With domestic demand in Australia growing at orabove trend, but with a number of our major export markets declining, it is an arithmetical certaintythat the current account has to widen, as it has. This is not a sign of an economic policy failure, and Itrust markets will treat it accordingly. A number of people, including myself, have made the pointthat on this occasion the widening of the current account deficit is not the result of excessive growthin domestic demand, nor is it the result of declining competitiveness because of high Australianinflation, nor is it a counterpart to a large budget deficit. For these reasons, we expect it will notarouse the same excitement as it has in the past, though you can never be sure. At present, ourexpectation is that the current account deficit in 1998 will be about 5½ per cent of GDP, but if youlook at the cyclical behaviour of the current account over the last two decades, you could not rule outit touching 6 per cent for a time.Imports are probably slowing from their very high growth rate in the second half oflast year, but not by much according to the March quarter figures. Over the course of 1998, we stillexpect them to show their usual behaviour, that is to grow by a few percentage points faster thandomestic demand. Exports, on the other hand, cannot hope to keep up last year’s pace of 8½ percent, and a small positive figure is probably what we can expect.Most of our exports - our rural products and metals and minerals - are sold intoworldwide, rather than country-specific, markets. If we cannot sell zinc or copper to Korea, we sell itto another country: the same goes for our rural exports. It means that for two-thirds of our exports,
- 3 -BIS Review   41/1998what we earn is a function of world demand, not of the demand from our specific (largely Asian)trading partners. At the end of the day, the prices for these commodities adjust to clear the market,and that has been happening. The prices of Australian commodity exports have fallen by 9 per centover the past year when measured in terms of a neutral basket of currencies. At the same time, theAustralian dollar has fallen against this neutral basket of currencies, so our commodity prices inAustralian dollars - what our exporters actually receive - have gone up slightly. Even for our biggestexports - coal and iron ore - where prices are renegotiated annually, the Australian dollar prices incontracts which commenced in April this year were higher than in the contracts a year earlier. This isan example of the market adjusting - in this case, the foreign exchange market - to shield the exportsector (but not the whole economy) from the worst of the Asian downturn.4. AsiaHaving made these points, I do not want to give you the impression that I amdownplaying the effects of Asia. To the contrary, the biggest difference between the way we viewour immediate future today and the way we viewed it a year ago is clearly the external shock wehave received from Asia. While it is true that the Australian business cycle is always affected by theworld business cycle, the current Asian crisis is the first significant identifiable external shock wehave had for a long time. The last time I can remember something as specific as this was OPEC II in1979, but that was on a much bigger scale and affected the whole OECD area more evenly. Thecurrent Asian crisis is unusual in that Australia has a bigger exposure to it than any other OECDcountry (other than the two who are actually part of the crisis - Japan and Korea).We have always been very conscious of Australia’s vulnerability to a sharpcontraction in Asia. But it has always been our hope, and certainly the guiding principle behindAustralia’s policy, that the economic problems in Asia could be minimised by prompt action. It wasthis awareness of possible danger ahead that lay behind Australia’s very quick response to the Thaicrisis, and the Reserve Bank’s willingness to put funds from its balance sheet at the Government’sdisposal to ensure that Australian participation was not delayed. It also explains why Australia is theonly country other than Japan to be a part of all three Asian support packages - those for Thailand,Indonesia and Korea.Australia has done what it can to help minimise the Asian fallout, but clearly eventshave turned out worse than we had hoped for. The crisis has spread further than was at first thoughtlikely, it is resulting in larger falls in output and employment in the countries concerned, and finallyit has been compounded by the relapse of the biggest Asian economy - Japan - into recession. Whatstarted as a currency crisis in Thailand is leading to widespread suffering in a range of Asiancountries.Of course, those countries have some deep-seated economic policy deficiencies -weak banking sectors, too much of what is called “crony capitalism”, too much governmentdirection of investment (including implicit underwriting of loans) and insufficient disclosure, pooraccounting standards, etc. These deficiencies are common to most countries at earlier stages ofdevelopment than ours, and they have been around for decades. They did not deter massive capitalinflow for most of this decade, and I suppose it must be galling for some of these countries to listento sermons on their deficiencies delivered by international bankers who, until recently, were happyto ply them with loans. We all have to agree that these countries made policy errors; that is par forthe course. Yet I agree with Paul Krugman who, when commenting on the current situation, said:“Yet governments are no more stupid or irresponsible now than they used to be; how come thepunishment has become so much more severe?”These countries have had to make a very rapid adjustment to their external positionsto stop their exchange rates from falling below the extremely low levels they reached late in 1997.
- 4 -BIS Review   41/1998They could not rely on a resumption of capital inflow to stop the problem, so the only feasible waywas to return their current accounts to surplus. This has involved very tight policies, a very large fallin domestic demand, and very large falls in imports. For the three countries in IMF programmes, weestimate that imports have already fallen by between 30 and 40 per cent. Even though there has notbeen enough time to expand exports in line with their improved competitiveness, their currentaccounts have already moved into surplus. Australia’s exports to these countries appear to havealready fallen roughly in line with their falling imports. Thus, we have received the effects on ourtrade flows quite early in the piece. In time, when their exports pick up, we should get some benefitfrom this even if their domestic demand remains weak.5.    How have we coped?To date, we have coped quite well, largely because we were in good shape going intoit with strong domestic demand and low inflation. This was in part due to the fact that we had takenexpansionary monetary policy action between July 1996 and July 1997.The other way in which we have coped well is that our financial markets havebehaved very sensibly. It is true that our exchange rate has depreciated against the US dollar, andagainst major currencies in general, but this is an understandable market reaction to the deteriorationin our international trading environment. Apart from a minor panic in January, the whole process hasbeen very orderly.The bond market too has performed very well. International and domestic investorshave clearly drawn a distinction between Australia and our Asian neighbours, and we have not seenany rise in risk premia on Australian bonds. Indeed, we have improved our position over the period,and Australian borrowers can now borrow in A$ at or below the same rate as equally creditworthyUS borrowers can borrow in US dollars. The Australian share market has also risen over the past sixmonths and, even though it has not performed quite as well as some overseas markets, is higher thanits former peak in mid-1997.What is the implication of Asia for the conduct of monetary policy? The simpleanswer is that it makes it more difficult. The Australian economy has suffered an external shock - asignificant reduction in demand for our exports, which will lead to lower export volumes in somecases and lower export prices in others. This will show up in some combination of lower growth anda widening of the current account of the balance of payments. Because of the fall that has occurred inour exchange rate, it will also show up as higher inflation than otherwise. Even if we had perfectforesight, we cannot adjust policy in a way which would avoid these outcomes altogether.The best we can hope for is a combination which minimises the longer-run disruptionto our economy. Choosing the monetary policy to achieve this is not an easy task. It involvesconstantly reviewing our position in the light of changes to the economy, and our forecasts of futureevents. Importantly, it will be heavily influenced by how the Asian situation develops. I repeat thatthe only reason we are foreseeing any slowdown in growth in 1998 is because of the Asian crisis -there was nothing in the domestic economy that pointed in that direction - in fact, it pointed to highergrowth. I suspect that in the future evolution of our policy, Asia will be the major influence.As you know, the Board of the Reserve Bank met on Tuesday and did not make anychange to the setting of monetary policy. There had been some speculation over the preceding monththat we might ease, but the majority of observers expected no change. Our on-balance view is thesame as the majority of outside observers: that is, we judged that the present setting is the right one.As we see it:
- 5 -BIS Review   41/1998•The present stance of monetary policy provides a low interest rateenvironment which is working to support, rather than restrain,growth. Credit is readily available, borrowers seem to regard currentinterest rates as attractive, financial wealth is rising, as is privatesector leverage.•Developments in the exchange rate and interest rates charged byfinancial intermediaries since the last reduction in the cash rate inJuly last year have worked to magnify the effects of lower officialrates. The exchange rate has come down against major currencies,and competition among banks has reduced interest rates to businessand personal borrowers.•The most likely outcome over the next 12 months at the presentpolicy setting is for inflation to return to its target range and fordomestic demand to remain at or above trend growth. With asignificant reduction in net exports, GDP will probably grow belowits trend rate, but some growth slowdown in the short run is anunavoidable result of the external shock.•Our measured approach to date has served us well in that it hasmaintained confidence in Australian financial markets. That, ofcourse, does not rule out further changes in policy, but it does imposea constraint in that it means monetary policy has to be adjustedcredibly. We do not wish to jeopardise Australia’s current goodinternational standing or revive memories of when Australia wasregarded as a “boom and bust” economy. We gain a lot from ourcurrent reputation for stability - not only does it reduce our borrowingcosts, but we can raise equity more cheaply, and we have become amore attractive place for direct foreign investment.Of course, we recognise that it would also be a mistake to stick too long to a settingof policy in the name of stability if there were good reasons to move. We have to be conscious of therisks to our current assessment, and constantly review them. The major downside risk which we cansee is the possibility that the effect of the Asian and Japanese situations might produce a largerslowing in the Australian economy than our current expectations, perhaps indirectly by slowinggrowth substantially in other trading partners or by seriously dampening domestic demand throughincome or confidence effects. Such an outcome is not in our view the most likely one - but it hassome probability.
BIS Review   41/1998Ms. Rivlin remarks on lessons drawn from the Asian financial crisis   Remarksby the Vice-Chair of the US Federal Reserve System, Ms. Alice M. Rivlin, before the Hyman P.Minsky Conference on Financial Structure at The Levy Institute in Annandale-on-Hudson, NewYork on 23/4/98.Toward A Better Class of Financial Crises: Some Lessons from AsiaDrawing lessons from the Asian financial crisis has become a minor industry,partially offsetting the impact of the crisis on developed economies -- at least for economists. Itcontributes to conference budgets, airline revenues, bar tabs, and the length of academic resumes.The opining classes can turn almost any bad news into an excuse for more meetings in beautifulsettings like Bard College.Some of the talk has been devoted to the blame game. Was the crisis (or rather therolling set of interrelated crises) home-grown, that is, brought on by ill-conceived investment,over-leveraged companies, lax banking supervision and crony capitalism in the borrowing countries?Was it the greed, inattention, or herd instinct of the lenders? Or was it the inherent instability ofinternational capital flows? Did the IMF step in just in time to avert total meltdown or did it fail toprovide early enough warning? Did the conditions imposed on borrowers help restore investorconfidence or further undermine it?The quick answer is that all of the alleged culprits bear part of the responsibility.International flows of capital can be unstable -- what flows in can quickly flow out -- and fast. Theenormous escalation in the volume of private capital flows, coupled with the advent of simultaneouscommunication in all the world’s markets, has greatly increased the exposure of economies to rapidturnarounds in cross-border flows. Decades of rapid growth and apparently unending capital inflowhad made the Asian emerging markets, until recently known as “tigers”, believe they were immunefrom the reversals of investor confidence that beset other parts of the world and produced anincaution that led to over investment in some sectors, inflated equity and real estate prices, and someill-thought-out projects, public and private. Close relations between companies, banks andgovernments created false senses of security, as well as uneconomic “policy” loans and investments.Weak supervision of financial institutions and markets, on top of traditions of secrecy in businessand governmental transactions, aggravated the crises when things turned down. At the same time,foreign investors and creditors asked too few questions, were hesitant to reign in the galloping goosethat had laid so many golden eggs, and reinforced each other’s reluctance to be the first to pull back.As tensions were developing, the IMF pointed to some of the dangers without getting muchresponse, and missed some others, as did the much-vaunted market gurus and rating agencies. Whenthe crises hit, the IMF quickly crafted rescue packages that imposed serious structural reform asconditions of aid, inevitably making some mistakes in the process, but arresting the spreadingdownward spiral and restoring enough confidence to allow the countries to get their policies in shapeto support the climb back to economic health. No one thinks the climb will be easy, but the best betis that the worst is over.Now the talk has shifted to the more difficult subject of what the internationalcommunity can do to prevent, mitigate and manage financial crises in the future. The stakes are high,for industrial and emerging market countries alike. When international capital markets function well,they help achieve rising standards of living for both creditor and debtor countries. When the marketscrash, they bring incredible hardship to ordinary workers and their families -- often people who havebeen pulled out of their traditional occupations and communities by economic change and may havenothing to fall back on.
- 2 -BIS Review   41/1998Two sets of prescriptions are relatively uncontroversial, albeit deceptively hard toachieve. First, the world’s capital markets and the machinery designed to stabilize them wouldfunction better with more complete, accessible and timely information flows. Investors can makebetter decisions and lenders can exercise more discipline over borrower behavior if they have moreaccurate and more complete information and have it sooner. Both international and domesticofficials can monitor, supervise and warn of impending danger only if they know the facts.Improving transparency should apply not only to businesses and banks, but to official bodies, bothnational and international. It’s important to know what a country’s budget deficit really is (on budgetand off budget) and what its exchange reserves really are, including any operations in the forwardmarkets. The Asian crisis was certainly exacerbated by lack of information of many sorts, includingaccurate data on reserves.There is currently a great flurry of activity in various international fora to raisestandards of accounting and reporting on business, banking and governmental activity and balancesheets. Progress will be made. But one should not expect too much. Although post mortems onfinancial crises, especially reviews of investor decisions that went sour, feature a great deal ofif-only-we-had-known rhetoric, in actual fact a great deal of information usually turns out to havebeen available which no one ever looked at or effectively analyzed. For transparency to be useful,people need to actually want to look -- and too often those who are making high profits would rathernot hear bad news.Second, a major sustained international effort is needed to strengthen the structure,functioning and supervision of financial systems in emerging market countries. A clear lesson ofrecent economic history (and not just in emerging market countries) is the crucial importance ofstrong banks and other financial institutions, adequately capitalized and able to manage risk,overseen by serious prudential supervision and an independent well managed central bank. Industrialcountries can ill-afford to be sanctimonious on this score -- many of us have experienced the adverseeffects of poor prudential supervision or lack of political will to close failing financial institutions --but good management and strong supervision of financial institutions is clearly a key to withstandingeconomic shocks.Here, too, consensus is strong and serious activity is underway under the aegis of avariety of international bodies, perhaps too many, to evolve clear rules for financial supervision andhelp countries implement them. The task will require time, patience and resources. It is not just bankexaminers, but bankers who need training in how to do their jobs in modern, fast movinginternationally exposed economies. Strengthening financial systems, including improving corporategovernance, goes hand in hand with efforts to improve transparency and information flows -- toinvestors, shareholders, supervisors and international agencies -- and both will require sustainedeffort and run into significant resistance.The first two prescriptions are preventive, designed to reduce the frequency andamplitude of financial crises. But no one with a sense of history -- or reality -- believes that crisescan be eliminated. Hence, a third prescription also appears on everybody’s list, albeit with far lessagreement on what it means, namely, private creditors should take on a greater portion of the burdenof resolving future international financial crises. Sharing the burden is a far more difficult issue tocome to grips with conceptually than either the need for greater transparency or the need forstronger, better supervised financial systems. Not much intellectual structure yet exists for thinkingabout burden-sharing in international financial crises. Moreover, cross-border financing is growingso rapidly and market instruments are morphing so fast that designing ways of sharing the burden islike changing the tires on a moving car -- pretty exciting and not obviously doable.
- 3 -BIS Review   41/1998The task cannot be set aside, however, for at least two reasons. First, the cost ofresolving international financial crises is outrunning the likely resources available for that purpose.The volume of cross-border flows has grown precipitously and the cost of breakdown has escalatedwith it. High speed traffic on a six lane freeway moves a lot of people to their destinations fast, butthe pile-up in a wreck is a lot more expensive than on a winding two lane road. If recent trendscontinue, managing the next crisis will call for more resources than taxpayers in the United Statesand other developed countries are likely to feel comfortable turning over to the IMF and otherinternational organizations, even if they are reasonably confident that the borrowing countries willpay the loans back, as experience indicates they will.Second, and far more important, the perception that official resources can be countedon to bail out creditors (directly or indirectly) arguably generates moral hazard. It could lead toexcessive risk-taking by lenders and funding of less economically defensible projects. It may alsochannel financing into less stable forms whose overuse makes crises more likely to occur. In recentepisodes, direct investors and holders of equity and long-term debt have taken serious losses, butshort-term lenders, especially interbank lenders, have been largely protected. While a country introuble has understandable reasons for not wanting to cut itself off from short-term bank credit andfor using its scarce international resources to keep this lifeline attached, the result may be toreinforce excessive dependence on debt rather than equity and on short, rather than longer-termfinancing.Both reasons combine to create an urgent need for serious and creative thought on thepart of the international community about how to “bail in” private sector financiers, in order toreduce the impact on the financial resources of official institutions like the IMF, the World Bank andthe regional development banks, to reduce moral hazard leading to excessive risk-taking, especiallyshort-term inter-bank borrowing, and to improve risk assessment.Designing mechanisms for appropriate burden sharing among private sectorinvestor/creditors is inherently hard because it runs into some very sticky and fundamentaldilemmas. The basic principle from which all borrowing and lending must proceed is that peoplewho use other people’s money have a firm obligation to pay it back. Hence, a suspension ofpayments or a work-out arrangement must be clearly rare and exceptional, resorted to only inextreme situations. Raising fears that suspensions are likely or work-outs normal could unnecessarilyincrease the cost of capital, cause drastic reductions in cross-border flows and diminish futureincomes of debtors and creditors alike. Yet having no known or understood process for dealing withdefault can, as has been seen in Asia, lead to inequitable burden sharing, high official cost andpotential future moral hazard.A related basic dilemma involves the timing of a suspension of payments. Authoritieshave to hold off long enough to be sure there is no other choice, but not wait so long that creditorsare running for the doors and irreversible damage is already done.The problem is, of course, not entirely new. International borrowers have gotten intotrouble before, and precedents for workouts have been developed -- Paris Club procedures forresolving sovereign debts to public creditors; London Club for resolving sovereign debts to privatebanks. But each crisis is different from the last. A critical element in the Mexican crisis of 1994-95was the threat of default on dollar-indexed Mexican short-term bonds (tesebonos1) for which nowork-out process existed. Dealing with bond holders (who are likely to be numerous and scattered)is more complex than dealing with lending governments or a relatively small (and known) group of                                                     1  Tesebonos were technically denominated in pesos.
- 4 -BIS Review   41/1998international banks. The recent Asian crises posed still another problem. The borrowers were notgovernments, but private banks and corporations, a situation that may be typical of future crises, andone that adds greatly to the legal and organizational complexities of sharing the burden of financialdistress.When the debt in question is sovereign debt, whether to banks or other lenders, itmay not be hard to re-establish stability and confidence in the sovereign. The IMF can lend enoughto solve the borrowing government’s immediate liquidity problem while the government works out adebt restructuring with its creditors. IMF rules permit “lending into arrears” in these circumstances.If the creditors are bondholders, as they were in Mexico, the situation is moredifficult. IMF rules do not at present permit a government borrowing from the IMF when it is unableto pay its bondholders. Even a small minority of the bondholders can use their bargaining power toobstruct a resolution of the crisis in hopes of getting a better deal. After the Mexican crisis had beenresolved with the help of significant new official lending to Mexico, the international communityfocused on how to improve the bargaining position of the debtor government with its bondholders ifsuch a crisis should arise in the future.The “Rey Report” on Sovereign Liquidity Crises (named for its author, Jean-JacquesRey of the Central Bank of Belgium) was a major effort by the G-10 countries to learn the lessons ofMexico. It recommended two new steps:•First, the IMF should expand its willingness to lend into arrears to cover thesituation in which a sovereign was making a good faith effort to work out a debtrestructuring with its bondholders.•Second, it recommended that bonds issued in international markets containclauses that would facilitate debt restructuring if it became necessary. Clausescould be added to provide for debt-holder representation in negotiations with thesovereign or qualified majority voting on changes in terms. Such clauses wouldmake it harder for minority creditors to block restructuring or exact a higherprice than necessary to satisfy the majority.Neither of these recommendations received much official attention until the Asiancrisis hit. Although the recommendations were not actually germane to the situation in Asia, the IMFreviewed the recommendations at its Interim Committee meeting in April 1998 and action in thenear future seems more likely than a year ago. Perhaps the official community will always be onecrisis late.Unlike the sovereign debt crises in Latin America, the situation in Asia involvedprivate debts (of banks in Korea, corporations in Indonesia, and some of each in Thailand) to privatecreditors, mostly banks. Hence, it was inherently harder, as currency values plummeted and reservesall but disappeared, to design ways either to restore stability or to organize work-outs.An additional complication was the fact that, although the debts were private, someof them involved varying types of implied government guarantees. In Korea, the Finance Ministerill-advisedly volunteered that the Korean government would honor foreign debts of Korean banks.When the Korean banks experienced difficulty rolling over their international bank loans, the Bankof Korea provided the reserves they needed to repay the loans, in effect delivering on the guarantee,but rapidly depleting the central bank’s reserves in the process. Guarantees of this sort clearly createmoral hazard. Pre-crisis, they result in more bank lending than would otherwise have taken place,and when trouble begins they may accelerate a bank run. But much less explicit guarantees can be
- 5 -BIS Review   41/1998trouble as well. Where governments are heavily intertwined with banks and companies, as has beennormal throughout much of Asia, foreign lenders and investors may well assume that thegovernment will not allow favored operations to fail. One of the challenges of mitigating andmanaging future crises, therefore, is finding ways to discourage emerging market governments fromguaranteeing private debts or being so closely involved with private enterprises that these enterprisesare seen as immune from market forces.The expectation that future borrowers in international markets will be mostly privateenterprises, greatly increases the importance of the first two prescriptions -- increasing transparencyand strengthening financial system surveillance -- not just to prevent and mitigate crises, but tomanage them when they happen.In an economy that tolerates secrecy in business and financial dealings and whereinformation disclosures are limited, firms with fairly shaky fundamentals may be able to borroweasily in a boom. They will be carried along by the general optimism, since everyone wants tobelieve the best and there is no tradition of asking hard questions anyway. But in a crisis, marketparticipants tend to believe the worst. To contain the crisis and restore confidence, it is necessaryboth for managers and public authorities to be able to deliver the bad news and be believed by themarkets. If there is no tradition of accurate, high quality information that can be relied on, marketparticipants and bank depositors are likely to believe that things are substantially worse than theyreally are and proceed to prove it by their actions. A culture of transparency and timely, accurateinformation can serve as an economic stabilizer in both directions. It can restrain the boom byenabling investors to assess risk more accurately, and it can cushion over-reaction once a downwardslide begins. But such a culture cannot be built quickly, and even where it exists, has to beassiduously maintained.Similarly, prudential supervision of financial institutions may be thought of asprimarily valuable for crisis prevention -- useful for ensuring that financial institutions areadequately capitalized, don’t take unacceptable risks with other people’s money, and that the weakones are required to shape up or go under. Once a crisis hits, however, it is important to be able todistinguish strong from weak institutions, those that ought to be rescued from those that ought to beclosed. Unless supervision has been effective on an ongoing basis, however, the supervisors will notbe able to tell strong from weak and will not be able to find out fast enough to prevent a rout. Goodinstitutions then go down with the bad. It is actually in the long-run interest of financial institutionsthat aspire to be the survivors of a shake-out to insist that supervisors are well informed and applyinga high standard.Another lesson of recent events in Asia has been the importance of clear, enforceablebankruptcy laws in dealing with a crisis, as well as helping to prevent one. Bankruptcy provides anopportunity, not only for closing down truly insolvent enterprises in an orderly way, but for rescuingtroubled ones by allowing them to cut a deal with their creditors, restructure their obligations, and goon operating on a sounder basis. But bankruptcy procedures cannot be rapidly invented or first testedin a crisis. For bankruptcy procedures to mitigate crises effectively and help to get survivors on theirfeet, there has to be a “culture of bankruptcy” which operates in good times as well as bad. Debtors,creditors, lawyers and courts have to be used in the process, know what to do, be able, because theyhave done it before, to cut the deals that will minimize the damage and keep potentially profitableenterprises afloat. Asian countries, most obviously Indonesia, found that since their modern marketexperience had been primarily one of boom and growth, they had inadequate bankruptcy laws andlittle “culture of bankruptcy” to help manage a sudden negative turn of events.Improving transparency, supervision and bankruptcy procedures will help emergingmarket economies grow more sustainably (albeit perhaps slower) and manage downturns better
- 6 -BIS Review   41/1998when they happen. But the conceptually hard questions involve international collective action andhow it can manage major crises more effectively.Once a crisis hits one country, especially a country of significant size and linkagewith others, the whole international community has a strong interest in rapid action to isolatemarkets and prevent the contagion from spreading and engulfing others. At this moment, thecommunity looks to the IMF to act quickly, provide liquidity and restore confidence, especially theconfidence that the crises has bottomed out and will not be part of a continuing downward spiral.Asia in 1997 was a demonstration of how fast the dominoes could fall.When the root cause of the problem is inappropriate macro-economic policy,especially big budget deficits and easy money combined with a pegged exchange rate, it may not bedifficult for the IMF to restore confidence by injecting enough liquidity to pay short-term claims inforeign currency in return for rapid changes in policy. When macro policy is not obviously the chiefculprit, restoring confidence may be harder and more expensive.Injecting new money in exchange for reforms may still be the primary answer, but thepatience of taxpayers wears thin as amounts escalate and it is perceived that some classes ofcreditors are being bailed out with official international resources -- creditors who should havecalculated the risks more accurately and should bear the cost of not having done so, so they won’t doit again.Some have asked whether official resources could be saved and moral hazardreduced by designing an automatic international bankruptcy-like process, known in advance, bywhich a standstill could be triggered, followed by a set procedure for sharing the burden among allthe relevant creditors. Serious thought is being devoted to this issue. It is not hard to imagine such anapproach, but all crises are different and applying a cooky cutter solution could well do more harmthan good.The next few years will be a testing time for what I think of as the “cross-bordercommunity”, meaning the organizations, public and private, dedicated to making the cross-borderrelationships (especially business and financial ones) work better. The “cross-border community”includes mega firms that produce goods and deliver financial services on a worldwide scale, andassociations of accountants, lawyers, bankers, securities dealers, insurance underwriters and variouskinds of financial regulators as well as general international financial institutions (the IMF and theWorld Bank) and more specialized ones such as the Bank for International Settlements, and theregional development banks -- to mention only a few of the more obvious members of a burgeoningspecies.The benefits of cross-border trade and capital flows for raising the world standard ofliving are clear, but so are some of the costs -- especially the costs to ordinary people of being caughtin the backwash when there is a crisis. If these costs are not taken seriously and methods designed tomitigate and manage financial crises better, a wave of political backlash against capitalism,foreigners and what we all think is “progress” could result. One lesson of recent crises is thatfactories, banks, shiny buildings, and eager investors do not by themselves create the underpinningsof modern economic society able to withstand shocks with minimal damage. That takes -- inaddition to good fiscal, monetary and other public policies -- an infrastructure of laws and traditionsand expectations that cannot be built overnight or imposed from the outside. The challenge for thecross-border community will be to work closely with emerging market economies to help them buildthis infrastructure in ways that work for them. Wading in and saying, “do it our way” won’t work.The process will involve continuous interaction and adaptation and may well result in betterfunctioning economies in the so-called developed world, as well.

BIS Review  40/1998˝Mr. Stals addresses the topic “Implications for the South African financialsector of the process of financial globalisation”   Speech by the Governor of the South AfricanReserve Bank, Dr. C. Stals, at the Tenth Annual “Beeld” Economist of the Year Banquet, held inJohannesburg on 8/5/98.1. Lessons from the East Asian crisisRecent developments in certain East Asian countries focused attention on the manypitfalls for the smaller economies of the world on the road to financial globalisation. The reasons forthe collapse of financial markets in East Asia may differ from country to country, but a few commonshortcomings in the economies of the afflicted countries were identified:Firstly, in many countries, inappropriate macroeconomic policies were applied todefend artificial exchange rates, and/or to maintain interest rates at untenable low levels. Thesecountries were highly successful for many years and they achieved remarkably high averageeconomic growth rates over an extended period of time. Based mainly on an industrious and frugallabour force, they were able to remain competitive, despite the emergence of underlying weaknessesin the economic fundamentals.Secondly, the financial systems did not keep pace with the changing macroeconomicenvironment. Banking institutions were not properly regulated and monitored, and financial marketswere distorted by undue governmental intervention. In some cases, there were insufficient disclosureof basic information that could have enabled investors to make a better assessment of thedeteriorating situation at an earlier stage.Thirdly, the countries became overly exposed to foreign capital flows, and vulnerablebalance of payments positions developed that could not be managed once confidence faded. Largecurrent account deficits were no longer covered by total capital inflows, and the withdrawal ofshort-term funds from some countries exacerbated the situation.Fourthly, bad governance in public and private sector institutions did not realise theseriousness of the underlying adverse developments, and did not take timely corrective action. Whenthe bubble finally burst, the situation had already advanced to a stage where only costly and painfulmacroeconomic restructuring could salvage these economies.The experience of the afflicted East Asian countries provides ample evidence of thevulnerability of the smaller, emerging market economies in the environment of financialglobalisation. Other countries, including South Africa, can also be subjected by the global financialmarkets to similar painful corrections, although it might be for completely different reasons. Thelesson for South Africa from the East Asian crisis is therefore to be alert, to be cautious, and to beaware of the harsh but not unreasonable disciplines of the global markets.2. South Africa and financial globalisationOver the past few years, the South African financial sector has moved quite fast onthe road of globalisation. In the Annual Report for 1997 of the Bank Supervision Department of theReserve Bank, interesting information has been made available about developments in the SouthAfrican banking sector in 1997.There are now more than 20 foreign banks operating in South Africa throughlocally-established branches or subsidiaries, and more than 60 foreign banks with representativeoffices in South Africa. South African banks are also extending their activities to the rest of the
- 2 -˝BIS Review  40/1998˝world and during 1997 obtained permission from the Registrar’s Office to establish more than45 branches, subsidiaries, and representative offices in other countries around the world.At the end of 1997, the total South African banking sector utilised more thanR35 billion in foreign funding, and carried loans extended by them in foreign currencies of aboutR17½ billion. The foreign liabilities and foreign assets of the South African banking sector,respectively, represented but small percentages of the total assets (or total liabilities) of the bankingsector, estimated at about R440 billion as at 31st December 1997. Foreign funds as a source offinancing of the activities of South African banking institutions are, however, still increasing.It is well-known that non-resident investors have become very important participantsin the South African financial markets. Over the past 16 months, that is since the beginning of 1997,non-resident investors increased their holdings of South African equities by R45.6 billion, and theirholdings of South African bonds by R31.1 billion.The South African Government raised a total amount of approximately R11.3 billionin seven public loan issues made in international capital markets since December 1994. At the sametime, many South African public and private sector borrowers also made use of the foreign financialmarkets to fund the expansion of their activities in South Africa, and in the rest of the world. Thegradual relaxation of exchange controls has indeed enabled South African residents to acquire largeforeign assets abroad. The following estimates provide some indication of the extent of theseinvestments since the beginning of 1994:Direct foreign investment by South African corporates R44.3 billionPortfolio foreign investment by South African institutional investors R37.4 billionPortfolio foreign investment by South African private individuals   R1.1 billionVolumes in the South African foreign exchange market increased substantially inrecent times. At this juncture, it is not unusual to have a daily turnover in excess of US$ 10 billion inthis market.One further indication of the extent to which South Africa has already become part ofthe global financial markets can be found in the expansion of the Euro-rand market. The total amountoutstanding in this market, where non-resident borrowers raise funds in rand-denominated loanissues made to non-resident (mainly European) investors, now exceeds R37 billion.3. Consequences for the South African economyThis process of the globalisation of the South African markets has importantconsequences for the South African economy. The major advantage for South Africa is, of course,that the scarce sources of finance for economic development can be supplemented with increasingamounts of foreign funds. Savings of more developed countries are therefore transferred to SouthAfrica to supplement domestic saving.The large inflow of funds over the past four years enabled the Reserve Bank toincrease the country’s official foreign reserves from a small to a more acceptable amount ofR33 billion, which is sufficient to cover about three month’s imports of goods. This increase alsomade it possible to substantially relax exchange controls in order to create a more free market, whichshould eventually contribute to a higher economic growth rate.It is necessary that foreign investments make a more purposeful direct contribution toreal economic development in South Africa, and not only to the restructuring of the financial system.
- 3 -BIS Review  40/1998˝To achieve this, South Africa must ensure that attractive and competitive investment projects areavailable for this purpose.The globalisation of South Africa’s financial markets, however, have importantconsequences for the analysis of South African financial conditions, and in particular for theforecasting of possible future developments in South African financial aggregates. The exchange rateof the rand is consequently more subject to the inclinations and whims of foreign investors, as wellas to developments in the foreign exchange markets of nearly all the other parts of the world. Howwell the South African financial authorities may plan and manage, developments over which theyhave no control can change the exchange rate of the rand, especially against individual currencies, ina direction which was not expected or could not be forecasted. These kinds of changes can be verydisruptive over the short term.This also applies to South African interest rates. A sudden inflow of funds from therest of the world can lead to a decline of South African interest rates against the run of events in theSouth African economy or the objectives of the monetary authorities. Similarly, an outflow of fundsarising from developments in a distant country, such as for example Indonesia, can very easily leadto an increase in South African interest rates when we would have liked to have seen a decline.South African share prices are also affected by the views of foreign investors and donot always truly reflect the actual potential of South African companies. Developments in the pricesin London, New York, Paris and Tokyo often have a greater influence on these prices thandevelopments in South Africa.Even the South African inflation rate tends to move to lower levels in accordancewith the inflation rates in the rest of the world. Inflationary errors that are made with domesticmacroeconomic policy under these circumstances, will often have a detrimental effect on the SouthAfrican balance of payments, or aggregate domestic economic activity, before leading to an increasein prices.4. Economic forecasting: a difficult taskAgainst the background of the international integration of financial markets itbecomes much more difficult to predict developments in financial aggregates, such as interest rates,exchange rates and the inflation rate. It does not only depend on what happens in the better knownown national economy, but requires a broader cosmopolitan knowledge. Mr. Alan Greenspan’sdecisions often can have a greater influence on the developments of these aggregates in South Africathan decisions of the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank.Unfortunately, businessmen, investors and economic policy makers often have to takea view about possible future developments in these financial aggregates. The decisions they have totake are mainly concerned about the future, and not about the past or present situation. It is thereforeessential that forecasts be made, even if it is done in a framework of greater uncertainty andunforeseeable future developments. With all the modern electronic technology which is available tofacilitate forecasts, the world of the actual economy remains too uncertain to be always correct.There are a few basic principles which must be kept in mind when making forecastsof financial aggregates:1. Do not believe too much in your own forecasts. There are good reasons why youwill often be wrong.
- 4 -˝BIS Review  40/1998˝2. Do not accuse someone else - for example, the Governor of the Reserve Bank - ifyour forecasts are wrong. He also has only little control over developments inthese macroeconomic aggregates.3. Make regular forecasts. The data on which forecasts are usually based changeoften and therefore justify regular revisions of forecasts.4. Be willing to acknowledge a wrong forecast and produce a new one. Most peoplewho take note of your forecasts have in any case already forgotten the last onethat you made.5. Remember the assumptions which form the basis of every forecast. They areoften so unrealistic that the forecast is also nearly worthless.6. Make forecasts on the basis of objective analyses, and not on what suits yourbook or the book of your clients. It doesn’t help to be popular but wrong.7. Be grateful if you are sometimes right in this difficult game of trial and error - itmay not happen again.5. Concluding remarksThe integration of South Africa in the world financial markets is an on-going processthat is linking developments in the major financial aggregates in this country more and more todevelopments in the rest of the world.Because of this process, economic forecasting has become much more complex. Notonly changes in the South African situation influence developments in important financialaggregates, such as interest and exchange rates, but also events in remote places such as Indonesia.Economic forecasters have great responsibility, not only to provide consistent andsensible forecasts, but also to understand and explain the shortcomings of even their best efforts - andto remember that even bad forecasts can sometimes become self-fulfilling.
BIS Review   39/1998˝Mr. Tietmeyer’s address at the International Frankfurt Banking EveningCo-speaker’s address by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof. Hans Tietmeyer, followingthe lecture “Achieving a Credible Currency for Europe” held by Dr. Sirkka Hämäläinen, Governor ofthe Bank of Finland at the International Frankfurt Banking Evening on 5/5/98.ISirkka,First of all, thank you very much for having come and for your extremely interestingspeech.You have spoken to us this evening with dual authority:-on the one hand, as the Governor of a highly successful national central bankand,-on the other, as a prospective member of the ECB Executive Board.In the face of such concentrated authority in your address, there is hardly anythingpertinent that I can add.I can only emphasise one of the core sentences of the speech you addressed to theNCB governors, and which is certainly true of the Board members as well:“The interests of the entire euro areamust always come first.”Without any doubt, this rule is the crucial cornerstone of the ECB in achievingcredibility.The topic of our gathering this evening is “Achieving a credible currency forEurope”.Nominating Sirkka Hämäläinen to the Executive Board of the ECB is, however,without any doubt an invaluable step on the way to a credible currency for Europe.I am sure that you, Sirkka, will be a jewel in the crown of the - hopefully - stableeuro.By the way, in Brussels a number of men were likewise earmarked for the ExecutiveBoard. But they are, of course, not so important - not, at least, this evening.Sirkka, sincerest congratulations! We are all delighted that you are going to become aFrankfurt central banker.I wish you, for our own sakes, every success.-To begin with, of course, on the way to your definitive appointment.-And particularly in your office here in Frankfurt, from the summer onwards.
- 2 -BIS Review   39/1998˝IIHowever, not everything that happened last weekend in Brussels contributed to thenecessary expectation that the euro will be a really supranational and depoliticised currency.I would like to make three remarks on the decisions which were taken in Brussels lastweekend.1.The compromise reached in Brussels over the weekend on filling the office ofPresident of the European Central Bank is a decision taken by the political authorities which wetake note of and on which I do not want to make any further comments.2.The suggestions made with regard to the nominations for the Executive Boardof the ECB are to be viewed favourably overall. The persons involved are acknowledged expertson monetary and banking issues, and for the most part have many years of experience in thefield of monetary policy. That certainly goes for Professor Dr. Otmar Issing, who is to beappointed for eight years. It is to be hoped that the appointment process will be completed verysoon, and the European Central Bank thus established.3.The European Central Bank must endeavour from the start to build up thenecessary confidence in the sustained stability orientation of its policies, and must demonstrateits independence of political influences. As a member of the future ECB Governing Council, Ishall strongly support any such policy.IIISirkka,Frankfurt will become your new place of action.I wish that you will feel happy here in Frankfurt. And I am sure that will be so -provided that you are able to get to know Frankfurt a bit.For if every one of the eleven national parliaments - like parts of the French NationalAssembly - in future wanted to hold regular consultations with the members of the ECB ExecutiveBoard, you would not get to see very much of Frankfurt, other than the airport.I hope that will not be the case.I also hope that you will like Frankfurt. Of course, I don’t suppose Frankfurt cancompete with Helsinki in every respect. But in many ways it can.In terms of culture, too, Frankfurt has a great deal to offer. After all, culture andbanking go well together. It is no accident that the great Finnish composer Jean Sibelius once said:“It is only among bankers that I have ever comeacross an appreciation of music; it is very rareamong artists, who prefer to talk about money.”
- 3 -BIS Review   39/1998˝IVAnother reason why you may feel at home in Frankfurt is that - in my opinion - thereare a number of common features in the Finnish and German mentalities.Both national mentalities are inclined to speak their mind clearly and frankly. It ispossible that both the Finns and the Germans do not always express themselves with that eleganceand fluency that so distinguishes the representatives of those civilisations which were moreinfluenced by Rome.But Finns and Germans alike are conspicuous for a strong sense of realism, forclear-cut, if sometimes somewhat harsh, powers of judgement, and for a healthy attachment to theirnative land.Finns like a clear, straightforward approach, rather than convoluted affectedness.That goes equally for their approach to Europe. Finnish professions of faith in Europemay not always sound so effusive and euphoric. Understandably, they also set great store by theirindependence.On the other hand, the Finns stand by Europe-not only when the sun is shining,-and not only when they are receiving money from Brussels.Finland is on the periphery, if at all, only in geographical terms; in political terms, itis in the heart of Europe.VIt no doubt owed something to the sense of realism in the thinking of our two nationsthat a “stability culture” evolved, and was consolidated, in both our countries.And in both countries the respective central bank plays a major role in cementing thatstability culture. The high international reputation of Finnish anti-inflation policy owes a great dealto your efforts and your personality, Sirkka.So, you will likewise appreciate the “stability culture” which Frankfurt has inherited.You once said that it is the lot of a strictly stability-oriented central banker to remainunpopular.I can assure you of one thing: here in Frankfurt it is possible for a central banker to beboth stability-oriented and popular at the same time. Being a guardian of stability in Frankfurt issomething special, I must say.And I am convinced that Finns have a particular gift for that.That is because stability orientation has something to do with long-termism, and thuswith staying-power. And Finns are proverbially unbeatable in the kinds of sport that requirestaying-power.
- 4 -BIS Review   39/1998˝And another thing: once the euro has got going, it will have to pass its “Elch-Test”(an expression that was last year’s “word of the year” in Germany). And we Germans are mightyrelieved that somebody from Finland is helping at the steering wheel. For the Finns are the experts inall matters relating to Elks and how to deal with them.VIIncidentally, there are also some interesting similarities between our two currencies.What strikes one first, of course, is the common name.At the time when a proper name for the single European currency was being soughtinstead of the three letters E-C-U, many Germans suggested calling the single currency Mark afterthe Finnish currency. “For unfathomable reasons”, however, that suggestion failed to meet withgeneral approval.Another extremely interesting parallel is that both currencies are older than theirrespective, nowadays independent, states.As you will no doubt know, the introduction of the D-Mark preceded theestablishment of the Federal Republic of Germany, even if only by a short period.The 50th anniversary of the introduction of the D-Mark will remind us again of that.A ceremony to mark that occasion will take place in Frankfurt’s Paulskirche on June 20.But the less than one year that the D-Mark is older than the Federal Republic ofGermany is nothing in comparison with the pacesetter role played by the Finnish markka. Themarkka was actually introduced over 50 years before independent Finland was born.Hence we are all the happier that the Finns are prepared to let the markka be absorbedinto the euro. And that change is actually meeting with more approval in Finland than in Germany.But there has been one problem in connection with Finland’s qualification formonetary union. A few months of membership in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS arelacking.When we in the Bundesbank were drafting our Convergence Report, we racked ourbrains wondering what we could do. Strictly speaking, Finland ought to have joined the EMS inwinter 1995-96.But we in the Central Bank Council then recalled that, as everybody knows, the Finnsare always somewhat downcast and despondent in winter. That is because of the lack of sunshine.We thought it would be unfair to expect the Finns to take such an important decisionas joining the ERM in the depths of winter.But after a fine summer it was very much easier for the Finns to take that step.And so we agreed in the Central Bank Council of the Bundesbank not to express anycriticism of Finland in this matter.
- 5 -BIS Review   39/1998˝We found that all the easier since Finland’s successes in the field of stability policyhave been of such a lasting nature. And that, of course, is what matters most.In the other case in which a few months of ERM participation were lacking, by theway, things were not quite so easy.VIISirkka, once again, thank you very much for your address, and the very best wishes toyou in your new and important assignment.I am sure our cooperation will be as confident as it has already been in the past fewyears.
BIS Review   38/1998Mr. Stals asks whether the East Asian financial crisis can be repeated in SouthAfrica  Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of South Africa, Mr. C. Stals, at a breakfastmeeting organised by Life Line West Rand in Krugersdorp on 29/4/98.1. Background to the East Asian crisisIt is now history that the economies of a number of East Asian countries collapsed inthe second half of 1997 and created disruptive turmoil in financial markets around the world. Thecountries most affected were Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines andThailand.A number of reasons were provided for this collapse which shocked the worldeconomy, particularly because it occurred in those countries that were the most successful inachieving their economic development objectives during the past thirty years. The main reasonsincluded:• a substantial build-up of foreign liabilities -- particularly of a short-term nature --took place over the protracted period of rapid economic growth;• the financial sectors were not properly supervised and regulated, with the resultthat banking institutions accumulated large amounts of non-performing loans, notprovided for in capital and reserves;• there were unjustified governmental interventions in the normal working of thefinancial markets. Financial institutions were, for example, instructed to makeloans to preferred clients at low interest rates;• governance within private sector institutions, public corporations and governmentdepartments was of low quality and, in the case of some countries, undermined bycorruption;• macroeconomic policies did not adjust to the changing environment; marketswere liberalised without concurrent adjustment in internal economic structures;money supply and bank credit extension increased almost unchecked; interestrates were kept artificially low, and exchange rates were not allowed to adjust inaccordance with changes in the overall balance of payments situation.The final collapse was triggered first in Thailand, when foreign investors lostconfidence in the economy and started to withdraw part of their more liquid investments from thecountry. The authorities were very slow to react to the threatening crisis. As became evident at a laterstage, important information on the deteriorating economic situation was withheld from the marketsand vital statistics were, in some cases, deliberately not released.In the end, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, a number of thegovernments of industrial countries, and the international investment community, had to provide amassive amount of financial support -- more than US $120 billion -- to assist these countries. Thecountries themselves also had to implement painful corrective measures that will, over time, restoreequilibrium in their economies. These programmes inter alia provide for:• relatively restrictive monetary policies that must prevent further depreciation ofthe currencies to protect domestic institutions with outstanding foreign liabilitiesfrom further losses, and must eventually reduce inflation;
- 2 -BIS Review   38/1998• the restructuring of the financial sectors through predetermined reform agendas ineach country. Public sector rescue operations must be supported by cost sharingsacrifices from the private sector, and prudential regulations for financialinstitutions must be tightened;• improvements in public and corporate governance and a strengthening oftransparency and accountability;• a reduction in the dependence of public sector budgets on external funds, andfiscal provision for the costs of restructuring and recapitalising banking systems.The devastating effects of the crises can be illustrated by a few statistics from some ofthe affected countries. According to a recent World Bank report, prices of key commodities, such asrice, increased by 25 per cent or more in Indonesia, leading to food riots and major demonstrationsagainst the Government. Unemployment is rising sharply and will increase the number of peopleliving below the poverty line from 23 million to 40 million during the course of 1998.In Korea, bankruptcies and unemployment are on the rise. Eight of the thirty biggestconglomerates (chaebol) have filed for liquidation. Unemployment is expected to increase from500,000 last year to 1.2 million workers soon.In Thailand, the slump in industry is severe. Monthly sales of motor vehicles, steel,consumer electronic goods and durable consumer goods are now running at levels of 35 to 75 percent down on last year. Industrial output growth is expected to decline by about 50 per cent.In terms of the latest World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary Fund,the global economic growth rate for 1998 will be reduced by the East Asian crisis from a previousforecast of 3½ per cent to not more than 3 per cent in 1998. This will have an adverse effect on worldtrade, and also on the export prospects for countries such as South Africa. It further deteriorates theoutlook for an early economic recovery in Japan, and also holds adverse effects for many emergingmarket economies.2. The South African situationThe South African economy was so far relatively little affected by the East Asiancrisis. The foreign exchange market, and particularly the exchange rate of the rand, came underpressure for only a few weeks in October last year. Prices on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange weremore directly affected, although the declines registered at that time were wiped out by a strong bullrun over the past three months.Some other emerging markets, for example Brazil, were affected much more severelythan South Africa. The question is often asked why was South Africa left almost unimpaired by theEast Asian crisis? There are a number of reasons for this:Firstly, it must be remembered that South Africa had its own mini-crisis in 1996when sudden capital outflows from the country forced a depreciation of the rand ofmore than 20 per cent, and the introduction of restrictive fiscal and monetary policiesthat reduced the growth rate in total domestic expenditure from 5.0 per cent in 1995to 2.7 per cent in 1996, and 1.4 per cent in 1997. At the time of the East Asian crisis,South Africa had just gone through a very painful downward economic adjustment
- 3 -BIS Review   38/1998period that satisfied foreign investors of our resolve to apply acceptablemacroeconomic disciplines.Secondly, the South African problems of 1996 were created by a cyclicaldisequilibrium, following from excessive rates of growth in total domesticexpenditure, and this situation could be corrected fairly easily with the right kind ofmonetary and fiscal policies. In most of the East Asian countries, the fundamentalproblems are more of a structural nature and will require longer and more painfuladjustments to restore growth to previous levels.There are, nevertheless, a number of lessons to be learned by South Africa from theEast Asian crisis. Our country is also being integrated more and more into the global markets of theworld and, as in the case of those countries, developments in South Africa are also subject to the verycritical surveillance of the international investors’ community. At this stage, their critical monitorsare being focused on:• the health and soundness of the domestic financial sector;• the openness and efficiency of the money and capital markets, and the market inforeign exchange;• the transparency, both of policies and of macroeconomic data made available bythe authorities;• the quality of governance in both the public and the private sectors of theeconomy;• the macroeconomic policies followed in the country by the monetary and fiscalauthorities, and in respect of labour and commodity markets;• the overall balance of payments situation, including developments in the currentand in the capital accounts; and• the total outstanding foreign liabilities, with special reference to the vulnerabilityof the country for sudden outflows of capital.In recent months, foreign investors showed their satisfaction with the South Africansituation by continuing to increase their investments in South Africa. Over the first four months ofthis year, non-residents increased their holdings of South African equities and bonds by no less thanR34 billion. This enabled South Africa to continue with the programme of gradually relaxingexchange controls, and also helped the Reserve Bank to increase its net foreign reserves by R4.9billion during the first quarter of this year.South Africa can continue to hold the confidence of foreign investors, provided weare also prepared to continue to apply the sound monetary and fiscal policies of the past year. If not,foreign market sentiment towards the country can change very quickly, and we can easily be forcedinto a new financial market crisis of our own.With his latest Budget, the Minister of Finance reconfirmed the Government’sdetermination to maintain the necessary disciplines in fiscal policy. The Reserve Bank is known forits conservative approach towards monetary policy, and is equally determined to maintain strictdisciplines in the management of the money and banking systems of the country. In this way, SouthAfrica will continue to benefit from being part of the global financial system, and to make use of thesavings of other countries to help finance growth and development.In summary, it depends on us and on the economic policies we apply, whether an EastAsian crisis will also develop in South Africa. Foreign investors nodded their approval of the policies
- 4 -BIS Review   38/1998of the past year. We should therefore not deviate unnecessarily from the course of the existingpolicies.
BIS Review   37/1998˝Mr. Erçel reports on medium and long-term prospects for the Central Bankof the Republic of Turkey   Address by the Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic ofTurkey, Mr. Gazi Erçel, before the 66th Shareholders’ General Meeting, in Ankara, on 28/4/98.A detailed account of economic developments during 1997 is given in our annualreport for that year which has already been delivered to you.  We are keeping the publicinformed of our expectations for this year through the quarterly announcements of our monetaryprogramme.  Today, instead of repeating these short-term perspectives, I would like to speak ofthe medium and long-term prospects of the Central Bank.  For the last two years, my discoursehas touched on what kind of institution an ideal central bank should be.  Today, I want toconsider this matter in a more detailed way.In recent years, there has been a worldwide trend towards simplification of the goalsof central banking.  This has led to a reduction of the responsibilities they take on.  Funding theirgovernments, for example, is no longer the main purpose of central banks.  There is none amongthe western central banks that aims at achieving full employment of the highest level ofproduction.  Today’s modern central banks have only one aim: to maintain price stability.It is not surprising that the Central Bank of Turkey, one of the most importantinstitutions of the Turkish economy, which hopes to become integrated with the westerneconomies, is affected by these trends in modern central banking as it maps out its medium andlong-term strategies.Accordingly, the main goal of the Central Bank of Turkey, like that of other centralbanks, should be to maintain the stability of prices in the economy.At this stage I would like to clear up two points with respect to the price stabilitytarget.  First, the Central Bank’s price stability target and its responsibility for price stability aretwo different issues.  The price stability target assumes a stability which exists under conditionsof low inflation.  Therefore, the economy has to undergo a “disinflationary process” before theCentral Bank assumes responsibility for price stability.It is well known that in Turkey, which has been experiencing high inflation for years,reducing inflation to the levels of the western economies will require a comprehensive effort andis not a process which can be accomplished by the Central Bank alone.  The Central Bank cantrack the price stability target as a part of the larger disinflationary programme.  I believe thatonce low inflation rates have been achieved by means of such a programme, it will be a rationaldecision to make the Central Bank responsible for maintaining price stability.The second point I want to stress concerning the price stability target concernsmicroeconomic functions of central banks.  Efficient operation of a payments system andsupervision of the banking sector are two other basic functions of a central bank.  These twofunctions can also be performed in a way that supports price stability targets: indeed, a sound,effective financial sector and payments system are necessary conditions for price stability.Duties assumed by the Central Bank of Turkey in the economy, which aims at pricestability, should be consistent with the target.  Functions that conflict with the price stabilitytarget or which cause difficulties for the achievement of this target should not be assigned to theCentral Bank.  And this should be the basic theme of the Bank’s medium and long-term strategicplanning.
- 2 -BIS Review   37/1998˝Whether or not those functions assumed by the Central Bank as a result of suchfactors as the country’s geographic size, history, legal structure and degree of technologicaldevelopment operate as impediments to the achievement of stability targets, can be examined bymeans of several criteria.  Effective use of monetary policy is an absolute necessity for a centralbank that takes price stability as its first priority.  We must therefore review those functions ofthe Central Bank that interfere with the effectiveness of monetary policy.At this point, I would like to emphasise the importance of increasing the CentralBank’s control over its own balance sheet, which is one of the main conditions required for theeffective implementation of policies, mainly monetary policy, that must be adopted in order toachieve the price stability target.  Over the past decade, substantial improvements have beenvisible in the Central Bank’s balance sheet, especially on the asset side.  Foreign assetsincreased, while domestic assets dropped sharply due to the decrease in loans to the publicsector, including valuation accounts.  The final step to be taken in this area will be to reduce, bylaw, the advances made by the Central Bank to the Treasury to zero.  Pursuant to the protocolbetween the Central Bank and the Treasury, signed in the second half of last year, theeffectiveness of the monetary policies pursued by the Central Bank increased during this period.An amendment to our laws will ensure the continuance of this favourable condition.  And therevision of the financial relationship between the Central Bank and the Treasury and the increasein the Central Bank’s control over its balance sheet will aid the achievement of the price stabilitytarget.But the structural improvements seen on the asset side of the Central Bank’s balancesheet in recent years have not been matched by similar improvements on the liability side.  OurTurkish lira liabilities represent a minor share in our total liabilities.  To improve thisunfavourable situation, which can be seen as the reflection in our balance sheet of high inflation,will require a lasting reduction in the inflation rate, which is the basic reason for this problem.Converting our liabilities into Turkish lira is one of our goals for the medium term.Independence is of great importance in the medium and long-term perspectives of theCentral Bank.  An independent central bank, with respect both to its goals and its instruments,will promote the achievement of the price stability target.  A central bank which is independentwith respect to instruments will implement its monetary policy effectively.It is also recognised that a central bank which is independent of political authoritywill play an important role in minimising fluctuations arising from political uncertainties.Today, it is apparent that economies with independent central banks that havemaintained monetary and financial stability are very strong.The basic features of the Central Bank’s medium and long-term strategies are tochoose price stability as its main target, to establish consistency between its functions and itsmain target, and to revise any functions that may impede the implementation of its monetaryprogramme and in this context to achieve its independence.On the other hand, the organisational efficiency of the Central Bank can be seen asthe complementary element of this strategy.  There is no doubt that a central bank with qualifiedpersonnel, which fulfils its duties with high productivity, will earn full credibility.  Distinguishedguest, here let me quote one of the economists:  “Credibility cannot be purchased, it must beacquired.  And this is achieved step by step, through consistent policy implementations.”To carry the Central Bank, one of Turkey’s most credible institutions, into the futurewith this in view is the fundamental mission of my fellow workers and myself.
BIS Review   36/1998Mr. George discusses international economic and monetary management andthe implications of the present disturbances in Asia   Text of the Henry Ford II Lecture deliveredby the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J George, at Cranfield University School ofManagement on 21/4/98.It is a real pleasure to be back here at Cranfield to deliver this Henry Ford II Lecture.The Lecture - as you have just heard - commemorates an award made by the Ford Motor Company,in celebration of Henry Ford II’s 60th birthday, to Cranfield School of Management.  It was one ofjust two such awards to European business schools.  And we have just seen evidence - in thepresentation of the Henry Ford Award - of the continuing close relationship between the Ford MotorCompany and the School of Management.  The University has every reason to take pride in the factthat the achievements of the School are recognised by a great multinational company in these ways -as I take pride in my own links with Cranfield.Given the nature of the occasion, Mr. Chairman, I thought it might be appropriate if Iwere to look beyond the narrow perspective of the monetary and economic situation in this country -though I will say something about that towards the end of my remarks - and focus on some wideraspects of the international economy.  I will begin with a broad overview of the current internationalapproach to overall economic management, then say something about the present disturbances inAsia, and finally about their implications for the prospects for the rest of the world.Let me begin with just a few words about the process of international economic andmonetary management.  I have just returned as it happens from the annual Spring Meeting of theIMF in Washington, where the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors from all around theworld gather to discuss current international developments.  We all meet again every autumn.  Lastweek, we debated much the same agenda in a variety of meetings - in the Group of 7 major industrialcountries; in the Group of 10 - actually eleven - a somewhat wider range of industrial countries; inthe Interim Committee in which all IMF member countries are represented, in constituencies; andthis time in a new ad hoc Group of 22 or 23 countries including a broad cross-section of industrial,emerging and transition countries.  Invariably the journalists, who also gather in Washington, quitereasonably ask, “What exactly did you decide in all those meetings?” And almost invariably, wehave to respond that “We did not actually decide on anything - we agreed we should do some furtherwork and meet again for further discussions!” You could be forgiven for thinking that the wholeprocess of reaching international agreement on anything moves at a snail’s pace!But even a snail can make remarkable progress if it keeps going.  I am told that thequick species - I suppose they are the Model T snails - travel at a speed of three inches a minute - say5 yards an hour.  In that case a quick snail could have travelled quite easily from Cranfield to theborders of Scotland since the collapse of the Berlin Wall! And if you look back over a decade ratherthan at the outcome of just the latest meetings, then there really has been remarkable progress -within the developing, emerging and transitional economies as well as the industrial world - towardsa broad international consensus on approaches to economic management.  That consensus canperhaps be summed up essentially as macro-economic stability and supply-side flexibility - but thatneeds some elaboration.On the macro-economic side we have learned - and it has taken some countries longerthan others - that you cannot achieve what we are all trying to achieve - sustained growth, high levelsof employment and rising living standards - simply by pumping up demand in our economiesthrough expansionary monetary and fiscal policies without regard to the underlying supply-sidecapacity of our economies to meet that demand.  Short-term demand management through monetarypolicy too often led just to accelerating inflation, which had then eventually to be brought undercontrol through recession - an absolute recipe for short-termism in both financial and business
- 2 -BIS Review   36/1998behaviour.  Equally, excessive public expenditure - which had ultimately to be financed throughhigher taxation - imposed burdens on the private sector which weakened its capacity to generateemployment and income and wealth.So the emphasis now, more or less everywhere, is on effective price stability as theimmediate objective of monetary policy - not simply as an end in itself but as a measure of thebalance between aggregate demand and underlying supply in the economy as a whole, in order tomoderate rather than aggravate the economic cycle, and so to provide the basis for sustainablegrowth at around the underlying rate of growth of productive, supply-side, potential.  And theemphasis now - again more or less everywhere - in relation to fiscal policy is to limit public sectorborrowing, and the outstanding level of public sector debt, to levels that can be sustained into thefuture, without the need for increasing tax burdens or raising real interest rates on the private sector.These objectives of macro-economic policy - monetary and fiscal policy - will befamiliar to you in recent years in this country; they are at the heart of the policies being pursued inContinental Europe by those countries that, in just under a fortnight from now, will agree to moveahead to Monetary Union; and they are the policies endorsed, too, by all the members of the IMF inthe Madrid Declaration adopted at the IMF Annual Meeting in 1994 and expanded and updatedeighteen months ago.  Of course on occasion the flesh proves to be weaker than the spirit - andachieving these macro-economic objectives is not easy in practise even as a technical matter.  But theintention - the international commitment to macro-economic stability - is clear and this in itself oughtover time to mean a radical change - for the better - in the environment for private sector businessactivity across the world.Acceptance of the aim of macro-economic stability has brought into sharper focus thestructural, supply side, of the economy - that is the whole raft of influences that can affect theunderlying growth rate of capacity and thus the growth rate of aggregate demand that can besustained.In this context there is a strengthening international presumption in favour of openmarkets and free competition - both domestically and internationally - with a continuing strongpresumption against predatory trade or exchange rate manipulation.  The argument is that undistortedcompetition contributes to potential macro-economic growth through increased efficiency and themore effective allocation of productive resources.This in itself is somewhat remarkable, given that, at the micro-economic level,competition invariably constitutes a threat to established producers - and their employees - who maybe tempted to make, often highly vocal, pleas for protection in one form or another to their nationalgovernments.  Consumers, who benefit from competition, tend to make less noise.  The threat ofprotectionism is never, therefore, far away.  But in fact the presumption in favour of competition hasproved encouragingly robust.  And that is not just in relation to international trade.  Domesticderegulation is increasingly in vogue in many countries; and there is much greater openness aroundthe world to inward investment and foreign ownership.  I see the same presumption in favour ofcompetition, for example, in the global trend to privatisation, through which governments haveincreasingly returned commercial activities, in which they have no necessary comparative advantage,to the market sector.  At the same time, against the background of financial globalisation, attentionhas in the past few years increasingly focused on removing restrictions on the free flow of capital -again domestically and internationally - essentially on the grounds that this can further improve theeffective allocation of productive resources, increasing the benefits to be derived from competition inmarkets for goods and services.  The IMF is in fact currently working on an amendment to itsArticles of Agreement to give it a greater role in promoting the liberalisation of external capitalmovements.
- 3 -BIS Review   36/1998Of course, it remains true that market competition, and the supply capacity of theeconomy more generally, are inevitably influenced by virtually every other aspect of public policy,and will be affected to varying degrees by the particular social and economic judgements made bynational politicians.  This is true whether one is talking about direct public sector provision - ofeducation and training, for example, or incentives to saving and investment, or current or prospectivewelfare provision, or the structure of taxation.  And it is true equally of government intervention inthe form of regulation and social protection.  But my strong impression is that there is a growingawareness in many countries that policies in all these areas need to take account of potentialsupply-side effects, with an increasing bias towards structural reforms, in labour, product and capitalmarkets, with a view to increasing employment and reducing distortions that impede efficientresource allocation.Now I do not pretend to you, Mr. Chairman, that the international policy consensusthat I describe - particularly on the supply-side - is fully articulated; nor do I claim that it issubscribed to in its detail equally in every IMF member country.  But it does represent a substantialevolution in our collective thinking over the past decade or so towards a much more commonapproach to economic management, which serves as a valuable framework within which countries’performance can be assessed.  The snail may have moved slowly but it has in fact travelled aconsiderable distance!It has nonetheless still a long way to go.  Its progress has been impeded in the pastfew years by the eruption of a number of financial disturbances - most recently in Asia - which havedrawn attention to continuing deficiencies in our approach to economic management; and we spentmuch of the time last week in Washington discussing what lessons we might learn from those events.The storm last year in Asia struck essentially the ASEAN four - Thailand,the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia - spreading subsequently to South Korea and intermittentlybattering Hong Kong and elsewhere.It is still not wholly clear - to me at least - quite why the storm struck suddenly whenit did.  Most crises of this sort have their origins in some evident macro-economic policy failure.  Atleast in hindsight there are usually fairly clear tell-tale signs of expanding fiscal deficits and/or laxmonetary policies, classically accompanied by evidence of imbalance in the form of acceleratinginflation or a rapidly deteriorating balance of payments.  There were such signs, perhaps mostnotably in Thailand; but they were not for the most part particularly pronounced in Asia.  In factthrough the first half of the 1990s, and in some cases for much longer, the countries in question hadbeen remarkably successful.  They attracted, by their very success, huge inflows of capital from therest of the world, where yields had fallen, in the hope of sustaining higher returns.There is no question that this capital inflow made a very big contribution to theeconomic expansion in Asia; but with the benefit of hindsight, the accelerating scale of the inflow,and particularly the forms that it took, became an important part of the problem.  It was not all in theend productively employed.  There was over-investment in some sectors; much went into ambitiousproperty development; and much went into financial rather than real assets.  The hoped-for higherreturns could not be maintained.Again with the benefit of hindsight, it is possible to identify a number of structuralweaknesses in the mechanisms for financial resource allocation in the recipient countries.  Therewas, for example, a general lack of reliable financial information, and a lack of transparency inrelation to the financial position, of both public and private sectors.  Complex and opaque linksbetween government, financial institutions and non-financial companies made it difficult foroutsiders to understand the real nature of their exposures.  Financial markets were not welldeveloped, leaving the system heavily dependent upon the banks.  There was inadequate regulatoryor supervisory oversight.  There was widespread, often informal, government influence over
- 4 -BIS Review   36/1998financial flows, which importantly also contributed to a perception that much of the borrowing wasimplicitly under-written by the government.  The list could go on.The problem was compounded by the absence of any real perception of exchange raterisk.  Borrowers were evidently confident that governments would maintain their exchange rate pegsagainst the dollar, even when it began to strengthen, so that unhedged foreign currency debt, much ofit at short-term, appeared to be a cheap alternative to domestic currency borrowing.  The result was abuild-up of short-term foreign currency liabilities, by banks and non-banks, which was not fullyappreciated, and which left the Asian economies especially vulnerable to a flight of capital in theevent of a change in sentiment.  The problem is that national authorities can create their domesticcurrency, if they choose to do so, even if it leads to inflation, but they cannot simply create foreigncurrencies in the same way.So, once the run started, it was violent and contagious.  For a time around the end oflast year there was a significant possibility of a chain of default emanating from Asia that could havereverberated right through the global financial system.  The immediate task was how to contain thatrisk.Essentially there are two broad options for dealing with an external financial crisis.One is simply to allow financial markets - exchange markets, interest rates, and stock and bondprices - to take the strain, and to seek to restore confidence, and moderate the impact of marketmovements, by restrictive macro-economic policy adjustment.  The second is to limit the financialmarket impact and the extent of the associated macro-economic adjustment by providing orarranging alternative external financing.  In practice these options are not, of course, mutuallyexclusive and the real question is the appropriate balance between them.Where a country has transparently been pursuing an unsustainable macro-economicpolicy, most people find it easy to accept that that country should bear the burden and adjust, painfulthough that may be.  Many people find this harder to accept where, as in the present case,conventional macro-economic policies had, for the most part, been relatively responsible.  Therewere certainly adjustments to macro-economic policy that needed to be made - a more flexibleexchange rate regime in some cases, for example, or a somewhat tighter overall macro-economicstance, with perhaps some adjustment between fiscal and monetary policy.  And, once the capitaloutflow had started, macro-economic adjustment had to be harsher than might otherwise have beennecessary, in order to re-establish confidence.  But there are real dangers in extreme marketmovements or in excessively severe macro-economic adjustment to contain them.  That could causea vicious circle of domestic default and systemic financial weakness in the affected country.  Andthat could have seriously adverse implications - in terms of both financial and economicknock-on-effects - for the global economy.That, essentially, is why it may be in the self-interest of the international communityto attempt to mitigate the market and macro-economic adjustment pressures by providing financialsupport.It is why the international community responded to the crisis in Asia by promptlyoffering very large amounts of official assistance - $17 billion in the case of Thailand, $43 billion forIndonesia and $57 billion for South Korea.But such official financial help cannot be unlimited and it cannot be provided withoutstrings.  It, too, has real dangers.  If it were too readily forthcoming it could encourage “moralhazard”, especially by encouraging commercial lenders - particularly foreign currency creditors - inthe belief that they will be bailed out if things go wrong.  That would be likely to add to the problemof potentially volatile capital inflows next time around.  Not surprisingly, too, there is strong political
- 5 -BIS Review   36/1998resistance in many countries, including notably the United States, to the idea that public,i.e., taxpayers’, money should be used to bail out private creditors, especially foreign creditors.External financing need not come solely from the public sector.  Private financewould, in principle, serve the same purpose, and in many situations market price adjustments may besufficient to stem the capital outflow.  But, given the extent of the loss of confidence in the Asiancase, organising private financial support meant in practice persuading existing creditors that theirassets would be better protected if they were prepared to leave them in place, especially if othermajor creditors agreed to do the same and if official support was made available in parallel.  But inthis case, too, difficult judgements had to be made.  There was a danger that, if private creditors hadto be in effect coerced into staying put, they would immediately cut their positions elsewhere, whilethey still could, adding to the international contagion.In fact, in the critically important case of Korea, the promise of massive officialsupport failed to restore market confidence.  And when it became apparent that the official bilateralfinancing was in practise available only as the very last resort we had to turn to the commercial banklenders in the major creditor countries and persuade them to extend the maturity of their loans.  Itwas a dangerous moment.  But their constructive response went a long way to resolving theimmediate crisis and helped to restore greater financial stability to the region as a whole.  Thecreditor banks are also now in negotiation with Indonesia’s commercial debtors.The discussion in Washington turned to preventative measures for the future.It would have been understandable in the light of the Asian experience if there hadbeen some turning back from the path towards greater freedom of international capital movements,and there was some suggestion of this.  But on the whole the long term benefits of free capital flowswere upheld, and the mood was to continue cautiously down that path, but to emphasise the need, notonly for sound macro-economic policies which everyone accepts as a sine qua non, but also for stepsto accompany capital account liberalisation designed to reduce the risks of volatility.These related in part to the process of capital account liberalisation, where there was agood deal of stress on ‘sequencing’ - that is on liberalising potentially more stable, longer-term,capital inflows initially, rather than short-term borrowing.But they related particularly to three key conditions for living with freedom of capitalmovements.The first was “transparency”.  In a broad sense a need for greater transparency wasrecognised in relation to public policy, to the relationship between the public and private sectors, tocorporate governance and accounting and so on.  In a narrower sense there was seen to be a need forgreater and more timely disclosure of financial information generally, but especially in relation tocountries’ true foreign exchange reserve positions and in relation to their short term external debt.The general point is that we cannot reasonably expect markets to make a proper assessment of therisks of their lending if they do not have adequate information in accessible form.  The corollary isthat where they do have adequate information they can be expected to accept the penalty if theirjudgements prove ill-founded.The second condition for more stable capital flows is stronger financial systems.That includes for example the broadening of capital markets so that the allocation of capital is lessconcentrated on local banking systems.  It includes robust financial infrastructure - for examplepayments and settlements systems.  And it includes more effective financial regulation andsupervision.  A key feature of future arrangements for me in this area is the encouragement of moreactive management of short-term foreign currency assets relative to liabilities, by both the public
- 6 -BIS Review   36/1998sector and the local banks, taking account of the nature of the exchange rate regime.  It wasweaknesses in this area, above all, in my view that turned the Asian problem into a panic.These various steps - which need a great deal of elaboration and refinement - inthemselves represent a huge agenda for the future.  But however much we try to prevent accidentswe need nevertheless to be prepared for them to happen.  The third condition for living with greaterfreedom of capital movements, therefore, is a more consistent view of how, when a crisis does break,the burden might be expected to be shared in the future between official and private sector financing.In this context, one thing seems clear: given the evidence of public resistance, wecannot assume that massive official financing packages will in fact be deliverable in the future to bailout private creditors.  Various ideas have been put forward for involving the private lenders inmaturity extension - within a formal legal framework or through official persuasion - and they, too,need to be elaborated and refined.  But it might help to avoid inflows becoming excessive if privatelenders clearly understood from the outset that they would be expected to carry a substantial part ofthe load.Mr. Chairman, the debate on all of these issues is still at a relatively early stage.  Butit is an important part of the present international monetary agenda and you can expect that, as thedebate crystallises, aspects of it will be gradually added to the policy consensus.  Our snail must keepmoving forwards.In the meantime, Mr. Chairman, the world too goes on.  So let me conclude with afew remarks on the prospects for the global economy, bearing in mind the potential economicaftershock from Asia’s financial disturbances.In fact those prospects are less bleak overall than you might suppose.The last few years have seen world growth at around 4%, against a longer-termaverage rate of just under 3½ % - with the improvement extending across both the industrial and thedeveloping countries as a whole and with stabilisation now in the transition economies.  Meanwhile,inflation has declined almost everywhere.The latest IMF projections suggest world growth of just over 3% this year - more than1% less than was projected as recently as last October.  The slowdown - and downward revisions -are heavily concentrated on the Asian countries themselves, notably Japan, which, because of themassive size of its economy has a large impact on world growth.  Elsewhere among the majorindustrial countries weaker demand from Asia is expected to be offset by relatively strong domesticdemand, so that overall output growth is not much affected - indeed it is expected to pick up on thecontinent.  A troublesome feature of these projected developments - coupled with recent exchangerate movements - is that they imply large external payments imbalances which will need to becarefully managed if they are not to lead to protectionist pressures and exchange market volatility.Against that background the G7 surveillance discussion focused particularly onJapan, where financial fragility - in the wake of the bubble and subsequent collapse of asset prices -continues, which is itself acting as a drag on the domestic economy and which is compounded by aloss of both consumer and industrial confidence.  Both the financial fragility and the domesticeconomic weakness are now aggravated by the problems elsewhere in Asia.  Everyone at the meetingwelcomed the Japanese commitment of public funds to strengthen the financial system and the recentannouncement of large fiscal stimulus to strengthen domestic demand led growth, which will help toreduce Japan’s external surplus and also to strengthen the Yen.
- 7 -BIS Review   36/1998In relation to the other major industrial countries there was general puzzlement at thepersistent strength of equity markets and about the implications if it were to continue - or even if itdoes not.Particular points made in relation to continental Europe were that it is importantthere, too, that the gathering recovery - hitherto driven largely by external demand - shouldincreasingly be based on sustained growth of domestic demand; and that continuing structuralreforms will be necessary to combat persistent high unemployment - especially now in the context ofmonetary union.  In the United States and this country, on the other hand, which both grew stronglylast year on the back of domestic demand, the emphasis was on a need for vigilance - as always - tostay on a non-inflationary path so that sustainable growth can be maintained.The IMF’s analysis of this country’s position, Mr. Chairman, is in fact very similar toour own.  We both recognise that aggregate demand growth needs to moderate quite sharply ifinflation is to be held to the Government’s target over the next two years or so.  We are alreadyclearly seeing a weakening of net external demand in response to the sterling’s exaggeratedappreciation - particularly against other European currencies - since the autumn of 1996 and now inresponse to the Asian crisis.  However undesirable that may be in terms of the balance of theeconomy - and I am very sensitive to the hammering being taken by the internationally exposedsectors - it does provide a little more time to bring about the necessary moderation of the strength ofdomestic demand growth, which we expect to occur as a result of both the fiscal and monetarytightening already in place, and in the absence this year of “windfalls” from demutualisations.  Thecritical judgement relates to the precise timing and pace of this moderation of domestic demandgrowth, and whether it will be sufficient to prevent a pick up in inflation as the dampening effects ofthe strong exchange rate and weaker external demand wear off.Now - although there are some encouaging signs - frankly no-one can know theanswer to that question with any great confidence - we are not blessed with perfect foresight!  As theIMF says in one of its documents prepared for the recent meetings: “Striking the right balance formonetary policy in this environment is a difficult challenge.” Well you can say that again! It ishardly surprising against this background that there should be disagreement within the MonetaryPolicy Committee as to whether or not a marginal further tightening of monetary policy isnecessary-in fact I would normally expect there to be disagreement when we are close to where weneed to be.  But we are all unambiguously clear about where we need to get to in terms of inflation,and it is unrealistic in the circumstances - indeed in any circumstances - to expect us to say what willhappen to interest rates in the future.Mr. Chairman, the overall prospect for the world economy - and indeed our owndomestic economy - is for continuing growth with low inflation, and we do I think have a clearvision of where we want to go and the policies to take us there.  But there are certainly a number ofimmediately painful blackspots - internationally and here at home - and there are some formidablerocks and potential whitewater further ahead.  Navigating through them will not be easy.  I only hopethat our snail is able to swim.
BIS Review   35/1998˝Mr. Bäckström speaks on Swedish monetary policy outside EMU   Address bythe Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Urban Bäckström, to the Monetary Policy Forumorganised by the Centre for Business Policy Studies and the Riksbank in Stockholm on 22/4/98.I am pleased to note that the Centre for Business Policy Studies (SNS) ismaintaining the tradition, together with the Riksbank, of arranging the Monetary Policy Forum.This is our sixth annual opportunity of discussing monetary policy issues in the Forum and whatcould be more natural on this occasion than to consider the monetary policy future in Europe inconnection with the launching of what is perhaps history’s most momentous project in this field.Besides the question of how monetary policy will be conducted in the euro area, an equallyimportant issue for us in Sweden is how our monetary policy will be affected when Stage Threeof EMU starts and Sweden does not participate initially.The discussion of “Monetary Policy in EMU” is to be opened by my Finnishcolleague, Dr. Sirkka Hämäläinen, and I want to take this opportunity of wishing her a heartywelcome to Sweden.  In this context I should also like to express my appreciation of the closecooperation between Suomen Pankki and Sveriges Riksbank, which we reckon to continue eventhough Finland participates in the monetary union.The topic assigned to me is “Swedish Monetary Policy Outside EMU”.  First Ishall paint my picture of what an outsider position will entail for Sweden’s economic policy.Then I will look at how monetary policy in Sweden is constructed in principle and conclude withsome remarks on the current situation.In that Sweden will be outside the euro area initially, our economic policy will beconstructed to fulfil the goals that are set up in Sweden.  These goals are based in turn on ourdomestic priorities together with the commitments we have as a member of the European Union.To a large extent, Sweden’s priorities are the same as the EU’s: implement an economic policyconstructed for stability and low inflation, thereby creating conditions for a good development ofprosperity.  Participation or otherwise in the monetary union does not affect the need for abalanced economic policy.Monetary policy aimed at price stabilityA political majority has stated that membership of the European exchange ratemechanism, ERM, is to be seen as a preliminary step towards participation in the monetaryunion.  Thus there are reasons for supposing that the question of ERM membership will not betopical until the issue of future EMU participation has been resolved.  Meanwhile, the Riksbankwill continue to operate with a flexible exchange rate regime and an explicit price stability targetfor monetary policy.  Here it should be underscored that experience to date indicates that thisregime is working well.From the beginning of 1999 the Riksbank’s present independent position will beformally embedded in law.  The price stability objective will have statutory force and thefunction of the Riksbank will be to ensure that this objective is fulfilled.  The amendments to thelegislation on the Riksbank have already been approved once by the Riksdag (Sweden’sParliament) and a second vote on this constitutional change is scheduled for after the generalelection in September.  The reform is supported by five of the political parties and thus by a clearparliamentary majority.
- 2 -BIS Review   35/1998˝These changes meet EU requirements concerning monetary policy and the role ofthe central bank.  Whether or not we adopt the single currency, Sweden has undertaken to havean independent central bank and this entails a far-reaching delegation of monetary policydecisions on the basis of an operational objective.Budget policy aimed at surplusSimilarly, Swedish fiscal policy will continue to be based both on our nationalobjectives and on the requirements that have been adopted for the European Union.An objective for Sweden’s public finances has been set up by the Government andapproved by the Riksdag.  In the medium term the government budget is to show a surplus,measured as the cyclical average, of 2 per cent of GDP.  In that a surplus is generated,government debt can be reduced so that future challenges which Sweden’s economy may facecan be tackled without creating problems for government finances.Considering the government debt that has accumulated in the 1990s and the factthat Sweden’s public finances are relatively sensitive to cyclical activity, this objective isreasonable.  Current assessments, based on existing decisions and official economic policy,suggest that the budget policy target will be met in the coming years.Besides the greater awareness of the importance of stable finances, the conditionsfor fulfilling the budget objective have been improved by institutional changes to the budgetprocess.  Sweden’s new budget process is inherently more disciplined than before and this cancontribute to the maintenance of sound finances.The Swedish objective of government financial consolidation is in line with theEU budgetary aim of positions close to balance or in surplus over the medium term.  SoSweden’s fiscal policy is also subject to EU agreements even though we have deferredparticipation in the monetary union.  Sweden has undertaken to aim for the objectives in theStability and Growth Pact.More generally, as a member state, Sweden has undertaken to regard its economicpolicy as a matter of common concern to all EU member states.  We will accordingly beparticipating in the economic policy discussions and be subjected to assessments andevaluations.  We are also taking part in the drafting of the broad guidelines of economic policies;these guidelines, which can be likened to fiscal plans for the Community, are to be incorporatedin the construction of EU countries’ economic policies.Sweden moving towards stabilityA broad consensus has been established - in the world in general as well as inSweden - about the objectives and institutional arrangements that are appropriate for economicpolicy, as well as the importance of international economic cooperation.  The inflation economythat prevailed earlier caused major problems.  An expansionary economic policy withsubsequent devaluations does not generate any lasting positive effects in the real economy.  It isliable to result in high inflation that erodes the short-run gains in terms of costs.  The longer theperiod of inflation, moreover, the more painful will be the readjustment to a more sustainableeconomic development based on low inflation.
- 3 -BIS Review   35/1998˝Developments in Sweden have been moving in the right direction for a number ofyears.  Inflation is low and growth favourable.  Earlier imbalances, in the government budget aswell as in foreign transactions, have been turned into surpluses.  Whether the adjustments in thelabour market are sufficient to permit a sustained and more extensive increase in employment inthe coming years remains to be seen.FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATE WITH PRICE STABILITY TARGETSweden is in its sixth year with a flexible exchange rate regime and the fourthyear with a specific price stability target.  Insights into the new regime have been gained step bystep, both in the Riksbank and in the Swedish community in general.  The construction of theregime and its underlying ideas have been discussed over these years, not least in these MonetaryPolicy Forums.The present monetary policy regime provides good conditions for long-term pricestability and thereby for an economy that functions better.  It also contributes to an appropriateshort-run balance between acting as a clear anchor for price stability and promoting realeconomic stabilisation.  Basically, it is a matter of minimising both the fluctuations around theprice stability target and those around the Swedish economy’s growth trend.  Cyclicalfluctuations cannot be eliminated but we can hope that sequences of intense boom-and-bust are athing of the past.Low inflation and good growth go hand in handWhen inflation converges internationally and long-term inflation expectations arepermanently lowered to the level of the target for price stability, the core of the inflation processlies in the relationship between prevailing demand and the sustainable level of output.  Ifresource utilisation is so high that it becomes strained, inflation will tend to rise.  Conversely,when resource utilisation is low, inflation tends to fall.  To a large extent it is the interaction ofdemand and supply that determines whether inflation is rising, falling or constant in relation tothe 2 per cent target.Monetary policy is capable of exerting a direct effect - through the repo rate - ononly one of these two sides of the economy, namely demand.  The supply side is essentiallyinfluenced by structural factors that the Riksbank cannot control directly.  But permanently highinflation can indirectly impair the workings of the economy, leading to weaker growth.  By thesame token, today’s low inflation should help the supply side to function more efficiently.Seen from this angle, it is easy to appreciate that a policy for safeguarding pricestability should be able to go hand in hand with a development of demand that matches thesupply side’s sustainable capacity.  In the event of a demand shock, even in the short run theRiksbank’s objective therefore coincides with that of general economic policy - a favourable realeconomic trend.  In view of the discussion that arises from time to time about objectives for theRiksbank, this should be borne in mind.  Consider these two examples:• Suppose, first, that a shock causes demand to fall; resource utilisation willthen decline, with a risk of inflation dropping below the 2 per cent target.  Themonetary stance must then be adjusted so that the rate of inflation returns tothe target.  This involves lowering the repo rate so that demand recovers.
- 4 -BIS Review   35/1998˝• Suppose, instead, that a shock causes demand to rise faster than the supplyside can cope with.  Inflation will then be liable to rise above the targeted rate.The monetary stance must therefore be tightened so that inflation falls back tothe target, which involves subduing demand to output’s sustainable level.In the various situations, the impact of monetary policy can be contractive,expansive or neutral, depending on the degree of resource utilisation and the risk of inflationdeviating from the target in either direction.  The relevant rate of inflation here and the one thatis affected by total demand, is the underlying trend.  In that this trend is in line with the target,conditions are created for sustainable growth.  In the event of a demand shock there is thus noconflict between combating inflation and promoting growth.Transient price effects of secondary importanceBesides effects from demand shocks, price movements are influenced bydisturbances in supply.  Supply-side shocks vary both in kind and in the duration of their effectson the economy.  The monetary policy response accordingly depends on how suddenly such ashock occurs and how soon it fades.  A supply shock with a direct effect on prices, for example aVAT increase, should be distinguished from an increase in productivity, which affects demandvia resource utilisation.  Let me start with the former case.A VAT increase will tend to subdue demand at the same time as it adds to the12-month rate of CPI inflation over a period of one year.  In this case, in the first year after thetax increase, demand and inflation move in opposite directions.  If the monetary stance were tobe tightened in order to achieve a prompt return to inflation’s targeted rate, it would causedemand to fall further.  Temporary price stabilisation would be accompanied by a destablisationof real economic activity.  A similar dilemma is posed by VAT reduction, which stimulates theeconomy and lowers registered inflation.  A monetary policy response in the form of a repo ratecut - to return inflation to the target - would act as a further economic stimulus.  Here, too,temporary price stabilisation would be accompanied by a destablisation of real economicactivity.I have used VAT adjustments here as an example of shocks from the supply side.Effects of the same type are associated with changes in other indirect taxes, for instance thecurrent proposal to lower the tax on tobacco.  The same applies to international oil pricemovements, as well as to the Riksbank’s own interest rate adjustments, which have a directimpact on house mortgage interest costs.How, then, should monetary policy deal with a situation in which prices areexposed to supply shocks of this kind? Part of the answer lies in the circumstance that - providedpeople’s medium or long-term inflation expectations remain unaffected - most shocks of thistype are transitory.  The Riksbank has concluded that in the normal course of events, transitoryprice effects of this type ought to be a secondary consideration in the construction of monetarypolicy in so far as they do not affect inflation expectations and thereby have a more permanentimpact on inflation.Effects of supply-side shocks may, however, be more permanent.  Animprovement in trend productivity, for example, implies lower resource utilisation and therebylower underlying inflation, and vice versa.  Such supply shocks should therefore influence theconstruction of monetary policy.
- 5 -BIS Review   35/1998˝Advantages and drawbacks of the CPIA drawback with the CPI is that it combines information about both theunderlying trend and temporary price movements.  So why has the Riksbank chosen the CPI asits target variable instead of some indicator of underlying inflation? The reason lies in the CPI’sadvantages as a familiar index that is used in many contexts, whereas the opposite applies to theconcept of underlying inflation.Sweden could, in fact, supplement the CPI figures with a series on underlyinginflation statistics that would ultimately become more familiar.  This is a matter that the CPIEnquiry will be considering.  But it is still not clear just how an index of underlying inflationshould be constructed.What is clear, however, is that this function cannot be performed by the Net PriceIndex because that excludes only one type of transitory effect, namely indirect taxes.  In that itincludes other transitory effects - for example mortgage interest costs and international oil pricemovements - the Net Price Index gives a picture of inflation’s underlying trend that isincomplete and distorted.Another alternative would be to use the EU’s harmonised index of consumerprices (HICP), which is constructed to exclude house mortgage interest costs.  One disadvantageof this index, however, is that some of its components have not yet been finalised.As an aid in the analysis of price trends, the Riksbank’s inflation reports includevarious indicators of underlying inflation.The tolerance interval of ±1 percentage point serves, among other things, toaccommodate the various transitory price movements that normally occur.  Experience hasshown, however, that in periods when the transitory price effects are extensive, inflation maymove outside the interval without this by itself having consequences that should be considered inmonetary policy.  Thus, the tolerance interval represents the range that is normally expected forfluctuations in CPI inflation.  It serves to indicate that the target variable, the CPI, cannot becontrolled exactly.Still, I am convinced that people’s awareness and understanding of these factorswill gradually grow as time passes.  This will happen not least as a result of the efforts of allthose knowledgeable analysts and business journalists who follow monetary policy closely andmostly do their utmost to explain these complex details to a broader public.Exchange rate of indirect importance for monetary policyNow I should like to say something about the role of the exchange rate.  Ourmonetary policy strategy is premised on a flexible exchange rate.  In other words, the Riksbankdoes not explicitly target the exchange rate and, given Sweden’s position on ERM, it seemstoday that the rate will continue to be flexible at least until a new political decision is taken onthe issue of EMU.  This complies with EU agreements.  ERM membership is voluntary.  Buteven in a flexible regime, exchange rate movements constitute an important policy indicator,albeit more indirectly.• If the exchange rate weakens and remains at the weaker level, demand in theSwedish economy is stimulated via increased exports and decreased imports.
- 6 -BIS Review   35/1998˝In this way, a permanent depreciation can lead to higher inflationary pressure.The Riksbank then has to keep its instrumental rate at a higher level thanotherwise in order to fulfil the price stability target.• A permanent appreciation of the krona tends to dampen demand, leading tolower inflationary pressure.  All else equal, the Riksbank can then keep theinstrumental rate at a lower level.With reference to the exchange rate, the Riksbank is wont to talk of “permanent”or “lasting” developments and that is applicable here.  We do not react to occasional marketmovements because they are unlikely to influence inflation prospects.The Maastricht Treaty requires all member states to treat exchange rate policy as amatter of common interest; this applies even if the exchange rate is flexible.  An EU country isexpected to focus economic policy - both monetary and budget policy - on stability to the samedegree as the other EU countries.  This, basically, is the absolutely crucial condition forsustained exchange rate stability.  An exchange rate that deviates permanently from thelong-term real equilibrium level may be an indication that economic policy lacks credibility.  Insuch a situation the EU member states have a “common interest” in discussing how confidencein economic policy can be enhanced.During the spring there has been a discussion in Sweden about the exchange ratetendency in connection with the move to Stage Three of EMU.  What will happen if, forinstance, companies adopt the euro as their unit of account?  The Riksbank has underscored thatit does not see any strong reasons for large currency outflows on account of the monetary union.And if such outflows were to occur and the krona suddenly weakened, we consider thatcountervailing forces would act in financial markets.The value of a currency is determined by numerous factors, of which the mostimportant is confidence in the country’s economic policy.  The general trend towardsinternationalisation in recent years has entailed relatively large currency outflows due toportfolio diversification among resident investors.  But at the same time the krona has displayedan appreciating trend as growing confidence in economic policy generated a compensatorycurrency inflow.All in all, conditions for a stable exchange rate between the krona and the singlecurrency should be good.  There are many indications that the European Central Bank will definea price stability target that resembles Sweden’s.  Similar inflation trends, together withconfidence in economic policy as a whole, should result not only in stable nominal and realexchange rates between the euro and the krona but also in conditions for a reasonable valuationof the krona.MONETARY POLICY’S CURRENT CONSTRUCTIONA long target horizon permits a gradual monetary adjustmentWhen assessing monetary policy’s construction, we look ahead to assess the pathof inflation in the coming twelve to twenty-four months.  A relatively long target horizon doeshave the drawback that earlier assessments may have to be revised.  One reason for choosing along horizon - with the attendant difficulties in making reliable forecasts - is the time lag beforeeffects of monetary policy materialise.  By acting in good time, it is possible to adjust interest
- 7 -BIS Review   35/1998˝policy more gradually and smoothly.  In this way, any consequences that altered inflationprospects may have for the monetary stance will usually be gradual and small.With a shorter target horizon, the inflation assessments might be more accuratebut the monetary policy responses would have to be more pronounced in order to fulfil thetarget.  There would also be wider fluctuations in output and employment.  Real factors likeproduction and employment are accordingly taken into account when making this choice.In view of the difficulties in assessing and forecasting economic tendencies andmonetary policy effects exactly, the Riksbank has opted for one to two years as its normal targethorizon.Lower CPI figuresThe forecasting problem can be illustrated with assessments from the NationalInstitute of Economic Research; I use them here simply as an example, not to single out theNational Institute from other forecasters.  But the National Institute is one of the forecasters withthe largest resources and it usually “sets the trend” for other forecasters.  Last November theInstitute counted on annual rates of CPI inflation of 2.0 per cent for 1998 and 2.5 per cent for1999.  In other words, inflation would move gradually upwards from the price stability target.  Inkeeping with this, the Institute also counted on an monetary policy realignment, with an expectedincrease in the repo rate from 4.10 to 5.5 per cent, that is, by 140 basis points.This March - only four months later - the National Institute’s prediction ofinflation had changed considerably, to annual rates of 1.1 and 1.5 per cent for 1998 and 1999,respectively.  The Institute’s most recent assessment is that during 1998 and 1999 there is noneed for any change from the present level of the repo rate.  What has happened to forecasters’perception of inflation?Increased element of transitory price effectsBasically, nothing has happened in the appraisal of the upward cyclical phase.The National Institute, like most other observers, counts on good growth in the coming years.The strength of the upswing may vary but the overall picture is that demand growth will besomewhat above the long-term trend, which implies rising resource utilisation.But besides expectations of lower wage increases, there have been a number offavourable price shocks on the supply side.  Falling international crude oil prices have alreadyled to price reductions for energy-related goods.  Moreover, falling interest rates have loweredhouse mortgage interest costs.  Then there is the Government’s proposed reduction of tobaccotax.  However, the price shocks from the supply side are mainly transitory and tend to lower theCPI temporarily but not necessarily inflation’s underlying trend.  It follows that these effectsprobably should not have much influence on monetary policy.  This holds even though the CPIchange figures are likely to move outside the lower tolerance limit for a time during 1998,mainly on account of the lower tobacco tax.How strong is the upward trend?As I mentioned earlier, the primary concern for monetary policy is inflation’sunderlying rate and trend.  In that the monetary conditions have been expansionary for sometime and both economic activity and resource utilisation are rising, Sweden should be moving
- 8 -BIS Review   35/1998˝towards a situation with some increase in underlying inflation.  This phase may not be imminentor involve anything dramatic but rising resource utilisation will ultimately lead to it.  But thereare some factors which may defer it.  They have to do with the momentum in the Swedisheconomy and the impact that may come from the crisis in Asia.  Another central factor is theexchange rate’s underlying trend.  In addition there is the increasingly discussed uncertaintyabout the sustainability of international share prices.To sum up, most of the evidence suggests that economic growth in Sweden willbecome stronger in the coming two years.  To date, however, the upswing has been accompaniedby subdued price movements.  This mainly reflects a number of favourable transitory effects butthere may also be signs of a somewhat lower inflation propensity.  The strength displayed byproductivity may perhaps enable the Swedish economy to expand somewhat faster withoutimmediately generating inflationary pressure.  But it is still too early to form a more definiteopinion on whether the productivity trend has changed.  It is now important that incomingstatistics are still followed closely and assessed.  As I just said, there is no reason at present toalter the repo rate.
BIS Review   33/1998˝Mr. Ferguson discusses the role of banking in the global market-placeRemarks by Mr. Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., a member of the Board of Governors of theUS Federal Reserve System, before the Urban Bankers Coalition, Inc., in New York on 4/16/98.Are Banks Safe for the World and Is the World Safe for Banks?Thank you for your kind invitation to speak to you this evening.  Your topic,banking in the global market-place, is obviously timely.  Given the role of international capitalflows, I expect that this is a topic that will continue to be the focus of a great deal of attention.The current crisis in Asia, which is both a banking crisis and a macroeconomic crisis, is thestarting point of my talk this evening.  As I considered the Asian crisis, I became curious toknow whether it is a unique problem due to a unique set of circumstances, or an accident thathappened in a few Asian countries this time, but could occur in other countries at almost anytime.  I would like to share with you the results of my inquiries.Banks Continue To Be Important in a Global ContextThe starting point of my research was to confirm the critical role banks continueto play in global finance, particularly for countries with relatively underdeveloped capitalmarkets.  For example, the Bank for International Settlements estimates that the stock ofinternational bank loans had grown to $8.5 trillion at the end of September 1997 - almost30 times the level 25 years earlier.  Importantly, loans to developing countries now total about$1 trillion.  While it is true that international bond and equity flows have grown during theperiod, new issues of bonds only exceeded bank lending 10 years ago, and the stock ofoutstanding loans is still considerably greater.This flow of capital has been critical in increasing the standard of living aroundthe globe.  Funds have flowed internationally from savers to borrowers, who generally tend to beentrepreneurs and others in business who need capital to build businesses and serve customers,both in their home countries and overseas.  This international flow moves capital toward its mostproductive use, in principle, from the higher saving industrialized world to the high return,capital-short developing nations.Are there issues that should give us concern in this benign picture?Unfortunately, there are many.  I would like to turn now to the question of whether banks aresafe for the world economy and if the world economy is safe for banking.Are Banks Safe for the Global Economy?The current crisis in Asia led me to ask how many other countries haveexperienced banking crises, either domestic or cross-border? The answer I found may surpriseyou.  Research done by economists of the International Monetary Fund indicates that 133 of the181 countries who are members of the Fund, more than two-thirds, have experienced significantbanking problems at some time since 19801.  Thirty-six of those instances would be described asbanking “crises” in that there were runs or other portfolio shifts, collapses of financial firms, ormassive government intervention.  Several countries experienced multiple banking crises.Banking crises have affected developed countries, such as the United States, Sweden, France,                                                     1   See “Bank Soundness and Macroeconomic Policy”, C.

- 2 -BIS Review   33/1998˝and Norway, as well as rapidly developing or “transitional” countries, including now Korea,Indonesia and Malaysia, but earlier Mexico, Argentina, and Chile.Banks fail for a number of reasons, including poor management, excessive risktaking, fraud and a poor operating environment.  Individual bankers too often forget thefundamental tenets of banking, which are universal and apply to internationally active banks inAmsterdam as well as to community banks here in New Amsterdam.  These tenets include:Know your customer; understand the legal framework in which you are working; thoroughlyunderstand the sources of repayment and the risk of nonperformance; and price your servicesaccordingly.  We know that in Asia banks violated some of these rules.  Banks often engaged indirected lending, either directed by government bureaucrats or commercial enterprises undershared ownership with the bank.  Because of government intervention in the lending process,Asian banks had not developed the necessary credit risk skills, and bank supervisors wereincapable of enforcing reasonable standards of behavior on the part of local banks.In the international context, the interbank lending problem that emerged in Asiaarose in part because of a lack of transparency in the financial system, making it difficult forforeign bank lenders to know the quality of the ultimate credit.  More importantly, however,foreign banks that funded Asian banks may have assumed an implicit government guarantee ofinter-bank counter-parties because a history of supporting troubled institutions may have left thatimpression.What is the impact of a banking crisis? First, the financial cost of fixing aninsolvent banking system is high, and that cost is ultimately borne by the taxpayer.  For example,in Australia’s banking crisis of 1989-1992, the IMF estimates the cost of rescuing state-ownedbanks to be nearly 2% of GDP.  In Mexico, the overall cost of several programs to support thebanking system is estimated (in present value) at 6.5% of GDP.  Currently in Japan, thegovernment has announced an intention to spend as much as 30 trillion yen, 6% of GDP, tosupport its banking system.  For Finland, Chile, and Argentina, the IMF estimated the fiscalimpact of banking crises to have been between 4% and 8% of GDP.  Finally, in the UnitedStates, resolution of the S&L crisis is estimated to have cost $150 billion, approximately 3% ofGDP in 1990.In addition to the cost imposed upon society, an unsound banking system cannotcarry out its credit-creation function and can distort macroeconomic performance.  Unsoundbanks, ones with sufficient liquidity but a high percentage of nonperforming loans and adeteriorating capital base, act on a different set of incentives than do sound banks.  First, unableto declare loans in default unless they admit their own insolvency, such banks may continue tolend to nonperforming borrowers or, alternatively, capitalize unpaid - and uncollectible - interest.That is, they may act to defer recognition of their problems.  At the same time, they might seekriskier investments to try to offset their problems with higher earnings.  In addition, such banksmay attempt to attract depositors by paying higher interest rates than their solvent competitors.A high percentage of nonperforming loans may also lead to a contraction of credit, a “creditcrunch,” as banks turn away sound borrowers in order to continue to support unsound ones orunduly raise underwriting standards in fear of making more weak loans.  Finally, a bankingsystem that is unsound cannot perform its role as a transmitter of monetary policy.  Particularlyin emerging economies, in which other financial markets are not well developed, banks transmitmonetary policy by expanding or contracting their balance sheets, i.e., engaging in more or lesslending.  An economy which is relatively stagnant cannot easily recover using monetary policy ifit is saddled with an unsound banking system, because efforts to stimulate growth by loweringinterest rates may not lead to a sufficient expansion of lending.
- 3 -BIS Review  33/1998˝In an international context with cross-border lending, the same issues may apply.Banks that are saddled with a large number of nonperforming loans from another country, eitherprivate or public debt, will have a need to work out those loans, and continue to support thoseborrowers rather than engage in new lending, either domestic or cross-border.  Similarly, suchbanks are unlikely to be as efficient as they otherwise would be in transmitting the monetarypolicy of their home country central bank into their home country macroeconomy.So it is clear that an insolvent banking system is bad for a local, and indeed, theglobal economy.  The costs to fix such as system can be substantial, the credit function cannot becarried out properly by such a system, and monetary policy may be hampered.Is the Global Economy Safe for Banking?Obviously, however, the record of banking crises around the globe does not provethat banking is the source of all problems.  Macroeconomic policy and the performance ofpolicymakers also have the potential to create systemic problems.  Macroeconomic conditions orpolicies that undergo sufficiently significant and unexpected changes impact all banks, wellmanaged and poorly managed alike.  Unfortunately, the current Asian crisis and previous bankcrises, including our own, indicate that a range of macroeconomic mistakes can lead to anunsound banking system.  Put another way, there are many macroeconomic roads to ruin.First, let’s start with Asia.  The countries currently in crisis followed traditionalmacroeconomic policies that in the main were sound.  They avoided fiscal deficits, and in somecases ran surpluses.  In addition, they avoided a general inflation in the prices of goods andservices.  However, notwithstanding responsible macroeconomic policies, strong increases inprivate spending, much of it financed by bank credit and capital inflows, turned out ex post tohave been unwarranted.  Much of the increased investment spending was concentrated in stocksand real estate, and asset price bubbles emerged.  Moreover, exchange rates were in some casesallowed to get out of line with fundamental forces in the economy, leading to sharp increases inimports and a widening of trade deficits.  To some extent this effect was a result of peggingexchange rates to the U.S. dollar, or to a basket of currencies in which the dollar had a largeweight, at a time when the value of the dollar was rising against the yen.Exchange rate and capital flow problems could similarly be assigned blame inseveral earlier banking crises, as well.  For example, in the late 1970s, the Chilean governmentfollowed a policy of rapid exchange rate appreciation, culminating in a fixed exchange rate in1979.  Credit to the private sector rose sharply as massive capital inflows followed.  Aninternational slowdown in the early 1980s resulted in a collapse in the price of copper, Chile’smajor export, an increase in the country’s trade deficit, and a sudden reversal of its capital flows.Recession followed and banks were left with unserviceable, foreign-currency-denominateddebts.However, exchange rate problems are only one type of macroeconomic concern.Other countries, such as Finland, Sweden and Norway, experienced banking crises followingexplosions in central bank credit and bubbles in asset prices or in credit creation by banks.Fiscal and monetary policy, and the need to reverse policy unexpectedly, can also lead tobanking crises if bubbles arise in asset markets and banks are heavily exposed to assets withinflated values through their lending practices or balance sheets.
- 4 -BIS Review   33/1998˝Other countries, particularly those that rely heavily on a single internationalcommodity export, such as oil, have experienced banking crises following rapid adjustment inthe prices for those commodities.  Often in these cases, the government attempts to use fiscal ormonetary stimulus to offset the loss of standard of living that results from a decline incommodity prices.  This policy generally only succeeds in inducing a cycle of strong inflation,perhaps accompanied by pressures on exchange rates, followed by a steep correction.Finally, here in the United States, the S&L crisis was due in part to deregulationof interest rates on deposits, that left S&Ls with low returns on assets but a high cost of funds.In a scramble for new sources of revenues and an effort to generate earnings, S&Ls took ongreater and greater risk.Potential SolutionsGiven this history of banking crises throughout the world - some the result of poorbanking practices, some tied to the rapid ebb and flow of cross-border capital, and some due tointernal macroeconomic policies - what should one recommend?  I would like to focus on threesets of solutions designed to minimize the risk of future cross-border banking crises:(1) improvements in supervision and basic banking skills; (2) international transparency,including sound accounting standards; and (3) ways to avoid potential problems in capital flows.This analysis also points to a responsible policy for countries faced with unsound bankingsystems.First, with respect to banking supervision, the faster pace and increasingcomplexity of financial services mean that banking supervision has had to change its methods torely more heavily on market forces as a means of regulating banks.  For example, the FederalReserve has become more focused on how individual institutions, including community banks,manage the risks of banking.In the international arena, the Federal Reserve is working with the BasleCommittee on Banking Supervision, which was established by the central banks of the majorindustrial countries, to increase outreach to emerging-market countries.  The Basle Committeehas recently published a set of core principles for effective banking supervision.  Theimplementation of these core principles should aid many countries in making their supervisionmore effective.  I believe that adopting these principles, or something like them, is an importantfirst step as countries move to participate more actively in global financial markets.  The time isprobably near when we have to determine how to encourage more countries to adopt and fullycomply with these principles, or their equivalents.  The world should not be subject to weak banksupervision in any country.Having sound banking practices may also be a necessary condition for havingfully open capital markets.  In general, the skill building and training problem for banks intransitional countries is immense.  I believe that governments should probably spend as muchtime determining how to transfer solid banking skills into domestic banks as they spend trying todetermine whether to open capital markets.  To date debate has probably centered a bit too muchon the latter and not enough on the former.Second, with respect to transparency, the Basle Committee is now exploring thepossibility of setting benchmarks for information about individual financial institutions thatshould be available to both supervisors and markets.
- 5 -BIS Review  33/1998˝More broadly, the time may be appropriate to hasten the adoption of widelyaccepted international accounting and disclosure principles that raise the standard for accountingtreatments in all countries.  These standards might focus on four key areas: (1) completefinancial statements; (2) management disclosure about risk profiles, risk management practicesand performance; (3) timeliness of disclosure and (4) control and audit environment.  The goalwould be three-fold.  First, any international accounting principles should provide the basis fordepicting a clear and fair picture of the condition of the bank and of corporate creditors.  Second,any principles should provide a means by which firms identify and disclose their major risks,such as funding, foreign exchange or concentrations.  Finally, compliance with these principlesshould be sufficient to support market confidence in the basic integrity of a firm’s publishedfinancial statements and other disclosures.Such transparency is important because, ultimately, the market is the bestregulator.  However, adequate market discipline can be brought to bear only if investors haveinformation that is sufficient in quantity, reliability and timeliness.  As my colleague SusanPhillips has said:  “Well-managed firms can benefit if better disclosure enables them to obtainfunds at risk premiums that accurately reflect lower risk profiles.  Inadequate financialdisclosures, on the other hand, could penalize well-managed firms, or even countries, if marketparticipants do not trust their ability to assess firms’ or countries’ fundamental financialstrength.”I indicated that historical experience teaches that volatile short-term capital flows,particularly those involving banks, are often at the heart of banking crises.  A third policychallenge, therefore, is how to minimize the impact of these flows without attempting to limitthem altogether, which is neither beneficial nor feasible.  One approach advocated by many isthe so-called Chilean model.  This includes a system in which firms and banks that borrow fundsfrom abroad maintain a non-interest-bearing cash reserve at the central bank for one year.  Theone-year term of the reserve deposit makes the requirement most onerous for short-termpositions, which is of course the intent.  Proponents argue that these controls encouragelonger-term, more stable investments.  However, there are downsides.  Over time, controls can,and almost certainly will, be circumvented, which might encourage even more controls.  Alsocontrols, if successful, tend to perpetuate or create distortions and inefficiencies - including theprotection of weak and poorly managed domestic financial institutions.  On balance, evenrecognizing these potential problems, I believe that short-term capital controls may beappropriate, if they are a temporary part of an orderly entry by a small country into the globalcapital market.All of the above initiatives and approaches are aimed at avoiding an insolventbanking system.  Nevertheless, since we know that banking accidents will happen in the globalmarket place, what is the best solution for countries that face an insolvent banking system?  Thebest solution to emerge from these crises and significant banking problems appears to be toremove the nonperforming loans from the bank system, even if only through government(or quasi-governmental) purchases, and then resell them to private market participants at the bestprices available.  To the extent that the government is involved, a number of questions arise.First, should nonperforming loans be purchased at par to help recapitalize banks?  This approachhas been followed in some countries, but providing such a subsidy to banks does not deal withthe issue of removing excess banking capacity nor does it discourage the repetition of similarmistakes.  Second, what process should be used to determine which banks need to be closed, ormerged, and which can continue to operate on a recapitalized basis, probably with new ownersand managers?  Third, how much support should the government provide, through guarantees forexample, to purchasers of nonperforming loans?  Our experience in the United States indicates
- 6 -BIS Review   33/1998˝that the scale of such support, however structured, must be commensurate to the problem.Finally, and by no means least important, we must consider how official assistance can bestructured, if at all, to minimize moral hazard.  Do we understand how to achieve burden sharingwith the private sector?  A critical point, though, is to act decisively to restore marketmechanisms and place nonperforming assets in the hands of those capable of putting them togreatest use.  Allowing a serious problem to languish can be a great and costly mistake.ConclusionIn conclusion, we know that the banking industry plays and will continue to playan important role in the global market place.  Unfortunately, a combination of poor bankingpractice, weak supervision and a number of macroeconomic shocks can destabilize a bankingsystem.  The solutions might include bank supervision at the best international levels, greatertransparency, and, perhaps, some interference with capital flows.  When a banking systembecomes insolvent, however, there is no substitute for stripping away the bad assets in order toallow banks to once again perform their special role in society.  Who bears the costs and how toensure market discipline may be the most important issues to be addressed in that solution.Unfortunately, given changes in technology and global economic forces, I am surethat we will not stop discussing the issue of banking crises.  I appreciate the chance to sharethese thoughts with you this evening.
BIS Review   33/1998˝Mr. Meyer remarks on the economic outlook and the challenges facingmonetary policy   Address by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors ofthe US Federal Reserve System, presented at the Public Policy Meeting, Federal Reserve Bankof Atlanta, on 9/4/98.Recent economic performance has been exceptional.  I want to focus on the forcesresponsible for this performance and how much credit economic policy deserves for theoutcome.  Then I will assess the crosscurrents shaping prospects going forward and thesustainability of recent economic performance and give my perspective on challenges facingmonetary policy.Let me emphasize that the views about the economic outlook and about monetarypolicy I present here are my own and should not be interpreted as the position of the Board ofGovernors or the FOMC.Where We Are and How We Got ThereThree forces have driven recent economic performance.  First, there has been strongmomentum in private domestic demand - the sum of consumption, private fixed investment andresidential construction - only partially offset by a decline in net exports.  The result has beenconsistent above-trend growth and a rise in resource utilization rates, particularly in the labormarket.Second, the strength in the aggregate demand for goods and services has beenencouraged by favorable financial conditions.  Whereas, normally, financial conditions becomeless favorable during an expansion and ultimately constrain demand, in this expansion financialconditions have become increasingly favorable and therefore have continued to supportabove-trend growth.  An important element in the favorable financing conditions has, of course,been the soaring stock market.Third, a coincidence of favorable shocks has enabled businesses to produce at alower cost; in the short run, at least, this restrains inflation.  The result has been a slower increasein the CPI and other measures of the overall price level, even as the economy has raced ahead tohigher utilization rates.  The favorable shocks have included a decline in oil prices, a decline inimport prices associated with the cumulative appreciation in the dollar, technological innovationsthat have sped the reduction in computer prices, changes in medical care management that haveheld down the increase in benefit costs, and improved crops that have damped food prices.The resulting economic performance has consistently exceeded expectations.  I havesaid many times that if I had a dime for every time I have had to say faster-than-expected growthand lower-than-expected inflation, I would be a rich man today! Growth over 1998 was nearly4%, the highest annual growth in about a decade.  The unemployment rate declined by about¾ percentage point last year to a quarter-century low.  And inflation declined to a more than30-year low.There is much to like about this outcome and the policy that supported it.  Monetarypolicy has helped deliver a low inflation environment and the strong economy and disciplinedfiscal policy have delivered a balanced budget.  In the case of monetary policy, the low inflationenvironment is one we believe encourages efficient resource allocation and perhaps higher levelsof saving and investment.  In the case of fiscal policy, the government is no longer competing
- 2 -BIS Review   33/1998˝with the private sector for private saving, contributing to lower real interest rates and higher ratesof capital formation.  In combination, monetary and fiscal policies have set a stable foundationfor private sector decision making.As good as policy has been, it clearly does not deserve all the credit for theexceptional recent performance.  I have a rule I religiously follow: If you didn’t predict it, don’ttake credit for it.  We did not predict this exceptional performance and we should not take morecredit for it than we deserve.  Still, there should be little question that policy has made animportant contribution to the exceptional performance.The net result of these forces has been that the economy has, in my view, movedbeyond the point of sustainable capacity.  That is, output is above it’s long-run sustainable level.Normally, this would result in rising inflation, but the favorable supply shocks have not onlyprevented a rise in inflation, but have allowed inflation to decline.  Monetary policy hasaccommodated the above-trend growth and rising utilization rates precisely because they havebeen accompanied by declining inflation.ContradictionsI always appreciated, as a private sector forecaster, that, in any interpretation of theeconomy, there were always some tensions or contradictions.  This reflects the reality that theinterpretation of the data is never perfectly clear, always subject to some uncertainty.  And so itis today.  Let me highlight three uncertainties.First, there is some question about whether or not or, at least, to what degree theeconomy is operating beyond the point of sustainable capacity.  The unemployment rate is belowthe consensus estimates of the threshold consistent with stable inflation, although there issomewhat greater than normal uncertainty about this estimate.  This threshold is called NAIRU,the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment.  The President’s Council of EconomicAdvisers estimates this threshold, for example, at 5.4%, Congressional Budget Office at 5.8%,and I have used 5.5% as my best guess.  There is, at any rate, no question about labor marketsbeing very tight.  On the other hand, the measures of resource utilization in the product market,notably the capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing sector, do not suggest excess demand.There is, in fact, an unusual discrepancy between the unemployment and capacity utilizationrates, compared to previous expansions; that is, the capacity utilization rate is lower than wouldhave been expected, based on past experience, at the prevailing unemployment rate.  Thisundoubtedly accounts for the perception of limited pricing leverage and has contributed to therestrained inflation, despite the low unemployment rate.  Nevertheless, the very tight labormarkets can be expected to put upward pressure on wage change and hence inflation, once thespecial forces restraining inflation dissipate or reverse.Second, there is some question about how to assess the degree of restraint orstimulus associated with current monetary policy.  Although the nominal federal funds rate hasremained nearly constant, the decline in inflation has raised the real federal funds rate.  Manyhave observed the rise in the real federal funds rate to a level well above its historical averageand concluded that monetary policy is currently restrictive.  The implication is that monetarypolicy is already well positioned to slow the expansion.On the other hand, many other measures of financial conditions appear to beindicating, to the contrary, that financial conditions are very favorable, highly supportive ofcontained momentum in aggregate demand and perhaps becoming even more so.  This
- 3 -BIS Review  33/1998˝interpretation appears to be confirmed by the continued strength in aggregate demand in generaland in interest-sensitive sectors in particular.  Real long-term interest rates, based on surveymeasures of inflation, have been stable to declining, equity prices have been soaring, creditavailability has been more than ample, underwriting standards may have eased some, loanpricing is aggressive, spreads between safe and risky assets have narrowed, and the moneysupply is growing rapidly.  I conclude that, notwithstanding the recent rise in the real federalfunds rate, neither financial conditions in general nor monetary policy in particular are currentlyrestraining aggregate demand.Third, there has been a significant rebound in productivity growth over 1996 and1997, compared to the previous two years.  That is clear from the data.  The question that thedata do not immediately reveal is whether this rebound was a normal cyclical rebound or marks asignificant increase in trend productivity growth.  My view has and continues to be that theincrease is predominantly a cyclical rebound.  This leads me into my next topic.StoriesIn my last outlook talk I developed two “stories” that provide alternativeexplanations for the recent exceptional economic performance.  Each story carries with it animplication about the sustainability of recent performance and a challenge for monetary policy.I call one story “temporary bliss.” This story emphasizes the role of good fortune inthe current exceptional performance and highlights the potential that we may not be able tomaintain the recent rate of growth and the current high labor utilization rates for much longerwithout ultimately suffering an increase in inflation.  The key to this story is the series offavorable supply shocks that have, in my judgment, masked, for a time, the normal consequencesof very tight labor markets and permitted the economy to operate beyond the point of long-runsustainable capacity without the usual inflationary consequences.  The challenge facingmonetary policy, in this interpretation, is to facilitate a transition to a more sustainable statebefore the favorable supply shocks dissipate or reverse.The second story I call “permanent bliss.” This story emphasizes the possibility thatstructural changes have permanently altered what the economy is capable of delivering in termsof both average growth and the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation.  In thisinterpretation, monetary policy must be careful not to interfere with the economy takingadvantage of its improved potential.The truth, as I have noted previously, is likely some combination of the two stories.I keep them separate to highlight the differences in policy implications between temporarysupply shocks and permanent structural change.  I have said previously that I have lowered myestimate of NAIRU, for example, from 6% to 5 1/2%, in response to my reading of the evidenceof the last several years.  I have also raised my estimate of trend productivity -- from 1.1%, theaverage rate for the 20 years prior to the current expansion to 1.3% or 1.4%.A tenth of this increase in trend productivity growth reflects the technical revisionsto the CPI which have lowered the chain measure of the GDP deflator by a tenth.  This is not anincrease in trend productivity in this expansion, relative to previous expansions, but rather anupward revision to productivity growth over the entire postwar period, the mirror image of adecline in the upward bias to measured inflation.  It should be noted, nevertheless, that thetechnical revisions to measured inflation do account for part of the appearance of improvedeconomic performance.
- 4 -BIS Review   33/1998˝In addition, the data suggest to me, as to many private sector forecasters, that theremight be a tenth or two increase in trend productivity, an improvement that is generallyassociated with capital deepening, an increase in the amount of equipment each worker has at itsdisposal, as a result of the strength of investment in this expansion.  As such, this improvementin productivity growth may itself be transitory, part of a one-time increase in the level ofproductivity associated with a transition to a higher capital-to-labor ratio.  Nevertheless, even acouple of tenths improvement in productivity growth, if sustained for some period, would givean important boost to higher living standards over time.But this upward adjustment in my estimate of the productivity trend plays only anegligible role in explaining how we have managed such exceptional economic performanceover the last couple of years.  It goes in the right direction, but it is simply too small to carrymuch of the burden.  The major player in my view, in addition to the decline in NAIRU, is thecoincidence of favorable supply shocks.  The relative weights here are very important becausethey affect the challenge for monetary policy.Challenges for Monetary PolicyThe challenge for monetary policy, as always, is to sustain the best possibleeconomic performance.  The emphasis here is on the “possible.”  Sometimes we are expected todeliver more than what is possible.  We aim for maximum sustainable growth and maximumsustainable levels of output and employment.  The emphasis here is on “sustainable.” Trying todo more threatens to introduce unnecessary instability into the economy and ultimately to cutshort an expansion that otherwise has the potential to continue for some time.  Trying to do morethreatens to give back some of the reduction in inflation that has moved the U.S. to a positionvery close to the Federal Reserve’s objective of price stability.The bottom line is that it is essential that growth slow from the near 4% over 1997 toand perhaps below trend for a while to allow the economy to move toward a more sustainablestate.ProspectsThere are two sets of crosscurrents that are likely to shape the outlook immediatelyahead.  First, there is a tug of war between the continued exceptional momentum in privatedomestic demand and the external drag from the Asian crisis.  The latter shock also reinforcesthe restraint that had been projected from a cumulative appreciation of the dollar that predatedthe Asian crisis.  The result should almost certainly be some slowing in the expansion, relative to1997.  Still, the sharper-than-expected decline in oil prices, the decline in long-term bond yieldsand the further rise in equity prices in recent months are providing some offset to the externaldrag coming from Asia and the appreciation of the dollar.  The question is when and how muchof a slowing results, and whether the slowdown takes growth to or below trend, or leaves growthstill above trend.  There is still considerable uncertainty about how these crosscurrents willbalance out.Second, there is a tug of war between the very tight labor market and the set of forcesthat have been restraining inflation.  The forces restraining inflation have been winning thisbattle to date, and they have been reinforced this year by the sharper-than-expected decline in oilprices, by the even more extraordinary decline in computer prices in recent months, and by thedecline in commodity prices and further downward pressure on import prices associated with thecrisis in Asia.  Nevertheless, at some point, the favorable supply shocks will dissipate or reverse.
- 5 -BIS Review  33/1998˝As the economy entered 1998, continued momentum in private domestic demandwas clearly evident, while the drag from Asia was less obvious.  But there was clear evidence inthe trade data among the Asian developing economies that a significant swing was under way intheir trade balances and there is little doubt that the U.S. economy will bear the greatest burdenof this turnaround.  The March employment report was the strongest evidence to date that aslowing is under way, although it should be appreciated that there is often more noise than signalin one month’s data.  And, even with the unexpectedly weak March reading, hours workedadvanced at a robust 4.8% annual rate in the first quarter.  So there is still considerableuncertainty about whether the spillover from Asia and the earlier cumulative appreciation of thedollar will slow the expansion to or below trend immediately ahead.In terms of inflation, there is no evidence to date that wage pressures are building,relative to last year, and certainly no evidence of a pickup in inflation, though the recent data forcore CPI has hinted that the earlier downward trend may now be behind us.  At any rate, itappears likely, given the renewal of favorable supply shocks, that inflation will remain wellcontained this year.  But monetary policy has little ability to affect inflation this year.  Weshould, therefore, be focusing on inflation prospects for next year.  As I noted earlier, someupward pressure on inflation is likely going forward as forces retraining inflation dissipate orreverse, though a similar statement would have been in order at this time last year.  The expectedpersistence of the special forces restraining inflation is therefore an important consideration inforecasting inflation and in assessing the appropriate course of monetary policy.  It is importantthat, as the forces retraining inflation dissipate or reverse, that this upward pressure on inflationis not reinforced by inflationary pressures generated from very high utilization rates.The key to sustaining the best possible performance going forward is making thetransition from the current state where performance is exceptional but unsustainable to the bestpossible sustainable state.  That will require a slowdown in growth, preferably in the near term.Asia may accomplish this, in which case it would substitute for monetary tightening that in myjudgment would otherwise be required.
BIS Review   76/1998Mr. Ferguson discusses the state of the US economy: near-term challengesand long-term changes   Remarks by Mr. Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., a member of the Board ofGovernors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City on17/9/98.It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss the state of the economy, not leastbecause -- despite some turbulence of late in financial markets -- there is still good news toreport. We are now in the eighth year of economic expansion. Production, employment, andincomes have all been rising briskly, and the unemployment rate has declined to its lowest levelsince 1970. And at the same time, inflation has remained remarkably subdued.But the prudent central banker cannot afford to focus exclusively on the goodperformance of the past. He must constantly look as well to the future. In that spirit, today I shallnot only discuss our current economic situation, but I shall also comment on several areas that Ibelieve deserve particular attention in the period ahead. Some of these areas involve potentialrisks to our fine economic performance, and some involve potentially important structuralchanges to our economy.Before I begin, let me remind you that these views are personal and do notnecessarily reflect the views of other members of the Federal Open Market Committee or theBoard of Governors.Recent Economic PerformanceAs you know, the United States has been experiencing a period of exceptionallystrong economic growth. Real GDP rose nearly 4 percent over 1996 and again last year, thefastest rates of increase, two years in a row, in fifteen years. And activity maintained a rapid paceof expansion over the first half of this year as well, although growth apparently did step downsome in the spring. This recent performance is especially impressive because it occurred in theface of a substantial reduction in export demand associated with the crisis in Asia.This powerful economic growth has benefited American businesses throughsoaring profits. It also has benefited our governments -- federal, state, and local -- through taxrevenues that have come in above earlier expectations. And it has benefited American workers,through higher incomes and lower unemployment rates than almost anyone predicted. Our tightlabor markets have had the tremendous dividend of giving job experience to people whootherwise would be on the margins of the economy -- experience that will serve these peoplewell for many years to come. Tight labor markets are welcome, even to central bankers, wherethey can be sustained without producing cost and price pressures that will undermine prosperity.The driving force behind this sustained growth has been domestic demand, asreflected in enormous increases in both consumption and investment spending. Consumptionspending has been fueled by rapid growth of employment and incomes. With some 6 millionpeople added to payrolls over the past two years, and with compensation gains well in excess ofinflation, consumers have had the means to boost their spending appreciably. And the more thandoubling in the value of the stock market since late 1994 -- only a small fraction of which hasbeen reversed in recent weeks, I might add -- has made people more comfortable about spendingout of current income -- and probably out of accumulated assets, too. It should be no surprise thatsurveys that measure consumer confidence have recorded historic highs, nor that the personal
- 2 -BIS Review   76/1998saving rate has declined considerably. The same factors, along with the lowest mortgage rates insome time, have powered home sales to record levels.Favorable financial conditions, along with exceptionally large price declines forcomputer equipment, have made it relatively cheap for firms to invest in new plant andequipment. And with sales in a solid uptrend, this has produced a remarkable boom in capitalspending. Business fixed investment was up nearly 10 percent last year, and it rose at a still fasterpace in the first half of this year. Even more strikingly, investment has averaged 10 percentannual growth over the past five years, making this the most rapid sustained expansion ofinvestment in thirty years. As I shall discuss shortly, this investment may provide reason forsome to be optimistic about productivity growth in the period ahead. But, without doubt, it hasplayed an important role in helping to boost aggregate demand in recent quarters.One important question looking forward is whether the recent rapid growth indemand can be sustained. I am not a forecaster, but it is important to know what the consensusamong forecasters has been, and most have been expecting growth to slow from its recent pace.One reason forecasters have expected growth to slow is that production for inventories had beenrising at an extremely rapid pace that was unlikely to be maintained. And indeed, inventoryinvestment did drop down a good bit in the second quarter, contributing importantly to thatquarter’s more modest GDP growth. Still, most analysts believe that the rate of stockbuilding --at least outside the motor vehicle sector -- probably remained unsustainable and can be expectedto slow further.A second reason forecasters have expected a slowdown is that the impetus toconsumer spending from annual gains of 25 to 30 percent in share values seemed unlikely to besustained. This may seem obvious after last month’s drop in stock prices, but looking back toearlier in the year even the most optimistic forecasters were expecting stock market increaseswell short of the rates seen in 1996 and 1997. The impetus to spending from such modestincreases in household wealth would be considerably smaller than was generated by last year’soutstanding run-up in share prices. And of course, last month’s decline may provide furtherreason to expect consumption growth to slow.International RisksA third important reason forecasters have expected slower growth ahead is thecontinuing troubles overseas. The problems faced by our Asian trading partners, including thepersistent weakness of the Japanese economy, and the accompanying strength of the dollar,already have led to a sharp reduction in the demand for our exports. Indeed, in the first half ofthis year, the quantity of exports declined two quarters in a row for the first time since themid-1980s, with shipments to Korea and Japan down sharply. Declines in exports of machinery,industrial supplies, and agricultural equipment were especially noteworthy. When we include theeffect of rising imports as well, net exports subtracted more than 2 percentage points from GDPgrowth over this period, and our trade deficit on goods and services widened to about$175 billion at an annual rate in the second quarter.I should emphasize that not all of the effects on our economy of the Asian crisishave been adverse. Low prices this year of energy and other internationally traded commodities,including many agricultural commodities such as soybeans and wheat, have benefited much ofour nation -- although certainly not our oil industry or our farmers. Those low prices reflect, inpart, a decline in the demand from Asia. To put it another way, those nations exporting oil and
- 3 -BIS Review   76/1998other commodities have borne some of the brunt of the sagging Asian economies. Furthermore,the favorable financial conditions in this country may have been aided by a “flight to safety” thathelped hold down our long-term interest rates and stimulate interest-sensitive sectors likehousing. Thus, the seemingly fortuitous timing of extremely robust domestic demand that hasoffset the reduction in our export demand has not been entirely coincidental.As with any financial crisis, it is extremely difficult to predict what the future willbring for the troubled Asian countries. I remain guardedly optimistic that conditions will begin tostabilize in the coming months, and that export demand will start to firm at least a little nextyear. But that is by no means a certainty.One particular risk is that the problems that have thus far been most severe in Asiamay become more severe in other regions of the world. We have already seen this in Russia, andfinancial difficulties in other countries as distinct as South Africa and Brazil emphasize theworries and uncertainties on this score. For a variety of reasons, there could be a more“contagion” to other countries. First, investors’ appetite for international risks has gone downfollowing the Asian crises. This has led to trouble for countries that are running current accountdeficits and so are dependent on foreign capital. While most of Russia’s problems are homegrown, for example, more cautious investors probably contributed to precipitating that country’scrisis. Indeed, over the last month it has become apparent that even US financial markets are notimmune to perceptions that risk has increased. Second, as some emerging-market countries withfixed exchange rates respond to market pressures by relaxing their exchange-rate arrangements,those remaining countries attempting to peg their exchange rates may come under increasingspeculative pressures. Third, countries that have close economic ties to the hardest-hit Asiannations certainly are feeling the repercussions of a reduction in demand for their exports, and agreater economic slowdown in Asia could trigger financial problems in those countries, too. Andfinally, as I noted earlier, countries that are heavy exporters of oil and other primary commoditieshave been hard-hit by low prices.In short, international problems in Asia and elsewhere are proving to be moreprofound and sustained than many, myself included, were guessing and hoping would be thecase. Obviously, the effect of this drag on our ongoing economic expansion is an area thatdeserves close scrutiny in the months ahead.Inflation DevelopmentsBut as I noted, the flip side of reduced export demand and a strong dollar is thatthe international situation is helping to hold down inflation here at home. This helps to explainthe remarkable fact that our strong economic growth and low unemployment rates havecoincided with exceptionally favorable news on the inflation front. I cannot overemphasize theimportance of this story: rising inflation has sown the seeds of almost every cyclical downturn ofthe last half century.The consumer price index increased less than 2 percent over the past year. The lasttime consumer inflation was this low was in 1986 when, as in the present instance, consumersbenefited from declining prices of energy products. But even when we exclude volatile food andenergy items and focus on the so-called “core” CPI, inflation has been running not much above 2percent, the lowest rate in more than three decades. And a broader measure of prices, the GDPprice index, has increased only one percent over the past year, held down by rapid declines in theprices businesses pay for computers and communication equipment.
- 4 -BIS Review   76/1998This inflation performance has been better than most analysts had expected. Butwe should not exaggerate the extent of the surprise. True, most economists believe that thecurrent unemployment rate of 4½ percent is below the level consistent with stable inflation, andindeed may already be exerting upward pressure on labor costs. But almost all sensibleeconomists have long realized that unemployment is not the only influence on inflation. As Ihave emphasized, the strong dollar has led to falling prices for our imports, and low oil priceshave led to low prices for gasoline and other energy products. Low oil prices also have helpedhold down prices for petroleum-derived products like fertilizers and plastics, and they havereduced price pressures more generally by reducing firms’ utility and transportation costs.Furthermore, structural changes in the health care system have reduced the growth of firms’health care costs. These factors have all contributed to our benign inflation performance. We willneed to be vigilant because, just as these factors have worked to the benefit of low inflationrecently, any or all of them may turn around and exert upward pressure on inflation in the future.Changes in the Labor MarketOne of the complexities in the inflation outlook involves changes that appear to beoccurring in labor market practices. The extraordinary rise in labor demand and theaccompanying tight labor markets have led to labor shortages in some parts of the country.Shortages have been reported for a variety of jobs, with the supply of computer professionalsespecially tight.To some extent, firms have been responding to these labor shortages by raisingwages. And indeed, compensation increases have been growing in size for the past two to threeyears. But firms also have responded to tight labor markets in ways other than simply grantinglarger base wage increases. Firms have been making increasing use of various forms of targetedpay, such as hiring and retention bonuses, as a way to attract and retain certain key employeeswithout granting a general wage increase. These targeted bonuses seem to be most prevalent forinformation processing workers, but I sense that they are reasonably widespread beyond that areaas well. And these bonuses are often quite sizable. It is not uncommon to hear of hiring bonusesof five to ten percent of base salary, or higher.Firms are changing their compensation practices in other ways, too. Businessesincreasingly are relying less on base wage and salary increases, and are substituting some form ofvariable pay that is tied directly to performance, such as annual bonuses and profit sharing plans,or even stock options that extend well beyond senior management.These changing labor market practices have implications for the functioning of theeconomy that are both interesting and, potentially, quite important. For one thing, many targetedbonuses may not be adequately captured by our aggregate wage statistics, so if these bonuses arebecoming more prevalent, labor costs may be rising somewhat faster than the published datawould indicate. Second, these practices may lead to changes in the cyclicality of firms’compensation costs. On the one hand, if firms now are able to use targeted bonuses to certainworkers in place of generalized wage increases, this could hold down compensation costs in tightlabor markets, thereby making these costs less cyclical. On the other hand, increasing use ofvariable pay will tend to make compensation more cyclical than it otherwise would have been.Under a profit sharing system, for example, firms make larger compensation payments to theiremployees when times are good than they do when business is slack.
- 5 -BIS Review   76/1998If the latter effect were to dominate, and compensation were to become morecyclical, it would raise interesting questions about how this change might affect firms’ pricingbehavior. To some extent, of course, firms probably smooth through the cyclical ups and downsin their costs when making price decisions in any case. But such smoothing probably is notperfect, and increases in fixed pay probably would exert some upward pressure on prices.Increased use of profit-sharing bonuses, however, would presumably lead firms to boost theiremployees’ compensation precisely when they can most afford to do so. And, conversely, whenprofits are being squeezed, the resulting decline in bonus payments would help ease the firm’scost pressures. Thus, there may be reason to believe that increases in variable compensationpayments might not lead to the same price pressures as would increases in fixed compensationpayments. In other words, increased cyclicality of compensation gains might not imply anychange in the cyclicality of price increases.Finally, the spread of variable pay could lead to changes in employment patterns.Pay that is more variable is more tied to profitability. As profitability declines, so willcompensation, and it is possible that employment may not drop as much as it would in a world inwhich compensation is less closely tied to profits. In any event, it will be fascinating to watchthese labor market developments unfold, and to try to sort out the implications for themacroeconomy.Of course, companies are not moving toward variable compensation schemes toalter the macro-dynamics of the economy. Firms are moving to variable compensation schemesbecause they hope these changes will enhance their profitability, in part by raising workerproductivity. By giving workers a larger and more direct stake in the fortunes of the company,firms are providing incentives for their employees to work more efficiently and to suggestproductivity-enhancing changes to the way products are made and business is conducted. It ishard to know how successful these efforts will ultimately prove to be. Many business people areconvinced that variable compensation plans have paid off in terms of higher productivity. Manyothers are less confident, and say that they hope the changes are boosting productivity, but that itis very hard to pinpoint the sources of productivity improvements.This discussion points to one final aspect of our economic outlook that deservesmention, namely, productivity growth. In the long run, nothing is as important for our economicwelfare as productivity growth, for this is what determines the pace of increase in livingstandards. And the recent productivity data have been impressive: output per hour worked rose1¾ percent in 1997 after an advance of more than 2 percent the year before. The big question iswhether this rapid productivity growth is temporary or is permanent -- that is, whetherproductivity has merely displayed its normal short-run response to a step-up in the growth ofactivity, or whether the faster pace can be sustained for some time even as output growthmoderates.The only correct answer, of course, is that we don’t know yet. I can cite a fewreasons to be very cautiously optimistic that productivity may be on a more favorable uptrendthan it was in the 1980s. One reason is the changing incentives within the firm owing to variablepay that I just discussed, which at least some firms strongly believe has aided their productivityperformance. A second reason for optimism is the investment boom that I discussed earlier.Economic history teaches us fairly convincingly that growth in the amount of capital per workeris an important determinant of gains in output per worker.
- 6 -BIS Review   76/1998Furthermore, some analysts have argued that the computerization of our economyis only now beginning to bear fruit, and that we may expect impressive productivity advances aspeople learn to use the new technology effectively. The economist Paul David notes that it tookseveral decades following the initial development of the electric motor for companies toreorganize their production techniques to use the new invention efficiently. By analogy, David’sargument hints that the largest benefits of computerization may be yet to come.This analogy is intriguing, but counterarguments certainly can be made as well.One reason it took electric power so long to yield benefits is that it took many years for the newtechnology to gain widespread use, in part because of the huge expenditures required toreconfigure manufacturing plants to use electric power. By contrast, the transition from olderoffice equipment to mainframe computers, and then to desktop machines, often entails muchsmaller adjustment costs and so has been comparatively rapid. Furthermore, it is easy to forgetthat, while computers account for a large share of investment, they account for only a small shareof the overall capital stock, in part reflecting their rapid rate of depreciation. Thus, unlesscomputers earn a considerably higher return than other investments that firms might make, thesmall share imposes some limits on the contribution computers could make to overallproductivity growth.So, while we can be hopeful that the recent productivity increases may represent afaster long-term trend, we should not count our chickens too soon. But you certainly can addproductivity to the list of items I will be following closely in the period ahead.ConclusionWith strong output growth, low unemployment, low inflation, and rapidproductivity growth, these have certainly been good times to be a central banker. But this doesnot mean that they are not interesting times, as a glance at the financial pages will drive home.Although our economy is basically very strong, we also face near-term and longer-termchallenges, and I hope I have given you a sense of some of the issues that will be on my mind as Itry to gauge our nation’s economic performance in the period ahead.
BIS Review   74/1998Mr. Kelley reports on the Year 2000 progress of the banking and financialservices sector in the United States   Testimony of Mr. Edward W. Kelley, Jr., a member of theBoard of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, on the Year 2000 progress of the bankingand financial services sector, before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the USHouse of Representatives on 17/9/98.Thank you for again inviting me to appear before this Committee to discuss theYear 2000 issue. This problem poses a major challenge to public policy: the stakes are enormous,nothing less than the preservation of a safe and sound financial system that can continue tooperate in an orderly manner when the clock rolls over at midnight on New Year’s Eve and themillennium arrives. The Year 2000 problem will touch much more than just our financialsystems and could temporarily have adverse effects on the performance of the overall USeconomy as well as the economies of many, or all, nations if not corrected. As I said last April intestimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, some of themore adverse scenarios are not without a certain plausibility, if this challenge were beingignored. But it is not being ignored. While it is impossible today to precisely forecast the impactof this event, and the range of possibilities runs from minimal to extremely serious, an enormousamount of work is being done in anticipation of the rollover of the millennium, and I amoptimistic that this work will pay off.In that spirit, let me update you on what the Federal Reserve has done to addressthe Year 2000 issue. Since I last testified here in November 1997, the Federal Reserve has metthe goals that we set for ourselves. We have:• renovated our mission-critical applications and nearly completed our internaltesting;• opened our mission-critical systems to customers for testing;• progressed significantly in our contingency planning efforts;• implemented a policy concerning changes to our information systems; and• concluded our initial review of all banks subject to our supervisory authority.While these accomplishments are indicative of our significant progress inaddressing the Year 2000 issue, much work remains. In the testing area, we are finalizing plansfor concurrent testing of multiple mission-critical applications by customers. We arecoordinating with the Clearing House for Interbank Payment Systems (CHIPS) and the Societyfor Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) to provide a common test dayfor customers of Fedwire and these two systems. We have a System-wide project underway toenhance our contingency plans to address failures external to the Federal Reserve. We areconducting a second round of supervisory reviews of banks subject to our supervisory authorityand also actively coordinating with various domestic and international Year 2000 organizations.This morning I would like to discuss these achievements and the important aspects of the job thatremain ahead of us.
- 2 -BIS Review   74/1998Federal Reserve ReadinessThe Federal Reserve has completed the renovation of its mission-critical systems,and we are nearing the conclusion of our internal Year 2000 testing efforts. Internal testingincludes both individual applications and application interfaces, such as the exchange of databetween Fedwire and our Integrated Accounting System. Testing is conducted through acombination of two elements: one is future-dating our computer systems to verify the readinessof our information technology, and the other is testing critical future date processing within ourbusiness applications. Communications network components are also being tested and certifiedin special test lab environments at the Federal Reserve Automation Services and the Board ofGovernors. The Reserve Banks and the Board have implemented test century date change (CDC)local area networks to verify the readiness of vendor provided products and internal applicationsthat operate in network-based computing environments. With the exception of a few systems thatwill be replaced by March 1999, we will complete the testing activities and implement ourmission-critical applications in production by year-end 1998.On June 29, 1998, we made our future-dated test environment available tocustomers for Year 2000 testing; the crucial testing period will extend through 1999. Depositoryinstitutions which are Federal Reserve customers, and thus rely on our payment applications suchas Fedwire, Fed ACH, and check processing systems, can test century rollover and leap yeartransactions six days a week. On six weekends this fall, depository institutions will be able to testYear 2000 test dates with several applications simultaneously. We are providing assistance to ourcustomers who test with us, and have provided them, through a series of Century Date Changebulletins, with technical information and guidelines concerning the testing activity.By the end of August, almost 400 customers, including the US Treasury, hadconducted CDC testing with the Federal Reserve, and the number scheduling tests is increasingrapidly. These tests encompass ten of our mission-critical applications. To ensure that thenation’s larger banks are taking advantage of this testing opportunity, we intend to contact anythat have not availed themselves of this service. Several foreign banking organizations havebegun to test large dollar payment systems with the Federal Reserve and CHIPS. Most largeforeign banks will participate in the September 26, 1998, coordinated test in which Fedwire,CHIPS, and SWIFT are participating.Like most information technology environments, ours are composed primarily ofvendor hardware and software products. To assess the Year 2000 readiness of theseenvironments, as well as our building systems such as vault and climate control systems, we havecreated an automated inventory of the vendor products that we use and are tracking the Year2000 compliance status of those products. Although the Federal Reserve has made progress inindependently testing vendor products, we will continue these efforts.In prior testimony, I have noted the critical dependence of banks ontelecommunication services and the need to ensure the readiness of telecommunication serviceproviders. To foster a better understanding of the importance of information sharing by thetelecommunications industry, I wrote to Federal Communications Commissioner Powell aboutthis issue. Commissioner Powell has been responsive and has provided us and others withinformation regarding the FCC’s oversight and plans. The Federal Reserve is also participating inthe Telecommunications Sector Group of the President’s Council on Year 2000 Conversion. Inaddition, the Federal Reserve is monitoring telecommunication carriers to assess whether thoseused by the Federal Reserve will be Year 2000 compliant. We are pleased with the
- 3 -BIS Review   74/1998responsiveness of the telecommunications industry: plans for industry testing are well under way,with participation from the major service providers, as well as their suppliers.Contingency PlanningAs the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve is actively engaged incontingency planning for both operational disruptions and systemic risks. An internal CDCCouncil consisting of senior managers is coordinating contingency planning across the FederalReserve’s various functions and is fostering a cohesive approach to internal readiness andinteraction with the financial community. In general, the banking industry’s focus has alsoprogressed from the renovation of systems to business continuity and contingency planning.Contingency planning for the Federal Reserve includes payments systems, currency availabilityand distribution, information processing, the discount window, and the supervision function. Wewill also play an important role in coordinating with the financial community concerning issuessuch as systemic risk and cross-border payments.Operational ContingencyThe Federal Reserve’s plans for operational continuity build on existingcontingency plans. As you know, we have long maintained comprehensive contingency plansthat are routinely tested and have been implemented during natural disasters and otherdisruptions. These plans cover our internal systems, as well as the services we provide todepository institutions. In June 1998, each of the Federal Reserve’s business offices completedassessments of the adequacy of existing contingency scenarios to address CDC risks.Federal Reserve CDC contingency workgroups are identifying problems externalto the Federal Reserve that may arise when the date changes to 2000, such as those affectingtelecommunications providers, large financial institutions, utility companies, other key financialmarket participants, and difficulties abroad that affect US markets or institutions. Theworkgroups are developing corresponding recommendations to mitigate those problems. TheFederal Reserve plans to finalize contingency plans reflecting these recommendations byNovember 30, 1998. We will continue to refine our CDC contingency plans as necessarythroughout 1999. In fourth quarter 1998, we will focus our efforts on how to test our contingencyplans to ensure their operational effectiveness at the century rollover.Change ManagementAs a part of our operational readiness planning, the Federal Reserve is developingprocedures to manage the risks posed by changes to information systems in 1999 and the firstquarter of 2000. After the scheduled completion of testing and implementation of our criticalapplications, changes to Federal Reserve policies, rules, regulations, and services that generatechanges to critical information systems create the risk that those systems may no longer be CDCcompliant. Consequently, we have established guidelines to significantly limit policy andoperational changes, as well as internal hardware and software changes, during late 1999 andearly 2000 in order to minimize the risks and complexities of problem resolution associated withthe introduction of new processing components.By limiting changes to our systems, we will not only provide a stable internalprocessing environment entering the Year 2000, but we will also minimize changes that ourcustomers could be required to make to their applications that interface with our software. In
- 4 -BIS Review   74/1998addition, we intend to aggressively coordinate with other institutions that typically generatepolicy and operational changes in the financial industry. We intend to publish our guidelines toassist other organizations facing similar issues and I would urge that Congress, as well as otherfederal agencies, consider adoption of such change management policies as we move into 1999.CurrencyAs I noted earlier, cash availability and processing is an issue we have consideredin the contingency planning process. We have regularly met the public’s heightened demand forUS currency in peak seasons or in extraordinary situations, such as natural disasters. We recentlysubmitted our fiscal year 1999 currency printing order to the Department of the Treasury’sBureau of Engraving and Printing and we increased the size of next year’s print order due toYear 2000 considerations. With this order, we will substantially increase the amount of currencyeither in circulation or in Federal Reserve vaults over current levels by late 1999. We believe thisincrease in the level of currency should be ample to meet the public’s demand for extra cashduring the period surrounding the century rollover. This is a precautionary step on our part -- webelieve it is prudent to print more currency than we think will be required than to risk notprinting enough. While we do not anticipate any extraordinary demand for cash, we believe it isimportant that the public have complete confidence that sufficient supplies of currency will beavailable. In effect, the Federal Reserve is accelerating the timing of currency printing; we areplanning for a possible short-lived increased demand for cash and will be able to reduce futureprint orders to lower-than-normal levels.As we monitor the public’s demand for currency, we can introduce other measuresto further increase cash levels. First, the recent currency order with the Bureau of Printing andEngraving is for the federal fiscal year 1999, so that there will be time to print additional notes inthe last three months of 1999. Second, we can change the print order to increase production ofhigher denomination notes. Third, we can increase staff in Reserve Bank cash operationfunctions to improve the turnaround time required to process cash deposits and move currencyback into circulation. Finally, as a last resort, we can hold off the destruction of old or worncurrency.LiquidityAnother contingency planning issue for the Federal Reserve is liquidity. Despitetheir best efforts, some depository institutions could encounter problems in the rollover inmaintaining reliable computer systems, and these problems may or may not affect their fundingpositions. To the extent necessary, the Federal Reserve is prepared to lend, in appropriatecircumstances and with adequate collateral, to depository institutions when market sources offunding are not reasonably available. The terms and conditions of such lending may depend uponthe circumstances causing the liquidity shortfall.Financial Sector InitiativesThe Federal Reserve and private industry have intensified cooperative efforts toaddress contingency planning. The Year 2000 Contingency Planning Working Group of the NewYork Clearing House (NYCH), the Securities Industry Association (SIA), and the FederalReserve are developing coordinated contingency plans for the Year 2000 and will act as liaisonwith other industry groups addressing contingency planning on behalf of banks, securities firms,exchanges, clearance and settlement organizations, regulators, and international markets. Among
- 5 -BIS Review   74/1998other things, the Working Group is considering plans for the establishment of Year 2000communications centers throughout the country, and perhaps internationally. Primarily, suchcenters would facilitate the exchange of up-to-date information on developing problems andissues among participants and enhance the development of consensus, when necessary, tocoordinate timely responses to problems.The Federal Reserve is assisting in the government’s coordination of the Year2000 effort within the financial industry by participating in the Financial Institutions SectorGroup of the President’s Council on Year 2000 Conversion. A senior Board official who chairsthis Sector Group has been working with representatives of government financial organizations,including the federal banking agencies, the Department of the Treasury, the Securities andExchange Commission, and other agencies responsible for various financial intermediaries, toassess the Year 2000 readiness of the financial industry and formulate strategies for addressinginteragency Year 2000 issues.Bank SupervisionI would now like to turn to our industry oversight activities. The Federal Reservemet its goal, set in May 1997, of conducting a Year 2000 supervisory review of all banks subjectto our supervisory authority by June 1998. This public commitment and visible effort did muchto stimulate industry action on the Year 2000 issue. We have also established ties and areproviding significant support to numerous public and private groups, both domestic andinternational, that are addressing the Year 2000 readiness of their respective constituencies.As part of our outreach program, we continually emphasize the criticalsignificance of ensuring that computer systems and applications are Year 2000 compliant and thecomplexity of the managerial and technological challenges that the required effort presents for allenterprises. For entities such as financial institutions that rely heavily on computers to providefinancial services to customers, achieving Year 2000 compliance in mission-critical systems isessential for maintaining the quality and continuity of customer services.While bank supervisors can provide guidance, encouragement, and strong formaland informal supervisory incentives to the banking industry to address this challenge, it isimportant to recognize that we cannot be ultimately responsible for ensuring or guaranteeing theYear 2000 readiness and viability of the banking organizations we supervise. Rather, the boardsof directors and senior management of banks and other financial institutions must be responsiblefor ensuring that the institutions they manage are able to provide high quality and continuousservices from the first day in January of the Year 2000. As we have emphasized continuallyduring the past sixteen months, this critical obligation must be among the very highest ofpriorities for bank management and boards of directors.Policy Guidance and Supervisory ReviewsThe Federal Reserve continues to work closely with the other banking agenciesthat comprise the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) to address thebanking industry’s Year 2000 readiness. A series of seven advisory statements has been issuedsince I was last here in November 1997, including statements on the nature of Year 2000business risk, the importance of service provider readiness, the means to address customer risk,the need to respond to customer inquiries, the critical importance of testing, the urgency ofeffective contingency planning, and the need to address the readiness of fiduciary activities. As a
- 6 -BIS Review   74/1998result of these advisory statements, the extent of the industry’s Year 2000 efforts hassignificantly intensified. These statements can be found in their entirety athttp://www.federalreserve.gov/Y2K.Compliance with these statements is assessed during the conduct of supervisoryreviews. Through June 30, the Federal Reserve had conducted reviews of approximately 1,600organizations. Information and data collected during these reviews has proven to be reliable,consistent with our overall supervisory experience which is heavily dependent on an extensiveon-site examination program. These reviews have resulted in a significant focus of attention onthe subject matter within the industry and identified several issues warranting additional attentionby the supervisors, particularly the need for the supplemental guidance on testing andcontingency planning. It is critical that banks avail themselves of every opportunity to testmission-critical systems internally and with their counterparties, and recurring testing may bewarranted as additional systems are renovated to assure that those systems already tested are notadversely affected.Based on the reviews completed by the Federal Reserve, the vast majority ofbanking organizations are making satisfactory progress in their Year 2000 planning and readinessefforts. About four percent are rated “needs improvement” and fewer than one percent are rated“unsatisfactory”. In these cases, the Federal Reserve has initiated intensive supervisory follow-up. Working closely with state banking departments, the Federal Reserve is making a concertedeffort to focus additional attention on those particular banking organizations that are deemeddeficient in their Year 2000 planning and progress.Deficient organizations have been informed of their status through supervisoryreview comments, meetings with senior management or the board of directors, and deficiencynotification letters calling for submission of detailed plans and formal responses to thedeficiencies noted. Such organizations are then subject to increased monitoring and supervisoryfollow-up including more frequent reviews. Restrictions on expansionary activities by Year 2000deficient organizations have also been put into place. As a result of these letters, organizationsonce deemed deficient have taken significant steps to enhance their Year 2000 programs andover half have been upgraded to satisfactory.The Federal Reserve has commenced Phase II of its supervision program whichcovers the nine months from July 1998 through March 1999. During this second phase, we willconduct another round of supervisory reviews focused on Year 2000 testing and contingencyplanning. In addition, we have committed to conducting another review of the informationsystems service providers and will distribute the results to the serviced banks.Assessment of Review ResultsBased on these reviews and other interactions with the industry, it appears thatfinancial institution progress in renovating mission-critical systems has advanced notably sincethe Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies escalated efforts to focus the industry’sattention on ensuring Year 2000 readiness. Banking organizations are making substantialheadway toward Year 2000 readiness and, with some exceptions, are on track to meet FFIECguidelines.Specifically, the FFIEC guidelines call for the completion of internal testing ofmission critical systems by year-end 1998. Most large organizations are nearing completion of
- 7 -BIS Review   74/1998the renovation of their mission-critical systems and are vigorously testing those that have beenrenovated. Smaller organizations are working closely with their service providers in an effort toconfirm that the efforts under way will assure the readiness and reliability of the services andproducts on which they depend.Information Systems Service ProvidersThe banking agencies are examining the Year 2000 readiness of certaininformation systems service providers and software vendors that provide services and products toa large number of banking organizations. These examinations are often conducted on aninteragency basis. The Federal Reserve has participated in reviews of sixteen national serviceproviders and twelve national software vendors. In addition, the banking agencies are examiningselected regional service providers and software vendors.These examinations assess the overall Year 2000 program management of thefirms and confirm their plans to support products for Year 2000 readiness. To help bankingorganizations assess the Year 2000 readiness and dependability of their service providers and toencourage examined service providers to cooperate fully with the industry’s efforts, the bankingagencies are distributing the results of Year 2000 reviews of service providers and softwarevendors to the serviced banks. The information in the reports is not a certification of thereadiness of the service provider, and it is still incumbent on each bank to work closely with itsservice providers to prepare for the century date change. Service providers and software vendorsserving the banking industry are keenly aware of the industry’s reliance on their products andservices, and most consider their Year 2000 readiness to be their highest priority in order forthem to remain competitive in an aggressive industry.Credit QualityFFIEC guidelines call for banks to have a plan to assess customer Year 2000readiness by June 30, 1998, and to complete an assessment of their customers’ Year 2000readiness by September 30, 1998, in order to better understand the risks faced by the bank ifcustomers are unable to meet their obligations on a timely basis. Even though our Phase I Year2000 examinations were conducted before the June 30, 1998, milestone, our examiners notedthat most organizations either had begun planning or had initiated their customer assessmentprograms.We have seen no signs that credit quality has deteriorated as a result of Year 2000readiness considerations, although it is still early. Results from a Federal Reserve Senior LoanOfficer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (May 1998) indicated that respondentsgenerally include Year 2000 preparedness in their underwriting and loan review standards.Another survey of Senior Loan Officers is to be conducted in November in order to obtain amore timely picture of any deterioration in credit quality related to the Year 2000.Efforts have also been made to prompt the nation’s largest banks that syndicatelarge loans to address the Year 2000 readiness of their borrowers. Through the Shared NationalCredit Program, banks that syndicate credits over $20 million are asked to provide the bankingagencies with information pertaining to the banks’ efforts to assess the readiness of theborrowers. This initiative has helped large lenders understand that they need to consider theircustomers’ readiness in their risk management programs.
- 8 -BIS Review   74/1998Additional Outreach InitiativesThe Federal Reserve is participating in numerous outreach initiatives with thebanking industry, trade associations, regulatory authorities, and other groups that are hostingconferences, seminars, and training opportunities focusing on the Year 2000 and helpingparticipants understand better the issues that need to be addressed. Partly in response to therequirements of the Examination Parity and Year 2000 Readiness for Financial Institutions Act,which calls for the banking agencies to conduct seminars for bankers on the Year 2000, thefederal banking agencies have been working with state banking departments as well as nationaland local bankers’ associations to develop coordinated and comprehensive efforts at improvingthe local and regional programs intended to focus attention on the Year 2000. In the first sixmonths of 1998, the Federal Reserve has participated in over 230 outreach initiatives reachingover 14,000 bankers. Another 100 outreach initiatives are scheduled for the third quarter of 1998.In addition, our public web site provides extensive information on our Year 2000 supervisionprogram and on other resources available to the industry to help prepare for the millennium.International CoordinationInternational cooperation on Year 2000 has intensified over the past severalmonths because of the efforts of the public sector Joint Year 2000 Council (Joint Council) andthe private sector Global 2000 Coordinating Group (G-2000). As you recall from your hearingson international issues in June, Mr. Ernest Patrikas, then Chairman of the Joint Council and asenior official of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, testified on the global efforts of theJoint Council to enhance international initiatives by financial regulators. His successor asChairman of the Joint Council, Federal Reserve Governor Roger Ferguson, is continuing thoseefforts and is working closely with an external consultative committee composed ofrepresentatives from international financial services providers, international financial marketassociations, financial rating agencies, and a number of other international industry associations.The Joint Council is working to foster better awareness and understanding of Year 2000 issueson the part of regulators around the world; for example, the Joint Council is sponsoring a seriesof regional seminars for banking, insurance, and securities supervisors.The G-2000 includes more than forty financial institutions from over twentycountries that are addressing country assessments, testing, and contingency planning, as well asother issues. The group has developed a standard framework for assessing individual countrypreparations for the century date change and also will address the Year 2000 readiness offinancial institutions, service providers, and the countries’ infrastructures. This framework isbeing used to collect information and assess the readiness of about twenty major countries by theend of this year, with others scheduled for in-depth reviews in 1999.The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision continues to be active on Year2000 issues, both within the Joint Council and separately, as part of its normal supervisoryactivities. Year 2000 will be a major issue to be discussed at the International Conference ofBank Supervisors in October. The Basle Committee is also planning a follow-up survey on Year2000 progress.Closing RemarksFinancial institutions have made significant progress in renovating their systemsto prepare for the Year 2000 and much has been accomplished to ensure the continuation of
- 9 -BIS Review   74/1998reliable services to the banking public at the century rollover. We are committed to a rigorousprogram of industry testing and contingency planning and, through our supervisory initiatives, toidentifying those organizations that most need to apply additional attention to Year 2000readiness. The Federal Reserve has renovated its mission-critical applications, and we arenearing the completion of our internal testing activities. To manage the risks posed bysubsequent changes to these systems, the Federal Reserve has instituted guidelines tosignificantly limit policy, operational, hardware, and software changes during late 1999 and early2000. Going forward, we will continue our industry and international coordination efforts,including participation in the President’s Council on Year 2000 Conversion, the Joint Year 2000Council, and trade associations, to assist the industry in preparing for the Year 2000.In closing, I would like to thank the Committee for its extensive efforts to focusthe industry’s attention on this significant matter. Awareness of the extent and importance of thischallenge is a critical first step in meeting it, and the Committee’s participation has been mosthelpful.
BIS Review   72/1998Mr. Greenspan’s testimony on the international economic and financialsystem   Testimony of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of theUS House of Representatives on 16/9/98.As I testified before this Committee in the midst of the Mexican financial crisis inearly 1995, major advances in technology have engendered a highly efficient and increasinglysophisticated international financial system. The system has fostered impressive growth in worldtrade and in standards of living for the vast majority of nations who have chosen to participate init.But that same efficient financial system, as I also pointed out in that earliertestimony, has the capability to rapidly transmit the consequences of errors of judgment inprivate investments and public policies to all corners of the world at historically unprecedentedspeed. Thus, problems that appeared first in Thailand more than a year ago quickly spread toother East Asian economies that are relatively new participants in the international financialsystem, and subsequently to Russia and to some degree to eastern Europe and Latin America.Even long-time participants in the international financial community, such as Australia, NewZealand, and Canada, have experienced the peripheral gusts of the financial turmoil.Japan, still trying to come to grips with the bursting of its equity and real estatebubbles of the late 1980s, has experienced further setbacks as its major Asian customers havebeen forced to retrench. Reciprocally, its banking system problems and weakened economy haveexacerbated the difficulties of its Asian neighbors.The relative stability of China and India, countries whose restrictions oninternational financial flows have insulated them to some extent from the current maelstrom, hasled some to conclude that the relatively free flow of capital is detrimental to economic growthand standards of living. Such conclusions, in my judgment, are decidedly mistaken.The most affected emerging East Asian economies, despite the sharp contractionin their economic output during the past year, have retraced, on average, only one-sixth of theirper capita growth over the past ten years. Even currently, their average per capita incomes aremore than 2½ times the levels of India and China despite the unquestioned gains both have madein recent years as they too have moved partially to join the international financial community.Moreover, outside of Asia, several East European countries have made significantprogress towards the adoption and implementation of market systems and have increasinglyintegrated their financial systems into the broader world context to the evident benefit of theirpopulations. Latin American nations, though currently under pressure, have largely succeeded inopening up their economies to international financial flows, and more rapidly rising livingstandards have been the result.It is clear, nonetheless, that participation in the international financial system withall its benefits carries with it an obligation to maintain a level of stability and a set of strong andtransparent institutions and rules if an economy is to participate safely and effectively in marketsthat have become highly sensitive to misallocation of capital and other policy errors.When domestic financial systems fail for lack of adequate institutionalinfrastructures, the solution is not to turn back to a less turbulent, but also less prosperous, past
- 2 -BIS Review   72/1998regime of capital controls, but to strengthen the domestic institutions that are the prerequisite forengaging in today’s international financial system.Blocking the exodus or repatriation of capital, as some of the newer participants inthe international financial system appear inclined to do after they get into trouble, is, of course,the equivalent of the economy receiving a subsidized injection of funds. If liquidity is tight, theimmediate effect of controls can be relief from the strain of meeting obligations and a temporarysense of well-being. This is an illusion however. The obvious consequence of confiscating part,or all, of foreign investors’ capital and/or income, is to ensure a sharp reduction in theavailability of new foreign investment in the future.The presumption that controls can be imposed temporarily, while an economystabilizes, and then removed, gives insufficient recognition to the imbalances in an economy thatemerge when controls are introduced. Removing controls subsequently creates its own set ofproblems, which most governments, inclined to impose controls in the first place, are thereforeloathe to do. Indeed, controls are often employed to avoid required -- but frequently politicallydifficult -- economic adjustments. There are many examples in history of controls imposed andremoved, but rarely without great difficulty and cost.To be sure, any economy can operate with its borders closed to foreigninvestment. But the evidence is persuasive that an economy deprived of the benefits of newtechnologies, and inhospitable to risk capital, will be mired at a suboptimal standard of livingand slow growth rate associated with out-of-date technologies.It is often stipulated that while controls on direct foreign investment and itsassociated technology transfer are growth inhibiting, controls on short-term inflows do notadversely affect economic welfare. Arguably, however, the free flow of short-term capitalfacilitates the servicing of direct investments as well as the financing of trade. Indeed, it is oftendifficult to determine whether certain capital flows are direct investments or short term in nature.Chile is often cited as an example of the successful use of controls on short-term capital inflows.But in response to the most recent international financial turmoil, Chile has chosen to lower itsbarriers in order to encourage more inflows.Those economies at the cutting edge of technology clearly do not need foreigndirect investment to sustain living standards and economic growth. The economy of the UnitedStates in the 1950s, for example, needed little foreign investment and yet was far more dominantin the world then, than it is today.That was a major change from our experiences of the latter half of the nineteenthcentury, when the vast amount of investment and technology from abroad played a significantrole in propelling the US economy to world-class status.Even today, though we lead the world in many of the critical technologies, we stillneed to borrow a substantial share of the mobile pool of world savings to finance our level ofdomestic investment. Were we unable to do so, our standard of living would surely suffer. Butthe inflow of foreign capital would be much reduced if there were uncertainties about whetherthe capital could be freely repatriated.While historically there could be considerable risk in American investments -- forexample, some nineteenth century investments in American railroads entailed large losses -- thefreedom of repatriation and the sanctity of private contracts were, with rare exceptions, secure.
- 3 -BIS Review   72/1998Our experiences, and those of others, raise the question of the sustainability offree international capital flows when the conditions fostering and protecting them are impaired orabsent.Specifically, an economy whose private and/or public sectors have become heavynet debtors in foreign currency is at risk of default, especially when its exchange rateunexpectedly moves adversely. Clearly, should default become widespread among a number ofeconomies, the flow of international capital to other economies perceived as potentially insimilar circumstances will slow and in certain instances reverse. The withdrawal of the ongoingbenefits of free flowing capital, as recent history has so amply demonstrated, often can be abruptand disruptive.The key question is obviously how do private sector entities and governments and,by extension, economies as a whole allow themselves through currency mismatches to reach theedge of insolvency? Indeed, where was the appropriate due diligence on the part of foreigninvestors?Investors will, on occasion, make misjudgments, and borrowers will, at times,misread their capabilities to service debt. When market prices and interest rates adjust promptlyto evidence of such mistakes, the consequences of the mistakes are generally contained and, thus,rarely cumulate to pose significant systemic risk.There was some evidence of that process working in the latter part of thenineteenth century and early twentieth century when international capital flows were largelyuninhibited. Losses, however, in an environment where gold standard rules were tight andliquidity constrained, were quickly reflected in rapid increases in interest rates and the cost ofcapital generally. This tended to delimit the misuse of capital and its consequences. Imbalanceswere generally aborted before they got out of hand. But following World War I such tightrestraints on economies were seen as too inflexible to meet the economic policy goals of thetwentieth century.From the 1930s through the 1960s and beyond, capital controls in many countries,including most industrial countries, inhibited international capital flows and to some extent theassociated financial instability -- presumably, however, at the cost of significant shortfalls ineconomic growth. There were innumerable episodes, of course, where individual economiesexperienced severe exchange rate crises. Contagion, however, was generally limited by theexistence of restrictions on capital movements that were at least marginally effective.In the 1970s and 1980s, recognition of the inefficiencies associated with controls,along with newer technologies and the deregulation they fostered, gradually restored the freeflow of international capital prevalent a century earlier. In the late twentieth century, however,fiat currency regimes have replaced the rigid automaticity of the gold standard in its heyday.More elastic currencies and markets, arguably, are now less sensitive to and, hence, slower tocontain the misallocation of capital. Market contagion across national borders has consequentlybeen more prevalent and faster in today’s international financial markets than appears to havebeen the case a century ago under comparable circumstances.As I pointed out before this Committee almost a year ago, a good part of thecapital that flowed into East Asia in recent years (largely in the 1990s) probably reflected the
- 4 -BIS Review   72/1998large surge in equity prices in most industrial economies, especially in the United States. Thesharp rise induced a major portfolio adjustment out of then perceived fully priced investments inwestern industry into the perceived bargain priced, but rapidly growing, enterprises andeconomies of Asia. The tendency to downplay the risks of lending in emerging markets,reinforced by the propensity of governments explicitly or implicitly to guarantee suchinvestments in a number of cases, doubtless led to an excess of lending that would not have beensupported in an earlier age.As I also pointed out in previous testimony, standards of due diligence on the partof both lenders and borrowers turned somewhat lax in the face of all the largess generated byabundant capital gains and all the optimism about the prospects for growth in the Asian region.The consequent emergence of heavy losses and near insolvency of a number of borrowing banksand nonfinancial businesses engendered a rush by foreign capital to the exits and induced severecontractions in economies with which borrowers and policymakers were unprepared and unableto cope.At that point the damage to confidence and the host economies had already beendone. Endeavors now to block repatriation of foreign funds, while offering temporary cash flowrelief, have significant long-term costs and clearly should be avoided, if at all possible. Irecognize that if problems are allowed to fester beyond the point of retrieval, no market-orientedsolution appears possible. Short-term patchwork solutions to achieve stability are presumed theonly feasible alternatives. When that point is reached, an economy is seen as no longer havingthe capability of interacting normally with the international financial system, and is inclined towithdraw behind a wall of insulation.It must be remembered, however, that the financial disequilibria that caused theinitial problems would not have been addressed. Unless they are, those problems will reemerge.As I implied earlier with respect to the nineteenth century American experience,there are certain conditions precedent to establishing a viable environment for internationalcapital investment, one not subject to periodic systemic crises.Some mechanism must be in place to enhance due diligence on the part of lenders,but especially of borrowers individually and collectively. Losses of lenders do on occasion evokesystemic risks, but it is the failure of borrowers to maintain viable balance sheets and an ability toservice their debts that creates the major risks to international stability. The banking systems inmany emerging East Asian economies effectively collapsed in the aftermath of inappropriateborrowing, and large unhedged exposures, in foreign currencies.Much will be required to bolster the fragile market mechanisms of many, butcertainly not all, economies that have recently begun to participate in the international financialsystem. Doubtless at the head of the list is reinforcing the capabilities of banking supervision inemerging market economies. Conditions that should be met before engaging in internationalborrowing need to be promulgated and better monitored by domestic regulatory authorities.Market pricing and counterparty surveillance can be expected to do most of thejob of sustaining safety and soundness. The experience of recent years in East Asia, however, hasclearly been less than reassuring. To be sure, lack of transparency and timely data inhibited themore sophisticated risk evaluation systems from signaling danger. But that lack itself ought tohave set off alarms. As one might readily expect, today’s risk evaluation systems are beingimproved as a consequence of recent failures.
- 5 -BIS Review   72/1998Just as importantly, if not more so, unless weak banking systems are deterred fromengaging in the type of near reckless major international borrowing that some systems in EastAsia engaged in during the first part of the 1990s, the overall system will continue at risk. Abetter regime of bank supervision among those economies with access to the internationalfinancial system needs to be fashioned.1 In addition, the resolution of defaults and workoutprocedures require significant improvements in the legal infrastructures in many nations seekingto participate in the international financial system.2None of these critical improvements can be implemented quickly. Transitionsupport by the international financial community to those in difficulty will, doubtless, berequired. Such assistance has become especially important since it is evident from the recentunprecedented swings in currency exchange rates for some of the emerging market economiesthat the international financial system has become increasingly more sensitive than in the past toshortcomings in domestic banks and other financial institutions. The major advances intechnologically sophisticated financial products in recent years have imparted a discipline onmarket participants not seen in nearly a century.Whatever international financial assistance is provided must be carefully shapednot to undermine that discipline. As a consequence, any temporary financial assistance must becarefully tailored to be conditional and not encourage undue moral hazard.It can be hoped that despite the severe trauma that most of the newer participantsin the international financial system are currently experiencing, or perhaps because of it,improvements will emerge to the benefit, not only of the emerging market economies but, of thelong-term participants of the system as well.1 Parenthetically, a century ago, banks were rarely subsidized and, hence, were required by the market to holdfar more capital than they do now. In today’s environment, bank supervision and deposit insurance havedisplaced the need for high capital-asset ratios in industrial countries. Many of the new participants in theinternational financial system have had neither elevated capital, nor adequate supervision. This shortfall isnow generally recognized and being addressed.2 There are, of course, other reforms that I believe need to be addressed. These were outlined in my earliertestimonies before this Committee.
BIS Review   71/1998Mr. George discusses monetary policy, unemployment and economic growth inthe United Kingdom   Speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at TheTUC Congress in Blackpool on 15/9/98.Thank you, Chairman. I’m actually very pleased to be here, and to have thisopportunity to respond directly to some of the serious concerns that have been expressed recently byTrade Union leaders - among others - about monetary policy.Let me start with what is perhaps your biggest concern. You think that the MonetaryPolicy Committee, which I chair and which sets interest rates, is only interested in controllinginflation and takes little or no account of the effects of its decisions on real economic activity andjobs. Some of you evidently think that’s because we’re a crowd of “pointy-heads” or “inflationnutters”, or even “manufacturing hooligans” - and I’m not sure these descriptions are intended asterms of endearment. More seriously some of you think that the problem lies with our remit from theGovernment which is first, to maintain price stability - defined as an underlying inflation rate of2½%, and, subject to that, to support the economic policy of the Government, including itsobjectives for growth and employment.Whatever the reason, your concern is that we place too much emphasis on holdingprices down and not enough on keeping growth and employment up. The implication is that you seea trade-off between inflation and the rate of economic growth, so that if only we’d let up a bit oncontrolling inflation then this country could enjoy higher activity and lower unemployment, whichare the really good things in life - or at least we could avoid some of the worst damage that iscurrently being inflicted upon the whole of the agriculture, large parts of manufacturing industry andeven some services sectors.And that might even be true for a time. The trouble is that, in anything other than theshort term, it would be likely to mean more rather than less economic damage, and lower rather thanhigher growth and employment.Often in the past in this country we behaved as if we thought that promoting highergrowth and employment - which of course is what we all want to see - was largely a matter ofpumping up demand. We paid too little attention to the structural, supply-side, constraints. All toooften we tried to buy faster growth and higher employment even at the expense of a bit moreinflation. In effect we tried to squeeze a quart out of a pint pot. And you all know the result - risinginflation and a worsening balance of payments, which eventually could only be brought back undercontrol by pushing up interest rates dramatically and forcing the economy into recession. I don’tneed to remind you of the really miserable social as well as economic consequences - as right acrossthe economy people lost their jobs, their businesses and their homes. More insidiously, repeatedexperience of boom and bust produced a pervasive short-termism in business behaviour whichinfected both industry and finance and - dare I say both employers and employees - however muchwe all like to blame everyone else. Everyone was tempted to grab what they could while the goingwas good.But we have learned from that experience. We’ve learned that in anything other thanthe short term there really is no trade-off between growth and inflation. What we are trying to donow through monetary policy is to keep overall demand in the economy growing continuouslybroadly in line with the capacity of the economy - as a whole - to meet that demand. Both theprevious Government and the present one set a low inflation target as the immediate objective ofmonetary policy, not as an end in itself, but in effect as a measure of our success in keeping demandin line with supply. So the real aim is to achieve stability across the economy as a whole in this muchwider sense.
- 2 -BIS Review   71/1998Now, there is not a lot, frankly, that we can do directly through monetary policy toaffect the supply side - the underlying rate of growth that can be sustained without causing inflationto rise. That can be influenced by the whole raft of Government policies, ranging from education andhealth to taxation and social security, and it depends ultimately on the ingenuity, the productivity,and the flexibility, of the economy. Employers and employees, working together, clearly have acrucial role to play in this context, and I recognise the constructive and forward-looking role thatmany of you are now playing to improve the supply-side capacity of the economy.Monetary policy operates on the demand side. And the best help that we can give isto keep overall demand consistently in line with that supply-side capacity - not letting it run abovecapacity but not letting it fall below capacity either - as reflected in consistently low inflation. Thatway we can moderate rather than aggravate the unavoidable ups and downs of the business cycle,enabling steadier growth, high levels of employment and rising living standards to be sustained intothe medium and longer-term. And if we can do that, then we will contribute indirectly to the supplyside by creating an environment which encourages more rational, longer-term, decision-makingthroughout the economy.I would hope, Chairman, that on this basis we could all agree at least on what it is weare trying to do. The debate is not about the ends it is about the means. We are every bit asconcerned with growth and employment as you are - as anyone in their right mind must be. But weare interested in growth and employment that is sustained into the medium and long term. Andpermanently low inflation is a necessary condition for achieving that.But, even if we agree on the objective, that still of course, leaves plenty of room forus to disagree about what that means for the actual policy stance - the level of interest rates - at anyparticular time. In fact, as you may have noticed, because we are wholly open about it, even theindividual members of the MPC have been known to disagree about that - at the margin. Outside theMPC, a lot of people say to me - “OK I agree we don’t want to return to boom and bust, but you arestill overdoing it. From where I sit, or from what I’m told,” they say, “we’re headed for recession -just hours away”. Sometimes they imply by that that we are also going to undershoot the inflationtarget - sometimes they don’t much seem to care about inflation.Now there are always plenty of people who claim to know what’s going to happen tothe economy, to know that interest rates are “clearly far too high” or “clearly far too low”, and thepresent time is no exception. It’s been difficult recently to hear yourself think above the deafeningnoise of opinions on the state of the economy, which, understandably, often reflect the situation intheir particular neck of the whole economy wood.The truth is that neither we, nor they, nor anyone else, can know with any greatcertainty precisely where demand is in relation to capacity in the economy as a whole. Still less dowe know where it is likely to be over the next couple of years - and that is the more relevantconsideration, given the time it takes before changes in interest rates have their full effects. Monetarypolicy is not a precise science - we’ve never pretended that it is. But it can’t be just a matter ofsweeping, broad brush, impressions based upon partial information either. What we have to do is tomake the best professionally-informed analysis we can, of all the sources of information available tous, relating to every sector of the economy and every part of the country, and then constantly reviewand as necessary modify our judgements, month by month and quarter by quarter, in the light of theflood of new information as it becomes available.And that, of course, is exactly what we do in fact do - using the vast array of officialeconomic statistics and financial market data, all the publicly available and some private surveys andcommentaries, as well as a wealth of anecdotal and structured survey evidence that we collect
- 3 -BIS Review   71/1998ourselves, through our 16 non-executive directors, through the frequent visits which MPC membersmake around the country, and through meetings in London, and through our network of 12 regional,information-gathering and disseminating, agencies with their 7000 industrial contacts throughout theUnited Kingdom. And we openly display the facts as they are available to us, as well as our analysisand our conclusions, regularly through the publication of the minutes of our monthly meeting and inthe quarterly Inflation Report.So when people say to me that the economy is headed for recession, I’m interested incomparing the evidence on which they base their views with our own evidence, and I want to knowwhether or not they are also saying that they expect us to undershoot the Government’s inflationtarget.Let’s just for a moment turn down the noise and look at some of the relevant facts asthey relate to the economy as a whole.Since the economy started to recover from recession in the spring of 1992 - some 6½years ago - overall output has grown at an average rate of about 3%. That is well above the trend ratefor the past 20 years, of just over 2%. Employment has increased by 1.2 million over this period,while unemployment has fallen almost month by month, on the familiar claimant count measure,from a peak of over 10% in 1993, to some 4.7% now. That is the lowest rate for 18 years. Meanwhileretail price inflation (on the Government’s target measure) has averaged around 2¾% - that’s thelowest for a generation. There’s not much evidence here that low inflation inevitably means lowgrowth and employment.But, of course, we started this period with demand below capacity - with a fairamount of slack in the economy which we were gradually taking up. By last year it had becomeclear, in the evidence of rising capacity utilisation and of growing tightness in the labour market, thatunless we acted to moderate the growth of demand we were at risk of overheating. That’s why wetightened policy over last summer - to slow things down before inflation took off - and to head off asubsequent recession. And although, as I say, you can never be sure - economic forecasting is a veryuncertain business - a necessary slowdown rather than a more serious recession is what we thinkwe’re seeing, and, as I understand it, that is what your own General Council thinks too.Our problem in slowing the economy down has been enormously complicated by theincreasing imbalance between the domestic and the internationally-exposed sectors of the economy.Domestic demand for goods and particularly for services has been unsustainably strong and largeparts of the economy have been doing very well on the back of that. But the sectors which are mostexposed to international competition have been suffering enormous pressure as a result, initially, ofthe exaggerated strength of sterling - especially against the major European currencies in the run upto decisions on the euro; and as a result subsequently of the successive waves of turmoil spreadingthrough large parts of the global economy. Overall demand growth - at least until fairly recently -remained excessive and the labour market has continued to tighten.The question was what should we do? It was not that we didn’t know that large partsof the economy were under the hammer - we have been as conscious of that as anyone. Still less wasit that we didn’t care - we care, just as you must, about activity and jobs in all sectors of theeconomy. But the stark choice confronting us was either to tighten policy, knowing that that wouldinevitably increase the pain which the internationally exposed sectors were already suffering, or todisregard the developing excess overall demand in order to protect the internationally-exposedsectors from further damage.
- 4 -BIS Review   71/1998This second course might have meant less pain for the internationally-exposedsectors in the short run. But it would have meant putting the whole of the economy, including theexposed sectors, at risk of accelerating inflation, and it would in all probability have meant a muchsharper downturn in the economy as a whole a little further ahead. We’ve been round that buoy alltoo often before. And so we tightened policy, trying as best as we could through our tactics tominimise the unwanted upward pressure on the exchange rate.I know, Chairman, only too well that this will be cold comfort to many of you in theexposed sectors - but there’s no point in pretending things are other than they are. The presentimbalance means that we are trying to maintain stability in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.But I will make one final point. The inflation target we have been set is symmetrical.A significant, sustained, fall below 2½% is to be regarded just as seriously as a significant, sustained,rise above it. And I give you my assurance that we will be just as rigorous in cutting interest rates ifthe overall evidence begins to point to our undershooting the target as we have been in raising themwhen the balance of risks was on the upside. There is now evidence that domestic demand growth ismoderating, as it must do, and that the labour market is tightening more slowly than before. On topof that, as we said in our press notice last Thursday - announcing that we had not changed interestrates - we recognise “that deterioration in the international economy could increase the risks ofinflation falling below the target”. That is still not the most likely outcome in the eyes of most of us -and given the real world uncertainties we can anyway never sensibly tie our hands. But there is nodoubt in my mind that recent international developments have at least reduced the likelihood that wewill need to tighten policy further.
BIS Review   70/1998Mr. Meister discusses the future of money and financial services   Statements byMr. Edgar Meister, a member of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank, to be put forward atthe Generation Bridge Symposium “Money tomorrow” in Eltville on 11/9/98.First statement:Supervisors are open to innovations in banking business — but banks andfinancial intermediaries in general must be able to manage the risks arising from newtechniques.Supervisors have never stood in the way of innovations in banking, but instead havealways worked hard to give entrepreneurs in this field a reliable legal basis for product development.For example, the legal definition of banking operations in Germany was extended to include prepaidcard business and network money business by amending the Banking Act.Yet attention must always be paid to sensitivity in confidence and to possible dangersfor the functioning of the financial system. Disruptions in payment transactions — even thedefaulting of a financial market participant — can rapidly affect financial markets adversely andeven hamper the development of the real economy.Things are only in their infancy. The issuance of electronic money should generallybe restricted to banks. That is primarily for reasons of safety; banks as issuers of electronic moneyare regulated and monitored according to prudential guidelines. To keep monetary policy efficientthe option to introduce minimum reserves on electronic money makes sense.Second statement:Recent financial crises have proven again: progress in information technologyand new risk management techniques cannot replace solid capital requirements for banks.Internal risk models for the calculation of capital requirements for market risks areimportant innovations in the field of risk management - supervisors respect such developments. Butrisk models are not infallible. Against the background of recentfinancial crises there are some doubts whether short-term high market volatility hasalways been covered adequately by the assumptions of the models (which use 250 days averages forvolatility).Credit risk models which are developed now can help to measure credit risks moreexactly. Capital requirements however must cover all risks of a bank, i.e. operational and legal risks,too. Consequently a licence to use credit risk models or generally new risk management techniquesmust not result in weaker capital requirements for banks considering generally rising risks in thefinancial world.Precisely the recent financial crises demonstrate how difficult it is to determine bank-specific risks with sufficient accuracy. Own capital as a cushion for losses is therefore a modernprudential requirement.Third statement:
- 2 -BIS Review   70/1998The banking world will be changing even faster - but neither the size of afinancial institution by itself nor applying modern strategies are guarantees of quality.The process of concentration in the banking industry will continue and probablyresult in fewer banks as well as a general increase in the size of units.Mergers in Germany are in many cases welcome, as they improve the viability ofinstitutions. The idea here is to safeguard the diversified nature of business inherent in the universalbanking concept through suitably sized banks. The situation is different in the United States, wheremergers sometimes take place in order to surmount the restrictions on business imposed by thespecialised banking system and to achieve a higher level of diversification.Mega-mergers have the disadvantage of making structures less transparent andgroups more difficult for management to control. On the whole, the number of institutions which, interms of systemic risks, are “too big to fail”, will rise.Alternatively or complementary to the massive growth we are seeing in many placesat present, specialisation, the return to core business or measures denoted by the term „leanbanking“, i.e. the attempt to reduce costs by outsourcing activities, shrinking the range of in-housebanking services or purchasing outside services. From an economic point of view these may beimportant strategies for the banks in the future, but outsourcing must never affect regularity ofbusiness or the possibility to control business for the management as well as for the supervisoryauthorities.Fourth statement:Changes in the banking scenery also affect supervisors - supervision must bekept efficient, time has not come for an „outsourcing“ of core functions of supervision.Supervisors must also react on global integration. One proposal to reform supervisionis to leave supervision and development of supervisory concepts to a large extent to the market,respectively to a small group of global players. Supervisors are open to new approaches. There are,however, some fundamental reservations against this proposal.The current proposals of self regulation do not respect the context betweenstipulating risk control norms and the responsibility for preventing systemic risks. More selfregulation would simultaneously require that market participants take over major responsibility forpreventing systemic risks and therefore setting up private agencies to intervene during liquiditycrises. But as long as private institutions are not prepared to install such agencies and to take overresponsibility for systemic risks, time for outsourcing of essential elements of supervision has notcome.Fifth statement:In the information age, central banks can operate as an anchor of prudentialsupervision owing to their “natural” presence in the market.The central bank establishes contacts with market participants and receives valuableinformation almost automatically by virtue of its market presence; similar to a seismograph, it mayrecord tremors in the financial system at an early stage and react accordingly. Moreover, in many
- 3 -BIS Review   70/1998cases the central bank is in a good position to strive for market-enhancing and prudentiallyjustifiable deregulation and technical innovations.However, during liquidity crises, central banks should not assume an official,predetermined function of “lender of last resort” because of the associated problem of moral hazard.Instead, liquidity crises should be solved by private or semi-private agencies before they reach thecentral bank. In Germany the Liquidity Consortium Bank serves as an example for such strategy incase of liquidity problems.
BIS Review   70/1998Bank of Japan’s annual review of monetary and economic developments   BANKOF JAPAN COMMUNICATION, the Bank of Japan Annual Review 1998.Annual Review of Monetary and Economic Developments in Fiscal 1997SummaryJapan’s economic growth slowed during fiscal 1997.1 The economy, which had beenon a recovery path, began to decelerate with the turn of the new fiscal year in April 1997, andbecame increasingly sluggish toward the end of the fiscal year.Final demand deteriorated toward the end of fiscal 1997. Until recently, net exportsgenerally followed an upward trend and underpinned Japanese economic activities. In detail, realexports expanded, reflecting firm business conditions overseas - particularly in Europe and theUnited States - and also by the depreciation of the yen, while real imports remained virtuallyunchanged. However, net exports peaked out toward the end of fiscal 1997, owing to a decrease inexports to other Asian countries against the background of the ongoing economic adjustments in theregion. Meanwhile, public-sector investment basically trended downward because of tight budgets atboth the central and the local government levels. Business fixed investment maintained a gradualincrease during the first half of fiscal 1997, particularly in the manufacturing industry. However, inthe second half of the fiscal year, it seemed to have peaked out reflecting factors such asdeterioration in corporate profits. Private consumption and housing investment were depressed fromApril 1997 mainly in reaction to the surge in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax ratefrom 3 to 5 percent.2The stagnation became evident from autumn 1997 partly against the background ofthe deterioration in household confidence despite a moderate recovery temporarily observed aroundsummer 1997. The stagnation in final demand adversely affected production, corporate profits, andemployment condition. Accumulation of inventories was followed by an adjustment in production,resulting in a decrease in output in the last two quarters of fiscal 1997. Inventories in final-demandgoods, including construction goods and consumer durables, began to accumulate in spring 1997,and this development expanded to producer goods in autumn 1997. Corporate profits plunged in thesecond half of fiscal 1997 resulting in a turn to decline for the fiscal year as a whole. Profits declinedeven at large manufacturing firms that had maintained steady growth up until that time. Under thesecircumstances, corporate sentiment worsened rapidly across a wide range of firms especially duringthe second half of the fiscal year, as indicated by the Bank’s Tankan - Short-Term Economic Surveyof Enterprises in Japan and other statistics. Labor market conditions deteriorated in fiscal 1997. Thenumber of new job offers turned to a decline particularly in the manufacturing and constructionindustries. The unemployment rate reached and remained around a historically high level in line withthe increase in involuntary unemployment. In the meantime, the growth in wages and salaries,particularly overtime compensation and bonuses, decelerated, reflecting reduced production andworsening corporate profits.Consequently, the positive cycle of production, income, and expenditures that hadsupported the economic recovery during fiscal 1996 weakened from the beginning of fiscal 1997,exerting downward pressure on the overall Japanese economy. With respect to final demandcomponents, the primary factor that weakened this positive cycle was the sluggishness of householdexpenditures.                                                     1 Fiscal year starting in April and ending in March.2 The consumption tax rate was raised on April 1, 1997.
- 2 -BIS Review   70/1998Household expenditures began to show a clear downward trend in early autumn 1997despite a slight rebound in summer 1997 after fluctuations resulted from the rise in the consumptiontax rate in April 1997. The decline in real disposable income due to the rise in the consumption taxrate and the discontinuation of the special income tax reduction can be cited as a factor behind thesluggish household expenditures. In the past, when constraints on household income intensified, amechanism often functioned whereby growth in expenditures was maintained by the increase in thehouseholds’ propensity to consume (the ratio of expenditures to household income). This time,however, household expenditures were restrained reflecting cautious household sentiment, and thisadded to the sluggishness in final demand, leading to excessive inventory and its adjustment in thecorporate sector. This development worsened labor market and income conditions in the householdsector. It is difficult to quantify and verify the factors that have weakened household confidence.However, it is likely that the following factors contributed: (1) mounting anxiety regarding the futureemployment and income conditions as a result of a series of large financial institution failures; and(2) growing uncertainty regarding the future burden on households amid the recent active debate onthe budget deficit and the reform of national pension systems.The stagnation of household expenditures also affected corporate sentiment andbusiness fixed investment through the sluggish domestic final demand and deteriorating corporateprofits due to inventory adjustment. Prior to the collapse of the “bubble” economy, brief periods ofstagnant domestic demand were overcome through (1) active export drives by firms especially inmanufacturing industry, which compensated for the weak domestic demand; and (2) an improvementin cash flow as a result of monetary easing and the positive lending attitude of financial institutions,which facilitated corporate financing and business fixed investment especially in nonmanufacturingindustry. However, after autumn 1997, business conditions became severe due to the economicturmoil in other Asian economies, especially in Korea and the ASEAN nations, and the cautiouslending attitude of financial institutions, due in part to weak stock prices and market concernsregarding credit risk.3In addition to the weak household expenditures, various strong and persistentstructural adjustment pressures on the economy can be cited as another fundamental factor in theeconomic stagnation. With such pressures, the economy, unable to resume a self-sustained recoverywhich started in fiscal 1996, stagnated, a result that was triggered directly by factors such as fiscalrestraint and cautious household sentiment. The attitude toward expenditure and investment at largemanufacturing firms facing so-called “mega-competition” remained selective. Nonmanufacturingfirms were pressed to boost their productivity - which was said to be behind that of themanufacturing sector - amid the ongoing deregulation in addition to the balance-sheet adjustmentfollowing the collapse of the “bubble” economy. Turning to the industrial structure, the Japaneseeconomy seemed to be still in the process of transition. There appeared to be no leading industryraising productivity and thereby creating additional employment, while in some industriesemployment adjustment pressure was intensifying.Prices (excluding the effects from the rise in the consumption tax rate) remainedstable on the whole during fiscal 1997, although they softened slightly during the second half.4Import prices rose sharply in 1996 but turned to a decline in the first half of 1997 reflecting thefluctuations in crude oil prices and the exchange rate of the yen. The prices remained relativelystable until the end of 1997, but began to trend downward once again reflecting the weakening ofinternational commodity prices due to the economic crisis in Asian economies. Domestic wholesaleprices seemed to be bottoming out during the second half of 1996 and the first half of 1997. Pricesthen softened from summer 1997, reflecting the weakening market conditions in materials-related                                                     3 ASEAN comprises Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.4 Price data presented in this report exclude the effects of the rise of the consumption tax rate from 3 to 5 percent effective fromApril 1, 1997.
- 3 -BIS Review   70/1998goods due to stagnant domestic final demand and the accumulation of inventories, in addition to thefall in import prices. Corporate service prices in fiscal 1997 narrowed their rate of decline followingthe ongoing downward trend and have recently moved around zero compared to the level of a yearearlier. Consumer prices (nationwide, excluding perishables) increased at a slightly higher rateduring the first half of fiscal 1997. This is because commodity prices declined more slowly as aresult of a decelerated influx of low-priced foreign goods. In the second half of fiscal 1997, however,the softening of commodity prices reflecting the decline in domestic wholesale prices dampened theincrease. Furthermore, the 12-month increase in consumer prices has recently fallen almost to zero,excluding the effects of the rise in medical service charges caused by the medical insurance systemreform of September 1997.With respect to factors affecting prices, the price decline phase of the second half offiscal 1997 differed from that of around 1994-1995. During the 1994-1995 period, downwardpressure on the overall prices of import-competing domestic goods intensified owing to the rapidincrease in the penetration ratio of imports, particularly in manufactured goods. This occurredagainst the background of the industrialization of Asian countries other than Japan and the continuedappreciation of the yen. On the other hand, in the second half of fiscal 1997, downward pressure onoverall prices resulted mainly from the stagnant domestic final demand. There did exist downwardpressure on domestic wholesale prices caused by the drop in import prices, owing to the pricedeclines in international commodity markets triggered by the crisis in Asian economies. However,the penetration ratio of imports did not increase since the value of the yen was significantly lower onthe whole than it was in 1994-1995. As for the effects of price declines on corporate activities, thedecline in the prices of crude oil and other raw materials in international commodity markets in thesecond half of 1997 worked rather favorably for Japanese firms by improving their terms of trade,unlike the first period during which the import penetration ratio of final goods increased. It should benoted, however, that there were signs of a squeeze on corporate profits as unit labor costs and labor’srelative share in income distribution increased against the background of the exceptionally lownominal GDP growth rate, and the expansion of the domestic output gap accelerated due to thestagnation of final demand. It therefore became important to carefully monitor the effects of thesluggish domestic demand on corporate activities and employment conditions.As for land prices, commercial land prices generally showed a smaller decline as aclear distinction in profitability existed between land whose price had stopped falling and landwhose value continued to fall from fiscal 1996 through the first half of fiscal 1997. Meanwhile,residential land prices virtually stopped declining. In the second half of fiscal 1997, however,commercial and residential land prices both began to weaken slightly once again, reflecting thestagnant economy.As for financial developments, while the Bank maintained its easy stance in monetarypolicy, some disturbances occurred in the financial system. Causes of the disturbances included thefurther drop in stock prices affected by a number of failures of banks and securities companies inNovember against the background of the prolongation of the efforts to dispose of nonperformingloans. As a result, there were some unstable developments in the market such as the rise in someinterest rates reflecting pressure coming from intensified market concerns over credit and liquidityrisks. Around the fiscal year-end, however, the market gradually regained stability as a result of anample supply of funds injected by the Bank and implementation of financial system stabilizationmeasures involving the use of public funds worth ¥30 trillion.Developments in market interest rates showed that both short and long-term interestrates increased slightly for a while after the beginning of the fiscal year and then turned to a declinethrough the summer, as the outlook for the economy became increasingly unclear. Then, inNovember 1997, market awareness of credit risk heightened sharply with a number of failures of
- 4 -BIS Review   70/1998banks and securities companies. Fund-raising costs of private-sector institutions - namely, interestrates on CDs and CP in the markets, and corporate bond yields in the capital markets - increasedreflecting the expansion of the risk premium. On the other hand, yields on safer assets such asgovernment bonds declined. The difference between rates offered in the interbank market alsoexpanded according to banks’ creditworthiness, and the so-called “Japan premium” was imposed onJapanese banks in overseas markets. In response to such a rapid rise in interest rates, the Bankprovided ample funds to the market in an effort to stabilize interest rates through various operationsincluding the new bond-borrowing (“repo”) operations introduced in late November. As a result, theovernight call rate (uncollateralized, weighted average) regained stability at the end of Novemberand interest rates on term instruments began to decline from late February. Yields on long-termgovernment bonds, on the other hand, declined to a historical low of 1.49 percent in late Marchreflecting releases of weak economic indicators. During the same period, stock prices (Nikkei 225Stock Average) fell around early January once marking ¥14,664, reflecting the cautious economicoutlook and mounting uncertainty about the future. Stock prices later rebounded with fluctuationsand recovered to ¥16,527 at the end of March 1998, reflecting implementation of the government’sstimulus measures including the use of public funds.Financial indicators such as monetary aggregates and lending also showed erraticmovements after November 1997 reflecting intensified awareness of credit and liquidity risks amongfirms and households. The growth of M2+CDs, a representative indicator of monetary aggregates inJapan, remained stable at around the annual growth rate of 3 percent until early autumn, but rosesharply after November, marking an annual increase of 5 percent in February 1998, the first time inthe approximately seven years.5 This reflected the shift of funds into M2+CDs from financial assetsoutside M2+CDs such as investment trusts, and also the buildup of corporate deposits as firmsdeposited the funds raised in advance by bonds and CP to secure liquid funds. From early March,however, the annual growth in M2+CDs fell slightly. Meanwhile, private-sector financial institutionsshowed stronger movement to reduce risk assets including lending in the second half of fiscal 1997,as capital constraints were intensified by the fall in stock prices just when risk management wasbeing strengthened prior to the introduction of the Prompt Corrective Action. Nevertheless, amassive reduction in lending did not occur with a slight pickup in stock prices and the decisions onthe injection of public funds toward the end of the fiscal year. The amount outstanding of privatebank lending, however, decreased substantially after March, partly due to loan write-offs andliquidation.With respect to corporate financing, a rapid contraction in overall fund-raising byfirms did not occur owing partly to the increase in fund-raising in the capital markets by firms withgood business performances. However, from a microeconomic perspective, the unbalancedallocation of funds among firms intensified. In particular, firms with low ratings and small firms thatare usually unable to access the capital market were considered to have experienced tighter financialconditions partly due to deteriorating business performances reflecting the staggering economy. Asfor lending by private-sector financial institutions, the lending attitude became increasinglyrestrictive due partly to intensified constraints on capital in view of capital adequacy requirements,and as a result exerted downward pressures on the economy through its effects on corporatesentiment and firms’ investment and spending activities. The significant influence of financialfactors on the economy was one of the characteristics of the economic developments in fiscal 1997.                                                     5 M2+CDs = cash currency in circulation + deposit money + quasi-money + certificates of deposit.(Cash currency in circulation = the amount of bank notes issued and coins in circulation - the amount of cash currency held byfinancial institutions surveyed.Deposit money = the total of demand deposits among private and public deposits with financial institutions surveyed - the checksand bills held by these institutions.Quasi-money = the total of private deposits, public deposits less demand deposits with financial institutions surveyed.Certificates of deposit = those of private corporations, individuals and the public with financial institutions surveyed.)
- 5 -BIS Review   70/1998In the “Annual Review of Monetary and Economic Developments in Fiscal 1996,”the Bank pointed out that the momentum of the economic recovery firmed gradually during fiscal1996, but this was not necessarily accompanied by an improvement in private-sector confidence.6 Infiscal 1997, in addition to the fiscal drag, the Japanese economy experienced diverse negativeimpacts such as failures in the financial system and the financial and economic crises in Asianeconomies. Thus, the recovery which had been proceeding since the end of 1993 was interrupted. Itcannot be denied that economic entities’ confidence was damaged further. Results of variousbusiness surveys indicated that the recovery of economic entities’ confidence was further delayed.Factors behind the weak recovery in the private sector’s confidence were anxiety and uncertaintyregarding the economic and social systems of the country, in addition to factors related to persistentaftereffects of the collapse of the “bubble” economy such as the financial institutions’nonperforming-loan problem. The anxiety related to whether the current systems can adapt to themajor structural changes facing the Japanese economy - such as intensified global competition anddemographic changes in Japan toward fewer children and an increasing aged population - and thegrowing uncertainty caused by the unclear direction of future economic developments.In light of the above, there are several issues which must be dealt with for theJapanese economy to regain a self-sustaining growth. First, the critical task for the Japaneseeconomy to be dealt with without delay is to avoid falling into a deflationary spiral induced bydecrease in demand. In view of this aim, the government set out a comprehensive economic packageon April 24, 1998 including special income tax reductions. Expeditious implementation of thesemeasures and significant results are expected.The second task is to solve various problems that surfaced after the bursting of theeconomic “bubble” as quickly as possible and to restructure and enhance the mechanism of Japan’sfinancial system. During fiscal 1997, the government implemented measures to stabilize theJapanese financial system, which included the use of public funds. In addition, the recentlyannounced comprehensive economic stimulus package incorporated measures to enhance assetsecuritization and real estate liquidation, and a systematic framework for the disposal ofnonperforming loans was consolidated. Also, the Japanese “Big Bang” financial deregulation isbeing implemented beginning with the amendment of the law on foreign exchange and foreign trade,which came into effect on April 1, 1998. Under these circumstances, it is imperative for financialinstitutions to dispose expeditiously of their nonperforming loans as well as to reallocate theirresources, in order to efficiently provide financial services that meet the needs of firms andhouseholds. Along with the efforts to review and to improve the indirect financing system, it isnecessary to reinforce direct financing through the expansion of risk capital offered in the capitalmarkets, thereby encouraging the optimal allocation of funds in the economy. Thus, theinfrastructure for corporate accounting, disclosure of information, the system of taxation for financialservices, and payment and settlement systems must be reviewed and improved expeditiously.The third task is to make steady progress in the reform of Japan’s economic structurethrough measures such as deregulation and revision of the taxation system. The relaxation andabolition of various economic regulations would bring about higher productivity and economicgrowth rates in the long run by creating demand and promoting effective resource allocation amongindustries and firms. Also, a revision of the taxation system aimed at improving the return oninvestment and supporting the optimal allocation of capital should have positive effects on theoverall economy. Restructuring of other economic systems is also required in order to smoothly shiftresources. For example, the current employment system should be reviewed to promote mobility inthe labor market. In addition, while efforts should be made to achieve greater efficiency in the public                                                     6 For details, see “Annual Review of Monetary and Economic Developments in Fiscal 1996” in the Bank of Japan’s AnnualReview 1997.
- 6 -BIS Review   70/1998sector, a nationwide consensus regarding the direction of the social security system reform should bereached as quickly as possible to ease the deep-rooted concerns in the household sector over thefuture burden of social security costs.The diverse events that the Japanese economy experienced in fiscal 1997demonstrated the importance of influencing expectations of various economic entities and to gainconfidence among market participants in managing economic policy. In this regard, policy makersshould strive to reduce the uncertainty concerning the outlook for the economy through improvedtransparency and consistency in their policy, while initiating effective measures in order to supporteconomic activities of private-sector entities.
BIS Review   68/1998Mr. Heikenstein discusses the advent of the euro and EMU in relation toSweden   Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikenstein, atWorld Trade Day ’98 held at the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce on 25/8/98.I should like to begin by thanking our hosts for the invitation to World TradeDay ’98. The introduction of a new currency is due in our vicinity in little more than fourmonths’ time. This is the first instance in modern times of a large group of sovereign statesestablishing a monetary union with a single currency. Along with the collapse of the IronCurtain, the creation of the European Monetary Union is probably the most significant Europeanevent since World War Two.Today I shall be focusing on what the birth of the euro may mean fordevelopments in the currency market. I shall not, however, be attempting to predict the euro’sfuture strength or weakness. Instead, I shall begin by discussing factors that could affect thesingle currency in the course of the changeover and the somewhat longer term. Then I shallconsider how the euro is likely to affect the position of Sweden’s currency, the krona. I can sayright now that, basically, I do not believe that the euro will fundamentally alter either the role ofthe krona in Sweden’s economy or, for that matter, the value of the krona in the long run. In viewof the discussion that this matter occasions from time to time, there may be reason to saysomething about the view of the Riksbank.1. A new currency is createdA new currency will see the light of day in January 1999. Eleven countries inEurope are forming a monetary union and will accordingly be having a currency, a monetary andexchange rate policy, and a central bank in common. The euro will be the domestic currency of amajor economic area. Today, the euro area’s share of world output is around 30 per cent, asagainst around 35 per cent for the United States. As regards world trade, the share for EMU’sexternal trade amounts to around 17 per cent and the United States around 15 per cent.EMU is a central component in the process of European integration. This processwas initiated in the 1950s with agreements on the joint control of certain means of production,the European Coal and Steel Community. The idea was to forge economic bonds betweennations as a way of promoting peace in Europe. The establishment of the Common Market in the1980s was a further step, aiming at freedom of movement within the Community for goods,services, capital and individuals. With the introduction of a single currency, the countries ofEurope will come still closer to each other in economic and political terms. At the same time, yetanother obstacle to the creation of a large internal market in Europe will be removed.Thus, EMU is to be seen primarily as one aspect of a larger, political project. Mostanalyses, however, have tended to concentrate on the union’s pros and cons in an economiccontext. The advantages that have been cited for the participating countries include lowertransaction costs for trading in a common currency, increased transparency and competition inthe single market, and low, stable inflation. The lack of an exchange rate as an instrument forstabilisation policy is mentioned as one of the drawbacks.Sweden’s Parliament decided in December 1997 that Sweden would not bejoining the monetary union from the start, mainly on account of the lack of public support. The
- 2 -BIS Review   68/1998decision was made after a committee of experts had reported on participation’s advantages anddrawbacks for Sweden. The commission was basically in favour of Sweden being a member ofEMU but was of the opinion that, given the disadvantages considered, Sweden should notparticipate from the start. The costs in terms of stabilisation policy were assumed to exceed thebenefits from economic efficiency. The report’s assessment of political aspects favoured Swedishmembership of EMU.The report gave the Riksbank an occasion to present its appraisal of the monetaryunion. This differed and amounted to a recommendation that Sweden should participate from thestart. We considered that the commission had overestimated the costs for stabilisation policy,while the economic and political benefits were likely to be even greater than envisaged in thereport. Since the compilation of report, moreover, the political reasons for participating from thestart have grown in that more countries than expected will now be members from the beginning.2. The euro’s stabilityThe euro will exist as an account-based currency as of next January. Whilebanknotes and coins denominated in euro will not yet be in circulation, it will be possible tomake transactions in euro. So what will be the euro’s role in currency markets? Will it be stable?And will it compete with the dollar as an international reserve currency? As we all know,predicting exchange rate movements is difficult. In general, one can say that a currency’snominal exchange rate is determined by the real exchange rate together with differences ininflation with the rest of the world. A currency’s real exchange rate can be described as the priceof goods and services in that country relative to the rest of the world. If a difference in inflationgrows, a corresponding depreciation of the currency is needed to keep the real exchange ratestable. The current exchange rate is also influenced by expectations of future rates. Thecredibility of economic policy’s commitment to long-term price stability is thus important forexchange rate tendencies. The value of a currency is also susceptible to influences of a moretemporary nature. Cyclical factors may play a part. When the economy is in an upward phase, acountry may need a tighter monetary policy, which normally leads to an appreciation of itscurrency. Deviations from the exchange rate’s more fundamental level may also be occasionedby matters to do with credibility. In addition, the exchange rate may be affected by transitoryshifts in the currency market’s demand and supply. Such shifts may arise from portfolioadjustments. In certain periods these mechanisms may tend to accentuate exchange ratemovements even though economic fundamentals point in a different direction. One example ofthis is the large movements in the US dollar.Against this background I shall now look at some factors that will probably beimportant for the development of the euro. I shall take the fundamentals first and then point outsome factors that could be of transitory significance for the euro.Fundamental factorsProvided economic policies in the euro area focus credibly on price stability -accompanied by a corresponding low-inflation policy in the rest of the world - it is probable thatthe euro’s nominal exchange rates with other countries will display a high degree of stability.However, cyclical disparities between currency blocs and some uncertainty about monetarypolicy signalling are factors that could generate certain fluctuations.
- 3 -BIS Review   68/1998EMU is constructed so that monetary policy will be formulated collectively by theECB’s Executive Council and the national central banks in the light of the overall picture ofinflation in the euro area, while fiscal policies are formulated at the national level.Monetary policyThe European Central Bank (ECB), which will be accountable for EMU’s singlemonetary policy as of next January, was established on July 1st. The monetary policy objective isprice stability. The objective has not yet been defined more specifically but statements suggestthat there will probably be an intermediate money supply target and that price stability will berepresented by an inflation rate of 2 per cent or less. The latter has raised the question of whetherSweden ought to revise its inflation target. The question is somewhat premature in that theECB’s target formulation has still to be finalised. Moreover, the suggested formulation is in linewith what has applied in Germany, where on average in recent decades monetary policy has notresulted in a rate of inflation below 2 per cent. In view of this, together with the advantages of aninflation target that is symmetrical, there are no grounds at present for considering any change inSweden’s inflation target.The ECB has been given a high degree of independence in fulfilling the pricestability target without any short-run political considerations. The institutional conditions formonetary policy credibility are accordingly good. By itself, however, this is not enough.Credibility must also be achieved continuously, through a responsible monetary policy that isproperly understood and supported by society in general. At first there may be considerableuncertainty about how the single monetary policy functions and how signals from the ECBshould be interpreted. Much will therefore be required initially of the ECB in explaining itspolicy, presenting the analyses behind its decisions in an understandable way and creating abroad understanding of the monetary policy in every part of the union. This understanding maybe tested particularly severely if price pressure in a particular country deviates from the averageso that the repo rate is not perceived as appropriate to the national situation. The national centralbanks in the euro area should be able to lend a hand here, both in communications with thepublic and by providing sound analyses of tendencies in their home country.This brings me to the discussion about the ECB Governing Council. Concern hasbeen voiced in the debate because the composition of the Council, the ECB’s supremedecision-making body, might lead to policy being influenced by strong national interests at theexpense of the total picture. One source of this concern is that so many of the Council’s decisionmakers are national central bank governors, who might allow for national interests. Comparisonsare made with the US Federal Reserve, whose decision-making body has a smaller proportion ofregional governors. Another cause of this concern is that political accountability in the EuropeanCommunity is essentially exacted at the national level; it is largely in the national arena thateconomic policy is discussed. While these problems cannot be dismissed out of hand, I believethey have been exaggerated. The members of the Council are jointly responsible for making theECB a success and establishing price stability in the euro area. In this sense they are all in thesame boat and nothing is more likely to capsize the boat that a national preference. That, Ibelieve, will characterise what happens in practice. In any event, a distinct, transparent policyright from the start is vital in order to avoid unnecessary uncertainty that could result inexaggerated movements in exchange rates and interest rates.Other components of economic policy
- 4 -BIS Review   68/1998In the long term it is the construction of monetary policy that determines the rateof inflation. In the shorter run, however, price movements are also influenced by other economicfactors. Other components of economic policy - that is, fiscal, labour-market and structuralpolicies - therefore have to be constructed so that they support the policy drive for sustainableprice stability. If these components do not work, the burden on monetary policy becomesadditionally heavy.Economic policy apart from monetary policy will continue to be a national matterin the euro area, even though it is the subject of agreements at Community level.Fiscal policy will still be constructed by the national governments, though to someextent its scope is restricted by the Stability and Growth Pact, to which all the EU countriessubscribe. This Pact requires each country to conduct a responsible fiscal policy, defined asachieving a general government budgetary balance or surplus over the medium term. Eachcountry is also to allow continuous monitoring of its government finances by the other EUcountries. A government budget deficit is normally not to exceed 3 per cent of GDP, thoughthere is room for certain exemptions. If a country in the euro area does have a budget deficitabove 3 per cent and this cannot be explained by factors that are exceptional and temporary,sanctions are to be imposed. EU countries outside the euro area are not liable to sanctions,however; they are only included in the monitoring provisions of the Pact.The task of establishing price stability in the euro area will be facilitated if lowinflation in the area is also promoted by fiscal policies. The importance of fiscal policy lies bothin creating sustainable government finances, which contribute to the general credibility ofeconomic policy, and in countering tendencies to excessive price pressure in the economy. In thatthe single monetary policy is to be constructed in relation to the overall situation in the euro area,more will be required of fiscal policy in the context of national stabilisation policy - fiscalinstruments will still be available for stabilising national economic trends. But this in turn doespresuppose that there is room for manoeuvre in the national budgets. Partly on this account, theStability and Growth Pact’s medium-term objective of a government budget balance or surplus isreasonable and it is highly important that the countries meet this undertaking. Today this is thecase in just a few countries, of which Sweden is one.Monetary policy’s interaction with fiscal policy will be important, at both nationaland EMU level, for the perceived credibility and consistency of economic policy in general. Aconstructive dialogue is therefore needed between the ECB and the governments of the eurocountries. The arrangements are not yet clear but an intense discussion of this and other mattersis now under way in Europe. The Treaty provides a number of opportunities for contacts betweenthe two spheres.Functional economic structures must also be in place so that the single monetarypolicy can establish low inflation without eliciting unnecessary economic tensions. A matter ofparticular importance in this context is the workings of the labour market. A labour market thatfunctions properly reduces the risk of regional unemployment and thereby of political problemsthat could ultimately pose a threat to the monetary union.Temporary factors
- 5 -BIS Review   68/1998The discussion of the euro’s development has included the point that theintroduction of the single currency will trigger widespread portfolio rearrangements, mainly byprivate investors but also in public reserves.The euro will alter the composition of exchange risks in investors’ portfolios andthis could result in flows to restore the degree of diversification. Investors who achieveddiversification previously with holdings in German marks and Italian lire, for example, will haveto adjust their portfolios when both these currencies are replaced by euro. Demand for euro mayalso be affected by the single currency’s conceivable international importance, so that the use ofeuro exceeds what one would expect from the area’s economic weight. To achieve internationalstatus, a currency needs to be stable, liquid and large. It should be born in mind that the Germanmark is currently an international currency. So perhaps the changeover to the euro will not makesuch a notable difference even if a potential exists for the position of the euro becoming evenstronger.It is generally assumed that exchange rates will not be permanently affected byportfolio rearrangements which do not stem from more fundamental considerations. But as theeuro’s entry into currency markets is something entirely new, it is hard to tell whether the scaleof portfolio changes will be such that euro exchange rates are influenced at least for a time. Andas the rearrangements will probably include both investment and borrowing in euro, neither is itclear what their net effect might be. As I mentioned earlier, the development of the euro willultimately depend on expectations of inflation in the euro area relative to the rest of the world.3. Role of the euro in SwedenHow will the euro affect Sweden’s currency, the krona? On the basis of theoreticalanalyses of what ought to determine a country’s use of a currency, together with information theRiksbank has obtained from interviews and surveys of Swedish firms and households, we haveconcluded that the introduction of the euro will not appreciably alter the role of the krona in theSwedish economy.The krona has important functions in Sweden’s economy, both as a means ofpayment and as a unit of account and a repository of value.The krona is already exposed to competition from other currencies. EMU can beseen as a continuation of this process. One indication of the competition is the very sharpincrease in exchange market turnover. Since 1986 this turnover has grown by a factor of eight,whereas foreign trade and GDP have no more than doubled. Only 5 per cent of the exchangemarket turnover stems from transactions directly connected with foreign trade.In what respects, then, might the advent of the euro alter the position of the krona?What is the line of reasoning behind such a scenario?The discussion about a marginalisation of the krona has started from the view thatSwedish export companies will choose to switch to euro in order to reduce the competitivedisadvantage of being outside the euro area. With this area as an important field for trade,Swedish firms have to meet the increased price competition which the monetary union entailswithout reaping the benefits which their euro area competitors reap from decreased exchangecosts and access to a large, liquid market for capital. In order to reduce these disadvantages, firmscan try to match their euro income with their expenditures in Sweden, for example for wages
- 6 -BIS Review   68/1998costs and payments to suppliers. The exchange risk would then be passed on to domestic players- households and firms - and these in turn would want to pay their bills in euro.How probable is such a scenario? One question is how serious the competitivedisadvantages will actually be for export companies. Another aspect that can be discussed is theextent to which households and Swedish-owned companies are prepared to accept an exchangerisk. They will want to receive income in the same currency as their expenditures. Otherwise theytake an exchange risk that makes the real income uncertain.Even when the monetary union has started, most of the expenditures ofhouseholds and Swedish-owned companies will presumably be expressed in the nationalcurrency. Retailers set prices and accept payments in Swedish kronor. The status of the krona aslegal tender means that they are under no obligation to accept payments in other currencies.Moreover, Swedish taxes and households’ fixed long-term loans are paid in kronor.Besides the question of why export companies would want to switch to euro on alarge scale, it is thus not clear that they would be able to pass the exchange risks on tohouseholds and suppliers.Large Swedish companies might be interested, on the other hand, in changing overto the euro as their unit of account, including the denomination of equity capital. Some businessrepresentatives have made statements to this effect. By reporting equity, deciding dividends andhaving their shares quoted in euro, companies with transactions in euro might possibly improvetheir access to the euro capital market and reduce their costs for handling currencies in themanagement of liquidity. Swedish law does not currently permit the use of currencies other thanthe krona but the possibility of having other currencies as the unit of account is beinginvestigated.Today, many companies invest their surplus liquidity in Swedish kronor, partlybecause their dividends are paid out in kronor. If companies choose the euro as the unit ofaccount, this could have consequences for their asset management. One such consequence mightbe a preference for investing surplus liquidity in euro. This alters their investment portfolio,which brings us back to what I said earlier about short-run exchange rate movements.Presumably, however, the portfolio adjustments would be gradual, leaving the krona’s exchangerate more or less unaffected by the flows. And even if the flows were to be so large as toinfluence the krona’s rate, there is no reason to suppose that they would have a permanent effecton the krona’s exchange rate against the euro. These flows would be accompanied by many othertypes of currency transaction.The krona’s long-term level will depend instead on Sweden’s economic policy.When economic policy is credible and focused on low inflation, there are no grounds forbelieving that the krona would go on weakening continuously or that it would relinquish itsposition in Sweden’s economy.4. Concluding remarksTo round off what I have been saying, the development of a currency - be it theeuro relative to the US dollar or the Swedish krona relative to the euro, for example - isdependent on the direction and results of economic policy. If the policies in the countries and
- 7 -BIS Review   68/1998regions we have been discussing are credible, focused on low inflation and successful, in thelonger run the exchange rates ought not to diverge.The legal framework for economic policy in EMU provides a good foundation fora credible low-inflation policy. But it is still important that all the components of economicpolicy back up the objective of price stability right from the introduction of the single currency.The ECB can do this by conducting a credible monetary policy and explaining it clearly. Thenational governments can contribute by ensuring that combined fiscal policies in the euro areacomfortably comply with the Stability and Growth Pact; this is not yet the case. Measures thatimprove labour markets can also help to enhance conditions for the success of the monetaryunion.In the same way, the institutional changes and economic developments in Swedenin recent years herald good conditions for a stable krona. The framework for both monetary andexchange rate policy has been strengthened. The status of the Riksbank is being made moreindependent and the budget process is now considerably more disciplined. Certain flows in thecurrency market may be generated simply as a consequence of the new currency’s introductionbut what ultimately matters is the economic fundamentals. This suggests that the advent of thesingle currency - the euro - will not lead to any marked changes either in the krona’s role in theSwedish community or in its value.
BIS Review   67/1998Mr. Greenspan remarks on income inequality   Remarks by Chairman of the Board ofGovernors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at a symposium sponsored by theFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in Jackson Hole, Wyoming on 28/8/98.Income Inequality: Issues and Policy Options I am pleased once again to open this annual symposium. At the outset, I wish to thankTom Hoenig and his staff for assembling a highly capable group of experts to inform us and to stimulatediscussion on an important issue in the world economy. The study of income inequality - its causes, itsconsequences, and its potential policy implications - has a long history in economics, although it has notalways had a high profile among researchers and policymakers. To borrow a phrase from ProfessorAtkinson, income distribution in recent years has been “brought in from the cold.” In part, that awarenesshas resulted from the experience of many industrialized economies with widening earnings inequality inthe 1980s and 1990s. It has been heightened by interest in the consequences of economic change indeveloping, newly industrialized, and transition economies. The experience of industrialized countries, including the United States, with growingincome inequality has spawned a great deal of research on the functioning of labor markets, on thesources of shifts in the demand for various types of skills, on the supply responses of workers, and on theefficacy of government efforts to intervene in the operation of labor markets. A number of those whohave contributed importantly to this work will be participating in this conference. One story that hasemerged from that body of research is now familiar: Rising demand for those workers who have theskills to effectively harness new technologies has been outpacing supply, and, thus, the compensation ofthose workers has been increasing more rapidly than for the lesser skilled segment of the workforce. Thatthis supply-demand gap has been an important source of widening earnings inequality is now widelyaccepted within the economics profession. However, the considerable diversity of experiences acrosscountries as well as the finding that earnings inequality has also increased within groups of workers withsimilar measured skills and experience suggest that we may need to look deeper than skill-biasedtechnological change if we are to fully understand widening wage dispersion. In particular, how haveprivate and public institutions influenced inequality over the past two decades? What roles have beenplayed by growing international trade and the evolving ways in which production is organized? Again,the participants in this symposium are well-equipped to speak to these issues, and we should learn muchmore about the causes of widening inequality during the next two days. In discussing the extent to which large portions of the population are not reaping thebenefits of economic growth, I hope that the participants at this conference will not stop with an analysisof trends in earnings - or, for that matter, even trends in income more broadly defined. Ultimately, we areinterested in the question of relative standards of living and economic well-being. Thus, we need also toexamine trends in the distribution of wealth, which, more fundamentally than earnings or income,represents a measure of the ability of households to consume. And we will even want to consider thedistribution of consumption, which likely has the advantage of smoothing through transitory shocksaffecting particular individuals or households for just a year or two. Among these more comprehensive measures, data for the United States from the FederalReserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances suggest that inequality in household wealth - that is, in networth - was somewhat higher in 1989 than at the time of our earlier survey in 1963. Subsequently, the1992 and 1995 surveys - and here our data are statistically more comparable from survey to survey thanthey were earlier - showed that wealth inequality remained little changed in terms of the broad measures.1Nonetheless, that stability masks considerable churning among the subgroups. One particularly notablechange was an apparent rise in the share of wealth held by the wealthiest families at the expense of otherwealthy families; most of the change occurred within the top 10 percent of the distribution.Moreover, our research using the survey suggests that conclusions about the distributionof wealth are sensitive - although to a lesser degree than income - to the state of the economy and to
- 2 -BIS Review  67/1998institutional arrangements for saving. For instance, among the wealthiest ½ percent of households,business assets, which tend to be quite cyclical, are particularly important. At the other end of thedistribution, owned principal residences, the values of which are not as sensitive to business cycleconditions, are a typical household’s most important asset. Another interesting finding is that if weexpand the definition of wealth to include estimates of Social Security and pension wealth, thedistribution among U.S. households becomes much more even.2 This finding suggests that, in addition tofactors influencing private wealth accumulation, the evolution of institutional arrangements for savingthat has taken place over the last two decades may have played an important role in affecting changes inthe distribution of wealth over time. What about the effect of the recent rise in stock and bond market values? The typicalview is that the growth in mutual funds and other financial investment avenues has allowed individualsfurther down in the wealth distribution to take advantage of the strength in equity markets. Certainly, ourfigures show that households lower in the income distribution are now more likely to own stocks than adecade ago.3 However, between the 1992 and 1995 surveys, the spread of stock ownership and the rise inprices did not lead to a rise in the share of stock and mutual fund assets owned by the bottom 90 percentof the wealth distribution. Although their dollar holdings rose rapidly, the increases were not as large asthose for households at the top of the wealth distribution. If patterns of equity ownership have notchanged much since 1995, the steep rise in stock prices over the past several years would suggest afurther increase in the concentration of net worth. This influence could be offset, to some extent, by acontinued broadening in the ownership of equities, particularly through tax-deferred savings accounts.Moreover, some additional offset may have occurred through rising house prices, an important asset ofmiddle class families. Our 1998 survey, which is now in the field, will yield a clearer reading both onhow wealth concentration has changed and on the relative importance of different assets in that change. Despite our best efforts to measure trends in income and wealth, I believe that eventhose measures - by themselves - cannot yield a complete answer to the question of trends in material oreconomic well-being. In the United States, we observe a noticeable difference between trends in thedispersion of holdings of claims to goods and services - that is, income and wealth - and trends in thedispersion of actual consumption, the bottom-line determinant of material well-being. Ultimately, we areinterested in whether households have the means to meet their needs for goods and for services,including those such as education and medical care, that build and maintain human capital. Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey that the U.S. Bureau of LaborStatistics conducts, researchers have found that inequality in consumption, when measured by currentoutlays, is less than inequality in income.4 These findings are not surprising. As is well known,consumers tend to maintain their levels of consumption in the face of temporary fluctuations in income.Variations in asset holdings and debt typically act as buffers to changes in income. Thus, consumptionpatterns tend to look more like patterns in income that have been averaged over several years - a findingthat should remind us of the pitfalls of reading too much into any year-to-year change in our measures ofeconomic well-being. The BLS’s consumer expenditure data suggest a rise in inequality over the 1980scomparable to that shown by the Census family income figures. However, during the first half of the1990s, inequality partially receded for consumer expenditures while for income it continued to rise (table1). The consumption data used in these calculations include only what individuals purchase directly outof their incomes and accumulated savings. Recently, researchers have extended the analysis using a morecomplete and more theoretically appealing measure of consumption that includes the indirect flow ofservices from the stock of durable goods that they already own - houses, vehicles, and major appliances.5As one might expect, although this measure of consumption has a profile somewhat similar to that seenin the current expenditure data over the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, it shows still lower levels ofinequality overall and a clearer pattern of consumption smoothing during the 1981-83 recession.The information available from the Consumer Expenditure Survey can be used tocalculate another interesting measure of the well-being of households: changes in inequality in theownership of consumer durables. The BLS staff has updated tabulations of these data that they prepared
- 3 -BIS Review   67/1998for me several years ago (table 2). Of course, ownership rates for household durables clearly rise withincome. But for a number of goods - for example, dishwashers, clothes dryers, microwaves, and motorvehicles - the distribution of ownership rates by income decile has become more equal over time. Even though we may be able to develop an array of measures of current and past trendsin inequality - such as those that I have described and potentially others that may be presented at thissymposium - we will likely still face considerable uncertainty about how to interpret those measures andabout what the future may hold for the trend and the distribution of economic well-being. Wealth has always been created, virtually by definition, when individuals use theirgrowing knowledge, in conjunction with an expanding capital stock, to produce goods and services ofvalue. The process of wealth creation in the United States has evolved in a number of important ways.Over the last century, we have learned how to be more efficient in meeting the needs of consumers, andthus we have moved from producing essentials to the production of more discretionary goods andservices. Moreover, these goods and services have been, over time, increasingly less constrained by thelimits of physical bulk. More recently, we have found ways to unbundle the particular characteristics ofeach good and service to maximize its value to each individual. That striving to expand the options forsatisfying the particular needs of individuals has resulted in a shift toward value created through theexploitation of ideas and concepts and away from the more straightforward utilization of physicalresources and manual labor. The new thrust has led to structural changes in the way that we organize theproduction and the distribution of goods and services. It has increased the demand for, and thecompensation of, workers who have the ability to create, analyze, and transform information and tointeract effectively with others. Most important, it has accorded particularly high value to the applicationof advanced computer and telecommunications technologies to the generation of economic wealth. At the same time, however, the consequences of technological advances and theirimplications for the creation of wealth have become increasingly unpredictable. We have found that wecannot forecast with any precision which particular technology or synergies of technologies will addsignificantly to our knowledge and to our ability to gain from that knowledge. Even if futuretechnological change were to occur at a steady rate, variations in our capacity to absorb and applyadvances would likely lead to an uneven rate of increase - over time and across individuals - in returns toexpanded investment in knowledge: Supplies of appropriately skilled workers can vary. In some cases,the initial choices in the exploitation of advances may turn out to be sub-optimal. In other cases, the fullpotential of advances may be realized only after extensive improvements or after complementaryinnovations in other fields of science. As we consider the causes and consequences of inequality, we should also be mindfulthat, over time, the relationship of economic growth, increases in standards of living, and the distributionof wealth has evolved differently in various political and institutional settings. Thus, generalizationsabout the past and the future may be hard to make, particularly in the current dynamic and uncertainenvironment of economic change. We need to ask, for example, whether we should be concerned withthe degree of income inequality if all groups are experiencing relatively rapid gains in their real incomes,though those rates of gain may differ. And, we cannot ignore what is happening to the level of averageincome while looking at trends in the distribution. In this regard, our goal as central bankers should beclear: We must pursue monetary conditions in which stable prices contribute to maximizing sustainablelong-run growth. Such disciplined policies will offer the best underpinnings for identifying opportunitiesto channel growing knowledge, innovation, and capital investment into the creation of wealth that, inturn, will lift living standards as broadly as possible. Moreover, as evidenced by this symposium,sustaining a healthy economy and a stable financial system naturally permits us to take the time to focusefforts on addressing the distributional issues facing our society and on other challenging issues that mayremain out in the cold.Table 1“GINI COEFFICIENTS” FORU.S. CONSUMER EXPENDITURES AND INCOME

BIS Review   67/1998Bank of Japan presents the summary of an article published in the August editionof its Quarterly Bulletin   Bank of Japan communication, 31/8/98.Release of a Reference Wholesale Price Index Using a Geometric Mean FormulaIntroductionIn recent years, concern about the accuracy of price statistics has risen in industrializedcountries where the statistical bias in price indexes seems to have grown significantly while actual priceshave generally been stable.1 The Bank of Japan has worked to improve the accuracy of its WholesalePrice Index (WPI) over the years, but many problems remain to be solved.2One such issue is the formula used for calculating the index. Recently, the Bank decidedto publish a reference WPI using a geometric mean formula (WPI-UGM) in addition to the conventionalindex using arithmetic mean method (Laspeyres index). Although the new formula may not succeed inremoving the bias in the current index, the Bank considers that by publishing more data, it can provideusers with more information about the possible measurement bias in the present WPI.                                                     1 In the United States, a report titled “Toward a More Accurate Measure of the Cost of Living” was submitted to aSenate Committee in December 1996 by the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index (BoskinCommission). This report triggered a series of controversies over the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board has frequently made references to this issue. In Germany,the Bundesbank published a discussion paper in March 1998 titled “Problems of Inflation Measurement in Germany:Non-Technical Summary” (Hoffmann [1998]). In Japan, too, a paper was published concerning the problem of CPImeasurement errors (in Japanese, Shiratsuka [1995]).2 In general, problems with the accuracy of price indexes can result from (1) factors relating to the formulae used tocalculate indexes, as discussed in this paper; (2) failure to adapt statistical samples properly to reflect changes inconsumer preferences and distribution channels; and (3) failure to make appropriate adjustments for changes inquality of goods and services. In order to deal with (2) and (3), the Bank revises the weights of goods based onexpenditure on individual items (expenditure shares) every five years, reviews and replaces individual items in thebasket when necessary, and makes an adjustment for quality changes between old and new items at the same time.Quality adjustment for such goods as personal computers is made by applying an econometric method known as the“hedonic regression method.”
BIS Review  66/1998Mr. Heikensten discusses recent economic and monetary policy developments inSweden   Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at the LocalAuthorities Economics Seminar in Malmö on 19/8/98.Thank you for the invitation to attend this Seminar and talk about the Swedish economyand monetary policy. I shall begin with a brief account of how the Riksbank operates with its inflationtarget. In that context I shall also be saying something about economic policy’s results in recent years.Then I shall consider the Riksbank’s appraisal of the Swedish economy, as presented in our latestinflation report last June, together with subsequent economic tendencies. Finally I shall be returning tothe somewhat longer perspective of my opening section. This will tie in with the theme of the seminarand highlight some factors that are of crucial importance for our success in creating a potential for futureeconomic expansion.1. Inflation target policy—how does it work?The objective of monetary policy is to keep the value of money stable. This has beendefined more specifically as keeping the annual rate of inflation (measured as the change in theConsumer Price Index) at 2 per cent. Around this target there is a tolerance interval of ±1 percentagepoint which serves to accommodate normal deviations that arise, for instance, from transitory impulses.But the possibility of larger deviations than this cannot be ruled out. If they occur, it is important that weexplain their causes and state how inflation is to be brought back into line with the target.To influence consumer prices, the Riksbank uses its instrumental rate—the repo rate.Simplifying somewhat, one can say that, by altering the marginal interest rate for banks, the Riksbankinfluences other domestic interest rates and thereby the level of economic activity in Sweden andconsequently the development of prices. It should be noted, however, that in the short and medium term,pricing is also affected by other factors, such as the construction of fiscal policy and the development ofwages. That is why the Riksbank is concerned that, when making decisions, politicians and labourmarket organisations should also promote low inflation. It is the reason, moreover, for my returning tothese matters at the end of this talk. But in the long run the course of inflation is crucially dependent onmonetary policy.Interest rate adjustments have their main effect on prices after an interval of one to twoyears. Monetary policy decisions therefore have to be based, not on the latest figures for inflation but onthe Riksbank’s current assessment of future price movements. Our quarterly inflation reports accordinglypresent ongoing inflation forecasts based on analyses of a large array of economic indicators, supportedby economic models and knowledge of relationships between different parts of the economy. Theinflation assessment is used by the Riksbank in drawing conclusions about the direction of monetarypolicy. A forecast rate of inflation above the target normally leads to interest rate increases, just as anexpected rate below the target prompts the Riksbank to lower the repo rate.Inflation is assessed on a continuous basis. New information—fresh economic statistics,for instance, or signs of a change in some economic relationships—leads the Riksbank to review itscurrent forecast and make the necessary changes. If a new forecast indicates that future inflation willdeviate from the target, then the Riksbank has to adjust the repo rate in accordance with the newassessment.However, assessments of future inflation—like any other forecast—are bound to includean element of uncertainty. Moreover, observers are liable to differ on which future path is most probable.So it is hardly surprising—rather a healthy sign—that our inflation assessments and monetary policy aresometimes a subject of lively debate. But while inflation assessments may vary, in Swedish society todaythere is broad support for focusing monetary policy on price stability.
- 2 -BIS Review  66/19982. Recent yearsThe Swedish economy, as we all know, went through a profound crisis in the early1990s. This is not an occasion for discussing the causes of the crisis in depth. It will suffice to note thatthe origins lay in structural weaknesses in Sweden’s economy. But the crisis also had to do withshortcomings in stabilisation policy in the late 1980s and early 1990s.Since production stopped falling and growth restarted in the course of 1993, economicdevelopments in Sweden have exceeded expectations in several respects. The average annual growth rateof above 2.5 per cent is higher than the average in the boom period in the 1980s.In a way, perhaps this is hardly surprising. The weak exchange rate gave exports a strongimpetus and there was plenty of unutilised capacity. But I do not think many people expected that suchhigh growth could be combined with low inflation. In these years Sweden has rejected the policy fromthe decades of high inflation and reinstated the time-honoured tradition of annual price increases around2 per cent. Inflation has also been low in an international comparison. Judging from the expectations ofeconomic agents, a low-inflation regime has now been established.The composition of growth has also been favourable. After decades of growth that wasgenerated to a high degree by rising consumption—with an accumulation of external debt—it is a healthysign that expansion been associated with strong export demand and industrial investment. One result ofthis, the large current-account surpluses since 1994, has made it possible to repay external debt.A dramatic turnaround has also been achieved in government finances. Massive budgetdeficits have been succeeded by a surplus. This trend is primarily a consequence of the economicrecovery, just as declining activity was the main cause of the earlier fiscal collapse. But without theextensive measures for budget consolidation, neither the economic upturn nor the improvement ingovernment finances would have been feasible.Tax increases and spending cuts on the scale we have experienced in recent yearsobviously leave their mark. Household income has been sharply restricted, particularly in 1995–96. Sohave public activities.In one respect, moreover, the outlook is still troublesome, namely as regardsemployment. Despite the economic recovery, a rapid expansion of employment has proved difficult toachieve. It is worth noting, however, that the number of private sector jobs, in services in particular, hasin fact been rising continuously since 1995. But this has not made up sufficiently for the contraction ofemployment during the 1990s in, for example, the public sector and construction.After this review of developments in recent years, I shall now discuss the Riksbank’sappraisal of the coming twenty-four months, which is the period we need to consider when conductingmonetary policy.3. The message in JuneIn the latest inflation report last June the Riksbank presented an economic forecast forSweden and its implications for the path of inflation up to the middle of the year 2000. Our assessmentwas that the trends in recent years, with high growth and low inflation, would continue in the yearsahead.The economic upswing was assumed to continue in the forecast period, with annualgrowth rates around 2.5 per cent this year and 3 per cent in the next two years. The forecast involved anincreasing contribution from rising domestic demand, accompanied by a successive fall-off in exportgrowth. Private consumption was expected to pick up, partly in view of rising household income.
- 3 -BIS Review  66/1998Notwithstanding the prospect of further good economic growth in the coming years, theRiksbank judged that the rate of inflation would remain low and even be less than we had expectedearlier. The strong demand was certainly assumed to give some increase in inflationary pressure in theforecast period but not so much as to be a cause for concern. One reason lay in the good productivitygrowth that was also foreseen, indicating that full capacity utilisation in the economy would not bereached in the coming twenty-four months. Although capacity utilisation was high in certain sectors, theRiksbank envisaged that in the economy as a whole there would be a capacity surplus.External inflationary pressure was expected to be low in view of subdued internationalinflation, low raw materials prices and a somewhat stronger exchange rate.Expectations of future inflation among households, financial agents and manufacturingindicated a belief that future inflation would be low. Thus, confidence in economic policy’s focus onprice stability seemed to have been firmly established.The Riksbank noted that the uncertainty in the assessment of future inflation was mainlywhether it would be even lower than we foresaw in the main scenario. One of the main factors here wasthe crisis in Asia and its conceivable effects on international economic developments and prices. Therewere risks of the crisis’ effects being greater than assumed in the main scenario in June, so that weakdemand and low inflation in the rest of the world would lead to an even lower price rise in the Swedisheconomy.All in all, these considerations meant that in the June report the Riksbank’s overallassessment of inflation in the coming years was adjusted downwards. As the rate of inflation twelve totwenty-four months ahead was judged to be below the target, the Riksbank considered that, at least for atime, there was room for a somewhat more expansionary monetary stance. The repo rate was thereforelowered 25 basis points.4. What has happened since the June report?Let us now look at what has actually happened since the beginning of the summer.Low pressure from international pricesDuring the summer the Asian crisis has got worse and the uncertainty about its futurecourse seems to have grown. More countries in the region are now expected to show a fall in outputduring the year. One of the main factors behind the deterioration is the weak Japanese economy. Theknock-on effects of the Japanese crisis in other parts of the world are highly uncertain, as is the outlookin such countries as Russia and China.An impact from the Asian crisis is now discernible in economic growth in the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom. These economies show signs of a slowdown that can be traced todecreased exports to Asia but there are also indications that their domestic demand is slackening.In the euro area, however, growth prospects seem to be more favourable. The recoveryappears to be firm—to a growing extent as a result of stronger domestic demand—and it looks as thoughinflation will remain low.The overall picture of international activity is somewhat weaker than the Riksbankforecast in June. International inflationary pressure is low. The extensive economic problems in Japanand the unrest in global stock exchanges are contributing to this.
- 4 -BIS Review  66/1998Swedish economy strongEconomic growth in Sweden seems to be good, however. As expected, the statistics showan accelerating growth of domestic demand, accompanied by a slowdown in foreign trade.Private consumption is rising strongly and a continuation of this trend is indicated by anumber of factors: households’ personal economic expectations are still rising, employment is expandingand disposable income is growing as a result of low inflation and a less restrictive fiscal policy.Uncertainty about share prices could have a contrary effect but the downward movements that have beenobserved constitute no more than a correction after a relatively strong increase. Since the beginning of1998 the Stockholm Exchange has risen 20 per cent. The statistics also show strong growth for publicconsumption as well as gross capital formation.But foreign trade is weakening; export growth is slowing and imports are rising. Thereare several signs that exports will go on slackening; the inflow of export orders has deteriorated andconfidence has fallen among purchasing managers in manufacturing. However, the weaker exchange ratemay have a contrary effect on exports.The inflation statistics show that inflationary pressure in the Swedish economy is stilllow. In June and July the price level fell 0.2 per cent. This means that for both months the twelve-monthrate of inflation was 0.6 per cent.All in all, it looks as though the growth of domestic demand in 1998 may exceed theassessment in the June report. On the other hand, foreign trade may be somewhat weaker than wecounted on at that time. Thus, the figures on real economic developments that have been published sincethe latest inflation report do not seem to call for any substantial revision of the forecasts. Neither havethe summer figures for inflation or the regular surveys of inflation expectations altered the outlook fromthe early summer.Weaker exchange rateIn the June report we counted on some appreciation of the krona in the forecast period.During the summer the krona has weakened and I want to take this opportunity of commenting on thetendency since June. Most of the weakening has occurred in August. In effective terms (TCW) the kronahas depreciated somewhat more than 3 per cent since the beginning of June, from 119 to 123. Against theUS dollar and the German mark the fall in this period amounts to somewhat more than 5 per cent and 3per cent, respectively.Several explanations are given for the weakening of the krona. A downward tendencywas already evident in May–June in connection with the repo rate cut. After that the krona seems to havebeen pulled down by the unrest in Asia, which has hit relatively small industrialised countries that aredependent on foreign trade. Some observers consider that countries with a high export share for rawmaterials have experienced a currency depreciation in connection with the price fall for raw materials.That explanation is not really all that applicable to Sweden because it is difficult to show that we are stillparticularly dependent on raw materials exports.The stock exchange turbulence is also considered to have had a major effect on the kronarecently in that nonresidents have disposed of Swedish shares, which involves selling kronor for othercurrencies. Since the June inflation report there has been no new information that warrants increasedconcern about economic development in Sweden. So the weaker krona does not appear to reflect achange in confidence in the economic fundamentals. The traditional indicators of credibility, computedfrom price trends in financial markets, convey the same picture. Both the long bond differential withGermany and the expected future short interest rates point to persistently strong confidence in thelow-inflation policy.
- 5 -BIS Review  66/1998In this context I should like briefly to rehearse the role of the exchange rate in monetarypolicy. The Riksbank does not target the exchange rate; monetary policy focuses instead on a target forinflation. The exchange rate can be seen as one of a number of indicators—albeit one of the mostimportant—that we use to predict inflationary pressure in the Swedish economy. If the krona weakens orstrengthens permanently, then this—all else equal—will affect inflation.The difficulty accordingly lies in assessing the permanence of exchange rate movementsand incorporating the assessment in the overall picture of inflation. The economic fundamentals favouran appreciation of the krona in the coming years. For this reason we believe that the current weakening istemporary and will be followed in time by a renewed appreciation. It should be underscored, however,that if the krona’s weakening to date can be regarded as permanent, then there are also reasons forexpecting that the weaker exchange rate will lead to inflation at a higher rate than we foresaw in the Junereport. That would have consequences for monetary policy, always assuming, of course, that otherfactors have not simultaneously contributed to a better outlook for inflation.The recent weakening of the krona, together with increased concern about continuedturbulence in Asia and global stock exchanges, has shown up in money market pricing. The market’searlier assessment was that room existed for further interest rate cuts. Today the picture is less clear-cut.This I find entirely natural in that the exchange rate is an important factor in our assessment of futureinflation.The overall pictureTo sum up, the new statistics since June largely support the opinion about inflationprospects that we presented in the latest report. The figures for real economic activity and inflationsuggest, if anything, that the path of inflation will be lower than in our main scenario in the June report.If so, however, it is presumably a question of marginal revisions. The exchange rate, however, instead ofmoving as we predicted, has weakened. The assessment of this tendency and how it should be weighedup with other factors in an overall assessment of inflation prospects is a matter to which the Riksbankwill be returning in the next inflation report on September 28th.Concluding remarksHaving presented the Riksbank’s picture of current economic developments, I should liketo return to the somewhat longer time perspective from the beginning of this talk and take up the issuethat is the theme for today’s speakers. Is there room for expansion in the Swedish economy? In doing so Ishall concentrate on two fields that are closely connected with monetary policy: the functioning of thelabour market and fiscal policy.The economic policy that has been implemented in recent years, with its emphasis onprice stability and sound government finances, has had favourable results in a number of respects. Highgrowth has been combined with persistently low inflation. Moreover, the composition of growth has beenstructurally desirable, focusing on exports and industrial expansion. This helps to establish a betterfoundation for a sustained increase in future consumption. A reduction of external debt has begun.Prospects for the coming years also look favourable. It seems that output can growrelatively rapidly by Swedish standards, accompanied by relatively low inflation.There is reason to emphasise, however, that what we see is hardly the final solution toour problems but rather important initial steps towards a more balanced development.For one thing, the positive trend in the Swedish economy does not yet apply at allsubstantially to the labour market. A downward adjustment in the rate of wage increases towards morereasonable long-term figures has begun but we do not know how permanent it will be. What will happenin the next round of wage negotiations if capacity utilisation at that time is high? Is the functioning of the
- 6 -BIS Review  66/1998labour market in other respects sufficiently smooth for the adequate creation and filling of new jobvacancies? This is a key question. If we do not succeed in finding good solutions in Sweden when itcomes to wage formation and the workings of the labour market, in the longer run it will not be possibleto permit such strong economic expansion as we have experienced in recent years.Another aspect of economic policy that, like the functioning of the labour market, isclosely connected with the Riksbank’s domain is fiscal policy. In recent years monetary policy has beenassisted in the first place in that the consolidation of government finances has restored a stablefoundation for economic policy; in addition, there has been the more direct restraint—in a cyclicalperspective—on demand and price impulses. In recent decades that was by no means invariably the case.On the contrary, there were periods when fiscal policy accentuated the cyclical movements.I find it important to issue a warning about repeating mistakes of this type. In the middleof an economic upswing we are now hearing calls for expansionary fiscal policies in the form ofincreased public spending as well as unfinanced tax cuts. There are strong long-term grounds for usingthe upswing in activity to build up government surpluses as a buffer for harder times. That will increaseour future freedom of action in economic policy. It will be easier to cope both with future economicdownturns and with structural challenges such as an ageing population. A tighter fiscal policy also easesthe burden on monetary policy and increases the probability in the years ahead of being able to continueto have low interest rates and a stable economic development, with good growth of production andemployment.
BIS Review   65/1998Mr. Heikenstein discusses the Swedish financial crisis of the early 1990s   Speechby the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikenstein, at a seminar arranged by theSwedish embassy held in Seoul, Korea on 15/7/98.Let me begin with a thank you to the organisers of this seminar. I am honoured tohave the opportunity to share with you some experiences from the Swedish financial crisis in theearly 1990s.1.  IntroductionAn IMF study from 1996 showed that in the past fifteen years, 132 of the Fund’s 182member countries had experienced macroeconomic and/or financial crises. Today the figure is evenhigher. Crises are a recurring phenomenon. In spite of every effort to prevent them, I fear that criseswill continue to occur. We should therefore use the opportunities to learn from each other, both inorder to avoid making the same mistakes and to find the appropriate correctives sooner.Needless to say, there are no single “best solutions”. Crisis situations are alwaysspecific in some respects, not least with regard to their structural and political environment. Had theynot been specific, they would probably never have occurred because they would have been “spotted”in advance. Having said this, however, there are a number of globally accepted “truths” about whatconstitutes a good response to crises.Discussions around crisis situations are usually divided into two parts: crisisprevention and crisis management. In this presentation I will be focusing on the latter. To understandthe handling of a crisis, it is useful to know which factors generated the problems. Hence, mynarrative will include the events that led up to the crisis in Sweden. I will also comment on thedevelopments in Asia, with some emphasis on Korea. Having sketched this background, I will turnto the actual handling of crises, explaining why we found certain types of solutions useful inSweden - leaving it to you to consider whether the same might apply to some extent to your country.2.  BackgroundThe macroeconomyFirst, let me say a few words about the macroeconomic background to the crisis inSweden. There are both similarities and differences between Sweden and Asia. In the following Iwill touch on some of them. It should also be remembered that substantial differences also existbetween the Asian countries.One common factor is the fixed exchange rate. In Sweden this led to high levels offoreign borrowing, particularly in the private sector. In addition it made it difficult to counter thegradual overheating of the economy by applying contractive monetary measures - raising interestrates tended to increase capital inflows which, to the extent they were monetised, further contributedto the overheating.Following the deregulation of the domestic financial market, the crisis in Sweden wasalso preceded by a rapid expansion of credit; in the course of five years, private borrowing grewfrom 85 to 135 % of GDP. The credit expansion coincided with a protracted boom and a significantproportion of the borrowed money was spent on speculation, both in real estate and in financialassets, such as equity. The real estate speculation in Sweden culminated in a bubble that burst in1990-91. Shielded by the economic upswing, there had been many misdirected and overly optimisticinvestments in various industrial and other projects.
- 2 -BIS Review   65/1998In these aspects I find similarities between Sweden in the late 1980s and the Asiancountries during the 1990s. A feature common to Sweden and Korea was, moreover, that thedomestic financial market was liberalised long before the external capital outflows. This meant thatoverheating of the domestic economy could not be adequately balanced by capital outflows forinvestment abroad.But there are also some differences. Other factors that contributed to Sweden’s acutecrisis were a relatively deep international downturn and high interest rates in our part of the worldin the wake of German reunion. On top of this, our fiscal position was more vulnerable, entering the1990s with a public debt-to-GDP ratio of around 40 per cent. Sweden’s external borrowing ratio wasalso high - some 30 per cent of GDP. Besides reflecting the public budget deficit, this had to do withan extremely low private savings ratio. In some years this ratio was actually negative. Theseweaknesses made Sweden highly vulnerable to shifts in confidence in our economy.The financial sectorThere were also underlying weaknesses in financial systems. Let me now turn tothese.The financial systems had not adapted to the change from a sheltered environment toa deregulated and much more competitive situation. In the earlier environment, banks had had littleincentive to develop a sophisticated credit culture, involving comprehensive evaluations of debtors,projects and collateral. (One important similarity between Sweden and Korea was the overoptimisticreliance on collateral and other guarantees, rather than on the viability of the loan project itself).When deregulation was a fact, bank managers saw a chance of gaining market share and increasingrevenues by taking new risks, but did not clearly see the dangers in a lack of the necessary expertise.One of the major faults in credit decisions in Sweden was that banks lent tocustomers, projects and geographical areas of which they did not have sufficient knowledge. Anothermajor mistake was that banks accepted high-risk concentrations, not just to individual companiesbut also to economic sectors, primarily real estate, and to geographical areas. At the peak of thecrisis, bank loans to real estate, or collateralised by real estate, accounted for more than 60 per centof all loan losses.A further weakness was the inability of the banks, as well as of the authorities, toregister the growing prevalence of indirect concentration risks. For instance, bank borrowersdemanded loans denominated in foreign currencies. Interest rates on these loans were lower than onkrona loans and as the krona was fixed within a fairly narrow band, there was presumed to be noexchange risk. The banks borrowed the foreign currencies abroad and on-lent them to customers,avoiding open exchange risk exposures. However, when the krona was attacked and the fixedexchange rate subsequently had to be abandoned, banks were doubly affected. Foreigncounterparties, perceiving the banks’ weakened position, reduced or withdrew credit lines. Thisforced the banks to demand either early repayment from customers or loan conversion into domesticcurrency. This led, in turn, to sharply increased loan losses because, at short notice, borrowers wereunable to raise the larger amounts in krona that were needed to repay the foreign currency loans,which the krona’s depreciation had made much more expensive.Neither had the supervisory authority, the Bank Inspectorate, adjusted. It continuedits traditional formal supervision, ensuring that reports, permits et cetera were formally correct,rather than supervising the actual risks. The authority was also somewhat complacent about risks (tobe frank, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance should share the blame for this) since
- 3 -BIS Review   65/1998Sweden had not experienced a financial crisis since the 1930s. Lacking relevant crisis experience,the authorities did not perceive that the 1980s could pave the way to a new financial crisis. Thedecade was, after all, characterised by sustained economic growth, rising bank profits and extremelylow loan losses.The financial weaknesses I have described so far are quite similar in Sweden andKorea. However, some differences should also be noted:• In Sweden, banks had built up good capital reserves. Before the onset of the crisis, all thebanks fulfilled or surpassed the 8 per cent Basle requirement for capital. So, although non-performing and other impaired loans amounted to 15 per cent of GDP in Sweden (a figurethat is rather similar to recent estimates for Korea), the original cost to the government ofrescuing the banking system amounted to only some 4 per cent of GDP; since then,moreover, most of this has in fact been recovered.• Sweden applied restrictive rules to central bank involvement in the banks. Only liquiditysupport was provided, inter alia in the form of foreign currency deposits to stem the outflowfrom the banks and to reduce the risk of a credit crunch. This did not involve the Riksbank inany risks because the State guarantee for banks’ repayments also applied to us as a lender.3.  TriggersNow, let me turn to the actual crisis. It is well known that the event (or events)triggering a crisis is often different from the crisis’ underlying causes. In the absence of a triggeringfactor, countries with substantial underlying problems from time to time have also been able to avoidan acute crisis. The event triggering a crisis is sometimes rather dramatic, such as the assassinationof a politician - as in the Mexican case - or a sudden loss of confidence, e.g. due to the presentationof a disappointingly weak fiscal budget. Opinions may differ about what were the most important“triggers” of the acute crises we are discussing today. Again, I see both differences and similaritiesbetween Sweden and the Asian countries.In our case, a policy shift to the low-inflation regime in the rest of Europe, combinedwith structural changes and a more hostile international environment (with higher interest rates andlower growth, as I mentioned before), made the existing situation unsustainable and triggered thecrisis.In the early 1990s the government refrained from accommodating the high costs andinflationary pressures that had been building up in the 1980s. Under similar circumstances earlier inthe 1970s and 1980s we had devalued several times. Now there was broad agreement that we shouldstick to the fixed exchange rate in order to bring inflation down; in this respect, the policy wasindeed successful: inflation fell from 8-10 per cent to 2-3 per cent in less than two years. One effectof this, however, was that real interest rates shot up. Structural reforms were also implemented,particularly in the tax system but also in housing and other areas. One aim of these reforms was tocreate more market-related incentives for savings and to reduce subsidies. While these changes werelong overdue, they now came at the worst possible time from a macroeconomic point of view.In this context, it is relevant to mention the importance of the sequencing of policychanges. In our case, some things, such as financial deregulation, were achieved during the 1980s(although obviously not enough) and supported demand when this was already strong. Later on,when the economy was on its way down, tax changes were implemented that encouraged saving. Tothis should be added the mistake I have already mentioned, of not liberalising outward capital flowsat the same time as the domestic credit market is deregulated.
- 4 -BIS Review   65/1998The crisis culminated in the fall of 1992, when for a few days repo rates were raisedto 500 per cent in the vain hope of stemming currency outflows. Interest rate hikes and othercontractive measures for defending the fixed exchange rate in the midst of European currencyturmoil further exacerbated the economic downturn and added to the banks’ loan losses. All in all, inthe three years from 1991 to 1993, Sweden’s GDP fell by a total of around 6 per cent. Before thefinancial crisis had even been recognised in the summer of 1992, production had probably alreadyfallen by 2-3 per cent.It is my impression that the process in these respects has been quite different in Asia,perhaps apart from Thailand. Growth did not drop much before the crisis. More important were thedirect contagion effects, particularly via financial markets. Other “triggers” were political, such asuncertainty caused by upcoming elections, and perceived balance of payments problems. In manyrespects the process - once it had started - was also more rapid in Asia. Perhaps markets have - afterall - learnt something from previous crises in Europe and Latin America. They did not see the crisiscoming but once it started, they reacted more rapidly.4.  Crisis managementI will now turn to the issue of how to resolve a crisis, once it has erupted. It isobviously necessary to tackle macro and micro problems in parallel since the two are interlinked.As I stated earlier, I believe that the origin of the Swedish crisis was primarilymacroeconomic, due to policy mistakes in the 1980s and early 1990s, and triggered by the policyshift to a low inflation regime. (Although there were also structural weaknesses in the financialsector). The solutions were also primarily macroeconomic in kind. Once the krona peg had beenabandoned, demand got a stimulus. The task confronting policy makers was to restore the credibilityof economic policy. This required in our case, given the weak fiscal position, very strong fiscalmeasures (some 8 per cent of GDP 1994-98). But it also called for a consistent monetary policy.However, and this is important to underline in the present context, if the financial problems had notbeen managed properly, they could easily have been a drag on the macro economy. For example, bytaking prompt action it seems that we largely avoided a “credit crunch”, which was a possibility thatworried people a lot at the time. Credit volumes obviously fell, but this could be explained by thereduction in demand.Briefly, the important components of the solution for the financial sector were as follows:1. The Government, later confirmed by Parliament, issued an unlimited guarantee stating thatno depositors or other counterparties to Swedish credit institutions would suffer any losses.This was a fundamental measure in order to restore confidence in the Swedish banks bothfrom domestic and from foreign depositors and other counterparties. The results showedthemselves rather quickly, e.g., in the form of renewed interbank credit lines with foreignbanks. Also the Swedish public remained calm and there were no runs on the banks.However, the government (Parliament) guarantee and the other measures must also be madeknown to all interested parties.2. The mandate to implement the support policies was given to a new agency, the Bank SupportAuthority, which was at arm’s length from the political sphere but accountable to theGovernment. To avoid conflicts of interest, it was found appropriate not to have the SupportAuthority in either the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank or the Financial SupervisoryAuthority.
- 5 -BIS Review   65/19983. A common framework of measures was constructed for support of the banking system. Astrategy for deciding which banks to reconstruct and which to liquidate was developed andexplained to the general public. The measures were designed to minimise costs for theGovernment and the risk of moral hazard. Consequently, shareholders were not covered bythe government guarantee and would lose their equity investments to the same degree as theGovernment had to provide support for their banks. This provided an incentive to the ownersto avoid applying for state support unless it was absolutely necessary, to minimise theamount of support and to reduce the time-period of receiving support. We used a verysimple, but clear and easy-to-explain, method of identifying banks which should be givensupport in order to survive and those which should be liquidated or merged. First youwrite-down the bank’s bad loans. Then you test the bank in a micro- and macroeconomicmodel. If the model indicates that the bank will be adequately profitable again in themedium-term future it should be given support to survive. But if the model indicates that thebank will never be profitable again the bank will not be of economic benefit to the societyand should thus be closed or merged in an orderly manner.4. Strict valuation rules were used from the onset of the crisis. This was deemed necessary inorder to restore confidence but the policy was not without risks. All bank assets had to bemarked-to-market even if the market, such as that for real estate, was exceptionally weak.This led to higher bank losses and a weaker financial position than if a somewhat moreflexible valuation rule had been adopted. The Bank Support Authority hired experts onvaluation of various types of assets to ensure that the banks did not over- or underestimatethe value of their assets with the aim to motivate requirements for more support. In addition,the rules on when to identify a loan as a non-performing loan and how much to write-offwere made stricter and with less room for the banks’ own judgement.5. The Swedish government did not take any specific measures to rescue or reconstruct thenon-financial companies, neither did it instruct the banks on how to use the support they hadreceived. All support was provided via the banks and the state-owned asset managementcorporations, leaving them to negotiate the best terms for themselves and their non-financialcustomers. There was a wave of bankruptcies and restructuring of non-financial companies,primarily in the domestic sector due to weak domestic demand.6. The extensive use of Asset Management Corporations (AMCs) in Sweden has become wellknown abroad. AMCs had, in fact, been established in other countries before the Swedishcrisis, so this was nothing new. The special feature in our case is the emphasis on splitting anailing bank into a good bank and a “bad part” and transferring the bad assets to the AMC atcarefully assessed market values. Once in the AMC, the assets are regrouped and improvedin order to become attractive to potential buyers. As soon as a reasonable price can beobtained, the asset was sold. This was sometimes a rather time-consuming process but in theend the results were probably better than if there had been a quick “fire-sale” of the assets. Itis my opinion that the use of AMCs is superior to having the bad assets remain in theproblem banks. The bank staffs are no experts in the field of handling bad assets and may notobtain the best sales values. Also, the bank management needs to tackle other problems andto work hard on future strategic planning for the bank – they do not have time enough for theoften very large number of complex decisions to be taken on the bad assets.5.  ConclusionsFinally, can we draw any conclusions for Asia in general and Korea in particularfrom the way the financial crisis was handled in Sweden?
- 6 -BIS Review   65/1998First, I think it is important, as I said before, to recognise the importance ofmacroeconomic developments. Once the fixed exchange rate had been abandoned, Sweden’seconomy experienced an export-driven upturn. But it did take a long time for confidence in theSwedish economy in general to return - at least another two years. It is noteworthy that this was sodespite the fact that the recovery in growth had started in the summer of 1993. The explanation liesprimarily in the fiscal situation, to which the financial sector and related problems had made asubstantial contribution - enlarging the budget deficit by perhaps as much as 6% of GDP at the time.On top of this, the krona was depressed for a long time by the repayment of foreign loans.The financial problems did not have a major impact on economic developments from1993 onwards. Once the important decisions concerning the financial sector had been taken, it wasnot long before the financial aspect of the crisis had disappeared from the headlines. And the bankswere already recovering in late 1993 - just a year after the peak of the crisis. This in itself wasobviously a great achievement and it may be worth briefly stating some of the more importantlessons that, in my opinion, can be drawn from this episode of financial crisis management:1. Confidence needs to be restored rapidly. This was achieved in Sweden as far as the financialsector was concerned. If confidence returns fairly soon, the real effects on the economy neednot be large. But if, on the other hand, the lack of domestic and/or external confidence wereto persist, this could act as a drag on economic development for a long period. It is also myexperience from other countries that the longer the period with a lack of confidence, themore drastic the measures that will be needed to restore credibility. Among other things,restoring confidence involves being transparent about the problems and about the measuresfor dealing with them. It also means that measures are implemented as stated by theresponsible authorities, without any deviations in timing or application. Just the suspicionthat specific industries or other interest groups may be receiving unjustifiably favourabletreatment would quickly erode any confidence.2. Transparency is important. A severe crisis wipes confidence out - rightly so. We realised thatit was up to Sweden to regain it. To do so, all the cards had to be on the table. The extent ofthe losses and the magnitude of the bad loans had to be revealed in their entirety andvaluation had to be prudent. If you hide losses initially or are overly optimistic in valuations,you risk having to apply again to the international investment community or to taxpayers foradditional support. This, in my view, might jeopardise confidence and legitimacy. It is alsonecessary to have highly transparent and fair “rules of the game” for government support tothe financial sector, not least to avoid political bickering. The responsibility for transparencyfalls primarily on two parties: the authorities and the banks. The authorities must betransparent about the broad framework for the solution of the crisis and the banks must betransparent about their losses and other deficiencies, financial position and need for externalsupport.3. Someone must take the losses. It is important to realise that once the crisis has occurred, thelosses cannot be hidden and must be dealt with in one way or another. In this respectSwedish institutions worked well. Party politics were clearly separated from businessrealities. And the politicians did a good job, realising that bygones were bygones, setting up afair framework to sort the crisis out. From a political perspective it was important that thebanks’ owners were not rescued. People at large had to take substantial cuts in livingstandards - at least temporarily. Letting the “big guys” go unhurt under these circumstanceswould have jeopardised the whole operation.4. The macroeconomic policy mix for crisis management can differ. In our case, there wasobviously not much room for fiscal stimulation of the economy. Considering the much lower
- 7 -BIS Review   65/1998public debt, there could be more room in some Asian countries but the potential budgeteffects of the financial losses also need to be taken into account. Monetary policy has adifficult dual role: it has to strike a balance between stimulating the economy so as to easethe burden on the banks and on their borrowers and at the same time ensuring the capitalinflows that are needed to rebuild the depleted foreign currency reserves.5. On top of this - and perhaps the most important factor - there was political consensus. Thegovernment sought and received backing from the main opposition party. That party wasalso allowed to appoint Board members of the Bank Support Authority so that it could becontinuously informed and influence decisions. That was important both for politicallegitimacy at home and for credibility abroad - investors could be sure that the system wehad created would be upheld even if there were a change in government.Let me end on a positive note. Economically, the crisis in Korea and in many of theother Asian countries should be manageable although it will probably take time before the results areclearly visible. Korea is in far better shape than many other countries, including my own in the early1990s, given the high rates of potential growth and that the fiscal balances are in reasonable shape.However, what actually happens will depend on how the crisis is managed.That is now precisely the question.
BIS Review   64/1998Mr. McDonough discusses the importance of sound financial systems   Remarksby the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. William J. McDonough, at apresentation in Mexico City, Mexico on 22/7/98.Introduction I am delighted to be here today in my second-favorite country in the world to addressyou on the very timely subject of the importance of sound financial systems. Having worked closelywith my friends in the public and private sectors here over the years, I know the importance of theseissues to them. Judging by the attendance here today, this interest appears very broad indeed, apositive sign for the continued revitalization and strengthening of Mexico’s banking sector. My remarks today, necessarily, reflect my perspective as president of the FederalReserve Bank of New York, which supervises the majority of domestic and foreign bank assets inthe United States, and as Chairman of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, a position Iaccepted last month. These positions allow me a front-row seat on the wide range of developmentstaking place in international banking and banking supervision, a perspective which I hope to sharewith you today.To understand the importance of sound financial systems, one need only look at theimpact of financial system breakdowns, of which, unfortunately, there are many recent examples.Indeed, prior to the onset of the Asian crisis, the IMF had estimated that fully three-quarters of itsmember countries had experienced significant banking sector problems since 1980. Bankingproblems have afflicted both industrial and emerging market countries, including the US, whichweathered the savings and loans and banking problems of the 1980s and early 1990s.Crises around the world have exacted a high price, with direct fiscal costs ofassociated resolutions typically starting at roughly 5 percent of GDP (in the US case, such costs ranmore than $100 billion). To these substantial sums, one must add the less quantifiable, but no lessreal, consequences for the economy and financial system. A weakened financial sector cannot serveits role as intermediary - as banks seek to repair their balance sheets, restrict new lending, and shoreup capital - leading to diminished growth prospects. In a number of Asian countries today, exportershave difficulty obtaining trade financing from domestic banks, delaying the process of economicrecovery and raising fears of a credit crunch in which even sound companies are driven intobankruptcy. Banking sector problems reduce depositor confidence in the banking system and cantrigger capital flight. Banking system problems, significant in their own right, can cause distortionsin monetary policy, render monetary policy tools less effective, and put at risk the integrity of thepayments system. In an integrated international financial system, it is increasingly difficult to containa banking crisis within a country’s borders. Finally, we must not forget the human consequences of afinancial and broader economic crisis, which disproportionately fall on those least able to weatherthe storm.Clearly we need to learn what we can from recent history and take steps now to makedomestic and international financial systems more resilient. Crises are opportunities forimplementing change, and in the US and internationally, significant reforms traditionally have beenborn of crisis. To effect meaningful and appropriate reform, however, we must fully understandcause and effect and the broader trends of international financial intermediation. Today, I would liketo share with you my perspective on these issues based on US and international experience, withspecial emphasis on the need for additional preventive measures.
- 2 -BIS Review   64/1998Importance of sound banking systems Over the long run, a nation must be able to mobilize domestic savings and othersources of funds needed to finance investment and other productive expenditures. This requires thedevelopment of an effective banking system that transfers surplus funds of households andbusinesses to borrowers and investors. Fair and impartial allocation of credit accommodates theeconomic development that results in improved national living standards. Notwithstanding broadchanges in the intermediation process which have reduced the role of banks in favor of the capitalmarkets, banks retain a critical role in direct intermediation and as managers of financial risk. Soundfinancial institutions, and banks particularly, remain integral to a sound economy.Effective financial intermediation is particularly important in the context of mostemerging market countries given the relative scarcity of savings, a relatively underbankedpopulation, and large-scale investment needs. The banking sector in emerging market countries alsotends to be more concentrated and represents a larger share of the domestic financial system,suggesting that problems there will have an amplified effect on the economy and on the fiscal costsassociated with bank rescues.Causes of banking system problemsBanking system crises have many and complex causes, both macro andmicroeconomic. Macroeconomic causes include exogenous shocks, sustained or sharp declines inreal growth, accelerating inflation, deterioration in the terms of trade, and changes in the policyregime. Macroeconomic shocks also typically expose underlying microeconomic deficiencies in riskmanagement practices and internal controls at financial institutions such as weak underwritingstandards, insider lending, excessive credit growth and credit concentrations, interest rate andexchange rate mismatches, and fraud. They also tend to reveal weaknesses in financial systemsupervision and regulation. The threats to financial system stability are many and interact in complexways.Policy responsesReflecting the many causes of financial system distress and differences in countryconditions and institutional settings, responses to financial system crises typically have been variedand hybrid. Banking sector restructurings are art as well as science, and can be influenced by a hostof factors, such as the depth and breadth of problems in the banking, corporate and householdsectors. Other critical factors include the existence of adequate enforcement mechanisms to achievecorrective action and of financial markets that are deep enough to permit the orderly disposal ofproblem bank assets. Indeed, there is no “one size fits all” solution, and individual countries musttailor their approach to their own conditions. Moreover, crises typically evolve in unpredictableways, and policy must be sufficiently fluid to adjust to changing conditions. Nonetheless, past criseshave taught us important lessons applicable to the current situation worldwide.First, it is imperative that bankers and authorities be realistic about the size of theproblems they face. While it is often difficult to accurately gauge the scale of problems at the outsetof the crisis, history shows that problems usually are much larger than they first appear, andestimates often are subject to frequent and significant upward revision. While pressures to muddlethrough may, at times, be almost irresistible, policymakers and bankers must realize that the costs ofinaction and denial are substantial and that problems left unaddressed grow rapidly over time.Second, it is important to recognize that financial system distress typicallyencompasses weaknesses in many individual areas, and effective solutions need to be comprehensive
- 3 -BIS Review   64/1998and multidimensional. Solutions usually involve complex tensions and trade-offs: improving thecondition of the banking sector, for example, may have the effect of worsening the condition of thecorporate and household sectors, which may, in turn, negatively affect the banks. Similarly,liquidating problem banking assets may put additional downward pressure on a broader range ofasset markets and further exacerbate banking sector problems. However, asset retention more oftenthan not erodes values and freezes market liquidity. Policymakers face difficult choices in managingproblem bank restructurings, and there is a great need for creativity in devising solutions.Third, crisis situations cry out for solutions to be adopted quickly to stem furtherdeterioration. At the same time, however, solutions adopted in the short term need to account for thelong-term consequences for market efficiency, particularly with respect to moral hazard. The highestpriority at the outset of a crisis is usually to restore confidence in the banking system. To this end,authorities in a number of countries have implemented guarantees of bank deposits or broader bankliabilities, in some cases both domestic and foreign, followed by concrete actions to make depositinsurance schemes more explicit and bolster the insurance fund. To minimize the moral hazardimplications of such arrangements, however, it is critical that guarantees be established for a definedtransitional period, and that supervision of financial institutions simultaneously be stepped up. Issues of moral hazard also need to be considered in authorities’ actions in cases offinancial institution insolvency. Supervisors have adopted varying approaches to insolventinstitutions, including mergers, purchases and assumptions, nationalization, and liquidation. Whilethe authorities should have a general bias toward writing-off existing shareholders and removingmanagement and directors of troubled institutions, such actions may need to be balanced againstarguments that current owners and management may be best positioned to achieve an effectivework-out.Fourth, I think we should bear in mind that banking sector crises often are not justshort-term aberrations, but usually are manifestations of longer-term structural problems. Therefore,it is crucial that policymakers address not only the immediate stock of problem assets through “badbank/good bank” vehicles, but also structural problems, or weaknesses in core profitability stemmingfrom high overhead, low margins, and excessive regulatory costs. To the extent that underlyingproblems are not addressed, the banking sector will remain vulnerable to future instability.Thus, at the same time as authorities seek to battle a crisis, they also may becompelled to undertake a range of longer-term reforms to banking sector infrastructure, most notablyin areas of accounting, disclosure, capital, and supervision and regulation. These changes ofteninvolve bringing domestic standards in line with international standards, and can involve difficulttrade-offs, in that, for example, fuller disclosure of problem loans may undermine depositorconfidence. Finally, the scale of banking sector problems in a number of countries hasnecessitated opening up the sector to significant foreign investment. Clearly, such a course bringspolitical tensions and possible domestic backlash. Notwithstanding these concerns, foreignownership is both inevitable and positive as foreign capital brings not only additional financialstrength to a domestic banking sector, but also frequently needed technology and skills transfer.Overall summary of initiatives What has been the success of responses to recent banking crises? While it is stillpremature to draw firm conclusions, based on the experience in Latin America and early indicationsfrom Asia, I believe that, on the whole, policy responses have been meaningful and have
- 4 -BIS Review   64/1998strengthened domestic safety and soundness considerably. Let me briefly review the new, post-crisis,financial landscape in Latin America. Crises have left perhaps their greatest imprint on domestic financial system structure.Financial systems have generally experienced significant consolidation - leading to a less fragmentedbanking market - as weaker and more marginal players have been forced to exit. Foreign capital nowaccounts for a noteworthy share of banking assets across a number of countries, bringing additionalfinancial strength and know-how. Many governments have sought to reduce their direct role in thefinancial system through the privatization of state banks, although this will likely remain a longer-term policy objective for many countries.Authorities also have made tremendous strides in improving system infrastructure.Disclosure standards have been greatly improved, and in some Latin American countries, disclosurestandards are now comparable to that of G-10 countries. Recognizing the greater historical volatilityin emerging market economies, minimum capital requirements have also been raised to levels aboveBasle minima, and now incorporate additional sources of risk, such as market risk. Financialsupervision and regulation has been improved, with additional resources dedicated to the hiring andtraining of examinations staff and to investments by regulators in information technology.Authorities have been tested and have established more effective mechanisms for addressingproblem bank situations.Financial institutions have undertaken a range of measures themselves to improverisk management practices, operational controls, and core profitability. Some institutions haveattempted to comply with international standards, notwithstanding lower domestic requirements.These reforms are especially important in light of the fact that the obligation to promote financialsoundness rests mainly with financial institutions themselves.Taken together, these reforms indicate progress toward reduced systemic risk,heightened competition, increased banking services provided to the domestic population, and higherstandards of conduct better approximating international standards.Work Ahead Notwithstanding this progress, much work remains ahead. While crises havemotivated a great deal of reform in individual countries, and standards are approaching internationalnorms, the international financial system remains a patchwork of varying standards and guidelines.While international disclosure standards have improved markedly in recent years, greater disclosurestill is required, particularly with respect to bank asset quality, both in emerging and industrialcountries alike. In seeking to make these improvements, however, we should avoid a “checklist”approach which may not address the risks of a given country and may soon become outdated. Improved disclosure will require more than a comprehensive framework.Accounting standards also need to be upgraded to reflect innovations in financial products and riskmanagement techniques. The process of upgrading accounting standards, in turn, would benefit fromgreater harmonization of accounting standards that would facilitate comparison of global financialinstitutions and result in more uniform capital standards across countries.At a fundamental level, I wonder whether the crisis has engendered the mostimportant reform of all – the development of a true credit “culture”. While necessarily a longer-termprocess, the existence of a sound credit culture is the sine qua non of long-term financial stability.Improved disclosure requirements for nonperforming loans, for example, will be meaningless to the
- 5 -BIS Review   64/1998extent that credit standards are weak to begin with, or that there is widespread tolerance regardingthe restructuring of past-due loans, motivated by an unwillingness to admit that the loans aretroubled. Further enhancements to the bankruptcy and legal codes to increase the efficiency andtransparency of collateral recovery are equally necessary.While supervisors have made tremendous strides to effect comprehensive,consolidated supervision globally, significant work remains to be done (and perhaps always will).The rapidly evolving international financial system, in which institutions operate to a greater degreeacross national borders through a variety of entities and, increasingly, in combination with securitiesunderwriting and insurance businesses, poses continued challenges to supervisory frameworksorganized primarily on a national, legal-entity, and business-specific framework. The existence ofparallel, offshore, and other unregulated structures also will continue to present obstacles to the fullimplementation of comprehensive, consolidated supervision on a global basis. Managing these issueswill require intensified coordination and information-sharing among international supervisors.Authorities need to ensure that capital adequacy guidelines keep pace withdevelopments in internal risk measurement techniques and changes in the business of banking. Tothat end, the Basle Capital Accord’s market risk amendment, which went into effect at year-end1997, represents a significant shift in capital supervision, moving away for the first time from theprevailing approach of a mandated and rigid regulatory formula or ratio. The amendment alsorepresents a major step toward a more market-based approach to supervision that draws on banks’internal methodologies for risk measurement, places greater emphasis on promoting sound riskmanagement and control processes, and encourages further innovation and improvement in thebanks’ internal models. While the market risk amendment is a major step in the right direction, we need tobegin thinking now about a conceptual framework for the next generation of capital rules,particularly given the long lead times involved. The original Basle Capital Accord took about fiveyears to develop, and almost seven more years were required to reach agreement on the market riskamendment. I intend to do whatever I can as chairman of the Banking Supervision Committee toraise the relevant issues and promote the development of new approaches to capital adequacy asearly as possible.In discussing the challenges ahead, I should also note some recent accomplishments,particularly the work of the BIS Committee on Payments and Settlements Systems, of which I wasthe former chair, on reducing Herstatt risk in foreign exchange settlements. Previous work by theCommittee, embodied in a March 1996 report, recognized that settlement risk depends not only onthe payments system infrastructure, but also on the way market participants use this infrastructureand manage their internal processes. A follow-up report was issued one week ago that applauded theprogress made, while noting that there were further opportunities for private sector initiatives inreducing settlement risk. The central banks, of course, are ready to work closely with the privatesector in achieving this goal.Closing Preventing future banking crises poses difficult issues for policymakers. Given theindispensable role that banks play in a nation’s economic well-being, all governments have found itimportant that financial institutions be subject to regulation or oversight. It is important tounderstand from the start, however, that there are limits to the supervisory process. Supervisors havelimited ability, for example, to detect fraud. Most important, in a market-oriented banking system,bank directors and management must have the ability to set the bank’s overall course, to seek a
- 6 -BIS Review   64/1998reasonable profit, and to innovate and experiment with new banking activities and products. In otherwords, supervision can not be so heavy-handed as to stifle competition and innovation. As such, thesupervisory process has an inherent tension between the freedom banks need in order to earnreasonable profits and the latitude to take such large risks that their future could be endangered. Inseeking reforms to supervision and regulation in response to financial system crisis, we need toensure a proper balancing of these trade-offs. While I am broadly encouraged by the international policy responses to recentfinancial crises, I recognize fully that more work remains to be done. I look forward to taking upthese challenges in my new position on the Banking Supervision Committee, and to our continuedcooperation as we work together toward building a sounder international financial system.
BIS Review   63/1998Mr. Greenspan presents the US Federal Reserve’s mid-year report on monetarypolicy   Testimony by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System,Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the US Senate on21/7/98.Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I appreciate this opportunity to presentthe Federal Reserve’s mid-year report on monetary policy.Overall, the performance of the US economy continues to be impressive. Over the firstpart of the year, we experienced further gains in output and employment, subdued prices, and moderatelong-term interest rates. Important crosscurrents, however, have been impacting the economy. With labormarkets very tight and domestic final demand retaining considerable momentum, the risks of a pickup ininflation remain significant. But inventory investment, which was quite rapid late last year and early thisyear, appears to have slowed, perhaps appreciably. Moreover, the economic and financial troubles inAsian economies are now demonstrably restraining demands for US goods and services - and thosetroubles could intensify and spread further. Weighing these forces, the Federal Open Market Committeechose to keep the stance of policy unchanged over the first half of 1998. However, should pressures onlabor resources begin to show through more impressively in cost increases, policy action may need tocounter any associated tendency for prices to accelerate before it undermines this extraordinaryexpansion.Recent DevelopmentsWhen I appeared before your committee in February, I noted that a key question formonetary policy was whether the consequences of the turmoil in Asia would be sufficient to checkinflationary tendencies that might otherwise result from the strength of domestic spending and tighteninglabor markets. After the economy’s surge in 1996 and, especially, last year, resource utilization,particularly that of the labor force, had risen to a very high level. Although some signs pointed tostepped-up increases in productivity, the speed at which the demand for goods and services had beengrowing clearly exceeded the rate of expansion of the economy’s long-run potential to produce.Maintenance of such a pace would put even greater pressures on the economy’s resources, threateningthe balance and longevity of the expansion.However, it appeared likely that the difficulties being encountered by Asian economies,by cutting into US exports, would be a potentially important factor slowing the growth of aggregatedemand in the United States. But uncertainties about the timing and dimensions of that developmentwere considerable given the difficulties in assessing the extent of the problems in East Asia.In the event, the contraction of output and incomes in a number of Asian economies hasturned out to be more substantial than most had anticipated. Moreover, financial markets in Asia and inemerging market economies generally have remained unsettled, portending further difficult adjustments.The contraction in Asian economies, along with the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar over1997, prompted a sharp deterioration in the US balance of trade in the first quarter. Nonetheless, theAmerican economy proved to be unexpectedly robust in that period. The growth of real GDP not onlyfailed to slow, it climbed further, to about a 5½ percent annual rate in the first quarter, according to thecurrent national income accounts. Domestic private demand for goods and services - including personalconsumption expenditures, business investment, and residential expenditures - was exceptionally strong.Evidently, optimism about jobs, incomes, and profits, high and rising wealth-to-incomeratios, low financing costs, and falling prices for high-tech goods fed the appetites of households andbusinesses for consumer durables and capital equipment. In addition, inventory investment contributedsignificantly to growth in the first quarter; indeed, the growth of stocks of materials and goods outpacedthat of overall output by a wide margin during the first quarter, adding 1 percentage points to theannualized growth rate of GDP. Although accumulation of some products likely was unintended, surveys
- 2 -BIS Review   63/1998indicate that much of the stockbuilding probably reflected firms’ confidence in the prospects forcontinued growth.As evidence piled up that the economy continued to run hot during the winter, theFederal Reserve’s concerns about inflationary pressures mounted. Domestic demand clearly had moreunderlying momentum than we had anticipated, supported in part by financial conditions that were quiteaccommodative. Credit remained extremely easy for most borrowers to obtain; intermediate- andlong-term interest rates were at relatively low levels; equity prices soared higher, despite somedisappointing earnings reports; and growth in the monetary aggregates was rapid. Indeed, the crises inAsia, by lowering longer-term US interest rates - through stronger preferences for dollar investments andexpectations of slower growth ahead - and by reducing commodity prices, probably added to the positiveforces boosting domestic spending in the first half, especially in the interest-sensitive housing sector. Therobust expansion of demand tightened labor markets further, giving additional impetus to the upwardtrend in labor costs. Inflation was low - though, given the lags with which monetary policy affects theeconomy and prices, we had to be mainly concerned not with conditions at the moment but with thoselikely to prevail many months ahead. In these circumstances, the Federal Open Market Committeeelected in March to move to a state of heightened alert against inflation, but left the stance of policyunchanged.Although national income and product data for the second quarter have not yet beenpublished, growth of US output appears to have slowed sharply. The auto strike has brought GeneralMotor’s production essentially to a halt, probably reducing real GDP in the second quarter by about½ percentage point at an annual rate. The limited available information on inventory investment suggeststhat stockbuilding dropped markedly from its unsustainable pace of the first quarter. In addition to theslower pace of inventory building, Asian economies have continued to deteriorate, further retarding ourexports in recent months.Indeed, readings on the elements that make up the real GDP have led many analysts toanticipate a decline in that measure in the second quarter, after the first-quarter surge. Given theupcoming revisions to the national income accounts, such assessments would have to be regarded asconjectural. It is worth noting in any case that other indicators of output, including worker hours andmanufacturing production, show a somewhat steadier, though slowing, path over the first half of the year.And underlying trends in domestic final demand have remained strong, imparting impetus to thecontinuing economic expansion.During the first half of the year, measures of resource utilization diverged. Pressures onmanufacturing facilities appeared to be easing. Plant capacity was growing rapidly as a result of vigorousinvestment. And growth of industrial output was dropping off from its brisk pace of 1997, importantlyreflecting the deceleration in world demand for manufactured goods that resulted from the Asianeconomic difficulties.But labor markets, in contrast, became increasingly taut during the first half. Totalpayroll jobs rose about one-and-one-half million over the first six months of the year. The civilianunemployment rate dropped to a bit below 4½ percent in the second quarter, its lowest level in threedecades. Firms resorted to a variety of tactics to attract and retain workers, such as paying various typesof monetary bonuses and raising basic wage rates. But, at least through the first quarter, the effects of arising wage bill on production costs were moderated by strong gains in productivity.Indeed, inflation stayed remarkably damped during the first quarter. The consumer priceindex as well as broader measures of prices indicate that inflation moved down further, even as theeconomy strengthened. Although declining oil prices contributed to this development, pricing leverage inthe goods-producing sector more generally was held in check by reduced demand from Asia that, amongother things, has led to a softening of commodity prices, a strong dollar that has contributed to bargainprices on many imports, and rising industrial capacity. Service price inflation, less influenced by
- 3 -BIS Review   63/1998international events, has remained steady at about a 3 percent rate since before the beginning of thecrisis.Some elements in the goods price mix clearly were transitory. Indeed, the more recentprice data suggest that overall consumer price inflation moved up in the second quarter. But, even so, theincrease remained moderate.In any event, it would be a mistake for monetary policy makers to focus on any singleindex in gauging inflation pressures in the economy. Although much public attention is directed to theCPI, the Federal Reserve monitors a wide variety of aggregate price measures. Each is designed for aparticular purpose and has its own strengths and weaknesses. Price pressures appear especially absent insome of the measures in the national income accounts, which are available through the first quarter. Thechain-weight price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, for example,rose 1.5 percent over the year ending in the first quarter, considerably less than the 2.3 percent rise in thecore CPI over the same period. An even broader price measure, that for overall GDP, rose 1.4 percent.These indexes, while certainly subject to many of the measurement difficulties the Bureau of LaborStatistics has been grappling with in the CPI, have the advantages that their chain-weighting avoids someaspects of so-called substitution bias and that already published data can be revised to incorporate newinformation and measurement techniques. Taken together, while the various price indexes show somedifferences, the basic message is that inflation to date has remained low.Economic Fundamentals: The Virtuous CycleSo far this year, our economy has continued to enjoy a virtuous cycle. Evidence ofaccelerated productivity has been bolstering expectations of future corporate earnings, thereby fuelingstill further increases in equity values, and the improvements in productivity have been helping to reduceinflation. In the context of subdued price increases and generally supportive credit conditions, risingequity values have provided impetus to spending and, in turn, the expansion of output, employment, andproductivity-enhancing capital investment.The essential precondition for the emergence, and persistence, of this virtuous cycle isarguably the decline in the rate of inflation to near price stability. In recent years, continued low productprice inflation and expectations that it will persist have promoted stability in financial markets andfostered perceptions that the degree of risk in the financial outlook has been moving ever lower. Theseperceptions, in turn, have reduced the extra compensation that investors require for making loans to, ortaking ownership positions in, private firms. With risks in the domestic economy judged to be low, creditand equity capital have been readily available for many businesses, fostering strong investment. And lowmortgage interest rates have allowed many households to purchase homes and to refinance outstandingdebt. The reduction in debt servicing costs has contributed to an apparent stabilization of the financialstrains on the household sector that seemed to emerge a couple of years ago and has buoyed consumerdemand.To a considerable extent, investors seem to be expecting that low inflation and strongerproductivity growth will allow the extraordinary growth of profits to be extended into the distant future.Indeed, expectations of earnings growth over the longer term have been undergoing continual upwardrevision by security analysts since early 1995. These rising expectations have, in turn, driven stock pricessharply higher and credit spreads lower, perhaps in both cases to levels that will be difficult to sustainunless the virtuous cycle continues. In any event, primarily because of the rise in stock prices, about$12½ trillion has been added to the value of household assets since the end of 1994. Probably only a fewpercent of these largely unrealized capital gains have been transformed into the purchase of goods andservices in consumer markets. But that increment to spending, combined with the sharp increase inequipment investment, which has stemmed from the low cost of both equity and debt relative to expectedprofits on capital, has been instrumental in propelling the economy forward.
- 4 -BIS Review   63/1998The consequences for the American worker have been dramatic and, for the most part,highly favorable. A great many chronically underemployed people have been given the opportunity towork, and many others have been able to upgrade their skills as a result of work experience, extensiveincreases in on-the-job training, or increased enrollment in technical programs in community collegesand elsewhere. In addition, former welfare recipients appear to have been absorbed into the work force insignificant numbers.Government finances have been enhanced as well. Widespread improvement has beenevident in the financial positions of state and local governments. In the federal sector, the taxes paid onhuge realized capital gains and other incomes related to stock market advances, coupled with taxes onmarkedly higher corporate profits, have joined with restraint on spending to produce a unified budgetsurplus for the first time in nearly three decades. The important steps taken by the Congress and theAdministration to put federal finances on a sounder footing have added to national saving, relievingpressures on credit markets. The paydown of debt associated with the federal surplus has helped to holddown longer-term interest rates, which in turn has encouraged capital formation and reduced debtburdens. Maintaining this disciplined budget stance would be most helpful in supporting a continuationof our current robust economic performance in the years ahead.The fact that economic performance has strengthened as inflation subsided should nothave been surprising, given that risk premiums and economic disincentives to invest in productive capitaldiminish as the economy approaches price stability. But the extent to which strong growth and high laborforce utilization have been joined with low inflation over an extended period is, nevertheless,exceptional. So far, at least, the adverse wage-price interactions that played so central a role in pressuringinflation higher in many past business expansions - eventually bringing those expansions to an end - havenot played a significant role in the current expansion.For one thing, increases in hourly compensation have been slower to pick up than in mostother recent expansions, although, to be sure, wages have started to accelerate in the past couple of yearsas the labor market has become progressively tighter. In the first few years of the expansion, the subduedrate of rise in hourly compensation seemed to be, in part, a reflection of greater concerns among workersabout job security. We now seem to have moved beyond that phase of especially acute concern, thoughthe flux of technology may still be leaving many workers with fears of job skill obsolescence and awillingness to trade wage gains for job security. In the past couple of years, of course, workers have nothad to press especially hard for nominal pay gains to realize sizable increases in their real wages. Incontrast to the pattern that developed in several previous business expansions, when workers requiredsubstantial increases in pay just to cover increases in the cost of living, consumer prices have beengenerally well-behaved in the current expansion.A couple of years ago - almost at the same time that increases in total hourlycompensation began trending up in nominal terms - evidence of a long-awaited pickup in the growth oflabor productivity began to show through more strongly in the data; and this accelerated increase inoutput per hour has enabled firms to raise workers’ real wages while holding the line on price increases.Gains in productivity usually vary with the strength of the economy, and the favorable results that wehave observed during the past two years or so, when the economy has been growing more rapidly, almostcertainly overstate the degree of structural improvement. But evidence continues to mount that the trendof productivity has accelerated, even if the extent of that pickup is as yet unclear. Signs of majortechnological improvements are all around us, and the benefits are evident not only in high-techindustries but also in production processes that have long been part of our industrial economy.Those technological innovations and the rapidly declining cost of capital equipment thatembodies them in turn seem to be a major factor behind the recent enlarged gains in productivity.Evidently, plant managers who were involved in planning capital investments anticipated that asignificant increase in the real rates of return on facilities could be achieved by exploiting emerging newtechnologies. If that had been a mistake on their part, one would have expected capital investment to runup briefly and then start down again when the lower-than-anticipated rates of return developed. But we
- 5 -BIS Review   63/1998have instead seen sustained gains in investment, indicating that hoped-for rates of return apparently havebeen realized.Notwithstanding a reasonably optimistic interpretation of the recent productivitynumbers, it would not be prudent to assume that even strongly rising productivity, by itself, can ensure anon-inflationary future. Certainly wage increases, per se, are not inflationary, unless they exceedproductivity growth, thereby creating pressure for inflationary price increases that can eventuallyundermine economic growth and employment. Because the level of productivity is tied to an importantdegree to the stock of capital, which turns over only gradually, increases in the trend growth ofproductivity probably also occur rather gradually. By contrast, the potential for abrupt acceleration ofnominal hourly compensation is surely greater.As I have noted in previous appearances before Congress, economic growth at ratesexperienced on average over the past several years would eventually run into constraints as the reservoirof unemployed people available to work is drawn down. The annual increase in the working-agepopulation (from 16 to 64 years of age), including immigrants, has been approximately 1 percent a yearin recent years. Yet employment, measured by the count of persons who are working rather than by thecount of jobs, has been rising 2 percent a year since 1995, despite the acceleration in the growth ofoutput per hour. The gap between employment growth and population growth, amounting to about 1.1million persons a year on average since the end of 1995, has been made up, in part, by a decline in thenumber of individuals who are counted as unemployed - those persons who are actively seeking work - ofapproximately 650,000 a year, on average, over the past two and one-half years. The remainder of thegap has reflected a rise in labor force participation that can be traced largely to a decline of almost300,000 a year in the number of individuals (aged 16 to 64) wanting a job but not actively seeking one.Presumably, many of the persons who once were in this group have more recently become active andsuccessful job-seekers as the economy has strengthened, thereby preventing a still sharper drop in theofficial unemployment rate. In June, the number of persons aged 16 to 64 who wanted to work but whodid not have jobs was 10.6 million on a seasonally adjusted basis, roughly 6 percent of the working-agepopulation. Despite an uptick in joblessness in June, this percentage is only fractionally above the recordlow reached in May for these data, which can be calculated back to 1970.Nonetheless, a strong signal of inflation pressures building because of compensationincreases markedly in excess of productivity gains has not yet clearly emerged in this expansion. Amongnonfinancial corporations (our most recent source of data on consolidated income statements), trends incosts seem to have accelerated from their lows, but the rates of increase in both unit labor costs and totalunit costs are still quite low.Still, the gap between the growth in employment and that of the working-age populationwill inevitably close. What is crucial to sustaining this unprecedented period of prosperity is that it closereasonably promptly, given already stretched labor resources, and that labor markets find a balanceconsistent with sustained growth marked by compensation gains in line with productivity advances.Whether these adjustments will occur without monetary policy action remains an open question.Foreign DevelopmentsWhile the United States has been benefiting from a virtuous economic cycle, a number ofother economies unfortunately have been spiraling in quite the opposite direction. The United States,Canada, and Western Europe have been enjoying solid economic growth, with relatively low inflationand declining unemployment, but the economic performance in many developing and transition nationsand Japan has been deteriorating. How quickly the latter erosion is arrested and reversed will be a keyfactor in shaping US economic and financial trends in the period ahead. With all that is at stake, it wouldbe difficult to overstate how crucial it is that the authorities in the relevant economies promptlyimplement effective policies to correct the structural problems underlying recent weaknesses and topromote sustainable economic growth before patterns of reinforcing contraction become difficult tocontain.
- 6 -BIS Review   63/1998Conditions in Asia are of particular concern. Aggregate output of the Asian developingeconomies has plunged, with particularly steep declines in Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.Even the economies of the stalwart tigers - Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan - have softened.Economic growth in China has also slowed, owing largely to the currency depreciations among itsneighbors and the sharp declines in their demand for imports.Russia has also experienced some spillover from the Asian difficulties, but Russia’sproblems are mostly homegrown. Large fiscal deficits stem from high effective marginal tax rates thatencourage avoidance and do not raise adequate revenue. This and the recent declines in prices of oil andother commodities have rendered Russian financial markets and the ruble vulnerable, particularly in anenvironment of heightened concern about all emerging markets. The Russian government has recentlypromulgated a set of new policy measures in connection with an expanded IMF support package in aneffort to address these problems.In Latin America, conditions vary: Economies that are heavily dependent on exports ofoil and other commodities have suffered as prices of those items have fallen, and several countries in thatregion have received more intensive scrutiny in international capital markets, but, on the whole, LatinAmerican economies continue to perform reasonably well.Disappointingly, economic activity in Japan - a crucial engine of Asian economicgrowth - has turned down after a long period of subpar growth. Gross domestic product fell at a5¼ percent annual rate in the first quarter. More recently, confidence of households and businesses hascontinued to erode, the sharp contraction elsewhere in Asia has fed back onto Japan, and the dwindlingdomestic demand for goods and services in that country has been further constrained by a mountingcredit crunch. Nonperforming loans have risen sharply as real estate values fell following the bursting ofthe asset bubble in 1991. Problems in the banking sector, exacerbated by the broader Asian financialcrisis, have led to market concerns about the adequacy of the capital of many Japanese banks and haveengendered a premium in the market for Japanese banks’ borrowing. This resulting squeeze to profitmargins has led to a reluctance to lend in dollars or yen. In response to the weakening economy anddeteriorating banking situation, the Japanese yen has tended to weaken significantly, in often-volatilemarkets, against the dollar and major European currencies.As you know, we have sought to be helpful in the Japanese government’s efforts tostabilize their economy and financial system, reflecting our awareness of the important role that Japanesefinancial and economic performance plays in the world economy, including that of the United States. Wehave consulted with the relevant Japanese authorities on methods for resolving difficulties in theirbanking system and have urged them to take effective measures to stimulate their economy. I believe thatthe Japanese authorities recognize the urgency of the situation.That a number of foreign economies are currently experiencing difficulties is notsurprising. Although many had previously realized a substantial measure of success in developing theireconomies, a number had leaned heavily on command-type systems rather than relying primarily onmarket mechanisms. This characteristic has been evident not only in their industrial sectors but inbanking where government intervention is typically heavy, where long-standing personal and corporaterelationships are the predominant factor in financing arrangements, and where market-based creditassessments are the exception rather than the rule. Recent events confirm that these sorts of structures areill-suited to today’s dynamic global economy, in which national economies must be capable of adaptingflexibly and rapidly to changing conditions.Responses in countries currently experiencing difficulties have varied considerably.Some have reacted quickly and, in general terms, appropriately. But in others, a variety of politicalconsiderations appear to have militated against prompt and effective action.
- 7 -BIS Review   63/1998As a consequence, the risks of further adverse developments in these economies remainsubstantial. And given the pervasive interconnections of virtually all economies and financial systems inthe world today, the associated uncertainties for the United States and other developed economies remainsubstantial as well.In the current circumstances, we need to be aware that monetary policy tightening actionsin the United States could have outsized effects on very sensitive financial markets in Asia, adevelopment that could have substantial adverse repercussions on US financial markets and, over time,on our own economy. But while we must take account of such foreign interactions, we must be carefulthat our responses ultimately are consistent with a monetary policy aimed at optimal performance of theUS economy. Our objectives relate to domestic economic performance, and price stability and maximumsustainable economic growth here at home would best serve the long-run interests of troubled financialmarkets and economies abroad.The Economic OutlookThe Federal Open Market Committee believes that the conditions for continued growthwith low inflation are in place here in the United States. As I noted previously, an important issue forpolicy is how the imbalance of recent years between the demand for labor and the growth of theworking-age population is resolved. In that regard, we see a slowing of the growth in aggregate demandas a necessary element in the mix.At this time, some of the key factors that have supported strong final demand bydomestic purchasers remain favorable. Although real short-term interest rates have risen as the federalfunds rate has been held unchanged while inflation expectations have declined, the financial conditionsthat have fostered the strength in demand are still in place. With their incomes and wealth having been ona strong upward track, American consumers remain quite upbeat. For businesses, decreasing costs of andhigh rates of return on investment, as well as the scarcity of labor, could keep capital spending elevated.These factors suggest some risk that the labor market could get even tighter. And even if it does not,under prevailing tight labor markets increasingly confident workers might place gradually escalatingpressures on wages and costs, which would eventually feed through to prices.But a number of factors likely will serve to damp growth in aggregate demand, helping tofoster a reasonably smooth transition to a more sustainable rate of growth and reasonable balance inlabor markets. We have yet to see the full effects of the crisis in East Asia on US employment andincome. Residential and business fixed investment already have reached such high levels that furthergains approaching those experienced recently would imply very rapid growth of the stocks of housingand plant and equipment relative to income trends. Moreover, business investment will be damped ifrecent indications of a narrowing in domestic operating profit margins prompt a reassessment of theexpected rates of return on investment in plant and equipment. Reduced prospects for the return tocapital would not only affect investment directly but could also affect consumption if stock prices adjustto a less optimistic view of earnings prospects.Of course, the demand for labor that is consistent with a particular rate of output growthalso could be lowered if productivity growth were to increase more. And, on the supply side of the labormarket, faster growth of the labor force could emerge as the result of increased immigration or delayedretirements. Nonetheless, it appears most probable that the necessary slower absorption of labor intoemployment will reflect, in part, a deceleration of output growth, as a consequence of evolving marketforces. Failing that, firming actions on the part of the Federal Reserve may be necessary to ensure a trackof expansion that is capable of being sustained.Thus, members of the Board of Governors and presidents of the Federal Reserve Banksanticipate a slowing in the rate of economic growth. The central tendency of their forecasts is that realGDP will rise 3 to 3¼ percent over 1998 as a whole and 2 to 2½  percent in 1999. With the rise in thedemand for workers coming into line with that of the labor force, the unemployment rate is expected tochange little from its current level, finishing next year in the neighborhood of 4½ to 4¾ percent.
- 8 -BIS Review   63/1998Inflation performance will be affected by developments abroad as well as those here athome. The extent and pace of recovery of Asian economies currently experiencing a severe downturnwill have important implications for prices of energy and other commodities, the strength of the dollar,and competitive conditions on world product markets. Should the situation abroad remain unsettled,these factors would probably continue to contribute to good price performance in the United States in theperiod ahead. But it is important to recognize that the damping influence of these factors on inflation ismostly temporary. At some point, the dollar will stop rising, foreign demand will begin to recover, andoil and other commodity prices will stop falling and could even back up some. Indeed, a brisk snap-backin foreign economic activity, should that occur, would add, at least temporarily, to price pressures in theUnited States.On a more fundamental level, it is the balance of supply and demand in labor and productmarkets in the United States that will have the greatest effect on inflation rates here. As I notedpreviously, wage and benefit costs have been remarkably subdued in the current expansion. Nonetheless,an accelerating trend in wages has been apparent for some time.In addition, a gradual upward tilt in benefit costs has become evident of late. A variety offactors - including the strength of the economy and rising equity values, which have reduced the need forpayments into unemployment trust funds and pension plans, and the restructuring of the health caresector - have been working to keep benefit costs in check in this expansion. But, in the medical area atleast, the most recent developments suggest that the favorable trend may have run its course. The slowingof price increases for medical services seems to have come to a halt, at least for a time, and, with thecost-saving shift to managed care having been largely completed, the potential for businesses to achievefurther savings in that regard appears to be rather limited at this point. There have been a few strikinginstances this past year of employers boosting outlays for health benefits by substantial amounts.Given that compensation costs are likely to accelerate at least a little further, productivitytrends and profit margins will be key to determining price performance in the period ahead. Whether therecent strong performance of productivity can be extended remains to be seen. It does seem likely thatproductivity calculated for the entire economy using GDP data weakened in the second quarter. Thisdevelopment clearly owed, at least in some degree, to the deceleration of output in that period. Inmanufacturing, where our data are better measured, productivity appears still to have registered a solidincrease. We will be closely monitoring a variety of indicators to assess how productivity is performingin the months ahead.Monetary policymakers see the most likely outcome as modestly higher inflation rates inthe next one and one-half years. The central tendency of monetary policymakers’ CPI inflation forecastsis for an increase of 1¾ to 2 percent during 1998 and 2 to 2½  percent next year. As noted, the ebbing ofthe special factors reducing inflation over the past year or so, such as the decline in oil prices, willaccount for some of this uptick. But the Federal Open Market Committee will need to remain particularlyalert to the possibility that more fundamental imbalances are increasing inflationary pressures. TheCommittee would need to resist vigorously any tendency for an upward trend, which could becomeembedded in the inflationary process.The Committee recognizes that significant risks attend the outlook: One is that theimpending constraint from domestic labor markets could bind more abruptly than it has to date,intensifying inflation pressures. The other is the potential for further adverse developments abroad,which could reduce the demand for US goods and services more sharply than anticipated and whichwould thereby ease pressures on labor markets. While we expect that the situation will develop relativelysmoothly, the Committee believes that, given the current tightness in labor markets, the potential foraccelerating inflation is probably greater than the risk of protracted, excessive weakness in the economy.In any case, it will need to continue to monitor evolving circumstances closely, and adjust the stance ofmonetary policy as appropriate, in order to help establish conditions consistent with progress towards theFederal Reserve’s goals of price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.
- 9 -BIS Review   63/1998Ranges for Money and Credit GrowthIndeed, recognition of the benefits of low inflation and our commitment to the FederalReserve’s statutory objective of price stability were once again dominant in the Committee’s semiannualreview of the ranges for the monetary and debt aggregates. The FOMC noted that the behavior of themonetary aggregates had been somewhat more predictable over the past few years than it had beenearlier in the 1990s. The rapid growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of the year, which lifted thosemeasures above the upper ends of the target ranges established in February, was consistent with theunexpectedly strong advance in aggregate demand. However, movements in velocity remain difficult topredict.The FOMC will continue to interpret the monetary ranges as benchmarks for theachievement of price stability under conditions of historically normal velocity behavior. Consistent withthat interpretation, the Committee decided to retain the current ranges for the monetary aggregates for1998, as well as the range for debt, and to carry them over on a provisional basis to next year. Althoughnear-term prospects for velocity behavior are uncertain, the Committee recognizes that monetary growthdoes appear to provide some information about trends in the economy and inflation. Therefore, we willbe carefully evaluating the aggregates, relative both to forecasts and to their ranges, in the context ofother readings on other variables in our efforts to promote optimum macroeconomic conditions.Concluding CommentsAs I have stated in previous testimony, the recent economic performance, with itscombination of strong growth and low inflation, is as impressive as any I have witnessed in my nearhalf-century of daily observation of the American economy. Although the reasons for this developmentare complex, our success can be attributed in part to sound economic policy. The Congress and theAdministration have successfully balanced the budget and, indeed, achieved a near-term surplus, adevelopment that tends to boost national saving and investment. The Federal Reserve has pursuedmonetary conditions consistent with maximum sustainable long-run growth by seeking price stability.These policies have helped bring about a healthy macroeconomic environment for productivity-boostinginvestment and innovation, factors that have lifted living standards for most Americans. The task beforeus is to maintain disciplined economic policies and thereby contribute to maintaining and extending thesegains in the years ahead.
BIS Review   62/1998Mr. White discusses promoting international financial stability: the role of the BISPaper by Mr. William R. White, Economic Adviser and Head of the Monetary and EconomicDepartment, Bank for International Settlements, to be published in the forthcoming conference volume“Regulatory and supervisory challenges in a new era of global finance” from the Forum on Debt andDevelopment (FONDAD) to be held in August 1998.A.Why financial stability is importantIt is not surprising that central bankers worry about financial stability, even those centralbankers who do not have statutory responsibilities for banking supervision. Weak financial systems canhave long-lasting and insidious macroeconomic implications (the problem of “financial fragility”) thatare naturally of concern to central bankers. Moreover, sudden failures in financial institutions, financialmarkets or payment systems (the problem of “systemic crisis”) threaten contagion effects warranting theclose attention of central bankers given their traditional role as lender of last resort. The seeminglyceaseless string of financial crises through the 1980s and 1990s, in both industrial (e.g. Scandinavia andJapan) and emerging market economies (e.g. Mexico and South Asia), indicates that these are practicaland not theoretical concerns.One problem arising from financial fragility is that central banks will be tempted toforbearance in the conduct of monetary policy, with associated risks to price stability and an increasedlikelihood of asset price bubbles. Even if the monetary authorities do not choose to behave in thisfashion, market perceptions that they may be forced to do so may actually encourage speculative attackson currencies and eventually a process of self-fulfilling expectations.1 Conversely, attempting to pursuestabilising macroeconomic policies when the financial system is already fragile can lead to institutionalfailures, giving rise to both heavy costs for national Treasuries and important negative feedback effectson the real economy.2 These processes were seen in Sweden, Finland and Mexico and still more recentlyin a number of Asian countries. A stronger financial system would alleviate both macroeconomicproblems. In the same spirit, it should also be noted that unstable macroeconomic policies can alsocontribute to financial instability through asset price bubbles and other channels. In short, monetarystability and financial stability are two sides of the same coin and central bankers should be concernedabout both. This is perhaps the principal lesson to be learned from the financial crises we have witnessedaround the world in the past two decades.Sudden failures in financial markets or payment systems can also have far-reachingeffects. Major changes in the prices of financial assets, perhaps but not necessarily related to movementsin underlying fundamentals, could threaten the solvency of individual institutions. A recent example ofsuch phenomena was the impact of the sudden decline in the value of the Mexican peso and some Asiancurrencies on the creditworthiness of private borrowers and in turn their bankers. Such unexpecteddevelopments could also lead to exaggerated concerns about counterparty risk, with associated                                                     1Following the seminal article by Obstfeld (1986), the possibility of multiple equilibria has been noted increasinglyin the academic literature.2For a summary of the explicit fiscal costs of some recent crises, see Caprio and Klingebiel (1996).
- 2 -BIS Review   62/1998reductions in liquidity in other financial markets. The recent drying-up of trade credit in Indonesia andsome other Asian countries is an example of what might happen. Finally, technical failures in paymentsystems, which currently process many trillions of dollars daily in the Group of Ten countries alone,would threaten a massive payments gridlock whose effects could easily extend beyond the financialsphere into the real economy. The disruptive effects of such a development would obviously increase(and perhaps non-linearly) the longer the problem persisted.It is also the case in the modern world that financial instability is unlikely to remaincontained within national borders. All financial disruptions are likely to have an international dimensionbecause the three pillars of any financial system - financial institutions, financial markets, and paymentand settlement systems - are increasingly international. In the early 1980s, virtually every OECD countrylimited or even refused the right of establishment to foreign financial institutions. By 1995 thisdiscrimination had virtually disappeared in industrial countries and is being reviewed in many emergingmarkets.3 Cross-border transactions in bonds and equities in 1980 amounted to 10% of the GDP of theGroup of Seven countries (excluding the United Kingdom); by 1995 this had risen to 140%. Derivativeinstruments were essentially unknown in 1980; daily turnover (notional amounts) had risen to almostUS$ 1½ trillion by 1st April 1995 and one-half of these trades involved a non-domestic counterparty.4Finally, the fact that new information is now available instantaneously and almost costlessly around theglobe further increases the likelihood that shocks in individual countries will be propagated elsewhere,even when such contagion might not be warranted by underlying economic fundamentals.B.A strategy for promoting financial stabilityAny strategy for promoting global financial stability must begin by recognising two facts.First, the pace of change in modern financial markets is extraordinary, ongoing and irreversible. Second,financial transactions are becoming increasingly complicated and opaque and are involving an everwidening and changing cast of characters. The implication is that the “system” which policy-makers aimto stabilise is both difficult to define at any moment in time and rapidly changing.An important underlying force driving both developments is continuing improvements incomputing and telecommunications which have brought a sharp reduction in the costs of carrying outeven extremely complicated financial transactions. Deregulation, which implies a significant expansionin the importance of market forces, has also contributed materially to the process of change to date. Yet,in part at least, deregulation is a by-product of technological change which has made it far easier to avoidexisting regulations. For example, when Microsoft can be traded at a transactions cost of 2 cents a shareon the Internet, Japanese domestic regulations that enforce a cost of US$ 5 are simply unsustainable.                                                     3For a fuller treatment of international agreements designed to facilitate international financial transactions andcontribute to the health of the international financial system, see White (1997).4See Bank for International Settlements (1996a).
- 3 -BIS Review   62/1998Better and cheaper communications have also contributed materially to the breakdown ofsectoral and national distinctions in international financial markets, as well as to the growingparticipation of a whole host of new players. The importance of this last development should not beunderestimated since such new participants as pension funds, mutual funds and hedge funds are notlikely to behave like traditional banks, a possibility which creates new uncertainties about how theinternational financial system might react during periods of stress. The fact that emerging markets arealso far more important on the global stage than they were ten years ago, and that emerging financialmarkets have many idiosyncratic properties (often including a lack of transparency and of good corporategovernance), further complicates the task of formulating policies to ensure financial stability.5 Thiscombination of complexity and rapid change, allied with the increased integration of the internationalfinancial system, points, however, to four strategic implications.First, measures to strengthen the system must be comprehensive. There are no simpleanswers. This means that wide-ranging measures must be directed to promoting the good health of eachof the major components of the international financial system: financial institutions, financial marketsand payment and settlement systems. In each instance, the overriding objective must be the stability ofthe system as a whole; that is, policy-makers must seek to ensure that disturbances in one component ofthe system are not easily transmitted throughout the system because they can interact with some otherweakness elsewhere.The second strategic implication is that policy-makers and regulators must relyincreasingly on market-led processes to provide the discipline required to lead to prudent and stabilisingbehaviour. It seems to be a fact that regulators everywhere are having trouble keeping up with moderninvestment practices. Nor do they wish to respond with still stricter regulation of the traditional sort. Thiswould be very costly in terms of efficiency, would only invite more evasion, and would probably lead tomoral hazard problems and still greater dangers in the future. Rather, regulators are increasinglychoosing to rely on the judgements of market participants, who are likely to be more up to date withevolving practices. In turn, the market will allocate rewards and punishments as necessary, both toowners of firms and to their directors and managements. This will help improve internal governance andencourage appropriate behaviour.For market discipline to work effectively, regulators should put growing emphasis ondisclosure and increased transparency. Better information aids “good judgement” as well as minimisingthe risk of “bad judgement”; say the likelihood that creditors might mistakenly shun good counterparties.However, since firms are often hesitant to increase voluntary disclosure, an important role for the publicsector is to convince a small number of important and well-managed firms to start the process going.Other firms will then have little choice but to follow for fear of being accused of having something to                                                     5 See Goldstein and Turner (1996) and White (1996).
- 4 -BIS Review   62/1998hide. This strategy was recommended in a recent BIS document6 (the Fisher Report) on the disclosure ofderivatives transactions, and also underlies the strategy of the IMF in asking for better macroeconomicdata from emerging countries (SDDS) in the wake of the Mexican crisis.This approach might also be used to support efforts, recently undertaken by the G-10Deputies7 and the Basle Supervisors,8 to reduce the risk of financial instability in emerging markets. Herethe basic idea would be to build on the recently agreed set of international “Core Principles” governingthe behaviour of (say) banks and their supervisors. Subsequently, a set of quantitative indicators of thehealth of the financial system might be drawn up9 and applied in the first instance to countries whosefinancial systems were known to be in good condition. With time, the market (including rating agencies)might come to insist on similar information from other countries, which in turn would encouragepressures for desirable financial sector reforms. Recognising that the Core Principles were conceived ofas minimum standards, the “hurdle rates” sufficient for banking systems to be judged healthy might besignificantly higher in emerging than in industrial economies. Financial systems of many emergingmarkets are subject to relatively large macroeconomic shocks and to potential transitional problems inthe context of financial deregulation, and may be prone to greater swings of sentiment than in moredeveloped markets.10 All such considerations should be taken into account when setting minimumrequirements.The third strategic implication is that market discipline must be a  complement to, ratherthan a substitute for, the traditional activities of regulators and policy-makers. Publicly availableinformation may arrive too late or be of too poor quality to support adequate market discipline.Moreover, safety-net provisions may also alter the incentives of market agents to respond appropriatelyto the receipt of new information.11 Finally, it would be simply naive to assume that the markets willalways exercise discipline appropriately. Throughout history, there have been instances recorded ofexcessive price volatility in financial markets, “bubbles” and other misalignment of financial assetprices.12 Moreover, banks and other financial institutions, buoyed by waves of “excessive optimism” oreven “irrational exuberance”,13 have frequently lent large sums of money to borrowers who ultimatelyproved unable to pay. Recent events in a number of Asian countries would seem to provide furtherevidence of this particular kind of market failure, albeit along with a number of other importantshortcomings.                                                     6 See Euro-currency Standing Committee (1994b).7 See Group of Ten (1997).8See Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (1997a).9This follows along lines originally suggested by Goldstein (1997).10 See Goldstein and Turner (1996).11 In the recent Asian experience, a number of central banks failed to provide timely data about their ownexposure in forward markets and/or their commitments to support the foreign exchange requirements ofprivate sector entities. Safety-net considerations may have affected the willingness of local depositors to keeptheir assets with local banks and the willingness of foreign banks to lend to local banks.12 For an overview of such considerations, see Bank for International Settlements (1996b) and (1998a).13The former phrase was introduced by McKinnon and Huw (1996), the latter more famously by Alan Greenspan.
- 5 -BIS Review   62/1998It is particularly worth noting at the present moment that imprudent behaviour andexcessive risk-taking by financial institutions often follow periods of declining profits due either toderegulation, and the associated loss of monopoly rents, or bad investment decisions in the past.Examples of such phenomena can be found in the domestic behaviour of US banks in the 1980s14 and theexpansion of Asian loans by certain Japanese and European banks more recently.15 Given the strongcurrent trend towards financial deregulation in emerging markets, and the likely effects of similardevelopments in industrial countries (the “Big Bang” in Japan, the effective demise of Glass-Steagall inthe United States and the effects on European banks of the introduction of the euro16), regulatoryoversight will continue to have an important role to play for the foreseeable future. Indeed, it is plausibleto argue that the combination of these changing circumstances, allied with the spread of Internet andother technologies17(as well as important demographic changes18), could be ushering in an unprecedentedperiod of transformation in modern financial markets. If so, policy-makers will need all the instrumentsavailable to them if this process of change is not to prove disruptive.The role of policy overseers will, however, have to change to reflect this requiredcomplementarity between market discipline and regulatory oversight. Just as monetary policy in aderegulated financial system must be conducted “with the grain of the market”, regulatory oversight mustbe increasingly directed to improving market processes. In response, regulators have already begun tostrengthen the focus they put on the adequacy of internal control procedures. This applies both tofinancial firms and to firms providing infrastructure services in the international financial system.19There must too be a greater willingness to use market-developed (firm-specific) models for evaluatingrisk exposures of various sorts (market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk); this process too is also wellbegun. Regulators will also wish increasingly to set or suggest standards for external disclosure. Thiswill foster the use of market discipline in general and will facilitate the participation and contribution of                                                     14The losses associated with the debt crisis of the early 1980s were followed (if not necessarily caused) byvigorous expansion into LBOs, property loans and proprietary trading.15 At a CEPR conference in London on 4th-5th February 1998, David Folkerts-Landau of Deutsche MorganGrenfell stated that many European banks had responded to declining rates of return in European banking inthe early 1990s by “targeting middle-market Asia”. French banks have been repeatedly warned by the Bank ofFrance to cease making international loans at margins that are too low to cover all-in costs. Crédit Lyonnais isknown to be the French bank most significantly exposed to Asia.16See McCauley and White (1997).17 Technology allows both the unbundling and the rebundling (pooling) of risks. This contributes to thedevelopment of securities markets as opposed to the use of intermediated credit. Moreover, new technologicaldevelopments have supported the advancement of non-bank financial intermediaries at the expense of banks,and the advancement of specialist “non-banks” to the detriment of both. Finally, by making information cheaperto obtain publicly, technology directly attacks the insider information which is at the heart of relationshipbanking.18The broad implications of projected demographic trends in the OECD area has been the focus of recentOECD studies. See Roseveare et al. (1996). The G-10 Deputies currently have a Working Group looking intothe macroeconomic and international financial implications.19 In the realm of the governance of banks, see Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (1998b). With respect togovernance issues in the area of financial infrastructure, see Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems(1997c).
- 6 -BIS Review   62/1998rating agencies in particular. Finally, it is worth noting that as markets evolve, as they will certainlycontinue to do, the complementary nature of the relationship between the regulator and the markets willhave to continue to evolve as well.The fourth strategic implication is that regulation or guidance from policy-makers mustbe the by-product of international agreements among policy-makers from different countries. Given thereality of international competition, efforts must be made to establish a “level playing-field” forregulatory purposes. Participation in such agreements must also be widespread enough to avoid thedanger of regulatory competition (regulatory arbitrage) for non-participating countries. Finally, given therequired complementarity between regulatory and market discipline, the dialogue leading up tointernational agreements must somehow involve both public sector and private sector participants. TheBIS plays an important role in facilitating such an international dialogue.C.The role of the BIS in promoting financial stability1.The process of achieving agreementBefore turning to what the BIS does, it is perhaps useful to be clear about what it doesnot do. In particular, it does not normally use its own financial resources to promote or finance particularcourses of action by its members. In these respects, its mandate is completely different from that of otherinternational financial institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank and the regional development banks.Rather, since being founded in 1930, its unchanged mandate has been to promote internationalcooperation on monetary and financial issues, principally but not exclusively among central banks.Leaving aside the banking services provided by the BIS to central banks and international institutions(which have resulted in a balance sheet of about $130 billion), the BIS could be described as beingessentially a talking shop. However, this talk had led to many important decisions being taken withsignificant international implications. While the small BIS staff organises and facilitates meetings, andits research papers (both published and unpublished) help raise the analytic quality of the debate, thegreater value added is provided by the national representatives who attend meetings at the BIS andcontribute to international cooperation in other ways.International cooperation at the BIS is based firmly on the principle of national (state)control.20 This recognises the reality that sovereignty in the modern world still resides at the level of thenation state and that national legislatures (particularly those of larger countries) are often not willing tocede their power to international bodies. Moreover, this approach also helps alleviate concerns about theexistence of a “democratic deficit”; that is, the fear that important decisions might be made bytechnocrats rather than public servants directly accountable to nationally elected politicians. The depth ofsuch concerns is evident to anyone following the current debate about the introduction of the euro, the                                                     20 A fuller description and analysis of alternative processes for achieving international agreements can be found inKapstein (1992) and Kapstein (1994).
- 7 -BIS Review   62/1998desirability of the European Central Bank being politically accountable, and the future political structureof Europe. Yet such concerns are by no means confined to Europeans alone.Members of the various committees which meet at the BIS negotiate positions amongthemselves. Each clearly pursues national objectives and, in general, each has been in close contact withprivate sector agents in his or her own country to ascertain their views. The objective of the exercise is tofind a negotiated agreement which is mutually acceptable, across countries and to both public and privatesector agents, and which can then be ratified by Ministers and Governors and subsequently implementedusing national legislation or regulation. The fact that the size of committees is relatively small facilitatesthe decision-making process, as does the tradition of making decisions by consensus. The recognitionthat a failure to reach an international agreement would open the door to both unfair competition andregulatory arbitrage also drives the process forward.The fact that national legislators have been willing to accede to such a process, and thatprivate sector participants likely to be affected have also generally signed on, testifies to the moralauthority exercised by these international agreements and the perceived legitimacy of the process itself.Moreover, although the committees which meet at the BIS have generally drawn their members from theG-10 group of countries, many of the agreements reached (most notably, capital adequacy standards forinternationally active banks) have simply been accepted by non-G-10 countries as effective globalstandards. In this regard, the influence of private rating agencies has often played a useful supportingrole, as have the efforts made by the various committees to disseminate publicly their findings andagreements.21 Other international financial institutions, such as the IMF and World Bank, have alsoplayed a major role in communicating to a wide range of non-G-10 countries what might be thought of as“best practice” in the industrial world. It is also notable that this model, which leaves decision-makingfirmly in the hands of experts from nation states and relies on international organisations to spread theword, is the model recently recommended by the G-10 Deputies (in association with manyrepresentatives of emerging markets) in their recent report on financial stability in emerging marketeconomies.22These positive comments about the “Basle process” should not blind us either toshortcomings evident in the past or to some important challenges for the future. The most importantproblem in the past has been that, although difficulties were often identified at an early stage, itsometimes took a crisis of some sort to galvanise into action the process of finding a solution. By way ofexample, the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision was set up only after the failure of BankhausHerstatt in 1974, even though it had been recognised well in advance that banks with large internationaloperations posed special problems. It is also instructive that the question of “Herstatt risk” (i.e. the creditrisk arising from lack of simultaneity in the settlement of the two legs of foreign exchange transactions)                                                     21A full list of all recent publications by the BIS and the various committees which meet there can be found athttp://www.bis.org.22See Group of Ten (1997).
- 8 -BIS Review   62/1998was highlighted at the same time (1974) but the first significant attempt to address the problem was notmade until over twenty years later.23 Having registered this shortcoming, it is also true that, the variouscommittees meeting at the BIS also have become significantly more proactive in recent years. This willbecome evident below.As for future challenges to the current process, the first complication is the need toinvolve participants from emerging markets. Hong Kong and Singapore are already the fourth and fifthlargest foreign exchange markets in the world and other financial markets are expanding rapidlyelsewhere. The growing industrial might of countries like Korea, China, Brazil and others must also berecognised, even if recent events in Asia suggest that there can be setbacks along the way. If thecredibility of the decision-making process rests on the involvement of national experts from jurisdictionsmost affected by the decisions taken, then input from emerging markets will be increasingly important.The issue is how to reconcile such an expansion with the maintenance of the intimate club-likeatmosphere (also involving shared values and shared conceptual frameworks) that facilitate agreementand decision-making on the basis of consensus.A second important complication is the breaking-down of the barriers between differentmarkets and different kinds of financial institution. Not only are national regulatory frameworksgenerally based on such distinctions but so also are international committees. At the very least, thereneeds to be a channel for communication among such bodies as the Basle Committee on BankingSupervision, IOSCO and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. The recent decision inthe United Kingdom to consolidate all forms of financial supervision in the hands of a super-regulatormay presage a more radical solution to this problem, but one which raises still other complications. Inparticular, the decision to site this regulator outside the Bank of England, but to give the Bankresponsibility for overall systemic stability, raises the question of overlapping mandates for those twobodies. Again, there may be international implications if non-central banks come to play an increasinglyimportant role in the BIS process. Similarly, the introduction of the euro and the establishment of theEuropean Central Bank raises the question of future representation on the various BIS committees. Theanswer to this will presumably depend on the nature of the relationship which evolves between nationalsupervisors and the supranational European System of Central Banks.24A final challenge has to do with managing the balance of influence between public sectorand private sector representatives in the process. While in the past public sector participants generallymade proposals and the private sector responded, increasingly the opposite is true.25 This trend is,however, to be welcomed in that it is consistent with the concept that it is the private sector that shouldbe held primarily responsible for avoiding possible failures in private financial markets. The role of thepublic sector will increasingly be to ensure that such private initiatives are commensurate with the total                                                     23See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (1996b).24 For a discussion of such issues see McCauley and White (1997) and Centre for European Policy Studies (1998).25Consider the recent reports by the Group of Thirty (1997) and the Institute of International Finance (1997).
- 9 -BIS Review   62/1998costs (including externalities) of such failures. As noted above, however, it may well take many years forthis new balance to be struck.2.Specific measures to promote financial stabilityThe objective of this part of the paper is to record more specifically how variouscommittees meeting at the BIS contribute to implementing the strategy for financial stability describedabove. Before doing so, it seems worth reiterating that the likelihood of financial stability, both at thenational and the international level, will be significantly enhanced if governments follow stabilisingmacroeconomic policies. This objective is also firmly endorsed by the BIS, which indeed regularlyorganises a wide range of meetings directed to improving the conduct of monetary policy in participatingcountries. While these meetings have traditionally focused on events in the G-10 countries (regularmeetings in Basle of the G-10 Governors, the Gold and Foreign Exchange Committee, Economists,Model Builders and many others), an increasing number of meetings now focus on macroeconomicdevelopments in emerging markets as well.26 However, since macroeconomic stability is a necessary butcertainly not a sufficient condition for ensuring financial stability, the implication is that more specificmeasures to foster financial stability are still warranted and are indeed urgently required.In this regard, it was suggested above that the international financial system is based onthree pillars: financial institutions, financial markets, and payment and settlement systems. The analyticalmodel underlying this suggestion is that of a flow-of-funds matrix underpinned by the infrastructure(payment systems and other “plumbing”) required for it to function.27 Perhaps more by luck than design,there is a BIS committee dealing with each of these individual pillars: the Basle Committee on BankingSupervision (institutions), the Euro-currency Standing Committee (markets) and the Committee onPayment and Settlement Systems (infrastructure).28 Pursuing the analytical framework one step further, itis evident that disturbances at the level of institutions, markets or infrastructure will have implicationsfor market clearing conditions (interest rates, exchange rates, etc.) in the flow-of-funds matrix whichcould well have macroeconomic implications. While all three of the BIS committees recognise theseinteractions, and increasingly share information in consequence, it is the Euro-currency Standing                                                     26 The proceedings of some of these meetings and the papers prepared for them are now available in a newseries of BIS Policy Papers. See, for example, Bank  for International Settlements (1998b).27 See White (1994).28For the sake of completeness, it should also be noted that various other committees of national experts alsomeet regularly at the BIS and contribute in rather more technical ways to issues having implications forinternational financial stability. The Committee of Legal Experts has at various times considered the possibleundesirable implications of having different legal codes (in particular, bankruptcy procedures) governing financialtransactions in different countries, and the Committee has recently considered as well legal questionssurrounding the introduction of electronic money. Committees of security and computer experts meetregularly at the BIS and commonly exchange views on technical issues having systemic implications. One suchissue currently receiving attention is how the official community should itself respond to the “millennium bug”problem. This work complements the recent document (September 1997) issued by the Basle Supervisorsdirected to encouraging the private sector to address this problem in a serious way (see Basle Committee onBanking Supervision (1997b)). A global conference, jointly organised by the Basle Supervisors, IOSCO and theCommittee on Payment and Settlement Systems, took place at the BIS on 8th April 1998.
- 10 -BIS Review   62/1998Committee that has traditionally been most interested in the overall dynamics of these systemicprocesses.a.The Basle Committee on Banking SupervisionThe Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, whose traditional preoccupation has beenthe stability of banking institutions, is the best known of the committees which meet at the BIS. Set up in1974, the Committee first directed its attentions to ensuring that all internationally active banks wereadequately supervised on a consolidated basis. The first agreement of this sort was the BasleConcordat,29 which established the principle that no foreign banking establishment should escapesupervision, and that such supervision should be adequate. The Concordat has been revised a number oftimes in the light of changing circumstances and perceived shortcomings, but a key principle has beenmaintained throughout: the home or parent supervisor is responsible for the global operations of banksheadquartered in its territory and should supervise them on a consolidated basis.The Minimum Standards paper of 199230 was a further effort to put such principles intopractice. Four standards were laid out to ensure that home supervisors do practise effective supervision(if not, the host country can refuse a banking licence) and to ensure that the home supervisor hasadequate access to information about cross-border activities of its banks (if not, the home supervisor canrefuse to allow the business to continue). Nevertheless, members of the Basle Committee and othersupervisors continue to feel that the flow of information among themselves remains subject to legalimpediments. Accordingly, at the International Conference of Banking Supervisors in Stockholm in1996,31 delegates from over 150 countries endorsed a further report prepared by a joint working group ofthe Basle Committee and the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors. In this report 29 recommendationswere presented. These included suggested procedures for the conduct of cross-border inspections byhome authorities monitoring their own banks, and approaches for dealing with corporate structures whichcreate potential supervisory gaps. Ongoing problems include those posed by countries which still do notallow on-site inspection by home-country supervisors (Singapore and France, for example) and fears thatinformation sent to other supervisory agencies will find its way into the public domain under the laws ofthe recipient country (a particular concern in the United States). In both cases, changes to domesticlegislation are required which may prove difficult to achieve.A second preoccupation of the Committee has been to ensure that internationally activebanks maintain a level of capital commensurate with the risks they run. The Committee’s firstachievement in this area was the promulgation of the Basle Capital Accord,32 which was published in1988 and laid down minimum capital adequacy requirements based on relative levels of exposure to                                                     29 See Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (1975).30 See Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (1992).31 See Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (1996).32 See Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (1988).
- 11 -BIS Review   62/1998various forms of credit risk, both on and off balance sheet. While a number of issues remain to beresolved by the Committee, such as the treatment of short-term capital flows into emerging markets viadomestic banks, this hard-won agreement did succeed in both levelling the international playing-field andincreasing levels of bank capital after a long period of deterioration in most G-10 countries. BySeptember 1993, all G-10 banks with significant international operations were meeting or exceedingthese minimum requirements.This success clearly owed something to the legitimacy of the Basle process, but alsoreflected the fact that the Accord suggested a clear quantitative standard on which market participantscould focus and impose discipline. More recently, the complications posed by having differentaccounting conventions in different G-10 countries have received more attention and this problem is alsobeginning to look more capable of resolution. Ongoing discussions between the Accounting sub-group ofthe Basle Supervisors and the International Accounting Standards Committee are directed to resolvingsome of these problems. Success in this area would also provide international benchmarks to help guideand improve accounting standards in many emerging markets. Without such improvements in the basicnumbers, it is difficult to draw much comfort from banks in emerging markets claiming to have met theminimum capital adequacy requirements.The Basle Committee has recently made a further significant extension to its work in thearea of capital adequacy. Whereas credit risk initially figured centrally in the calculation of minimumcapital requirements, increased attention is being paid to market risk. Moreover, in its calculation ofexposure to market risk, the Committee is now prepared to use the results generated by firms’ owninternal models, subject to certain restrictions.33 This has been a significant step, among many others, inthe direction of regulators working more closely with the grain of the market. Yet new challenges in thearea of capital adequacy are also emerging. Credit derivatives are rather new instruments but arespreading rapidly, and they may have the potential to change dramatically the nature of financialintermediation. Consequently, the required form of regulatory oversight might eventually also have to bereviewed.A landmark extension of the work of the Basle Committee was mentioned briefly above.In October 1997, at the time of the IMF meetings in Hong Kong, the Committee released a new set ofCore Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, based in large part on their deliberations anddecisions taken over previous decades. These principles reflect the strategic considerations describedabove and constitute a significant development in at least four respects. First, they are  comprehensiveand cover all aspects of banking. Second, they provide a checklist of good practice for use bysupervisors, international financial institutions, rating agencies and other  market participants. Third,they were drawn up with the active participation of official representatives from emerging markets. And                                                     33 See Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (1995).
- 12 -BIS Review   62/1998finally, they apply to all banks and not just those that are internationally active. This is a majordevelopment, the significance of which may not yet have been adequately appreciated.The obvious remaining challenge is to ensure that these Core Principles are actuallyimplemented. The Committee intends to begin by asking supervisors around the world to endorse theCore Principles and this will be followed by a questionnaire to determine whether actual supervisorypractices are consistent with them. In cases of inconsistency, the intention would be to agree on a clearand definite timetable for change with a report on progress made being prepared for the nextInternational Conference of Banking Supervisors in October 1998. This implementation strategy willcomplement the broader efforts being made to implement the results of the recent G-10 Deputies’ studyon financial stability in emerging market economies.34 Broadly put, such implementation will demand animportant degree of political will in all countries concerned. Mustering such will, particularly in the faceof monopoly rents and the entrenched interests they support, will not be an easy task. Ways must also befound to evoke market discipline in ensuring that required changes are carried out.Reflecting the breakdown of sectoral barriers and the growth of international financialconglomerates, the Basle Committee has had increasing contacts with its international counterpartsrepresenting both the securities (IOSCO) and the insurance (IAIS) industries. Indeed, all three groupsnow meet regularly in the Joint Forum on Financial Conglomerates and joint documents are beginning toemerge.35 To facilitate such work, the IAIS Secretariat moved physically to Basle at the beginning of1998. However, it is a fact that progress in establishing a consolidated supervisory framework has beenslow, sometimes because of the difficulties of ensuring cooperation among different regulatory agenciesat the national level. Such concerns may have provided some of the motivation for the recent proposal bythe Group of Thirty (1997) that the relatively few, large international conglomerates should establish,promulgate and oversee their own industry standards, subject to review by a single international auditorwith the active cooperation of supervisory bodies. What remains to be determined is whether this wouldprovide an adequate degree of complementarity between market and regulatory discipline. An activedebate on this issue seems both needed and likely.b.The Euro-currency Standing CommitteeFinancial markets are the second major pillar of the international financial system.Analysing new developments in this area and the possible policy requirements arising from them hastraditionally been of interest to the Euro-currency Standing Committee. This Committee was originallyestablished to look into the expansion of international bank lending, and the LDC debt crisis was itsprincipal preoccupation for much of the early 1980s. To provide increased possibilities for the official                                                     34 The Secretariat of the G-10 Deputies has recently sent out a questionnaire to a wide range of national andinternational bodies to ascertain what each has done to support the strategy laid out in the original G-10 report.A report on progress to date and potential further steps will presumably be put forward to the G-10 Ministersand Governors.35 See Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (1998a).
- 13 -BIS Review   62/1998and private sectors to monitor risk in this area, the Committee gave the BIS a mandate to coordinate thecollection and dissemination of relevant international banking data from national (creditor) sources.Indeed, in recent years the international banking statistics have expanded in both content and geographicscope and further improvements are under way.36The BIS statistics on international bank lending have received particular attentionrecently in the light of the Asian crisis. This crisis is similar to the debt crisis of the early 1980s in thatbanks have been the principal international creditors.37 Moreover, the BIS is now also maintaining anextensive database on international securities markets and has dramatically expanded its coverage ofderivatives markets. In addition to the triennial survey conducted by central banks, about 75 majorfinancial institutions began, in June 1998, semi-annual reporting on their consolidated derivativesactivity. Analysis of recent data and associated regulatory developments in all these areas (banking,securities and derivatives markets) is presented in various BIS publications.38 While seeking to be neitheralarmist nor prescriptive, this analysis does also attempt to highlight points of strain in the internationalfinancial system. Examples going back to 1996 included comments on the heavy exposure of Thai andKorean banks to short-term foreign currency financing, and the sharp reduction in both credit and marketrisk premia associated with relatively risky investments worldwide. The fact that these concerns weregenerally ignored, as were the similarly muted warnings by other international financial institutions,seems worthy of further reflection.Over the last decade, the Committee has focused on the implications of financialinnovations - and in particular of the rapid growth of derivatives markets designed to facilitate thetransfer of market risk - for the functioning and stability of markets. While the general conclusionreached has been that derivatives enhance market efficiency,39 financial innovation has also brought withit a diminution of transparency in markets and made it more difficult for market participants to assess thecreditworthiness of individual counterparties. To help deal with these problems, the Committee (inassociation with the Basle Supervisors) has taken steps to encourage key market participants to improvetheir public disclosure practices, notably in the area of market and credit exposures, by drawing oninformation generated by their internal risk management systems. The semi-annual global statistics onderivatives markets, referred to above, should also help participants assess the significance of their ownpositions in these markets.40                                                     36 Data on loans made by banks will increasingly be available on an “ultimate risk” basis. That is, loans made to(say) a Brazilian bank in the United Kingdom will be classified as Brazilian and not UK exposure. The number ofreporting countries is also likely to expand to record loans by (say) Korean banks to (say) Russian borrowers.The timeliness of the statistics is also being addressed.37 In contrast, it differs in that sovereign borrowers were of primary importance in the early 1980s and today it isprimarily private borrowers in Asia.38In particular, see the quarterly “International banking and financial market developments” and the semi-annual“The maturity, sectoral and nationality distribution of international bank lending”.39 See Euro-currency Standing Committee (1986) and (1994a).40 See Euro-currency Standing Committee (1996).
- 14 -BIS Review   62/1998Since the financial world is always changing, new questions pertinent to the mandate ofthe Euro-currency Standing Committee are always arising. One set of issues has to do with theimplications for financial stability of structural changes in financial intermediation, notably a world inwhich non-bank financial entities and markets are coming to play increasingly prominent roles. A furthersource of concern is the resilience of liquidity in linked markets under stressful circumstances.41 Manymarkets are dominated at the wholesale level by a relatively small number of key players (albeit oftendifferent ones in different markets), and their interactions as they strive simultaneously to adjust tocommon shocks can be an important determinant of market outcomes. Although short-term financialmarket volatility seems to have decreased over the last decade or so, we have observed occasional boutsof price “gapping” as well as sudden reversals of longer-term price movements without any obviouseconomic rationale. The reasons for this, and the possible implications for the solvency of marketparticipants, need further assessment.c.The Committee on Payment and Settlement SystemsThe third pillar of the international financial system is the payment and settlementsystem. As the gross volume of financial transactions has expanded in recent years, the exposure ofindividual firms to possible non-payment by a counterparty has increased commensurately. Failing timelysettlement, they too might be unable to meet their obligations, raising the prospect of gridlocks ofpotentially significant proportions. In recent years, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systemshas made many concrete proposals as to how these systems might be strengthened. While the focus hasbeen on the timely settlement of large-value transfers, issues relating to retail payment systems(especially the implications of electronic money)42 have also begun to receive attention. Typically, theaction needed requires cooperation between the public and private sectors, but as far as possible theprivate sector has been encouraged to help itself.The work of the Committee has consistently emphasised the importance of large-valueinterbank funds transfer systems, for the obvious reason that banks continue to be at the core of theinternational financial system. One of the Committee’s first projects was a detailed analytic review ofpayment system developments in the G-10 countries, the results of which were published in 1985 in theform of a “Red Book” on payment systems. Since then, similar books have treated payment systems in anumber of other countries, both industrial and emerging, and Red Books are regularly revised in the lightof changing practice. As well, considerable efforts have been put into evaluating different kinds ofcross-border and multicurrency interbank netting schemes and various reports have laid down agreed (bythe G-10 central banks) minimum standards for such private sector systems.43                                                     41 For a recent discussion of market dynamics, market liquidity and the role of information in price determinationin stressful situations, see Euro-currency Standing Committee (1997).42 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (1996a).43 Among others, see Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (1990a), (1990b), (1993) and (1995).
- 15 -BIS Review   62/1998The Committee’s most recent work focusing on banks is a report on real-time grosssettlement (RTGS) systems.44 These systems, which are now in place in most G-10 countries along withmany others, protect against gridlock by ensuring final settlement of all transactions, transaction bytransaction in real time. The report not only provides an overview of key concepts and principal designfeatures but also describes the risks associated with such systems and some broader policy implications.It addresses the particular differences between systems already in place, the management of liquidity insuch systems, and the various procedures used to queue payment instructions. The report is the first of itskind and is likely to prove particularly useful to both emerging and industrial countries still in theprocess of modernising their settlement systems.In recent years, the Committee has extended its interest beyond banks to settlementsystems for securities and foreign exchange, and clearing arrangements for exchange-traded derivatives.In all cases, the nominal values of the daily transactions are very large. Various reports on arrangementsto support securities transactions have been published since 1992, with the latest effort focusing on adisclosure framework for system operators that will allow participants in such arrangements to betterevaluate the risks they are running.45 As for exposure to settlement risk in foreign exchange markets, theCommittee has established that settlement exposures are much larger than had previously been thought.In a report published last year,46 they also indicated ways in which participants could reduce such risksand strongly suggested they do so to avoid a punitive response from public sector authorities. Regardingclearing arrangements for exchange-traded derivative instruments, the Committee published a report inMarch 199747 which systematically reviewed such arrangements, identified weaknesses and maderecommendations for remedying them. As with many other Committee reports, it contains a great deal offactual and comparative information not available elsewhere.Finally, the Committee recognises that issues having to do with the use of collateral tomanage risk, and with the operational reliability of the infrastructure (e.g. business continuity planning,especially with regard to IT services), are also germane to a well-functioning payment system. So too aremany legal issues, such as the enforceability of netting agreements and the complications likely to arisefrom the absence of an international agreement on bankruptcy procedures for internationally activefinancial institutions. The bottom line is that the task of ensuring timely settlement in all circumstancesremains incomplete and the Committee’s agenda is still full.d.Global participation in the work of the committeesFinally, the increasing efforts made by the various committees to involve non-G-10countries in their work deserves to be emphasised. The Core Principles were drawn up with the closecooperation of non-G-10 supervisors, and the “Report on cross-border banking” was prepared jointly                                                     44 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (1997a).45 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (1997c).46 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (1996b).47 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (1997b).
- 16 -BIS Review   62/1998with the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors. Regional supervisory groups meet regularly withrepresentatives of the Basle Committee in attendance, and there has been a significant increase insupervisory training by G-10 supervisors in association with the Secretariat of the Basle Committee.Finally, the Committee has recently initiated joint meetings with regional supervisors on the occasion ofits quarterly meetings in Basle. All of these efforts are directed to building a truly global network ofsupervisors and the wide dissemination of documents, standards and guidelines developed by theCommittee in association with others. Similar initiatives have recently been undertaken by theCommittee on Payment and Settlement Systems with similar objectives in mind. The Euro-currencyStanding Committee had, for many years, “extended” meetings involving representatives of importantnon-G-10 financial centres. However, it is now actively engaged in discussing how broader participationmight be made more effective.D.The role of the BIS in crisis managementIt has been analytically convenient above to deal separately with the three majorcomponents of the international financial system and the BIS committees which support each. Thisapproach also emphasises the comprehensive reach of the Committees’ concerns. However, a deficiencyof this approach is that it fails to emphasise the relationships between the various components of thesystem, as well as the further links to macroeconomic variables of interest to central bankers. In fact, it isthe complex reality of these interrelationships that makes the pursuit of financial stability such achallenging task and also accounts for the fact that there have been so many financial crises along theway.Before turning to the role of the BIS in crisis management, it is important to note that,even at the domestic level, a certain “constructive ambiguity” often applies about the potential role of thepublic sector. This is to avoid bad behaviour and moral hazard on the part of the private sector. Giventhat no two crises are the same, the amount of pre-planning that can be done is in any event limited.Perhaps the most that can be hoped is that the prospective players in the unfolding drama - the centralbank, the Treasury, supervisory bodies and deposit insurance agencies - know each other well and havewell-established lines of communications, so that decisions affecting all can be speedily agreed upon. Ata moment of crisis, the time allowed for decision-making is not likely to be great. Moreover, as we haveseen in South Asia, the failure of domestic policy-makers to take credible policy actions quickly(particularly if these policies have been prescribed in the context of an IMF programme) can result in themarket imposing heavy penalties.The provision of international support to help resolve financial crises with internationalramifications should be equally ambiguous if moral hazard is to be avoided.48 In any event, liquidity                                                     48 A new but unwelcome form of ambiguity has emerged in the context of the Asian crisis. The short-termliquidity requirements of a number of countries have been so great as to call into question whether the Fundhad adequate resources to restore confidence on the part of private creditors. For example, as of July 1996 the
- 17 -BIS Review   62/1998support from the International Monetary Fund to sovereign borrowers must continue to be firmly linkedto conditionality and the adjustment of domestic policies. Moreover, support should be provided in sucha way as to insure that all the parties whose behaviour contributed to the crisis (both debtors andimprudent creditors) pay some part of the costs. As for liquidity support to internationally active banks,the G-10 Governors have agreed that such support should be provided in the first instance by the home-country authorities. However, this decision still leaves unclear whether the home authorities will beprepared to do so. The willingness of the Bank of England to allow Baring Brothers to fail is a welcomeindicator of this ambiguity. What is also unclear is the extent to which other national authorities mightact to support the home authorities in different circumstances. The 1996 agreement between the FederalReserve and the Bank of Japan, under which the Bank of Japan could obtain dollar funds through repoarrangements, gives some indication of the possibilities in this regard.Given the scope, increasingly wide participation and regularity of the meetings whichtake place in Basle, the BIS makes an important contribution to international financial stability byensuring that policy-makers (at least central banks and other regulators) know each other well and haveopen lines of communication. This is the institution’s most important contribution to crisis management,although not its only one. The international community (in particular the central banks of the G-10countries) have often found it appropriate to provide bridge loans through the BIS to countries infinancial difficulties which are awaiting the receipt of funds from the IMF, the World Bank or other suchbodies. Such bridge loans often provide needed liquidity, are an indication of international support forthe policy changes normally associated with Fund programmes, and ensure a continuing central bankinvolvement in the process of crisis management. While this role might be thought less important in thefuture, given that the Fund can now disburse much more rapidly than before thanks to the newEmergency Financing Mechanism, some possibilities still remain open. For example, in view of itsexpertise with arranging bridge loans, the BIS might be asked to help draw up multilateral legalagreements to ensure equal and fair treatment of sovereign creditors should loans go bad. Attempts to usebilateral agreements to secure a “second line of defence” in support of the IMF programme for Korea inrecent months have become extremely complicated and are not yet complete.For completeness, it should be noted that the BIS, in addition to providing support forbridge loan facilities, is also prepared to act as a principal and to lend funds on both a collateralised andan uncollateralised basis. Needless to say, the sums available in this fashion must be strictly limited byconcerns about prudent behaviour and the continuing good financial health of the BIS itself.Nevertheless, there have been occasions when even the relatively small loans made by the BIS may havebeen useful in stopping small problems from potentially turning into much bigger ones.E.Conclusions                                                                                                                                                                          short-term debt (less than one year to maturity) owed by Korean debtors to international banks amounted toalmost $70 billion. See Bank for International Settlements (1998c). Private bankers did finally agree to establish aprocess for rolling over this debt. However, to the extent that this was not purely voluntary, the differencebetween this procedure and a debt rescheduling is moot.
- 18 -BIS Review   62/1998As the process of liberalisation and globalisation proceeds, markets increasingly replacethe dictates of governments and regulators. This is perhaps even more true with respect to financialmarkets than in other areas of economic activity. As a corollary, the influence of those governmentbodies which work closely with markets tends to be enhanced. In part, this may explain the perceptionthat both the domestic and the international profile of central bankers has risen in recent decades.Without delving too far into bureaucratic theories of institutional behaviour, the desire to expand theirinfluence may be a further reason explaining why both central bankers and other regulators areincreasingly relying on market processes to achieve their objectives. The role and reputation of the BIShas been similarly enhanced in that international cooperation among central banks and other regulators inlarge part takes place in that forum.49Another change affecting the work of the BIS in recent years has been the growingemphasis being put by governments on issues having to do with financial stability as opposed to pricestability and traditional macroeconomic preoccupations. It is of some note that the last four G-7 SummitCommuniqués (Halifax, Lyon, Denver and Birmingham) put strong emphasis on such issues while hardlymentioning international macroeconomic policy coordination. It is also notable that, at the semi-annualmeetings of the G-10 Governors and Ministers, the General Manager of the BIS has in recent yearsreported regularly on work being undertaken at the BIS in this area. This is not to say that traditionalmacroeconomic concerns have somehow become less important.

BIS Review   60/1998Mr. Ferguson gives his views on exercising caution and vigilance in monetarypolicy in the United States   Remarks by Mr. Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., a member of the Board ofGovernors of the US Federal Reserve System, on the occasion of the Distinguished Speaker Series,held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on 9/7/98.IntroductionThese are fascinating times for monetary policy. As we progress through theeighth year of the current economic expansion, economic growth has continued at a robust pacewith unemployment reaching a 28-year low, while inflation has remained remarkably subdued.To be sure, not all recent developments have been altogether positive, especially considering thecurrent situation in Asia. Nonetheless, the performance of the American economy in recent yearshas exceeded expectations in a rather extraordinary fashion.But recent developments have challenged our understanding of the workings ofthe macroeconomy. Although the recent surprises of both low unemployment and well-behavedinflation have been quite favorable, they have been surprises nonetheless and not easilyreconcilable with each other based on old relationships and our earlier assessment of theeconomy’s potential.These developments have increased the uncertainty about the economic outlookand about the appropriate response of monetary policy in general to new developments. I want totake this opportunity to discuss some implications of this increased uncertainty for the conduct ofmonetary policy.Before starting, let me remind you that these views are personal and do notnecessarily reflect the views of other members of the FOMC or the Board of Governors.Objectives and Strategy for Monetary PolicyTo evaluate the proper strategy for monetary policy, we must first understand theFederal Reserve’s policy objectives and then recognize the parameters within which policyoperates in attaining these objectives.The long-run goal of monetary policy is straightforward. The Federal Reserve Actmandates that we promote price stability and maximum employment. Sometimes this dualobjective is misunderstood, with the misconception that these inflation and employment goalscannot be attained simultaneously -- that there is a tradeoff in the long run between one and theother. It is worthwhile repeating what I am sure all of you already understand well: the long-rungoals of price stability and maximum employment are not mutually exclusive. Not so long ago,mainstream macroeconomists thought that employment and growth were by and largeindependent of inflation in the long run. But the evidence accumulating in the 1990s seems tosuggest that low inflation contributes to real economic performance in ways not fully appreciatedbefore. If anything, our approach to price stability, by reducing uncertainty and making long-runsavings and investment decisions easier, seems to have enhanced the growth of productivity, realGDP, and employment.This indirect benefit, of course, reinforces the price stability goal. It is the rate ofinflation that monetary policy determines in the long run, and this means that price stability in astraightforward way is elevated to the status of the primary long-run goal of monetary policy.
- 2 -BIS Review   60/1998Where a tradeoff can appear, and this I think is the source of occasional confusion,is over shorter periods. In the shorter run, inflation may rise and fall depending on where theeconomy is operating relative to its potential. When the economy has become overextended, withoutput exceeding the economy’s potential, employment beyond sustainable norms, andproduction surpassing normal capacity limits, then prices have tended to increase at an everfaster rate. Likewise, when aggregate demand has fallen short of the economy’s potential,inflation has tended to fall.And this is where the short-run setting of monetary policy comes into play. Bymoving short-term interest rates, monetary policy can affect other financial conditions and endup exerting a substantial influence on aggregate demand. Decisions by businesses aboutinvestment and by households about housing and consumption are altered by changes in interestrates and other credit conditions. Monetary policy also can indirectly impinge upon othercomponents of aggregate demand. As a result, in the shorter run, monetary policy can play animportant role in stabilizing the economy from undesired fluctuations in economic activity andinflation. The strategy for monetary policy geared towards these shorter-run concerns can bebriefly described. It is to restrict monetary conditions when the economy seems on the way tobecoming overheated and inflation is threatening and ease monetary conditions when signs ofweakness in demand appear on the horizon. But it is important that we pursue these short-rungoals keeping in mind our primary long-run goal of price stability.Of course, other forces besides the state of the economy relative to its potentialcan influence inflation in the short run. Even prior to the anomalous experience of recent years,which I will discuss later in detail, supply shocks, such as a sudden hike in oil prices, havedramatically affected inflation. Such forces can also cause short-term fluctuations in the economythat are, at least in part, beyond the control of monetary policy. However, active stabilizationpolicy may still have a role to play as a buffer, helping the economy to absorb such disturbancesin the short run, while counteracting any persistent deviations from price stability.But monetary policy operates with a long lag, with a policy change exhibitingmaterial effects on the economy (excluding the immediate impact on financial markets) onlyseveral quarters after its implementation. By some estimates it may be almost a year before thebrunt of the effect of an interest rate change is felt on aggregate demand, although the influenceappears sooner in some sectors of the economy than in others. And it may generally take longerstill for a policy change to alter the course of inflation.Consequently, active stabilization policy is most successful when it ispre-emptive, responding to early warning signals or forecasts of unfavorable developments onthe inflation and employment fronts. In this regard, by identifying past regularities inrelationships among economic variables and understanding their conceptual underpinnings, wecan use the most recent economic data to update forecasts of where the economy is headed.Based on these forecasts we can then take steps to adjust the stance of monetary policy asnecessary, in accordance with our objectives.
- 3 -BIS Review   60/1998Uncertainties: Old and newTo be useful for monetary policy, forecasts of the future health of the economyneed to be reasonably reliable. Good forecasts rest on theories about empirical regularities thatcan be confidently relied upon to provide guidance.Regrettably, accepted theories are found lacking at times, empirical models breakdown, and forecasts based on them prove unusually inaccurate. If monetary policy were naivelyto follow guidelines based on past regularities that are increasingly failing to reflect new realities,it would unintentionally introduce undesirable gyrations in the economy. Thus, heighteneduncertainties regarding the workings of the economy pose an additional source of stress in policydesign.To ascertain the appropriate framework for policy analysis we must first be awareof some key sources of uncertainty. In recent years, traditional views of the economy perhapshave been most challenged by the phenomenon of declining inflation despite increasing tightnessin labor markets as evidenced by reductions in the unemployment rate to its lowest level inalmost three decades. Many believe that there is an unemployment rate, the non-acceleratinginflation rate of unemployment (the “NAIRU”), that would be consistent with a stable inflationrate, once other short-run influences on inflation dissipate. To these economists, inflationarypressures tend to increase when unemployment remains below the NAIRU and tend to decreasewhen unemployment stays above the NAIRU. For many years proponents of this viewconsidered 6 percent a reasonable estimate of the NAIRU. Since 1995, however, theunemployment rate has been below this level, and substantially below of late, while inflation hascontinued to progress toward our price-stability objective. In response, over the past few years,many observers have revised their estimates of the NAIRU down by half a percentage point ormore. Yet considerable uncertainty remains about the confidence with which the new estimatescan be relied upon for evaluating inflationary pressures.The NAIRU never was measured with precision; statistical inference has alwaysprovided a distribution of likely values around a point estimate. And several factors, for instancethe demographic composition of the labor force, have long been known to introduce systematicvariation in its value over time. Nonetheless, the uncertainties about how structural forces maybe changing the NAIRU seem unusually large at present and cannot be ignored. And for somethe present uncertainties have called into further question the basic usefulness of the concept, orat least of a point estimate held with any confidence.A related uncertainty concerns the underlying trend growth of labor productivity.Until fairly recently, this trend had seemed to have been about constant since the mid 1970s. Butthere are many that believe that a pickup may have occurred in the last few years, and a fasterproductivity trend would help to explain the unexpectedly favorable economicgrowth-unemployment-inflation nexus in recent years. Unfortunately, much as with the NAIRU,our understanding of the forces that drive the productivity trend is less than perfect. Certainly, theinvestment boom of the current expansion has raised the amount of capital for each worker andcontributed to an increase in labor productivity, and it may be that advancing technology ismaking the capital stock and workforce more productive. However, some of the recent pickup inproductivity is the normal response to the faster output growth of late, so the degree to whichthere is a new higher trend remains an open question.
- 4 -BIS Review   60/1998Another difficulty in assessing the current amount of slack in the economy, and athird uncertainty, concerns the divergent patterns in alternative measures of excess demand.Capacity utilization in manufacturing and the rate of unemployment have historically movedtogether over the cycle. Unexpectedly, they have diverged in the current expansion, in part as thesurge in investment has kept capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector near its historicaverage while labor markets have become tighter and tighter.Recent developments in South-East Asia also have contributed to uncertaintyabout the current monetary policy environment. One place where the effect of the crisis is beingfelt is in the prices of primary commodities. Since such commodities are traded on worldmarkets, lower demand from Asia is reflected in lower prices world-wide, which benefit USproducers that use commodities as inputs. This development serves as a short-run boost, apositive supply shock, to the US economy, one that also helps contain inflationary pressures, asdoes the more general decline in import prices as the US dollar appreciates.But the Asian crisis can be expected to continue to have an adverse impact ontrade-sensitive industries. Some evidence of a deterioration of our trade balance with the region’seconomies has already appeared. With little historical guidance to draw from, however,considerable uncertainty prevails regarding the extent to which the present Asian situation maycontribute to slower US growth as well as the timing of such a slowdown. For instance, despiteexpectations that the crisis would have contributed to a slowdown in economic activity earlierthis year, the economy’s growth in the first quarter of this year exceeded even the remarkableperformance of 1997. However, more recent data reflecting developments in the second quarter,including survey information, do give some evidence of a slowing in the overall economy,especially the manufacturing sector, perhaps due to Asian financial turmoil. As you mightsuspect, we will continue to watch incoming data quite closely as the year progresses to get abetter handle on this situation.To be sure, uncertainties such as these have loomed large at times in the past, andwe can learn much from those experiences. The uncertainties faced by policymakers during the1970s about the economy’s potential provide an enlightening perspective on the presentsituation.Following a period of rapid productivity gains during the 1950s and 1960s, theeconomy’s performance during the 1970s appeared out of line with previous experience. Startingin 1973, in particular, inflation rose more than expected, at times considerably’so, whileeconomic growth tended to disappoint expectations for a number of years. At first, it appearedreasonable to assume that the observed productivity’slowdown was temporary. Reflecting thisassumption, for instance, the Council of Economic Advisors gave a 4 percent estimate ofpotential output growth in the 1974 Economic Report of the President, as would have beenconsistent with the earlier trends.Increased uncertainty regarding this estimate was evident in the 1975 and 1976Reports, but not until 1977 was the point estimate of potential output growth revised downward,to 3.6 percent. As the economy’s performance continued to disappoint, further downwardrevisions followed, to 3 percent in 1979 and to 2.5 percent to close the decade in 1980. Onlyseveral years after the fact was a trend break in productivity recognized as likely to have occurredin 1973. And even today our understanding of the forces contributing to the slowdown is notentirely satisfactory.
- 5 -BIS Review   60/1998As inflation accelerated as the 1970s continued, critics blamed the FederalReserve’s operating procedures for placing too little weight on money growth and too much oninterest rates in the conduct of policy. In response, the Federal Reserve in late 1979 put addedemphasis on monetary growth targets. But the FOMC abandoned the strict regime of targetingM1 through reserve quantities in 1982 once evidence accumulated that the character of M1demand had been altered by the spread of interest-bearing NOW accounts. Later, the break in thebehavior of M2 velocity during the early 1990s from its earlier historical pattern undercut theindicator properties of that aggregate as well. In 1993, the FOMC de-emphasized the role of thebroader aggregates in policymaking. Despite recent tentative signs that the relationship betweenM2 velocity and the cost of holding M2 assets may be returning to its earlier historical norms,uncertainty persists regarding the continued stability of this relationship.In terms of the performance of inflation and unemployment, the experience of thepast few years has not been unlike a mirror image of the 1970s. While the consequences are a lotmore pleasant, unexpectedly low inflation and unemployment do raise some complicated issuesfor monetary policy.Strategy in Uncertain Times: Caution and VigilanceThis account of the sources of uncertainty that we face in designing the propercourse of monetary policy should not leave the impression that our task is so daunting that thepolicy waters are unnavigable. But such an account does serve a valuable purpose in remindingus that in designing policy we should recognize our ignorance as well as trust our knowledge.For instance, we need to recognize the difficulties of inferring the true structure ofthe economy by interpreting incoming data. How do we know whether unexpected developmentsare just temporary moves away from stable longer-run relationships or are manifestations ofchanges in the underlying economic structure? In many cases this judgment is difficult to makewith much confidence until considerably after the fact. In the meantime, we must bear in mindthat the statistical relationships we work with are only loose approximations of underlyingreality, which is constantly evolving, at least to some extent, in response to changes intechnology, consumer preferences, and government policies. Our vision is always obstructed bysome haze. But sometimes the picture is clearer than at other times.Because of these difficulties in assessing the situation, a balanced judgment isrequired in evaluating whether historical regularities are indeed changing significantly and arenot just subject to temporary aberrations. I believe that one should guard against holding to oldtruths that may no longer be valid, but one should also be cautious about declaring thatpermanent changes have occurred, for there are too many examples of proclaimed “new eras”that did not in fact come to pass. Erroneously dismissing the continued validity of old truthscould result in bad policy just as easily as failing to correctly recognize new realities whenchange occurs.What should be done when uncertainties seem particularly acute? When wesuspect that our understanding of the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated appreciably,as evidenced by strings of surprises difficult to reconcile with our earlier beliefs, I think that theappropriate response is to rely less upon the future predicted by the increasingly unreliable oldgauges and more upon inferences from the more recent past, weighing incoming data moreheavily relative to more distant data in trying to discern the new environment.
- 6 -BIS Review   60/1998Even for those of us who take this more pragmatic approach, there are challenges.Recent data, on which our understanding of the new reality is based, are subject to revision asmore reliable or more complete sources become available. Moreover, there are often severalindices for measuring underlying economic circumstances, requiring one to consider variousmeasures simultaneously.In the current context, the considerable uncertainty regarding our previousestimates of the capacity of the economy and its sustainable rate of growth in my judgmentsuggest the need to downplay forecasts of inflation based on those earlier assessments. Bynecessity, I believe heightened reliance needs to be placed on more recent observations ofinflation and costs for inferring future inflationary pressures. We are not precluded from actingpre-emptively if new information were to tip the balance of risks in the outlook toward higherinflation, but are naturally a little more cautious in acting on forecasts as long as substantialuncertainty persists.As a consequence, the lead times for pre-emptive action are likely to be shorter.And, in my judgment, we may have to rely more on measures other than apparent excess demandto get reliable indications of pending changes in inflationary pressures. For instance, unit laborcosts may have to be watched especially closely, and the rate of unemployment perhaps lessclosely than we are used to. But a pattern of unsustainable growth characterized by acontinuously declining unemployment rate still may increasingly suggest greater inflation risk.Even if the limits of the economy’s growth potential have moved, there are still limits that needto be respected.The increased uncertainty also implies that continued strong economic growthwith low inflation is not outside the realm of possibility, and by adopting a cautious policyposture we may learn more clearly if that possibility is likely or remote. It should be clear that thecreation of new jobs, by itself, is a welcomed development. There are benefits to all from theskill building that occurs on the job. It is important, however, that these jobs be the result ofsustainable growth, and not the result of excesses and imbalances.However, caution can be excessive, running the risk that inflation may in factreappear and require a more wrenching readjustment than if it had been anticipated. Uncertaintyshould not induce paralysis. We need to be willing to move, even if cautiously, knowing that wemay have to reverse our action if subsequent developments differ from our expectations.Moreover, we must be willing to act forcefully if information suggesting a threat to our goal ofprice stability becomes available. Inflation is an insidious tax on all of our citizens, perhapsimpacting low and moderate-income citizens more than others because there are fewer waysavailable to them to protect their income and their assets against an erosion of purchasing power.If evidence of an incipient rise in inflation were to appear, decisive action would provide acounterweight to minimize the building of a temporary inflationary aberration into inflationexpectations, which could be disruptive. And this is why caution and vigilance go hand in handunder these circumstances of increased uncertainty.Moreover, it is at uncertain times such as these that the wisdom underlying theinstitutional structure of the FOMC becomes most apparent. A committee with broadrepresentation can bring a variety of perspectives and analyses to bear on difficult economicproblems. In addition, the real-time reports the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks bringfrom their districts are especially valuable in the decision-making process at times like thesebecause they afford a contemporaneous sense of what is going on in the economy. Such diversity
- 7 -BIS Review   60/1998of information sources becomes particularly useful when our earlier assessment of the economy’spotential has been drawn into question by surprises, even pleasant ones.ConclusionA string of favorable surprises yielding strong growth, high employment and lowinflation is by far the most pleasant environment under which to come to the realization that ourunderstanding of the workings of our complex economy is not infallible. A sound economy withsubdued inflation makes dealing with the greater uncertainty much easier indeed!The Federal Reserve has an important trust to help safeguard the health of theUnited States economy. What we should do in the face of some uncertainty is to act cautiouslywhile remaining vigilant, to take measured steps when necessary, and to adjust to the occasionalunforeseen change. In this way we will raise the odds of achieving our goals of stable prices andmaximum employment, not only providing benefits to Americans, but also a stable anchor for avolatile world economy.
BIS Review   59/1998Mr. Wellink looks at the United Kingdom and EMU   Speech by the President of theNederlandsche Bank, Dr A.H.E.M. Wellink, at the meeting of the Nederlandse City Lunches in Londonon 16/6/98.IntroductionBritain has a love-hate relationship with Europe. Love, because the UK, too, favours apowerful Europe generating peace and free trade relations worldwide. At the same time, however, Britainhas always been in two minds about its own role, opposed as it is to a federal Europe, where nationalsovereignty is curbed. It is not for nothing that Churchill did not envisage his own country as part of aunited Europe at that time.The relationship between the United Kingdom and Europe is complicated further by theexistence of a third party: the United States. The United States sometimes seems a more attractivepartner. It is always easier, in a relationship, be it between states or between husband and wife, to operatewith someone from one’s own background, in this case Anglo-Saxon, than with a partner from a totallydifferent culture.All told, however, the British seem to be favouring Europe. Newt Gingrich, theChairman of the US House of Representatives, is wrong. He has said that Britain would do better to jointhe North American Free Trade Association than to take up with EMU; but what is the point of that?After all, both economically and politically, the UK has much stronger ties with Europe. Tony Blair isevidencing a greater sense of reality when he holds that his country’s future lies in the heart of Europe.The question is, however: is he talking about the next few years or about the distant future?The British are hesitant about European integration, as they have always been. The UKonly joined the EC in 1973, when they were sure of its success. A similar process would seem to betaking place where EMU is concerned. At first, the UK was eager to be in on the process, completelyliberalizing its capital movements, but it subsequently demanded an opt-out clause so as not to be forcedto take further action. Such an approach is risky. There is always the chance than when jumping onto amoving train, one ends up between the train and the platform. A few years ago, no one was able toforesee that on 1 January 1999 EMU would be setting off with eleven out of the fifteen Member States.Now the UK is the only large Member State which is not joining the monetary union. Today I will bemaking out a case for the UK’s participation in EMU, and I will discuss a policy which may make iteasier for it to join EMU.The desirability of British membershipI can be brief about the advantages for Europe of the British taking part in EMU.Obviously, the union is strengthened by the participation of a country accounting for 16% of the EU’sGDP. It would mean a larger zone of exchange rate stability, a larger market, and better chances of theeuro becoming an international currency. In these respects, British membership of EMU is just asimportant as that of, let us say, France. Because EMU is built around French-German cooperation, and itis hence also about politics, it has been suggested that France’s membership is a must. But the UK, too,has a contribution of its own to make to EMU. After all, the UK has the City, the financial centre ofEurope. It would be peculiar, to say the least, if the leading financial centre of an economic power suchas the EU were to lie outside the euro zone. Another issue of at least the same importance is theconsiderable contribution which Britain can make to the policy discussions about greater labour andproduct market flexibility. The reduction of the working week in France and Italy to 35 hours, on theconditions now envisaged, indicates that continental Europe could do with some counterweight on thispoint.Let me say something about what entry into EMU would mean for the United Kingdomitself. In principle, the British Government is in favour of joining EMU. In October 1997, Gordon Brown
- 2 -BIS Review   59/1998said in the House of Commons: “If, in the end, a single currency is successful, and the economic case isclear and unambiguous, then the Government believes Britain should be part of it”.The UK could benefit materially from joining EMU. Exchange rate stability, greatercomparability of prices, and larger money and capital markets offer the British economy additionalopportunities for growth. It must furthermore be remembered that even if the UK does not join, it will befeeling the impact of EMU. Geographically, the UK may be an island, but it is not economically. Somuch is evidenced by the degree to which the British economy is affected by the exchange ratemovements of sterling. That influence being as great as it is, then surely it is better to be seated at thetable where the policy affecting your economy is determined. That means joining EMU. After all, so longas the UK remains outside EMU, it will not be permitted to take part in the euro-X group, where theeconomic policies of the euro area are coordinated by the Ministers of Finance.The City, too, stands to benefit substantially from Britain’s participation, because it willbecome part of deeper and more liquid financial markets. Obviously, the City’s position as Europe’sfinancial centre is not yet in peril. As my colleague, Eddie George, neatly pointed out, the number ofpeople working in the financial sector and affiliated industries in Greater London equals the populationof Frankfurt: 600,000. But the City is not impregnable. Take, for instance, Liffe, which lost its leadingposition in the trade in futures of German central government bonds, the most important contract inEuropean government bonds, to the Deutsche Terminbörse in Frankfurt within only a short period oftime. If the UK were to remain outside EMU for a long time to come, some City activities could well begradually shifted to financial centres on the continent.Policy-making for membershipFrom whatever angle you look at it, the UK would do well to enter into EMU. Fromwhere we stand, EMU is incomplete without the United Kingdom. The question is not so much whetherthe UK should join, as when. Research by the Treasury shows it is too early. Of the five economic testsdeveloped by the Treasury, the crucial one assesses whether the British business cycle is sufficiently inline with that in other European countries and is not marked by major outliers, the question beingwhether the single monetary policy actually fits in with the UK’s economic policy. At present, theinterest rate set by the Bank of England is double the monetary policy rate in the core countries of thefuture euro zone, viz. 7.5% against 3.3%. This is in line with Britain’s cyclical conditions. At this stage,considerable reduction of this short-term interest rate would be at odds with the British inflation target ofat most 2.5%. But apart from the question whether this is an economically favourable time to join, thereare institutional impediments to the UK’s immediate membership as well. For one thing, the Britishpopulation have to voice their approval in a referendum and, for another, the UK still needs to meet theexchange rate criterion for joining the monetary union.Let us take a closer look at these obstacles. First of all, the British Government will haveto convince the people of the importance of membership. This will be possible if the advantages arepresented in a convincing way, since the idea of joining monetary union is no longer an unfamiliar one.But the exchange rate criterion, which applies for countries in search of EMU membership, is another,more complex and more formal, matter. Countries wishing to join EMU on 1 January 1999 are requiredto have taken part in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System for the last twoyears, without the fluctuation margins being exceeded. Countries joining at a later stage are basicallysubject to the same rules. But the exchange rate mechanism which will take effect as from1 January 1999 differs from that currently in force. In my opinion, ERM2 will replace ERM1. Butlegally, it is not that simple, and my view is not shared by everyone. For the time being, the UK is notmaking any moves to join the new exchange rate mechanism. I understand the UK’s reluctance to joinERM2, considering its unfortunate experience with ERM1. Although the UK only joined ERM1 in 1990,it was already forced to leave in 1992. Naturally they feel that the experience does not bear repetition.But the circumstances prevailing at that time, viz. an excessively high entry rate for sterling and, moreimportantly, a macroeconomic policy which did not fully support the exchange rate objective, are in noway comparable to those in evidence in the UK and Europe today.
- 3 -BIS Review   59/1998Now let us take a look at Britain’s cyclical conditions and economic policy. Theexchange rate movements of sterling largely reflect the cyclical divergences between the UK and theEuropean continents. I already noted, it is crucial to British participation in EMU that, in the longer term,its economic development does not diverge substantially from those in Europe. The UK’s economy hasalways been subject to greater turbulence, and its business cycle is invariably ahead of those on themainland. But the cyclical outliers seem to be decreasing. It is gratifying to note that the political stop-gocycle of interest rate policy has made way for a monetary policy aimed at keeping inflation under control.The Government’s economic policy is now also directed at putting a stop to the well-known Britishpattern of stop-go, boom-bust. Gordon Brown’s first budget had a moderating effect on the exuberantcyclical conditions. Right now, the first signs of a cyclical slowdown are showing up. Hopefully, they donot portend a bust for the British economy. But we will have to wait and see.Like the business cycles of countries such as the Netherlands and Germany, that ofBritain will never run exactly parallel to the European average. This is the consequence of conducting asingle monetary policy in an area as large as the euro zone. The differences among the countries willhave to be addressed through their budgets, within the confines of the Stability Pact, and especially byflexible labour and product markets. In these respects, the UK is streets ahead of the other major EUcountries, and is therefore well placed for EMU.ConclusionLadies and gentlemen, I have come to the end of my speech. All things considered, theprospects are good for the UK making a successful entry into EMU somewhere in the first few years ofthe 21st century. The British Government’s commitment to membership of EMU, and their refusal toadopt a wait-and-see attitude can be regarded advantageous. In the meantime, the British should have asay in matters. They are a full-fledged member of the EU, and have been in on the process towards EMUthroughout. Outsiders should not become outcasts. From the Dutch perspective in particular, it isdesirable that the UK should put its mark on the shape of the European economy and EMU, also duringthe run-up to its participation. Britain can play an important role in boosting the flexibility of theEuropean labour and product markets. Such a role is needed to stimulate the European economy, and tooffer Europe’s 18 million unemployed the prospect of a new job. To quote Helmut Kohl: “To cooperateas closely as possible with Britain ‘in building Europe’, Europe needs the United Kingdom, and viceversa. The European Union needs, above all, that unique British blend of realism and traditionalism,pragmatism and idealism, level-headedness and love of freedom”. With which I could not agree more.*       *       *NB   This BIS Review is available on the BIS World Wide Web site (http://www.bis.org)._____________________________
BIS Review   58/1998Mr. Brash points out some positive aspects of New Zealand’s situation in theworld economy   Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Dr. DonaldBrash, to the Construction Liaison Group in Wellington on 26/6/98.IntroductionOver recent months, there has been a great deal of negative economic news. Incountries as diverse as Italy and Japan, GDP data for the March quarter have been releasedsuggesting economic activity is slowing down. Growth in industrial production in the 14countries which we monitor most closely in preparing our own economic forecasts was projectedto be just 0.1 per cent in 1998 in the June Consensus Forecasts, a significant fall from theincrease of 3.8 per cent expected last November, and even a fall from the 1.0 per cent increaseexpected as recently as last month. Financial markets have been extremely turbulent, withparticularly volatile trading in the foreign exchange market and some equity markets. Where isthe world economy going, and how will New Zealand be affected?It is always risky being too definitive in answer to questions of this kind, becausein reality nobody can know the answers with any confidence. But it is particularly dangerous togive answers at this time. If one suggests that the world economy is in for a very rough ride, andNew Zealand with it, one is accused of undermining confidence and making the situation worse.If one points out some of the positive aspects of New Zealand’s situation, one is accused of beinghopelessly unrealistic.Today I will try to be totally realistic. You may not agree with me, but I will notgild the lily.The implications of the situation in Asia are serious for New ZealandIn our December 1997 Monetary Policy Statement, we estimated that growth inour trading partners would average 1 per cent less than otherwise over 1998/99 due to the eventsin Asia, and in releasing that document I commented that the most obvious risk to our economicprojection was that the difficulties in Asia would turn out to be even more serious than weassumed at that time.In the intervening six months, the situation has indeed become markedly worse.Whereas in November 1997, the Consensus Forecasts projected Japan’s industrial production togrow by 1.6 per cent in 1998, the comparable estimate in June 1998 is minus 4.0 per cent.Whereas in November 1997, the Consensus Forecasts projected Korea’s industrial production togrow by 8.2 percent in 1998, the comparable estimate in June 1998 is minus 7.8 per cent.Whereas in November 1997, the Consensus Forecasts projected Indonesia’s industrial productionto grow by 6.9 per cent in 1998, the comparable estimate in June 1998 is minus 13.3 per cent.Japan’s banking system is under severe strain, and this is hampering the recovery of thateconomy. The same is true in many of the other countries of Asia. A number - potentially a largenumber - of banks will fail unless the governments of the countries concerned are willing andable to support them. Even those countries which have strong banking systems, such as HongKong and Singapore, face very sharp slowdowns in economic activity and possibly recession in1998. So the economic situation in Asia has deteriorated significantly in recent months and couldget much worse yet.
- 2 -BIS Review   58/1998With the exception of Japan, Korea and Australia, New Zealand has a biggerexposure to Asian markets than does any other OECD country. In 1997, some 36 per cent of ourtotal exports went to the countries of East Asia. In that year, Japan was our second largest exportmarket, and Korea our fifth largest market. Of our 10 largest export markets, six were in the EastAsian area last year, or seven if Australia is included. And Australia itself has a huge exposure tothe markets of Asia, which means that we have a further indirect exposure to those marketsthrough that country, now easily our largest single market. Of the tourists who visited NewZealand in 1997, over 30 per cent came from East Asia.This substantial involvement in the markets of Asia has been of great benefit toNew Zealand in the past, and will be of great benefit to us in the future. But right now, their painis also our headache. In the three months to April, for example, our exports to Korea were down48 per cent compared with the same three months in 1997, while exports to Indonesia were down69 per cent. Some commodity exports, such as logs and deer velvet, have been particularly hardhit. This has had a severe impact on some industries and some regions.Moreover, there are other risks. If the Japanese economy moves deeper intorecession, and the Japanese yen resumes its fall, there could be further downward pressure onother currencies in the region, as well as political pressures to build protectionist barriers aroundother markets. Or, because of Asian difficulties or for some other reason, the US equity marketcould turn down sharply, triggering an abrupt slowdown in the United States economy. As I saidin releasing our May Monetary Policy Statement, it is not at all difficult to envisagecircumstances where the New Zealand economy grows more slowly than projected. Indeed, it ispossible to imagine scenarios where the world economy at least is quite weak. The externalenvironment is not good, and could get markedly worse.To complicate matters still further, New Zealand enters this period of internationalturbulence with a balance of payments deficit exceeding 7 per cent of GDP, and a negative netinternational investment position (overseas assets less liabilities to foreigners) of some 80 percent of GDP, both high figures by international standards.But we have many strengthsSo we face serious challenges. But having established that I am fully aware of thatfact, allow me also to note some of the advantages we have in dealing with those challenges.First, while a little over one-third of our exports go to East Asia, almost two-thirdsdo not. And many of those other markets continue to grow strongly at this stage. In the threemonths to April, New Zealand’s exports increased by nearly 30 per cent to the United States (ourthird largest market) as compared with the same three months in 1997, while those to Belgiumand Italy increased by more than 50 per cent. Even exports to some parts of East Asia increasedduring that period - to Hong Kong by 29 per cent and to Singapore by 27 per cent. While touristarrivals from Korea in the month of May were down 89 per cent as compared with the yearearlier level, and from Thailand by 64 per cent, overall visitor numbers were down only 7 percent as a result of increases in tourists from the US, Britain and Australia. Our exporters andtourist operators are showing considerable ability to switch from weak markets to more buoyantmarkets.The decline in the New Zealand dollar against the currencies of the United Statesand Europe has greatly helped in this re-orientation of our markets.
- 3 -BIS Review   58/1998Secondly, we go into this period of international turbulence without the grosslyover-inflated asset prices which have been such a serious problem in many of the countries ofAsia, and which were such a serious problem in Japan in the late eighties and early nineties. It isthe pricking of these asset price bubbles which has often done so much damage to bankingsectors and, as a consequence, to the real economies of the countries affected. Yes, I have attimes lamented the high prices paid for both houses and rural land in New Zealand. I remainconvinced that some of these prices reflected unrealistic expectations of future income growth.But the extent to which these prices got out of line with long-term trends was relatively minorcompared with the inflation in asset prices in some of the countries of Asia. We are quiteunlikely to see the 60 to 80 per cent fall in such prices which have been common elsewhere inthe Asian region. And we have not (in the last few years) seen ‘price bubbles’ in eithercommercial property or equities.Of course, in part, the absence of significant asset price bubbles in New Zealand isa direct result of the fact that monetary policy here was leaning hard against inflationarypressures throughout the middle part of the decade. While that attracted a great deal of criticismat the time, it now means that we don’t face the painful adjustments which inevitably followwhen asset price bubbles burst.Thirdly, and related in part to the substantial absence of asset price bubbles, wehave a banking sector which is arguably as strong and as competitive as at any time in NewZealand’s history. This is in marked contrast to the situation in all of the troubled countries ofAsia. Indeed, the troubled countries of Asia are in an important sense defined as those where thebanking sectors are in serious trouble.Fourthly, we go into this period of turbulence with a ratio of net public sector debtto GDP of only some 25 per cent, less than half the level as recently as 1992. This ratio is one ofthe lowest in the OECD. While the Government does owe some of this debt to foreigners, theforeign currency component of the public sector debt is exactly matched by foreign currencyassets, so that the Crown has no net foreign currency debt at all. As everybody knows,Government has been running fiscal surpluses for the last five financial years, and is budgeting tocontinue doing so for the next three years. This clearly gives the country considerably more roomto manoeuvre than if we were already running substantial fiscal deficits.And perhaps most important of all, New Zealand has a floating exchange rateregime, and has had since March 1985. This has two hugely important implications. First itmeans that the value of the New Zealand dollar adjusts day by day and month by month assupply and demand change. This in turn means that, if there is a perception that New Zealand isin a difficult period, for whatever reason, the New Zealand dollar tends to fall in value (and viceversa). This tends to offset some of the impact of a weaker international environment. And this isprecisely what has happened over the last year or so, with the New Zealand dollar down from itspeak by some 28 per cent against the US dollar and by 17 per cent against the Trade-WeightedIndex (TWI). As a result, though the average world price of the commodities that New Zealandexporters sell declined by 10.8 per cent over the last year, the New Zealand price of those exportsactually rose by 9.3 per cent over the same period.Furthermore, having a floating exchange rate regime - one where everybodyunderstands that neither the Government nor the central bank will interfere in the foreignexchange market to prop up the value of the dollar - strongly discourages banks and corporates
- 4 -BIS Review   58/1998from taking on unhedged foreign exchange liabilities. This means that when the New Zealanddollar moves substantially, as it has done over the last year or so, neither banks nor corporatesincur the huge losses which have been commonplace in countries which have been forced toabandon fixed exchange rate regimes.1 To the best of my knowledge, there has been nothingwhich could be called a foreign exchange crisis in any country with a floating exchange rateregime since 1945.In a recent editorial, the Christchurch Press suggested that ‘New Zealand is a childout in the economic storm this week - out in the storm without a hat or coat and with gumbootsleaking’.2 Certainly, the weather is getting rough, and may get rougher. But in my own view, wehave good wet-weather gear and a sturdy four-wheel-drive vehicle.Should policies be changed?Are there things which Government should be doing to further assist the countryweather the storm? Clearly, one of the issues being focused on currently is the desirability ofGovernment’s cutting back on some of its planned increase in expenditure because of the riskthat, with slower economic growth a possibility, the projected operating surplus may turn into adeficit.To the economist, cutting government expenditure in a growth slowdown seemscounter-intuitive. Better, surely, to allow the ‘automatic stabilisers’ to work, with theGovernment’s operating position moving into a small deficit when the economy is in the troughof the cycle and into a surplus at the peak. Moreover, there is quite a strong case for allowinglonger-term considerations to determine fiscal decisions, in the light of considered judgementsabout the appropriate size of the public sector in the context of Government’s economic andsocial objectives.On the other hand, it must be acknowledged that the Government’s determinationto run fiscal surpluses throughout the cycle, and to achieve further reductions in net public sectordebt, has been one of the important reasons why foreign investors have been willing to financeNew Zealanders’ insatiable appetite for borrowing in recent years. Should there be noGovernment fiscal response to the present situation, and should a fiscal deficit subsequentlyemerge, the confidence of foreign investors could be somewhat undermined - with resultantupward pressure on interest rates and downward pressure on the exchange rate.                                                     1 Last week, the Government Statistician announced that the gross overseas debt of New Zealand banks andcorporates had risen by $20.1 billion during the year to 31 March 1998, to reach a total of $79.0 billion.  Ofthis increase, it was stated that $6.2 billion was on account of the increase in the New Zealand dollar valueof foreign currency debt. It was also noted, however, that the figures took no account of ‘hedging or otherfinancial derivatives used by companies to offset potential foreign currency risk.’  The significance of thisnote has almost certainly been missed by many commentators, because it is quite clear that all banks, and Isuspect most corporates, hedge their foreign-currency denominated liabilities in full or in substantial part.Certainly at 31 March 1998, the four largest banks, which have been heavy borrowers of foreign funds inrecent years, carried almost no foreign exchange risk on that borrowing.  This means that the increase in theNew Zealand dollar equivalent of the gross overseas liabilities of the banking system as a result of thedepreciation in the New Zealand dollar, included in the debt figures published by the GovernmentStatistician, will have been almost exactly matched by gains on the banks’ currency hedges.2The Press, 23 June 1998.
- 5 -BIS Review   58/1998Moreover, in recent years it has been possible to argue that New Zealand’sbalance of payments deficit has been a result of investment exceeding saving in the privatesector; the public sector was more than funding its own investment activities through itsoperating surplus. In 1998/99, the budgeted operating surplus looks likely to be broadly similarto public sector investment. If the operating surplus turns out to be less than now budgeted,perhaps because economic growth turns out to be slower than projected, it is possible that publicsector investment will exceed the operating surplus. In other words, if the operating surplus turnsout to be less than now budgeted, the public sector will be contributing to the balance ofpayments deficit in 1998/99 for the first time in several years.If Government were to cut back on its own spending, this would further dampendemand in the domestic (non-tradeable) part of the economy. This would in turn permit somefurther easing in monetary conditions without putting price stability at risk, leading to strongerinvestment in export and import-competing sectors of the economy. The economic benefit wouldbe faster reduction in the balance of payments deficit. The economic cost would be slowergrowth in the domestic (non-tradeable) part of the economy.To the best of my knowledge, all commentators project a gradual reduction in thebalance of payments deficit over the next few years on present policy. My own hunch is that thedeficit will in fact reduce somewhat more quickly than any of the official projections (includingthat of the Reserve Bank) now suggest, as a result of the substantial fall in the real exchange rateover the last 12 months and a decline in imports which may follow an increase in householdsector saving, in turn a result of a decline in house prices. It is already evident that growth inbank lending to the household sector has slowed markedly in recent months. Offsetting that, ofcourse, is the risk of further reductions in export volumes as a result of the prolonged drought,and the weakness in some of our export markets.At the end of the day, this decision about the trade-off between the speed ofbalance of payments adjustment and the strength of the domestic part of the economy must, ofcourse, be a political judgement.Whatever Government chooses to do with fiscal policy, it is obviously importantto continue with the programme of microeconomic reform, which can play such an importantrole in building on the competitiveness of New Zealand producers in world markets.What about monetary policy?It is my absolute conviction that monetary policy targeted at maintaining pricestability has a crucial role to play in the uncertain environment in which we now find ourselves.Just as policy aimed at price stability must tighten monetary conditions asinflationary pressures increase, so policy aimed at price stability must ease monetary conditionsas inflationary pressures abate.And that is what the Reserve Bank has been doing for the last 18 months. Formuch of 1997, before the Asian crisis became a present reality, we eased gradually from a levelof 1000 on our Monetary Conditions Index (MCI) in the December quarter of 1996 to around650 in the December quarter of 1997. As it became obvious that the international environmentwas deteriorating, we allowed conditions to ease substantially faster, to around 250 over the lastmonth.
- 6 -BIS Review   58/1998The MCI seeks to measure the effect of both interest rates and the exchange rateon the real economy, and so on inflation. Perhaps not surprisingly, given New Zealand’s balanceof payments deficit and the uncertain international environment, the easing in monetaryconditions over the last year or so has been entirely in the form of a fall in the exchange rate.Indeed, 90-day interest rates have actually risen somewhat over that period. But overall theeasing which has taken place over the last 18 months is equivalent to a fall in 90 day interestrates of over 7 per cent with unchanged exchange rate, a substantial easing in any language. Justas it was the export sector which bore much of the brunt of policy tightening between early 1994and late 1996, so it has been the export sector which has received all of the benefit, so far, of theeasing.Ten days ago I attended an interesting conference in Stockholm on the best waysof conducting monetary policy. One of the papers at that conference3 argued that, when theSwedish central bank became the first central bank to use monetary policy to try to maintain astable price level in Sweden in the ‘thirties, it had the important benefit that Swedish output andemployment were also maintained at markedly higher levels than was the case in other countriesat that time.We in New Zealand do not target a price level but we have been charged with theresponsibility of keeping inflation tightly constrained below 3 per cent and above 0 per cent. Thisdoes not imply that we can eliminate the economic cycle. The world is far too uncertain for that,and the lags between taking a monetary policy action and the effects of that action are both toolong and too variable. (This means, incidentally, that there is nothing which monetary policy cando at this stage to affect the growth in GDP in the June quarter, which indeed is virtually over.There is virtually nothing which monetary policy can do at this stage to affect the growth in GDPin the September and December quarters. As far as monetary policy is concerned, those quartersare already substantially beyond influence. Whether they are quarters of strong growth or ofweak growth will be determined by a range of domestic and international factors, one of which ismonetary policy in 1997.)But, provided we take our responsibility to keep inflation above zero as seriouslyas we take our responsibility to keep it below 3 per cent, monetary policy should be able toprotect the economy from any prolonged deflation and the loss of output and employment whichthat would entail. We have spent much of this decade fighting to keep inflation below the top ofthe target agreed with Government. It is at least possible that, over the next year or two, we willbe working to prevent it from going through the bottom of that target. We will be as single-minded in that objective as we were in the earlier challenge. Indeed, we have been easingmonetary conditions for more than a year with exactly that objective in view.Having said that, we also need to be mindful of the risks in ignoring the long lagswith which monetary policy works. If we ignore those lags, we run the risk of making economiccycles worse.Alan Blinder, former vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, sometimes usesthe analogy of the thermostat. Who has not checked into a hotel room and turned up the heatingbecause the room is too cold? Then, after having a shower, turned the heating up some more                                                     3 ‘Pioneering price level targeting:  the Swedish experience 1931-1937’, by Claes Berg and Lars Jonung.
- 7 -BIS Review   58/1998because the room is still cold. And finally woken up two hours later in a sweat, with the roomlike an oven. It takes time for central heating to warm up a room. It takes time for an easing inmonetary policy to offset a sharp increase in deflationary pressures. If we keep easing untilactivity actually starts picking up strongly, we run the risk that in a year or two we will need to beslamming on the brakes. As we have sanctioned very substantial easing over the last year, wehave been conscious of this risk. We have been conscious also that, with the sharp fall in theexchange rate which has taken place, import prices may be pushed up, with a risk that this mightspill over into more generalised inflationary pressures. We recognise that, even now, withconfidence quite low among both businesses and households, there is a strong increase in activityin some parts of the economy, particularly in those parts of the manufacturing sector which havebenefited most from the fall in the exchange rate.In short, while we can not eliminate cycles in economic activity, we believe thatmonetary policy aimed at price stability can smooth economic cycles to some degree. This meansthat when inflationary pressures increase, we can be relied upon to tighten. It means that wheninflationary pressures fall away, perhaps because of a sharp deterioration in the internationalenvironment, we can be relied upon to ease. It certainly does not mean, as some commentatorshave asserted, that we operate in some kind of strait-jacket which requires us to suppresseconomic activity at every opportunity. Monetary policy aimed at delivering predictably lowinflation enables the economy to maximise sustainable growth and employment opportunities.ConclusionThe sharp downturn in many of our major export markets may well turn out to bethe most serious shock to hit the New Zealand economy since the oil shocks of the ‘seventies. Ifso, the benefits of recent economic reforms, in reducing public sector debt and improving theflexibility and adaptability of the economy as a whole, will be evident for all to see. A monetarypolicy aimed firmly at price stability is of enormous benefit in weathering the storm.*  *  *NB   This BIS Review is available on the BIS World Wide Web site (http://www.bis.org)._____________________________
BIS Review   76/1998Mr. Meyer reflects on recent developments in banking and financialmarkets: implications for bank supervision and regulation   Remarks by Mr. Laurence H.Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the FinancialInstitutions Center, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, on 18/9/98.The banking and financial services industries have been undergoing rapid changein recent years. These changes include the consolidation and increased geographic scope of thebanking industry, a blurring of the distinctions between various financial institutions,deregulation, and the implementation of financial strategies made possible by improvements incomputer technology and advances in finance theory. These changes in turn have created newopportunities and risks for financial institutions and new challenges for supervisors andregulators.My focus today will be on how legislation, supervisory practice and regulatorystandards have to adapt to these changes in order to promote competition for financial servicesand maintain stable financial systems. Markets are moving very rapidly, while legislative andregulatory changes are occurring much more slowly. It is important that both legislation andregulatory standards quickly catch up to the changes in the market place in order to maximize thebenefits to consumers and minimize the risks to financial stability.There are three ways in which recent developments have put pressure onlegislation, regulatory standards and supervisory practice. First, the job of supervision has simplybecome more challenging as a result of the increased size, geographic scope, complexity,globalization and diversity of banking organizations. Second, the effectiveness of one of thefoundations of the current regulatory framework, the risk-based capital rules, has eroded asimprovements in credit risk measurement facilitated increased use of securitization and creditderivatives to arbitrage those capital rules. These innovations have allowed banks to reduce thecapital charges for a given set of risks, making reported risk-based capital ratios increasingly lessmeaningful and the current standards progressively less effective. Third, banks and otherfinancial institutions, often with the help of their regulators, have found ways, albeit withinstatutory limits, to expand not only the activities in which they engage, but also to compete moreeffectively with one another. Market developments and regulatory actions have created tensionswith the existing legislative framework underpinning banking and financial services.I will focus on three policy responses. First, I will discuss the potential forincreased market discipline to raise the overall effectiveness of the current regulatory andsupervisory framework, responding to the challenge of supervising such large and complexinstitutions, without more burdensome and intrusive regulations. Second, I will emphasize thepriority that needs to be attached to updating and refining our capital standards. Third, I willdiscuss the importance of financial modernization legislation.Before tackling the policy questions, let me begin by reviewing why and howbanks are regulated.Why Do We Regulate Banks?Why do we supervise and regulate banks? The reasons are very straightforward.Initially, when banks were the dominant financial institutions, the major purpose was to reduce“systemic risk” and the impact on the economy of bank failure. Then as the safety net was
- 2 -BIS Review   76/1998created to reduce systemic risk, the resultant moral hazard created an even more important reasonto supervise and regulate banks.Historically, the objective was to protect against a panic-driven flight to currency,or bank runs, that caused a catastrophic decrease in the money supply and the collapse offinancial intermediation. Today, largely because of deposit insurance and the Federal Reservediscount window, flights to currency are not a real concern in the United States. But liquidity andsolvency problems at large banks and other financial institutions can create systemic concerns,and while banks are no longer “special” the large banks do play a central role in our financialsystem. Indeed, the stability of the electronic, large dollar payments system, which movestrillions of dollars a day and in which banks play a pivotal role, is critical in limiting systemicrisk. Other potential pressure points, in all of which banks play a key role, include the liquidity ofsecurities, financial derivatives, and interbank funding markets.Our very success at virtually eliminating the risk of bank runs in the United Stateshas led to a second major reason for supervising and regulating banks. Deposit insurance, thediscount window, and Federal Reserve payment system guarantees -- the very things that haveeliminated bank runs -- create what is called a “safety net” for banks. The existence of this safetynet gives the Government a direct stake in keeping bank risks under control, just as a privateinsurance company has a stake in controlling the risks of policyholders. Because depositinsurance and other parts of the safety net can never be fully and accurately priced, it is necessaryfor us to monitor and sometimes to act to control bank risks in order to protect the potential callon taxpayer funds. An equally important, if unintended, consequence of the safety net is that itcreates what economists term “moral hazard” incentives for some banks to take excessive risks.That is, the safety net creates incentives for banks to take larger risks than otherwise, because thesafety net, and potentially taxpayers, may absorb most of the losses if the gamble fails. Suchincentives are especially strong if the bank is near failure since, at this point, bank stockholdershave virtually nothing to lose.How Do We Regulate Banks?Bank regulation and supervision can be thought of as a portfolio of regulatoryrules and supervisory practices that collectively aim to monitor and protect the safety andsoundness of the banking system, so as to control systemic risk, offset moral hazard incentives,and limit the potential call on the taxpayer. This portfolio includes, in no particular order, (1) theset of rules and practices relating to the federal safety net itself; (2) the requirements fordisclosure and the incentives that promote market discipline of banking organizations; (3) therules that govern the capital that banking organizations must hold; (4) the limitations onactivities that banking organizations may engage in; (5) the restrictions on where certainactivities can be conducted within banking organizations; (6) prudential restrictions on therelationship between banks and their affiliates; and (7) the nature and details of the supervisionof banking organizations.The more effective is market discipline and the more effective are capitalstandards, the less there is a need to invoke the more intrusive and burdensome components ofthe regulatory portfolio. For this reason, I focus particularly on enhanced market discipline andreform of capital standards. But financial modernization legislation has also focused attention onthe role of activity limitations, restrictions on where activities are conducted within the bankingorganization, and the appropriate supervisory framework for more diversified financial serviceorganizations that would emerge from such legislation.
- 3 -BIS Review   76/1998Market Discipline: The Role of Subordinated DebtTo a significant extent, market discipline and regulatory standards are substitutes.The more effective the former, the less reliance has to be made of the latter. Because theregulatory approach involves significant costs to both the private and public sectors, increasedreliance on the market can reduce the cost of achieving a given degree of safety and soundness inthe banking system and thereby increase the efficiency of the overall regulatory framework.But there is a significant trade-off to worry about. A greater reliance on the marketmay also increase systemic risk. For example, eliminating deposit insurance would certainlyincrease the incentive for depositors to monitor the risk profiles of banks. The price for suchincreased market discipline, however, would, in my view, be unacceptably high -- a significantlyincreased risk of bank runs and hence systemic risk. The key therefore is to find opportunities toincrease market discipline in a way that results in an acceptable trade-off with respect to systemicrisk and thereby to achieve the optimal balance of market discipline and regulatory standards.Market discipline involves information and incentives. Markets need access toinformation to judge the risk profiles of banking organizations. But, to make market disciplinework, there also have to be incentives for banks to respond to the changing judgment of themarket.It may be possible to increase market discipline by requiring large, internationallyactive banks to issue a minimum amount of certain types of subordinated debt to the public. Anappealing aspect of this approach is that subordinated debt holders, so long as they are not bank“insiders”, face only downside risk, and thus their risk preferences are very close to those of theFDIC. Subordinated debt holders would therefore be expected to impose market discipline on thebank that is quite consistent with what bank supervisors are trying to do, including encouragingbanks to disclose more information about their financial condition. Observed risk premiums onsubordinated debt could perhaps be used to help the FDIC set more accurate risk-based depositinsurance premiums, and such debt would provide an extra cushion of protection for taxpayers.An additional benefit of having subordinated debt traded on the open market is that pricemovements would provide a clear signal of the market’s evaluation of the bank’s financialcondition that, even if it were not used to help price deposit insurance, could serve as an earlywarning aid to supervisors.Such an approach would most likely be limited to the largest banks for at least tworeasons. First, it is the increased size of banking organizations and the financial innovations atthe largest and most sophisticated banks that are challenging the effectiveness of the currentregulatory and supervisory framework. It may therefore be appropriate, even essential, todifferentiate the regulatory standards and supervisory practices at large, sophisticated, andinternationally active banks -- the predominant sources of systemic risk -- from those that applyto small and medium-sized banks. Second, it is unclear just how deep and liquid a market inbank subordinated debt would be and what access small and medium sized banks would have tothis market. Today, almost no smaller banks, for example, issue subordinated debt, while amajority of the largest banks already participate to some degree in this market. However, even atthe largest banks that participate, most of their subordinated debt appears to be held by theirholding company, not by independent third parties. This suggests that the development of anoperationally feasible program for mandatory subordinated debt would require a considerableamount of careful thought. Still, in my judgment it is thought that might prove very worthwhile.
- 4 -BIS Review   76/1998Reform of the Basle Accord: Updating Risk-Based Capital RulesCapital supplements the discipline from “outsiders” -- the market -- by reinforcingthe incentives of “insiders” -- the owners. Capital standards have therefore long been thefoundation of the regulatory approach to safety and soundness in the banking system.The current capital standards are based on the Basle Accord adopted in 1988 bymost of the world’s industrialized nations in an effort to encourage stronger capital at riskierbanks, to include off-balance sheet exposures in the assessment of capital adequacy, and toestablish more consistent capital standards across nations. The Accord was a major advance in1988, and has proved to be very useful since then. But in recent years calls for reform have begunto grow.The Basle Accord capital standard divides bank on- and off-balance-sheet assetsinto four risk buckets, and then applies a different capital weight to each bucket. These weightsare intended to increase with the riskiness of the assets in a given bucket. However, therelationship is rough. Perhaps most troublesome, the same risk weight is applied to allnon-mortgage loans. Thus, for example, a loan to a very risky “junk bond” company gets thesame weight as a loan to a “triple A” rated firm.While the current capital rules fail to differentiate among the riskiness of loans onthe banking book, banks are increasingly doing so, taking advantage of increasingly accuratemodels for measuring, managing, and pricing risk. These models allow banks to assign internaleconomic capital to the various loans and allow banks to identify those loans for which theeconomic capital is less than that required by the Basle Accord. Banks should then either want toremove loans from their banking books for which regulatory capital exceeds economic capital orotherwise find ways to make regulatory capital converge to economic capital. Conversely, banksshould want to keep loans that their models assign higher capital than required by the Baslestandard. And, banks have been doing just that, in part through innovations such as securitizationof loans and credit derivatives.Banks use securitization, for example, to remove their lower risk loans -- whichperhaps they otherwise would not originate -- from their banking books, reducing the associatedcapital charges. In a traditional securitization, a special purpose vehicle sells securities backed bya loan pool and uses the proceeds to purchase the loans from the bank. There might seem to beno problem with this arrangement, as long as banks shed the risks that go along with the loans. Ifthis were the case, securitization would simply be a device for shifting to the capital markets therisks associated with the bank loans securitized. Banks would then continue their traditional roleof originating the loans, but the capital markets would play an increased role in the funding of theloans.But, in reality, banks are required to keep part of the risk or provide some otherenhancement in order to make the securities backed by the loans more acceptable to the capitalmarket. Thus securitizations typically result in only a limited transference of risk. But the Baslecapital rules typically reduce capital requirements against the retained bank exposure by morethan banks lower the risk associated with the underlying loan pool. In addition, even if a bankcompletely transferred the risk associated with the underlying loan pool, eliminating the low-riskloans from the banking book raises the average risk level of the remaining loan portfolio, raisinga question as to whether the 8% capital charge remains adequate.
- 5 -BIS Review   76/1998Credit derivatives are another technique for managing both risk and risk-basedcapital charges. Derivatives are ways of slicing and dicing the risks and returns of assets, so thatthe risks and returns can be allocated more efficiently among ultimate risk takers. With a creditderivative, a bank can transfer the risk and returns associated with a loan, even though from anaccounting perspective the loan remains on the books of the bank. By using credit derivatives,banks can create “synthetic securitizations” to transfer risk and reduce risk-based capitalrequirements, while avoiding disclosure of an effective loan sale and possibly harming acustomer relationship. Such arrangements are also typically less costly than traditionalsecuritizations in terms of administrative, legal, and other structuring costs. As with traditionalsecuritizations, the concern from a regulatory perspective is that a bank is encouraged to reducethe risk-based capital requirement associated primarily with higher quality assets. This raisesquestions about its overall capital adequacy, given the remaining risks in its portfolio.This so-called “regulatory arbitrage” may not be all bad. It arises, after all, inresponse to deficiencies of the capital standards themselves, specifically their failure to reflectdifferences in the risk of loans within and across banks. Given the intense competition amongbanks, in part due to the globalization of the banking industry, banks are under pressure to limittheir capital and thereby raise their profitability. When regulatory capital requirements aresignificantly greater than the economic capital banks would otherwise assign to a given loan,banks either have to find ways to lower those capital charges, shift the risks associated with thoseloans elsewhere, or get out of the business of making such high quality loans. In the absence ofsuch adjustments, the capital standards might otherwise drive banks out of the business ofmaking high quality loans and therefore toward increased risk-taking. Regulatory capitalarbitrage can therefore be a safety valve that allows banks to continue in the business of lendingto high quality counterparties.But we must deal with both the problem of the degree to which the capital on theremaining credit risk at a bank associated with securitizations accurately reflects that risk.Perhaps even more critical is addressing the effect of both securitizations and credit derivativesfor the capital associated with the risk level of the residual loan portfolio. A one-size fits allregulatory capital charge and the cherry-picking of securitizing low risks and retaining high risksis, I believe, our biggest problem with securitizations -- real and synthetic. To address theseproblems we need a two-track approach. In the near term, we need to implement rules that bettermatch capital charges with the residual risk left after securitizations. This is a very complexproblem. The banking agencies issued a proposed rulemaking to address this issue in Novemberof 1997 and received many comments from the industry. A high priority in the near term must beputting in place an improved set of rules related to securitization.Over the intermediate term, we need to move more rapidly toward reform of theBasle capital standards, with a particular emphasis of dealing more effectively with the creditrisk in the banking portfolio. This hopefully would reduce or eliminate the incentive to movelow-risk assets out of the banking book and, in any case, permit capital charges to be set moresystematically in relation to the risk in a given banking book. Because the markets are moving sorapidly, this has to be a high priority. Because these standards require international consensusand because the problem is complex and the solutions not entirely self-evident, the process ofreform moves more slowly. But the time has come for putting this effort on the fast track.Financial Modernization: Updating the Legislative Framework
- 6 -BIS Review   76/1998As opposed to being on the fast track, I believe we can all agree that, in the UnitedStates, reform of our legal framework for banking regulation and supervision has been on theslow track. Indeed, much of our legal framework has essentially not changed since the 1930s. Inthe meantime, the distinctions between financial institutions has become increasingly blurred, asfinancial institutions have endeavored to broaden the activities they engage in to take advantageof synergies among the activities and to compete with other financial institutions. The result hasbeen a relentless search for loopholes by the financial institutions and efforts by regulatoryauthorities to find ways within their charter to permit new activities in order to preserve thecompetitiveness of the institutions under their charge. This process is not only inefficient, butcreates new inequities, institutions that may be producing unintended risks, and the misallocationof resources. That is why my colleagues and I are such strong supporters of H.R. 10, TheFinancial Modernization Act of 1998, which the House passed last month and the SenateBanking Committee approved in a modified form last week.Both bills bring our financial institutions into the 21st century in a framework thatminimizes risks and inequities. The task it sets for itself is not easy. First and foremost the billswould finally let financial institutions get into each other’s businesses, and thus widen the scopeand range over which institutions can compete for the public’s business. Mind you, this is not astatement that says financial supermarkets and/or large institutions will be better or moresuccessful than specialized and/or smaller institutions. But the benefit is that the public, notregulators, will decide which will prosper as competitors all bend their efforts to serve theconsumer.That is the bottom line. It’s the reason why there should be financialmodernization. But the bills also establish a structure of bank supervision that is consistent bothwith efficient resource allocation and with minimizing risk to the stability of the economy andthe taxpayer. The key elements to that structure are some residual limits on bank activities,limitations on the location within the banking organization where the new activities can beconducted, a blending of functional and umbrella supervision, and the continuation of the FederalReserve’s role in the consolidated supervision of banking organizations.Both the House and the Senate versions would permit banks to conduct in theirown subsidiaries (so-called operating subsidiaries or “op subs”) only the same activities that theymay already conduct in the bank and financial agency activities, which by their nature requireminimal funding and create minimal risk. These limitations, it seems to me, are crucial forseveral reasons. Banks have a lower cost of funds than other financial entities because of thesafety net. As I discussed earlier, this federal safety net, and the subsidy that goes along with it,are provided by the Government in order to buy systemic stability. But it has a cost: increasedrisk taking by banks, reduced market discipline, and consequently the need for more onerousbank supervision in order to balance the resultant moral hazard. The last thing we should want isto extend that subsidy over a wider range of activities, which is, I believe, exactly what wouldhappen if bank op subs could engage in wider nonbank financial activities. Not only would thatincrease the moral hazard -- and the need for bank-like supervision -- but it would also unbalancethe competitive playing field between bank subs and independent firms engaging in the samebusiness, a strange result for legislation whose ultimate purpose is to increase the competition forfinancial services.Both bills would require that organizations that conduct both banking and otherfinancial businesses organize in a holding company form where the bank and the other activitiesare both subs of the holding company. Profits and losses of the business lines accrue to the
- 7 -BIS Review   76/1998holding company and thus do not directly benefit nor endanger the bank, the safety net, or thetaxpayer. The safety net subsidy is not directly available to the holding company affiliates andcompetition is thus more balanced. Moreover, traditional regulators like the SEC and the stateinsurance commissioners still regulate the entities engaged in nonbank activities as if they wereindependent firms. Functional regulation is desirable not only for competitive equity, but is apolitical necessity and a practical reality in the process of balancing that is required to passfinancial modernization. In principle, functional regulation could also be applied to op subs, butthe safety net, I submit, would soon create regulatory conflict with that structure.Importantly, both bills would prohibit commercial affiliations with banks. There isno doubt that it is becoming increasingly difficult to draw a bright line that separates financialservices from nonfinancial businesses; it will only become more difficult to do so. But, the truthis that we are not sure enough of the implications of combining banking and commerce --potential conflicts of interest, concentration of power, and safety net and stability concerns -- tomove forward in this area. Better, I think, to digest financial reform before moving in an area thatwill be very difficult to reverse.Finally, the holding company framework of the bills would keep the FederalReserve as the umbrella supervisor. I believe that the Fed has an important role to play inbanking supervision in order to carry out its responsibilities for monetary policy, economicstabilization, and crisis management. I cannot grasp how we could possibly understand what ishappening in banking markets, what innovations are occurring and their implications, and thenature and quality of the risk exposures and controls so critical for crisis management and policyformulation without the hands-on practical exposure that comes from supervision. An umbrellasupervisor is needed for complex organizations in order to assure that the entire organization andits policies and controls are well managed and consistent with financial stability. At least for thelarge organizations, I believe that supervisor should be the Federal Reserve so that we can playour role as a central bank and international crisis manager.ConclusionThe rapid changes in banking and financial services markets are creatingopportunities and challenges. Increased competition in the financial services industry andincreased synergies provided by financial services firms promise important benefits toconsumers. But the increased size, breadth, complexity, and geographic scope of banking haveincreased the challenge of managing and of regulating and supervising banks. Banks haveresponded by developing new approaches to measuring and managing risk. Now it is time forregulatory standards and supervisory practice to catch up. This catching up must involveupdating the legislative framework underlying banking. It must also involve updating theinternational capital standards that have been the foundation of the regulatory framework. And itmay also be useful to reinforce the role of market discipline. Working together, the markets, thepolitical process, and the regulators can ensure that we take advantage of the new opportunitieswhile maintaining the safety and soundness of our banking system.
BIS Review   73/1998Mr. Macfarlane examines monetary policy developments in Australia duringthe last quarter of the twentieth century   Text of the Shann Memorial Lecture given by theGovernor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. I.J. Macfarlane, in Perth on 15/9/98 (exludingbibliography).1. IntroductionIt is an honour to be invited here tonight to deliver the Shann Lecture. As iscustomary when giving a memorial lecture, I have re-acquainted myself with the writings of theman whose memory we are honouring. It is noteworthy that for most of his working life he held aChair at this University in History and Economics, as opposed to Economic History. Thisallowed him to range over a broad area, both as a scholar and as a polemicist.His scholarly reputation rests mainly on his economic histories, and I am pleasedto record that he also wrote a fine piece on monetary policy in 1933 called “National Control ofBanking”.1 His best known work, “The Boom of 1890 - and Now”, was not much more than apamphlet, but was extremely important in establishing his reputation among the wider public.Written in 1927, it was an account of a period about 40 years earlier - a period that was recentenough to matter, but too long ago to have figured in people’s working lives. I see a lot of valuein this type of work, and have even tried my hand at a similar piece myself.Tonight, I would like to move to a more recent era and to a narrower topic, byexamining the development of monetary policy over the last quarter of the twentieth century. Indoing so, I intend to cover not only the institutional changes, but, where relevant, the intellectualcross-currents and the political influences that were at work. It may seem strange to give aprominent role to political influences, because the end point we have now reached in ourmonetary policy framework in Australia is not dissimilar to that of a number of countries thathave had very different political developments. But even though the end points are similar, thesequence of events in the Australian development has been unique, and political influences haveplayed a role in that sequence.2. The starting point in the mid-1970sAround the world, the mid-1970s was a very unhappy period for macro-economics - to find a worse period in terms of economic mismanagement, we would have to goback to the 1930s. In the 1930s a severe deflation was let loose on the world economy, while inthe 1970s it was a severe inflation. To make matters worse, even though the inflation of the1970s was initially tolerated because it was thought to be helpful in pushing unemploymentdown to very low levels, it ended up having the perverse effect of yielding a higher level ofunemployment. The word stagflation was coined to describe this period.The experience of the Australian economy in the mid-1970s reflected theseunfortunate worldwide developments to the full. The underlying rate of inflation reached 20 percent by early 1975 and was in double digits again in the early 1980s. Unemployment rose from1.4 per cent at the start of the decade to 6.5 per cent by 1978. While the unemployment rate rosefurther in later decades, it was the 1970s that transformed Australia from a low to a highunemployment economy.All macro-economic policies came in for severe and justifiable criticism at this                                                     1 Published in Shann (1933).
- 2 -BIS Review   73/1998time, monetary policy being no exception. A similar phase of self-examination occurred in allOECD countries, and there was intense debate about monetary policy in the economic literature.In this lecture, I would like to examine how this debate evolved in Australia and how it led tochanges in our monetary institutions, our guiding economic principles, and the responsibility fordecision-making. I intend to concentrate on these three main areas:• First, changes to the institutional structures which formed the underpinnings of themoney supply process - regulations on banks, methods of government debtfinancing and the exchange rate regime. Changes to these features amounted tofixing up the underlying “engineering” of the monetary system.• Second, changes to the guiding economic principles which determined whethermonetary policy was on the right course.• Third, changes to the “governance” of the monetary policy decision-makingprocess.From the above description it may still not be completely clear exactly what thedifference is between these three main areas of change. Perhaps it will be a little clearer if Iemploy a metaphor. If we were to picture monetary policy as a ship, the first of these changeswas to stop it leaking, the second was to equip it with a more reliable navigation system and thethird was to work out who should be at the helm.3. Fixing up the underlying “engineering”I do not wish to spend a lot of time describing how the monetary ship was madeseaworthy because there are already some very good accounts available.2At our starting point in the mid-1970s, most observers agreed that loose monetarypolicy had been a major factor behind the rise in inflation, and that it needed to be tightened.Unfortunately, there were significant structural deficiencies in the system which meant that noone could be confident that a tightening could be achieved with any reliability.The first deficiency was that the system relied heavily on direct controls on banks,including interest rate ceilings imposed on banks’ deposit and lending rates. This meant that,even if monetary policy was successful in limiting the expansion of bank deposits and lending(and it was by no means clear that it would be), the tightening of conditions would not extend tothe non-bank financial intermediaries. It was this group - merchant banks, building societies andfinance companies (formerly called hire purchase companies) - which were usually the fastestgrowing providers of finance.The solution to this problem was to remove the interest rate ceilings and allowbanks to compete on equal terms with other providers of finance.3 This meant that if banks wereshort of liquidity they could raise interest rates and compete for funds with other intermediarieswho, in turn, would probably have to match them. In this way the tightening of conditions wouldbe spread across the whole financial sector. Interest rate ceilings on deposits were removed inDecember 1980 and on smaller business loans in April 1985. With the removal of the ceiling on                                                     2 Grenville (1991).3 This may seem obvious now, but it was not the first response to the problem. The first response was to set intrain a process whereby interest rate ceilings would be extended to cover all non-bank financial institutions.An Act of Parliament was passed - the Financial Corporations Act of 1974 - to do this, but Part 4 of the Actwas not proclaimed and therefore the powers to extend controls never came into effect.
- 3 -BIS Review   73/1998loans for owner-occupied housing in April 1986, the last of the interest rate ceilings was gone.The second deficiency in the system was that there was no mechanism in place toensure that the budget deficit was financed entirely by borrowing from the public. Any shortfallin borrowing from the public was automatically met by the Government borrowing from theReserve Bank, a method of financing which is colloquially known as “printing money” or“monetising the deficit”. In order to stop these unintentional monetary injections into the system,the Government needed to move from its existing system, where it set interest rates ongovernment bonds and issued only the amount of bonds that the market wanted to buy (the “TapSystem”), to a new system where it sold the amount needed to finance the deficit at whateverinterest rate the market demanded (the “Tender System”). This move occurred in 1979 forTreasury notes and in 1982 for government bonds.4Finally, the fixed, quasi-fixed or occasionally changed exchange rate regimes thatAustralia had used over the post-war period introduced another element of unintended monetaryinjections or withdrawals into the system. Under all these systems, the Reserve Bank had to clearthe foreign exchange market at the end of each day. If there were more buyers of Australiandollars than sellers, this effectively represented an injection into the Australian money supply.This meant that if monetary policy was tightened in Australia with a view to slowing the growthof the money supply, its effects could be offset through the foreign exchanges. This is becausethe tightening of monetary policy would raise Australian interest rates relative to other countries,and attract money into Australian dollars. In the first instance, this could be offset by ReserveBank open market operations, but in the long run it could be self-defeating. This problem wasovercome with the floating of the Australian dollar in December 1983.These three changes were effectively completed by the mid-1980s. Even thoughone of them - the float of the currency - was a massive change to Australia’s economic structure,5the three changes were seen by economists as largely technical in nature, and there was littledissent in the economic community. Also, there was no political polarisation with one partysupporting and the other party resisting the change. The Campbell Committee, which reported inSeptember 1981, had been an important influence in establishing a consensus for change. ThisCommittee had been set up by a Coalition Government, but most of its recommendations wereimplemented by a Labor Government.4.  A better guiding principleThe move to greater exchange rate flexibility, which, as explained above, hadbegun well before the float, meant that monetary policy needed a new guiding principle (or a newnavigation system, to quote the metaphor used earlier in this Lecture). Instead of having anexternal guide (the fixed exchange rate), a satisfactory internal guide had to be found. Thisprocess, beginning in the mid-1970s, took Australian monetary policy from a system based onpure discretion, to monetary targeting, and ultimately to the present system of inflation targeting.The changes were not always smooth and there were some important gaps along the way which                                                     4 This change permitted another important improvement - the separation of debt management from monetarypolicy. See Phillips (1985) and Reserve Bank (1993).5 Even here the break was not as dramatic as it seems, because Australians had already got used to dailybilateral exchange rate movements under two of the pre-float exchange rate regimes. Under both the “fix tothe trade weighted basket” (1974 to 1976) and “adjustable peg to the trade weighted basket” (1976 to 1983),the exchange rate of the Australian dollar against the US dollar could change every day, even though theReserve Bank cleared the foreign exchange market at the end of each day.
- 4 -BIS Review   73/1998have never been satisfactorily explained. I would like to retrace some of this ground tonight. Indoing so, I hope to skip lightly over the periods that have been covered fully before andconcentrate on those that have been neglected.From 1945 to 1971 the Australian dollar was pegged against the US dollar, andthis effectively formed the centrepiece of Australian monetary policy. If our economic conditionsgot too far out of line with those in the United States it would imperil the exchange rate, and sofiscal and monetary policy would have to change in order to prevent it. It is a simple system, andone that still finds favour in a number of quarters around the world. The best known currentexample of this system is the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System,which is scheduled soon to go a step further into monetary union with a single currency (theeuro) and a single central bank - the European Central Bank.Our link with the US dollar was broken in 1971, and thereafter the disciplineexerted by a fixed exchange rate dissipated; once the link was broken the first time, it was nolonger “sacred” and could be broken again. Although we retained a pegged exchange rate systemin one form or another until 1983, parity adjustments became increasingly frequent. We wereeffectively on our own with no clearly enunciated guiding principle behind our monetary policyuntil monetary targeting was introduced in 1976. This period of four-and-a-half years couldtherefore be regarded as one where unconstrained discretion was the underlying basis ofmonetary policy.6 Since it was also the period when inflation accelerated most quickly andreached its highest level, it confirmed the general suspicion among monetary economists thatsomething more than pure discretion was needed. Some guiding principle, or rule, that limitedthe capacity for discretion in monetary policy was essential to keep it from falling under theinfluence of expediency or succumbing to populist pressures for an excessively expansionarystance.(a) The period of monetary targetingBy January 1976 that guiding principle was found when Australia fell into linewith a large number of other industrialised countries by introducing a monetary target. Thismove, which coincided with the election of the Fraser Government, had strong support from theReserve Bank and the Treasury. Within the Bank, the Research Department had been heavilyinfluenced by academic monetarism, as evidenced by much of their research output in that periodand the choice of visiting overseas scholars.7 At the top of the Bank, the Governor and DeputyGovernor were supportive of the new regime, but retained a degree of scepticism and arecognition of the need for some flexibility.8The Australian system of monetary targeting was based around an annual targetfor M3, which was not unusual by world standards. What was unusual was that it was set by theTreasurer on the joint advice of Treasury and the Bank. Another unusual feature was that theBank always preferred to use the term “conditional projection” rather than target. Its success, asmeasured by how often it was met, or by the size of over-runs, was not very different to                                                     6 The term discretion is used by economists to describe the conduct of monetary policy where the authoritiesadjust policy by reference to a range of indicators, none of which has any special standing. A criticism ofdiscretion is that the public does not know what the monetary policy framework is, and therefore has troubletelling whether the authorities are acting in accord with principles or expedience. As a system, it is theopposite of a rule (such as a fixed exchange rate or monetary targeting).7 Professors Laidler, Parkin and Poole all spent time at the Reserve Bank during this period.8 See Sanders (1979) and Sanders (1982).
- 5 -BIS Review   73/1998experience elsewhere.9 This degree of success was somewhat surprising considering that formost of the period over which it operated the underlying monetary “ship” contained all the leaksand distortions referred to in the previous section.The era of monetary targeting lasted for nearly nine years (from April 1976 toJanuary 1985), which roughly coincided with the period which Goodhart describes as “the highwater mark of international monetarism”.10 I do not propose to examine its strengths andweaknesses at any length because I have done so elsewhere, as have others.11 Suffice to say thatit did bring some order to Australian monetary policy and was a big improvement on itspredecessor. Nevertheless, it had only limited success in its central task of reducing inflation, andas time went on its inherent weaknesses began to show. The logic of monetary targetingpresupposes a stable statistical relationship - the demand for money - which implies that inflationis ultimately linked to the rate of growth of the money supply. This relationship, as in othercountries, was never very precise over short periods, but that could be tolerated if it retained itslong-run stability qualities. In time, particularly as a result of financial deregulation, the long-runrelationship started to become unstable. At some point, M3 targeting had to be abandoned.(b) The replacement for monetary targetingIn the event, monetary targeting was discontinued in January 1985. The immediatereason for it was the extent of overshooting that was occurring during 1984, which seemed toindicate the effects of financial deregulation rather than a major rise in incipient inflation. Alsoof importance was the fact that Treasurer Keating had made no secret of his lack of enthusiasmfor this approach to monetary policy.12 Even so, the decision to discontinue targeting was seen bysome as precipitate, and many in financial markets were unprepared for the change. The Bankwas criticised for not having produced a convincing body of work containing the evidence for thechange in policy regime. Some of this criticism was justified, but to prove the breakdown in along-run relationship always takes a long time.13To allay the fears of those in financial markets who thought that the end ofmonetary targeting meant a return to unconstrained discretion, the Bank looked for an alternativeframework which it could use as the basis for its monetary policy. As a result, the so-called“checklist” was born. Its birth was announced in May 1985 by one of my predecessors, and itsmost detailed exposition was given in his 1987 Shann Lecture.14 In the event, it proved to have ashort life and there was little further mention of it after that time. The checklist contained anumber of economic variables that were to be taken into account in setting monetary policy. Upto a point, it was useful in conveying the sensible idea that monetary policy needed to look at awide range of indicators, not just one. Its problem was that it did not have a sufficientlywell-thought-out economic rationale or any criteria for determining which indicators were moreimportant. In particular, it failed to distinguish between the instrument of monetary policy,intermediate targets and ultimate targets (an essential framework that is to be discussed in thenext section). They were all in there, along with at least one variable that did not fit into any ofthese categories.                                                     9 Argy, Brennan and Stevens (1990).10 Goodhart (1989).11 Grenville (1997), Edey (1997).12 As explained earlier, it was the Treasurer who set the annual monetary target, which he announced in hisbudget.13 Decisive evidence was produced in series of research papers beginning in 1987.14 Johnston (1985 and 1987).
- 6 -BIS Review   73/1998The checklist was introduced in haste - barely four months after the end ofmonetary targeting. It had not undergone close economic analysis within the Bank, and had notbeen exposed to prior public scrutiny through research papers. In defence, it has to be said thatthe circumstances of the time were very turbulent; in 1985, the currency was plunging, bondyields were rising and there was a loss of confidence in Australian macro-economic policy andserious doubts about the sustainability of our external position. There was a feeling somethinghad to be done. Nevertheless, an important lesson was learnt from the episode - no central bankshould commit itself to a new monetary policy regime until it has researched the subjectthoroughly and established its credibility with reference to the economic literature and overseaspractice.(c)A new period of discretion? The Reserve Bank and its critics 1988-1993With the short-lived “checklist” period over, the Bank entered 1988 with noarticulated framework for monetary policy, but a determination not to introduce a new one inhaste. At first, there was little pressure from the markets, the press or the economic community todeliver a new framework because by 1988 the currency woes of 1985 and 1986 seemed wellbehind us. But that mood soon changed as critics began to focus on the fact that Australianinflation had not returned to relatively low rates as it had in most OECD countries. It is thisperiod of intense criticism - roughly from 1989 to 1993 - that I would like to cover in somedetail. I trust I can do this safely now because we are far enough past this period for it to havelost its political sensitivity, but close enough to still remember the details.The main charge of the critics was that Australia was still an inflation-proneeconomy, and that its central bank was never going to be able to improve the situation while-everit relied on unconstrained discretion as the basis of its monetary policy.15 The critics alsoattacked the Reserve Bank for a lack of independence. Other high inflation countries such as theUnited Kingdom (which was opting for membership of the European Monetary System) andNew Zealand and Canada (which were opting for inflation targeting) were doing somethingabout “stiffening up” their monetary policy frameworks, but Australia appeared to be doingnothing. To make matters worse, in the eyes of the critics, the newly appointed Governor -Bernie Fraser - was known to be a close associate of Treasurer Keating, and they thereforeassumed his appointment would result in a reduction in the Bank’s independence, alreadyperceived as being too little. This was another subject where they also had some suggestions, butI will save the discussion of central bank independence until the next section. For most of thecritics, there was no alternative but radical reform of the legislation to create a new type ofcentral bank subject to some form of binding monetary rule.Many of the critics were also influenced by academic thinking which held thatdiscretionary monetary policy would inevitably fail. Discretion was held to be destabilising, andto have an inevitable inflationary bias which could only be corrected by the imposition of a rule                                                     15 Many of the criticisms took place in the political arena and in the columns of newspapers, but the moresubstantive ones mainly appeared in economic or political journals. A reasonably comprehensive sample ofthe substantive ones would include, in chronological order, Hartley and Porter (1988), Jonson (1989), White(1989), Cole (1990), Dowd (1990), Jonson (1990), McTaggart and Rogers (1990), Morgan (1990), Stone(1990), Hartley and Porter (1991), Sieper and Wells (1991), Evans and Dowd (1992), Hanke, Porter andSchuler (1992), Moore (1992), Stone (1992), Makin (1993), Evans (1994) and Weber (1994). The titles ofsome of the conferences organised on the subject around this time convey the flavour: e.g. “Do we need aReserve Bank?” (CIS, 1989); “Can monetary policy be made to work?” (IPA, 1992).
- 7 -BIS Review   73/1998on the central bank. These conclusions, deriving mainly from the writings of Friedman and othermembers of the monetarist school, received empirical support from the events of the 1970s and1980s.16 This debate is usually called the “rules versus discretion” debate, and those supporting arule generally got the better of the argument. They were reinforced by the newer sophisticatedwritings of the rational expectations school, and in particular by its introduction of the concept of“time inconsistency”, which purported to show that there was a technical reason why only a rulecould contain inflation.17While there was a degree of agreement among the Australian critics about whatwas wrong with Australian monetary policy, there was less agreement about what rule shouldreplace the existing system. The critics proposed a wide range of alternative models, including acurrency board, monetary base targeting, a return to targeting broader monetary aggregates,various forms of commodity standards, and a combination of inflation targeting and central bankindependence.18Within the Reserve Bank there was some sympathy for an important part of thecritics’ case; it was conceded that monetary policy based entirely on discretion was intellectuallyand practically unsatisfactory, and it had been associated with high inflation in country aftercountry. We also agreed that something better was needed, but most of the concrete proposalscould be dismissed as impractical. There were no practical working models of strict monetarybase control or commodity standards, and monetary targeting and fixed exchange rates hadalready been rejected as unsatisfactory for Australia.The difficulty arose with respect to the inflation targeting proposals. There wasrecognition within the Bank that this was the most promising approach, but politicalcircumstances contrived to make our participation in the debate marginal at best. This wasbecause from about late 1989 onwards the most vocal proponent of the view was John Hewson,first as shadow Treasurer, then as the Leader of the Opposition. This had the effect of forcing theGovernment into defending its record on monetary policy and hence the existing institutions andapproach. It was a great disappointment for the Bank that this debate was politicised19 before theeconomics profession had time to explore it fully in an objective non-partisan way. But it wouldbe unfair to criticise either of the two political protagonists for this - there is nothing wrong withthem being quicker off the mark than the economics profession.The Bank had long agreed with its critics that Australia’s high inflation rate wasan obstacle to sustained economic development and that monetary policy would have to play the                                                     16 Friedman (1968), Brunner (1980) and Poole (1980) are good examples of this literature.17 See Kydland and Prescott (1977) and  Barro and Gordon (1983).18 Hartley and Porter (1991) proposed either a monetary base control regime or a currency board. Hanke,Porter and Schuler (1992) favoured a currency board. McTaggart and Rogers (1990), Sieper and Wells (1991)and Makin (1993) supported monetary base targeting, while Weber (1994) supported targeting M1.Commodity standards were proposed by White (1989), Dowd (1990) and Evans (1994).19 I have reviewed the files in our Press Office for this period, and am still surprised at the huge amountof material they contain. Although only the most important pieces have been kept, the Hewsonversus Keating controversy over the Reserve Bank is detailed in literally hundreds of press cuttings,excerpts from Hansard, competing press releases and media interviews. The files confirm thatDr Hewson initially criticised the Bank in late 1989 for being too close to the Government and calledfor greater independence and more emphasis on medium-term anti-inflationary policy. This generalcritique was made more concrete in mid 1991 when he proposed legislative changes to ensureindependence and the single objective of inflation, plus the introduction of an inflation target of 0 to2 per cent. It was this proposal that became part of the “Fightback” package in late 1991 whichformed the basis of the Opposition’s 1993 electoral platform.
- 8 -BIS Review   73/1998major role in remedying the situation. During 1988 and 1989, the Bank’s research efforts weretaking it towards a model that had a lot of similarities to those which underlay the New Zealandor Canadian style inflation targeting.20 Our research had taken us down a path that led to thesame general framework as those models, (and of the model of inflation targeting we eventuallyadopted in 1993). It is summed up in the schematic framework below:Table 1: Schematic Framework for Monetary PolicyPossible InstrumentsPossible IntermediateTargetsPossible UltimateTargetsOvernight interest rate*None*Inflation*orororMoney baseMoney supplyNominal GDP*ororExchange rate(Real GDP)or(Employment)or(Balance of payments)In August 1989, which was just before the subject had become politically charged,I was able to summarise our views to an international audience of central bankers as follows: thecash rate is the instrument of monetary policy,21 there is no intermediate objective,22 and theultimate objective has to be a nominal variable such as the rate of inflation or nominal23 GDP(the asterisked elements in Table 1).While we accepted some of the arguments of our critics, and we shared a commonframework with the most practical of the alternative models put forward, there were still somemajor differences. First, and most importantly, we believed that we could achieve what ourcritics wanted - a return to a low inflation environment - without radical overhaul or a completerewriting of the Reserve Bank Act. In a sense, we believed that reform from within was possibleand that this would gradually return Australia to being a low inflation country. Secondly, webelieved that the early overseas formulations of the inflation targeting/central bank independencemodel were too rigid in several ways:• There was a tendency to suggest that the single objective of low inflation meantthat central banks should pay no attention at all to other economic variables. Wefelt that there are a number of circumstances where, even if primacy is given tomaintaining low inflation, the effects on output and employment had to be taken                                                     20 Some of this was presented in a conference held by the Reserve Bank in June 1989; see Macfarlaneand Stevens (1989) and Edey (1989). See also Grenville (1989).21 “For all intents and purposes, the cash rate is our instrument.” Macfarlane (1989).22 “No-one can dispute the need for an instrument, or for the ultimate aim of monetary policy to bemade clear. The one part of the trilogy that is not self-evident is the need for an intermediateobjective. It is the part we have come to doubt, and ultimately to discard.” ibid.23 “We have no desire to dispute the widely-held proposition that the ultimate objective of monetarypolicy should be a nominal variable such as the rate of inflation or the rate of growth of nominalincome. A system which operates directly from instrument to ultimate objective still has to contendwith the fact that there is a long interval between the movement in the instrument and the resultingchange in the ultimate objective. For  this reason, actual inflation is not a good guide for monetarypolicy; leading indicators of inflation are much more useful.” ibid.
- 9 -BIS Review   73/1998into account and had to influence monetary policy actions. The best central banksoverseas, moreover, clearly behaved in this fashion.• There was a tendency for proponents to understate the output and employmentcosts of the initial reduction in inflation. This was because they relied on theconclusion from the rational expectations school that credible disinflations wouldbe relatively costless.• We were worried that if central banks were to be judged only by inflation results,there would be a tendency to over-achieve, i.e. they would be very reluctant toallow inflation to rise, even if only slightly and for short periods, but wouldreadily accept circumstances that pushed the economy in the deflationarydirection.• Because New Zealand and Canada had chosen 0-2 per cent as their target, that hadbecome the numerical norm in discussions of inflation targeting. We regarded thisas probably too low, and certainly too narrow a range.24 No country had achievedthis sort of inflation performance over any significant time interval in the past 50years. We did not like the concept of a “hard-edged band”, particularly the earlyformulations which suggested some decisive action occurring whenever the bandwas breached.25During the early 1990s, particularly between the 1990 and 1993 elections, theBank had to keep a pretty low profile in the debate because of the political constraint alluded toearlier. Governor Fraser made a number of speeches which defended the Bank and its monetarypolicy. In some of these he also questioned the more extreme versions of inflation as the singleobjective, and disputed the view that central bank independence meant that there should be anadversarial relationship between the central bank and the Government.During this period, the lack of a monetary policy framework that could commandwidespread support had its costs. It meant that each of the monetary policy easings of 1990 and1991 were met by the charge that they were only done for political reasons (lowering interestrates was presumed to make the Government more popular). There was clearly great distrust ofmonetary policy, the Government and the Reserve Bank - or, in modern parlance, a lack ofcredibility.It is interesting that virtually all of the serious criticism of the Bank in this periodwas coming from the perspective that it was too soft on inflation.26 Hence the proposals forreform were all aimed, in one way or another, at eliminating the supposed inflationist tendencies.Yet, while all the debate was going on, inflation was actually falling to its lowest level for ageneration. In some senses, it was this that ultimately proved decisive in confirming that it waspossible to return to a low inflation environment without radical change to the Reserve Bank orits Act. It was this economic development that ultimately ended the debate in our favour.                                                     24 We think our views were vindicated when Canada shifted its end-point target to 1-3 per cent in 1994 andNew Zealand to 0-3 per cent in 1997. On the other hand, Canada and New Zealand could respond bypointing out that they are now well within their “old band”, and did not need the change.25 For example, the automatic dismissal of the Governor, or a system where the Governor’s salary was inverselyrelated to the rate of inflation. While these have never become a part of any country’s system, they werewidely believed to be an important part of inflation targeting in much of the early Australian discussion.26 There were some exceptions - Phipps and Sheen (1995), Bell (1997), Langmore and Quiggin (1994) - butthey came after the 1989-1993 period. Also, they did not propose any restructuring of the Reserve Bank; theymerely argued that it should have run easier policy.
- 10 -BIS Review   73/1998Having said that, I do not want to suggest that we foresaw the whole developmentand were always confident of the result. We, like our counterparts in other countries, weresurprised by how far and how quickly inflation came down at the beginning of the 1990s. Wealso did not forecast the depth of the 1990/91 recession. But once inflation had come down, wefelt that there was a high likelihood that it would stay low during the subsequent phase ofeconomic growth. We also felt that an inflation target would help to bring about that result.(d) The introduction of inflation targetingAs I have already suggested, much of the intellectual groundwork for thedevelopment of our inflation target had been laid well before its introduction. The crucial steprequired to turn this into reality was the adoption of a published numerical target. For reasonsalready alluded to, it was some time before this step was taken. Not only was the issue highlypoliticised, but there was a strong presumption (by both the critics and proponents of inflationtargeting) that an inflation target had to be “0-2”, which the Bank felt would have been toorestrictive. Although we had a general aim of getting inflation down, we did not follow the NewZealand or Canadian sequence of announcing, in advance, a planned reduction to a particularrange over a specific time period. As it turned out, that sequence was reversed in our case -inflation was reduced, and a commitment to keep it low as then put in place.The process of establishing that commitment in the public arena was itself agradual one. Governor Fraser in 1993 referred in two speeches to the objective of keepinginflation around 2 to 3 per cent27. The initial flavour of these remarks was that inflation hadreached a trough in the early-1990s recession, and that the Bank wished to ensure that it did notrise appreciably during the recovery. This commitment was expressed increasingly firmly withtime.In developing our inflation target, the Bank was encouraged by the examples ofother countries such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, which adopted inflation targets in 1992and 1993. These showed that alternative, less rigid inflation targeting models could gainacceptance. Both countries specified targets higher than the original “0-2” model.28 Our ownchoice of a 2-3 per cent figure was based partly on pragmatic considerations.29 Inflation haddeclined to a trough of 2 per cent, and the main priority was to stop it rising too much from there.There was also a respectable body of academic opinion to suggest that it was optimal to aim forsomething in the low positive range rather than too close to zero.30The other unusual aspect of inflation targeting in Australia was that it wasintroduced by the central bank. In other countries such as New Zealand, Canada and the UnitedKingdom, it was from the outset a joint undertaking by both government and central bank, withthe former setting the target and expecting the latter to achieve it. Usually, the agreement wasformalised in a public document. The evolutionary nature of this process of change in Australiawas no doubt unsatisfactory to some of the Bank’s critics. They would have preferred a more                                                     27 Fraser (1993(a) and 1993(b)).28 In the United Kingdom, the initial target was 1-4 per cent, but to be in the lower half of the range by the endof the parliamentary term. Sweden’s target range was 1-3 per cent.29 See Stevens and Debelle (1995) for a discussion of the considerations involved in specification of the target.30 Summers (1991) and Fischer (1994) outline reasons why a low positive inflation rate may be optimal.Summers suggests an optimal range of 2-3 per cent, while Fischer's preferred range is 1-3 per cent. AlanGreenspan had talked about the need to ensure that inflation was “low enough not to materially affectbusiness decisions”.
- 11 -BIS Review   73/1998decisive regime shift, and there were some who felt that the absence of such a shift meant that wedid not have a “proper” inflation target.But gradually, the Government began to recognise that the inflation target washelpful to good economic policy. They had not argued against it after it was introduced, but itwas difficult for them to embrace it enthusiastically, given its chequered political history. Evenso, by 1995 and 1996, Treasurer Willis was publicly giving the Government’s endorsement to theReserve Bank’s target. In June 1995, in Accord Mark VIII, the ACTU agreed to aim for wageincreases that were compatible with an inflation outcome of 2 to 3 per cent. Thus, Australia wasgradually arriving at a very satisfactory position whereby most of the monetary policy regimewas now receiving bilateral support - a huge improvement on the situation in the early 1990s.5. Improving the governance of monetary policyThis is the third and last of the areas of monetary policy that needed to be clarifiedand improved. Returning to the nautical analogy introduced in the first section - this areaconcerns the question of who should be at the helm now that the vessel has been made seaworthyand equipped with a reliable navigation system? Most listeners will recognise that this boilsdown to the much-discussed subject of central bank independence, to which I promised to return.Although there has been a worldwide movement towards greater central bankindependence over the past decade, I propose only to talk about the aspects that have been uniqueto Australia. One of the peculiarities of the Australian debate on this subject is that the ReserveBank, by virtue of its Act in 1959, was always given a high degree of general independence as aninstitution.31 The fact that it had been unable to exercise this independence in monetary policyfor much of the post-war period was due to a practical impediment - it did not possess theinstruments of monetary policy. In the heavily regulated financial world which characterisedmost of the post-war period, virtually all the instruments - in the form of interest rate controls ongovernment debt and on bank lending and borrowing rates - were vested in the Treasurer. It wasnot until deregulation was largely completed in the mid-1980s that the Reserve Bank was in aposition to exercise the monetary policy powers contained in its Act. Only when it becamepossible to use open market operations to “set” the overnight cash rate, was the Reserve Bank ina position to adjust monetary policy in the same manner as (say) the Federal Reserve Board inthe United States or the Bundesbank in Germany.This development occurred at about the same time as the intellectual case forcentral bank independence was gaining momentum in major economies around the world.32 But,just as in the case of inflation targeting, the issue of central bank independence in Australia alsogot caught up in the political crossfire between the same two parties. It is perfectly reasonablethat it should become a political issue, because it is about the optimal delegation ofdecision-making authority, a decision which rightly rests with the Government. While the Bankthroughout the 1990s had independence, the political stand-off delayed its official recognition fora period longer than the delay of the Government’s recognition of the inflation target. The final                                                     31 Phillips (1992) and Macfarlane (1996).32 A much earlier expression of the case for central bank independence can be found in Professor Shann’s pieceon monetary policy, where he wrote … “My main theme is that central banking can give a community and,indeed, a world economy stable money …, if the politicians will give it fair scope and if men of technical skilland professional morale are given charge of the job with a judicial security of tenure.” Note that this waswritten in the middle of the Depression and that the stable money to which he referred meant principally theavoidance of deflation. Shann (1933).
- 12 -BIS Review   73/1998recognition was not achieved until after a change of government had occurred. In August 1996,the present Treasurer and I signed the Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy which setout the Government’s recognition of the Reserve Bank’s independence and support for theinflation target.There is still a lingering misconception in Australia that parties of the politicalright support central bank independence and that those of the left oppose it. This is a peculiarlyAustralian perspective based on our experience in the early 1990s; it is not true at present, wasnot at an earlier date33 and has not been the case in other countries. The two best knownexamples of countries adopting central bank independence are New Zealand, where thelegislation was introduced by the Lange Labour Government, and in France, where it wasintroduced by the Socialist Administration of President Mitterand. In the United Kingdom, theConservative Government resisted granting independence to the Bank of England to the end, butthe incoming Blair Labour Government introduced it as one of its first Acts. In all of these threecases, unlike Australia, new legislation was required because the existing Acts did not providefor independence.6. ConclusionsI have covered a full quarter of a century in this account, and have attempted to fillin some of the political, as well as the intellectual, background. It has been an eventful quarter ofa century for monetary policy, but one where a lot of progress has been made. Some of thisimprovement has been easy because the starting point was so bad - the mid-1970s to late-1970ssaw inflation peak at 20 per cent, while unemployment was rising and economic growth wasgoing through its most sluggish phase in the post-war period. Today’s economic environment isextremely benign in comparison to those days, even though, like then, we have the threat of anexternal shock hanging over us.When my account starts, not only were monetary institutions inadequate, butmonetary policy was not held to be very important. Fiscal policy was given precedence, andmonetary policy played a subsidiary role. In those circumstances, it is not surprising that themonetary framework was not well developed, and that little public attention was focused on it.By the time monetarism arrived on the Australian scene, this all changed. Monetary policybecame regarded as extremely important and much attention was focused on it. As we have seen,this attention eventually increased so that by the late 1980s-early 1990s, monetary policy hadbecome an intensely political subject. Not only was the conduct perceived as political, but thedesign of its institutions had become important enough to form a major part of the electoralplatform of one of the major political parties.Finally, we have entered a phase where a measure of peace has returned. Theday-to-day conduct of monetary policy is still closely scrutinised by the markets and the media,but attitudes to the underlying institutions and framework have reached a measure of bipartisansupport. With the reduction in controversy, monetary policy has gained a degree of credibilitythat seemed out of the question a decade ago.Of course, it is not only the bipartisan acceptance of the framework that hascontributed to the increase in credibility. The larger reason is that Australia has returned to the                                                     33 Under the Fraser Coalition Government (1975 to 1983), monetary policy decisions were taken by theMonetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Cabinet - the opposite of central bank independence.
- 13 -BIS Review   73/1998ranks of low inflation countries, so the underlying grievance of the majority of the ReserveBank’s critics has been removed.Economic historians who look back over the past quarter of a century may well besurprised by the huge role played by inflation in shaping our attitudes to monetary policy. Theyshould not be surprised. Just as the deflation of the thirties was the dominant macro-economicevent of the first half of this century, the rise of inflation in the 1970s was the dominant event ofthe second half of the century. So much of recent monetary policy thought has simply been aresponse to that event, just as Keynes provided the response to the earlier event. What will be thenext challenge? Already, monetary thought is recognising that there are more things to centralbanking than a single-minded pre-occupation with inflation. The recent events in Asia havetaught us that the avoidance of financial crises is as important. In Japan, we are confronting thespectre of deflation, which we all thought had been left behind after the war. It would befascinating to know what the defining event will be in the next quarter of a century.
BIS Review   72/1998Mr. Duisenberg’s opening statement at the meeting of the Governing Councilof the European Central Bank   Introductory statement by the President of the EuropeanCentral Bank, Dr. W. F. Duisenberg, at the press conference held in Frankfurt on 11/9/98.Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report not onlyon the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, butalso - as you are already aware - on the outcome of the meetings of the Governing Council andthe General Council that took place on 1 September 1998. It was in view of the short time spanbetween the two sets of meetings that we decided that it would be more efficient to hold only onepress conference to provide you with a summary of our deliberations.It is my intention to continue this practice for the remaining meetings of this year.In this regard, the Governing Council will meet, not only as scheduled on 13 October, 3November and 1 December 1998, but there will also be an additional meeting on Tuesday, 22December 1998. By this time, the bulk of nearly five years of preparatory work - including the“EMI years” - will be behind us and I envisage that the Governing Council’s final meeting beforethe start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will be devoted to fine-tuningits last-minute preparations. You will recall that monetary policy decisions remain a nationalcompetence until 31 December 1998. Looking ahead to next year, the Governing Council willhold fortnightly meetings and I intend to hold a press conference, normally, once a month. Forthe first quarter of 1999, I envisage holding a press conference immediately after the firstmeeting of each month. Further details of the meetings schedule are provided in the separatepress release that will be issued to you this evening.Let me, however, return to the present. The Governing Council and the GeneralCouncil devoted part of their September meetings to an extended exchange of views on recenteconomic, monetary and financial developments. In particular, much attention was paid to theglobal economic and financial environment of the future euro area, which has clearly worsened.Two major factors are currently affecting capital markets. First, the “flight into quality”. Second -and related - the tendency to switch from equities to bonds. As evidenced once again over thepast few days by large swings in investor sentiment, the monetary policy environment hasbecome more uncertain.One focal aspect of the discussion has been a close monitoring of the financialcrisis in Russia. As we all know, the Russian crisis has added to concerns regarding the state ofthe world economy at a time when the crisis in Asia is still ongoing and growth in Japan isnegative. These concerns have been fuelled by renewed strains in international financial marketsas well as sharp fluctuations and downward corrections in major stock markets. There is nodoubt that these developments will have a dampening effect on the world economy. However,their precise impact is difficult to measure at the current juncture.On the one hand, economic and model-based analysis still suggests only moderateeffects on prices and output in the euro area. This is due to the fact that, first, most of the crisisregions are quite small in economic terms, i.e. when compared with world GDP or theircontribution to world trade. Second, trade links between these countries and the euro area arealso of limited size. Third, the euro area itself is a very large economy, which is only directlyexposed to variations in global trade to a certain degree. However, on the other hand, thisanalysis should not mislead us. We are perfectly aware that the risks associated with currentglobal developments go beyond those effects which we can measure directly. In this respect onemay think of indirect influences resulting from changes in confidence, saving and expenditure
- 2 -BIS Review   72/1998within the euro area. We have to take these risks seriously and analyse the situation soberly, butwe should also not dramatise.Let me now turn to the latest available data. These seem to indicate that economicexpansion within the euro area has remained broadly on track, despite the worsening of theexternal environment. Domestic demand remains strong, while the contribution to growth fromnet exports has declined. Both private consumption and investment provided an importantstimulus to the growth rate in the first quarter of this year. More up-to-date indicators pointtowards continued expansion in the second quarter, albeit at a possibly more moderate pace thanin the first quarter.The outlook on consumption is supported by higher real earnings growth anddeclining unemployment, and is reflected in consumer confidence. The evidence for thecorporate sector is perhaps more mixed. As compared to the first quarter of 1998, industrialproduction figures show a somewhat slower rate of increase in the period from April to May, butcapacity utilisation has continued to increase and this, combined with low interest rates, shouldunderpin investment. European Commission survey data, such as confidence indicators and theassessment of order books, bear witness to relatively high levels, both with respect to their long-term averages and recent peaks. This can also be taken as a favourable indicator for continuedgrowth in the short term, although some indicators have not improved further since the spring.Unemployment has also been declining, but at a modest pace, and from a high level. Indiscussing the cyclical uncertainties, one should not forget that work on badly needed structuralreforms has not so far made much progress.Considering recent price developments, HICP inflation for the euro area as awhole remained stable at 1.4% between May and July. Both domestic and external factors stillappear to be favourable, suggesting that euro area inflation may be expected to remain subduedin the future. An important external factor underlying the favourable prospects for inflation is thesharp decline in oil and commodity prices, which is partly associated with developments in Asia.Moreover, domestic sources of inflation, such as those arising from the labour market situationand capacity utilisation, are also relatively moderate at the present juncture. In my opinion,taking a euro area wide perspective, these views are also broadly compatible with currentmonetary and financial developments. In this connection, please take note that we should soonhave new information on monetary developments on the basis of the new statistical reportingframework for money and banking.The environment of significant volatility in international financial markets,particularly stock markets, appears to account for much of the recent decline in long-term interestrates in the euro area to historically low levels, as investors have sought to protect themselvesagainst heightened global risk. Nonetheless, it is notable that the euro area yield curve shifteddownwards at all maturities, which to some extent would tend to indicate a further decline inlong-term inflation expectations for the euro area as a whole.As we approach the start of Stage Three, we shall need to continue to monitorclosely economic, monetary and financial developments within the euro area and in the worldeconomy. This will allow us eventually to set the interest rate for the euro area as a whole. At thesame time, we shall also need to monitor fiscal intentions in the euro area Member States, as theywill become more transparent over the autumn. If governments merely adhere to previous deficittargets for 1999, the structural position of budgets in quite a number of countries wouldeffectively deteriorate. This would entail that they would move farther away from, rather than
- 3 -BIS Review   72/1998approach, the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, which calls for the achievement of abudget close to balance or even in surplus.In addition to the review of economic developments, a number of organisationalissues were settled.(i) The General Council adopted its Rules of Procedure, which will be publishedin the Official Journal of the European Communities. You will recall that I informed you that theGoverning Council’s Rules of Procedure were adopted in July.(ii) The General Council also decided that the non-euro area national central banksshall pay up 5% of their subscriptions to the capital of the European Central Bank (ECB).However, the four national central banks concerned will not be asked actually to pay in theirshare as the amount due is less than they can expect to receive as their share in the proceeds ofthe liquidation of the European Monetary Institute (EMI). Further details on the actual amountsinvolved are provided in the separate handout that will be issued to you this evening.(iii) For its part, the Governing Council completed the list of committees whichwill assist in the work of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). In addition to theeleven ESCB Committees agreed upon at the meeting in July, the Governing Council decided toestablish an International Relations Committee and a Budget Committee. The latter was set up inorder to provide transparency to the shareholders of the ECB - the national central banks - onmatters relating to the budget of the ECB.(iv) Finally, the Governing Council endorsed the draft Headquarters Agreementbetween the German Federal Government and the ECB, which will be signed here in Frankfurton 18 September 1998.A number of decisions were also taken with regard to various aspects of thepreparatory work for Stage Three.(a) Exchange rate policy co-operation between the euro area and other EU countriesThe General Council endorsed the text of an Agreement between the ECB and thenon-euro area national central banks, laying down the operating procedures for an exchange ratemechanism in Stage Three (the so-called ERM II). You will recall that the European Council inAmsterdam in June last year agreed to set up an exchange rate mechanism in Stage Three toreplace the present European Monetary System (EMS). For this reason, the EMI had, on behalfof the ECB, prepared a draft Central Bank Agreement to replace the current exchange ratemechanism (ERM I, if you like) by a new one in Stage Three. It is this Agreement which hasnow been signed by the President of the ECB and the Governors of the four non-euro areanational central banks. The signature by the latter implies their agreement to the operatingprocedures. It does not, however, imply their participation in ERM II.Further details on the conventions and procedures for ERM II are provided in theseparate press release that is being issued to you this evening. The Agreement itself will bepublished in the Official Journal of the European Communities.(b) Monetary policy issues
- 4 -BIS Review   72/1998The Governing Council agreed on several issues relating to the monetary policyframework in Stage Three. At the centre of this framework is the report entitled “The singlemonetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instrumentsand procedures”, which contains a detailed description of the monetary policy instruments andprocedures to be applied by the ESCB in Stage Three. The report expands on and updates thematerial included in an earlier version of the report that was published by the EMI in September1997. I should like to limit my remarks in this regard to the announcement that a copy of thiscomprehensive report will be released very shortly, at which time a separate press releaseexplaining the nature and purpose of the documentation will be issued.The Governing Council also agreed upon a guideline for the management of theforeign exchange assets by the national central banks and for the Member States’ transactionswith their foreign exchange working balances. These are now being formalised in official legaldocumentation.(c) StatisticsThe Governing Council endorsed the statistical framework on the basis of anumber of reports that had been prepared by the EMI - many of which had been published in thepast - thereby confirming the ECB’s statistical requirements for Stage Three. I should perhapspoint out that the reporting framework for the money and banking statistics of the ECB willappear in the “General Documentation” that will be released next Wednesday.(d) Euro banknotesWith regard to the euro banknotes, the Governing Council confirmed (in line withprevious recommendations by the EMI) that seven banknote denominations would be issued: 5,10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500. Furthermore, it decided that there would not be any nationalfeatures on the euro banknotes. As you know, the euro banknotes will be put into circulation on1 January 2002. Thus there are fewer than 800 working days to go before their launch. TheGoverning Council took note that the technical preparations for the euro banknotes areproceeding according to schedule. The origination phase (i.e. the process of converting thedesigns into proof-prints) has now been successfully concluded and a zero-production run will beconducted in the autumn before mass production starts in early 1999.(e) Payment systemsThe Governing Council endorsed a list of eligible securities settlement systemsfollowing an assessment of such systems against standards that had previously been laid downfor their use in the credit operations of the ESCB. The list, which indicates those securitiessettlement systems that will be used by the ESCB and the conditions for their use, will be set outin the “General Documentation”, to which I have already referred. In addition, the GoverningCouncil approved a report on the “Assessment of EU securities settlement systems against thestandards for their use in ESCB credit operations”. It is intended to release this report during thenext couple of weeks.
BIS Review   71/1998Mr. Gramlich reviews the benefits and problems of world capital flowsRemarks by Mr. Edward M. Gramlich, a member of the Board of Governors of the US FederalReserve System, on “World Capital Flows” at the Carnegie Bosch Institute, University Center atCarnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on 15/9/98.For many years it has been clear that free trade is generally more efficienteconomically than protection. There are still huge political fights within countries about tradepolicies, and there may be occasions when countries are better off deviating from free trade, but freetrade normally wins the economic high ground in most policy arguments.But that is not true, or not as true, for international capital flows. Large increases inworld debt levels combined with inadequate management of foreign currency risks have led to acollapse of banking systems in country after country, massive changes in exchange rates, and arecession or depression in much of the world economy. In view of these provocations, manyobservers are now re-examining their preconceptions that free international capital flows areoptimal. Particular countries such as Malaysia are clamping on exchange controls, free tradeeconomists such as Paul Krugman are suggesting currency controls as a least bad option, a goodmany others are recommending distortionary taxes on some capital flows, and almost everybody is atleast re-examining their preconceptions.But before this process goes too far, I would like to enter a contrary plea. There areclear problems with the present system of international lending and borrowing. But there are clearand important benefits as well. We know what the problems are. Let’s fix them as soon as possible,and try to preserve the important benefits of international capital flows.The Benefits of World Capital FlowsLet me start with the benefits of world capital flows. Much of this is standardneoclassical economics, but it bears repeating in these troubled times. Countries’ saving andinvestment propensities can differ markedly around the world. If economies were closed to capitalflows, domestic interest rates would equilibrate saving and investment in each country. Theseinterest rates would vary widely, which means that capital would have a different marginal value ineach country.Suppose now the world were to be opened up to capital flows. Capital would flowout of those countries with low interest rates, where investment prospects are scarce compared todomestic saving, and towards countries where interest rates are high, where investment prospects areabundant relative to domestic saving. Countries that import capital would benefit from a greaterstock of high productivity investments. Countries that export capital would put their saving to betteruse. Both countries would gain, and the world economy would also gain because scarce saving isbetter allocated to capital markets around the world.This all may sound a bit academic, but the process has been very important in theworld’s economic development. Countries undergoing development can sometimes squeeze therequisite saving out of their poor economies, as the United Kingdom did in the 19th century andJapan did in the 20th century. Or they can import capital to supplement domestic saving, as theUnited States, Canada, and Australia did in the 19th century and several countries in Eastern Europeand Asia have done in the 20th century. This imported capital has been very important in the world’sdevelopment process, and it has often brought with it other benefits, such as the internationalspreading of technological improvements. Without world capital flows, the general level ofdevelopment in the world would be far less.Problems
- 2 -BIS Review   71/1998If that’s the story, what’s the problem? Why do world capital markets seem to becausing such anguish, in country after country? Why are countries turning away from open capitalmarkets? It turns out that there is some fine print that goes with the neoclassical model, and theworld economy has had some trouble with the fine print. Here are some of the ways.• Exchange rate volatility. Countries trade in different currencies, and exchangerates are necessary to make the conversions. But in addition to being the devicesfor converting currencies, exchange rates play another important role in theworld economy - they also represent the mechanisms for bringing countries pricestructures in line in international trade. Suppose one country’s prices are too highfor it to compete in world trade, either because it has suffered an adverse tradeshock, has had too much inflation, has too rigid labor contracts, or for someother reason. The country can suffer a painful recession to get its prices back inline. Or it can let its currency depreciate. Depreciations are not absolutelynecessary, as is asserted by advocates of fixed exchange rates. But depreciations,or currency fluctuations in general, are often far less costly ways to makeinternational adjustments. The next time you hear someone complain aboutexchange rate changes, ask them what else they had in mind to restoreinternational equilibrium.While exchange rate changes have this potentially stabilizing effect, they canalso be destabilizing. When exchange rates are allowed to fluctuate, they are setin currency markets according to the demands and supplies of forward-lookingtraders, and they can be very volatile, often overshooting long-term values. Thisvolatility can destabilize trade and impart significant uncertainty to internationallending. Borrowers may borrow in international markets expecting to repay atone exchange rate, and when the bill comes due, the exchange rate may differ,by a lot. Lenders and borrowers can both hedge, but hedging is costly, andinstitutions providing this hedge can go broke.• Financial institutions. Financial institutions engage in what is known as maturitytransformation. They take deposits from you and me, which deposits can beredeemed any time we take out our check book, and make long-term loans tomortgage borrowers and businesses. There are fantastic efficiencies in thisprocess - consumers can get higher returns on their saving, and business canborrow and invest in productive equipment. Indeed, banks and other financialinstitutions play the same role in allocating domestic saving to its best uses thatthe international capital market plays for international capital.But as with capital flows, there are risks. If the banks’ loans go bad, theinstitution is in trouble and may not be able to redeem deposits. Within acountry’s borders there are often institutions such as deposit insurance to protectsavers, but internationally the risks can be greater.Given that banks are involved in the domestic saving, investment process, it isnot surprising that they have become heavily involved in the internationalsaving, investment process. In general this process too has led to worldwideefficiencies, but here too there are risks. In Japan, for example, the banks havebeen hurt by a massive decline in real estate and other values, which have putmany nonperforming loans on their books. In Korea and Indonesia, the bankswere hurt by the foreign currency exposure of their borrowers.
- 3 -BIS Review   71/1998• Incentive effects. Incentive effects are always important in economics, generallycomplicating the analysis of policy measures. Nowhere is this as true as withinternational capital flows.One incentive problem involves what is known as moral hazard. Supposenational governments do intervene to protect the safety and soundness of banks.That intervention might seem sensible, but it could inspire more risky lending bythe banks, to let the government pick up the tab if things go bad. A secondproblem involves unilateral default on loan payments or currency obligations.Defaults would appear to benefit debtors, but in the long run these debtors willhave trouble getting new credit. Or contagion effects. Even if one borrower isperfectly sound, if other borrowers like it go under, lenders will be reluctant tolend to similarly classified borrowers. Discussions of international capital flowsabound with these incentive effects.• Transparency. A last issue involves transparency. For the international capitalmarket to work well, lenders must know the risks and rewards. They must knowthe aggregate debt of a country, the exchange rate risks they are taking, and theon and off-balance sheet liabilities of all relevant banks. When they do not havea good picture of these risks, they can get into serious trouble.While the world financial crisis has hit with uneven force in various countries, andwhile local situations have differed, the interaction between these four elements has almost alwaysbeen critical. Sometimes big changes in exchange rates precipitated a crisis, sometimes big changesin asset values put the banks in trouble, sometimes moral hazard issues generated unsound loans, andalmost everywhere there was a lack of transparency. Once a crisis got going, unilateral defaults andcontagion effects spread it to other countries. The result was a broadscale financial collapse, whichthen fed over to the real sector and caused bankruptcies, credit restraints, and recessions. These realincome losses in turn magnified the financial problems.SolutionsAre there any solutions to this mess? Many are calling for an end to open capitalmarkets, as if the benefits are not worth the costs. Others are calling for distortionary taxes, toprotect countries from too much openness. Should we go part or all of the way back to closedeconomies?I remain an optimist and I think not. There may be occasional instances where somerestrictions are necessary to control extreme capital flows not justified by economic fundamentals.Moreover, the world capital system clearly is in need of repair. But I hope we can repair it and getback to a world where saving in whatever country goes to the country that needs it most, and that canpay the most to the saver. And to a world where international capital flows are an important vehiclefor world economic development. Let me discuss some remedies that should help in that process.• Financial institutions. Two types of corrections are necessary. A first istantamount to preventive medicine - what should be done when institutions arenot in crisis? The basic need here is for better bank supervision. Supervisionmust be improved to insure that proper risk management techniques are put inplace and followed. Previous practices where banks, or those to whom banksmade loans, loaded up on short-term hard currency denominated liabilities mustbe curbed. Market discipline can also be used to control risk, by exposing
- 4 -BIS Review   71/1998financial institutions to as much market discipline as possible and by limitingmoral hazard problems.But even with all the preventive medicine in the world, the patient sometimesgets sick, and banks in Japan and a number of other countries surely are. What isto be done then?Examination of a number of historical episodes suggests that there are threeimportant elements to dealing with a banking collapse. First, the bank regulatorsmust go through the balance sheets, determine the problem loans, take them offthe banks’ balance sheets, sell them, and have the public take whatever losseswere entailed. Second, the troubled institutions must be closed down with themanagement replaced and shareholders suffering losses. Third, the healthyinstitutions must then be recapitalized, preferably by new equity sales in capitalmarkets. The sooner these steps are taken, the better. The longer they are nottaken, the longer troubled banks will continue incurring losses, engaging in riskypractices, threatening the safe institutions, generating contagion effects, and notperforming the banks’ all-important maturity transformation function. Indeed,here is a way foreign capital flows can be part of the solution to the problem,because new foreign-owned banks that can perform this maturity transformationfunction can be invited to participate in credit-starved economies.• Maturity transformation. While financial institutions perform maturitytransformation, there is no reason to unduly burden the system. Countries haveoften gotten into trouble when they have done too much maturitytransformation - that is, borrowed from abroad at short maturities to financelong-term investment. Steps could be taken to limit such borrowing, eithernationally or through bank supervision. Some economists have used this idea topropose taxes on short-term borrowing, though the tax rates necessary to do thejob could be very high and it might be more effective to use orthodox principlesof bank supervision.• Transparency. A further set of corrective mechanisms involves greatertransparency. It must be clearer to lenders and borrowers alike what risks theyare taking. This requires better reporting by financial institutions, and it alsorequires better aggregate statistics on the uncommitted foreign reserve balancesof individual countries. Transparency alone cannot do the job of good bankregulation, but it is hard to imagine a solution to the international lendingproblems of the day without more transparent accounting.• The IMF. Last but not least I discuss the IMF. Frankly, my own feeling is that ifan institution like the IMF did not exist, we would want to invent something likeit. Here is an international institution that, at least in principle, can supervise thefinances of different countries without the accusations of big brother that wouldcome about if the United States alone tried to put itself in this role. Moreover, itcan organize other lending countries to bring support to countries in need ofliquidity assistance, as opposed to having the bill fall entirely on the UnitedStates.Supporting the existence of something like the IMF does not suggest agreementwith its exact structure or with all of its policies. The present crisis indicates thatinternational preventive medicine provisions are weak. It may be difficult for the
- 5 -BIS Review   71/1998IMF to perform this warning system role, but there is clearly a need for betterwarnings about the risks of lending to certain countries, to prevent currencyvulnerabilities from building up as much as they did. The IMF’s “one size fitsall” recommendations of fiscal austerity should also be re-examined, because inmany Asian countries expansionary fiscal policies were clearly called for -indeed, still are called for - while the IMF initially recommended the reverse.But the two biggest criticisms of the IMF involve the moral hazard issue andexchange rate flexibility. On moral hazard, the criticism is more or lessinevitable. Any time there is any governmental attempt to increase safety andsoundness, moral hazard questions can be raised. In the case of the IMF, if it isthere to bail out countries in a liquidity crisis, countries will be more likely toend up in liquidity crises. The answer, it seems to me, is for the IMF to attachtight conditions on its lending, so that countries will certainly not look forwardto getting into debtor status. In terms of underlying structural change, this is oneof the few leverage points the international lending community has on borrowingcountries, and it is important for the IMF to use its tool well.On exchange rate flexibility, the problem with the critics is that they are notsaying the same thing. Some say the IMF is too quick to let the exchange ratefall, some say it is not quick enough. Both cannot be right at the same time.As a general rule, the exchange rate flexibility issue is a hard one and it is hardto make broad recommendations. Sometimes a country’s cost structure is clearlyout of line, or its inflation rate is clearly too high, and exchange rate flexibilityseems to be the least costly way to bring prices and wages back into line. Butexchange rate flexibility will cause capital losses and will raise the cost and riskof future capital transactions. That does not mean that the exchange rate must bepreserved at all costs, but it does mean that capital flows themselves put someconstraints on the normal international adjustment mechanisms. Given all this, itis hard for me to take a firm policy on exchange flexibility, and I have somesympathy for the apparent open-mindedness of the IMF on the issue.Will these solutions be enough? Who knows. But I think we all have a stake inmaking the world capital system work better. Before we initiate more artificial restrictions on capitalflows, we should try to improve the system to take advantage of its very large benefits.
BIS Review   70/1998Bank of Japan’s September report of Recent Economic and FinancialDevelopments   BANK OF JAPAN COMMUNICATION, 11/9/98.The Bank’s View1Japan’s economic conditions continue to deteriorate.With respect to final demand, public investment seems to have bottomed out. Netexports (exports minus imports) are increasing mainly due to a decline in imports. However,business fixed investment has been decreasing significantly, and housing investment has declinedfurther. Private consumption has not yet shown a recovery despite the special income tax reduction.Against this background of weak final demand, production has been reduced substantially. As aresult, some industries have shown improvements in inventory adjustments, but the level ofinventories is still high as a whole. With the decline in expenditure and production, corporate profitscontinue to decrease, and the decline of employee income is accelerating somewhat. In addition, theratio of job offers to applications records a historically low level, and the unemployment rateremains at a high level. As a whole, the employment and income conditions have deterioratedfurther.As the above indicates, there are continued negative interactions of production,income, and expenditure. Given the current considerably low level of economic activities, theeconomy is unlikely to transit immediately to a self-sustained recovery led by private demand,although a further deterioration in the economy is expected to cease gradually from the effects of thecomprehensive economic stimulus package. Additionally, attention should be paid to possiblenegative effects on the real economy from financial developments including the recent fall in stockprices. In these circumstances, the cabinet approved a guideline on budget requests by ministries forfiscal 1999. This guideline intends to stimulate the economy by allocating ¥4 trillion to the specialbudgetary provision on the condition that the Fiscal Structural Reform Act is suspended. In addition,the bills to rebuild the stability of the financial system are being deliberated at the Diet, and thereduction exceeding ¥6 trillion in personal income taxes and corporate taxes is expected to bediscussed in detail. The materialization of these policies along with their effects on corporate andhousehold sentiment should be carefully monitored.With regard to prices, wholesale prices are on a downtrend, and consumer prices arelowering below the previous year’s level. With respect to the outlook, the downward pressure fromdomestic factors is unlikely to weaken considerably reflecting the already large output gap, despitethe expected effects of the comprehensive economic stimulus package. Hence, prices are likely to beweak for some time.In the financial markets, stock prices dropped considerably in late August and stillremain unstable, due to the heightened uncertainty over the problems with the financial system andthe worldwide stock market plunge triggered by Russia’s financial crisis. Meanwhile, interest ratespreads, such as the rate differential between Euro-yen deposits and treasury bills, the Japanpremium, and the yield differential between private and government bonds, expanded against thebackground of intensified market concern toward credit risks of Japanese financial institutions.Nevertheless, both long- and short-term interest rates declined slightly as a whole, which seeminglyindicates that some market participants anticipated additional monetary easing.                                                     1 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary PolicyMeeting held on September 9, as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
- 2 -BIS Review   70/1998With respect to corporate finance, some firms are moving to resume securingon-hand liquidity against the cautious lending stance of private banks, although credit demand forreal economic activities remains sluggish. Consequently, the issuance of corporate bonds andcommercial paper continues to increase, and the private bank lending, measured by annual percentchanges, has escaped further decline so far. In addition, the growth of money stock appears to holdback its recent decelerating trend.However, some firms, especially small and medium-sized ones, continue to face asevere environment in terms of both funds availability and fund-raising costs. This influence on theeconomy continues to warrant careful monitoring.
BIS Review   69/1998Mr. Greenspan considers whether there has been a profound andfundamental alteration in the way the economy works in the United States  Remarks by theChairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, atthe Haas Annual Business Faculty Research Dialogue, University of California, Berkeley,California on 4/9/98.Question: Is There a New Economy?The question posed for this lecture of whether there is a new economy reachesbeyond the obvious: Our economy, of course, is changing everyday, and in that sense it is always“new”. The deeper question is whether there has been a profound and fundamental alteration inthe way our economy works that creates discontinuity from the past and promises a significantlyhigher path of growth than we have experienced in recent decades.The question has arisen because the economic performance of the United States inthe past five years has in certain respects been unprecedented. Contrary to conventional wisdomand the detailed historic economic modelling on which it is based, it is most unusual for inflationto be falling this far into a business expansion.Many of the imbalances observed during the few times in the past that a businessexpansion has lasted more than seven years are largely absent today. To be sure, labor marketsare unusually tight, and we should remain concerned that pressures in these markets could spillover to costs and prices. But, to date, they have not.Moreover, it is just not credible that the United States can remain an oasis ofprosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly increased stress. Developmentsoverseas have contributed to holding down prices and aggregate demand in the United States inthe face of strong domestic spending. As dislocations abroad mount, feeding back on ourfinancial markets, restraint is likely to intensify. In the spring and early summer, the FederalOpen Market Committee was concerned that a rise in inflation was the primary threat to thecontinued expansion of the economy. By the time of the Committee’s August meeting, the riskshad become balanced, and the Committee will need to consider carefully the potentialramifications of ongoing developments since that meeting.Some of those who advocate a “new economy” attribute it generally totechnological innovations and breakthroughs in globalization that raise productivity and proffernew capacity on demand and that have, accordingly, removed pricing power from the world’sproducers on a more lasting basis.There is, clearly, an element of truth in this proposition. In the United States, forexample, a technologically driven decline is evident in the average lead times on the purchase ofnew capital equipment that has kept capacity utilization at moderate levels and virtuallyeliminated most of the goods shortages and bottlenecks that were prevalent in earlier periods ofsustained strong economic growth.But, although there doubtless have been profound changes in the way we organizeour capital facilities, engage in just-in-time inventory regimes, and intertwine our newlysophisticated risk-sensitive financial system into this process, there is one important caveat to thenotion that we live in a new economy, and that is human psychology.
- 2 -BIS Review   69/1998The same enthusiasms and fears that gripped our forebears, are, in every way,visible in the generations now actively participating in the American economy. Human actionsare always rooted in a forecast of the consequences of those actions. When the future becomessufficiently clouded, people eschew actions and disengage from previous commitments. To besure, the degree of risk aversion differs from person to person, but judging the way prices behavein today’s markets compared with those of a century or more ago, one is hard pressed to findsignificant differences. The way we evaluate assets, and the way changes in those values affectour economy, do not appear to be coming out of a set of rules that is different from the one thatgoverned the actions of our forebears.Hence, as the first cut at the question “Is there a new economy?” the answer in amore profound sense is no. As in the past, our advanced economy is primarily driven by howhuman psychology moulds the value system that drives a competitive market economy. And thatprocess is inextricably linked to human nature, which appears essentially immutable and, thus,anchors the future to the past.But having said that, important technological changes have been emerging inrecent years that are altering, in ways with few precedents, the manner in which we organizeproduction, trade across countries, and deliver value to consumers.To explore the significance of those changes and their relevance to the possibilityof a “new economy”, we need to first detail some key features of our system.The American economy, like all advanced capitalist economies, is continually inthe process of what Joseph Schumpeter, a number of decades ago, called “creative destruction”.Capital equipment, production processes, financial and labor market infrastructure, and thewhole panoply of private institutions that make up a market economy are always in a state of flux-- in almost all cases evolving into more efficient regimes.The capital stock -- the plant and equipment that facilitates our production ofgoods and services -- can be viewed, with only a little exaggeration, as continuously being torndown and rebuilt.Our capital stock and the level of skills of our workforce are effectively beingupgraded as competition presses business managements to find increasingly innovative andefficient ways to meet the ever-rising demands of consumers for quantity, quality, and variety.Supply and demand have been interacting over the generations in a competitive environment topropel standards of living higher. Indeed, this is the process that, in fits and starts, hascharacterized our and other market economies since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.Earlier, standards of living barely changed from one generation to the next.This is the tautological sense in which every evolving market economy, our ownincluded, is always, in some sense, “new”, as we struggle to increase standards of living.In the early part of the 19th century, the United States, as a developing country,borrowed much technology and savings from Europe to get a toehold on the growth ladder. Butover the past century, America has moved to the cutting edge of technology.There is no question that events are continually altering the shape and nature ofour economic processes, especially the extent to which technological breakthroughs have
- 3 -BIS Review   69/1998advanced and perhaps, most recently, even accelerated the pace of conceptualization of our grossdomestic product. We have dramatically reduced the size of our radios, for example, bysubstituting transistors for vacuum tubes. Thin fiber-optic cable has replaced huge tonnages ofcopper wire. New architectural, engineering, and materials technologies have enabled theconstruction of buildings enclosing the same space but with far less physical material than wasrequired, say, 50 or 100 years ago. Most recently, mobile phones have been markedly downsizedas they have been improved. As a consequence, the physical weight of our GDP is growing onlyvery gradually. The exploitation of new concepts accounts for virtually all of theinflation-adjusted growth in output.The cause of this dramatic shift toward product downsizing during the past halfcentury can only be surmised. Perhaps the physical limitations of accumulating goods andmoving them in an ever more crowded geographical environment resulted in cost pressures toeconomize on size and space. Similarly, perhaps it was the prospect of increasing costs ofprocessing ever larger quantities of physical resources that shifted producers toward downsizedalternatives. Remember, it was less than three decades ago that the Club of Rome issued its direwarnings about the prospects of running out of the physical resources that allegedly werenecessary to support our standards of living. Finally, as we moved the technological frontierforward and pressed for information processing to speed up, for example, the laws of physicsrequired the relevant microchips to become ever more compact.But what was always true in the past, and will remain so in the future, is that theoutput of a free market economy and the notion of wealth creation will reflect the valuepreferences of people. Indeed, the very concept of wealth has no meaning other than as areflection of human value preferences. There is no intrinsic value in wheat, a machine, or asoftware program. It is only as these products satisfy human needs currently, or are perceived tobe able do so in the future, that they are valued. And it is such value preferences, as they expressthemselves in the market’s key signals -- product and asset prices -- that inform producers ofwhat is considered valuable and, together with the state of technology, what could be profitablyproduced.To get back to basics, the value of any physical production facility depends on theperceived value of the goods and services that the facility is projected to produce. More formally,the current value of the facility can be viewed as the sum of the discounted value of all futureoutputs, net of costs.An identical physical facility with the same capacity to produce can have differentvalues in the marketplace at different times, depending on the degree to which the investingpublic feels confident about the ability of the firm to perceive and respond to the futureenvironments in which the plant will be turning out goods and services. The value of a steel mill,which has an unchanging ability to turn out sheet steel, for example, can vary widely in themarketplace depending on the level of interest rates, the overall rate of inflation, and a number ofother factors that have nothing to do with the engineering aspects of the production of steel.What matters is how investors view the markets into which the steel from the mill is expected tobe sold over the years ahead. When that degree of confidence in judging the future is high,discounted future values also are high -- and so are the prices of equities, which, of course, arethe claims on our productive assets.The forces that shape the degree of confidence are largely endogenous to aneconomic process that is generally self-correcting as consumers and investors interact with acontinually changing market reality. I do not claim that all market behavior is a rational response
- 4 -BIS Review   69/1998to changes in the real world. But most of it must be. For, were it otherwise, the relatively stableeconomic environments that have been evident among the major industrial countries over thegenerations would not be possible.Certainly, the degree of confidence that future outcomes are perceivable andprojectable, and hence valued, depends in large part on the underlying political stability of anycountry with a market-oriented economy. Unless market participants are assured that their futurecommitments and contracts are protected by a rule of law, such commitments will not be made;productive efforts will be focused to address only the immediate short-term imperatives ofsurvival; and efforts to build an infrastructure to provide for future needs will be stunted.A society that protects claims to long-lived productive assets thereby surelyencourages their development. That spurs levels of production to go beyond the needs of themoment, the needs of immediate consumption, because claims on future production values willbe discounted far less than in an environment of political instability and, for example, a weak lawof contracts. At that point, the makings of a sophisticated economy based on longer-termcommitments are in place. It will be an economy that saves and invests -- that is, commits to thefuture -- and, hence, one that will grow.But every competitive market economy, even one solidly based on a rule of law, isalways in a state of flux, and its perceived productiveness is always subject to degrees ofuncertainty that are inevitably associated with endeavors to anticipate future outcomes.Thus, while the general state of confidence and consumers’ and investors’willingness to commit to long-term investment is buttressed by the perceptions of the stability ofthe society and economy, history demonstrates that that degree of confidence is subject to widevariations. Most of those variations are the result of the sheer difficulty in making judgmentsand, therefore, commitments about, and to, the future. On occasion, this very difficulty leads toless-disciplined evaluations, which foster price volatility and, in some cases, what we termmarket bubbles -- that is, asset values inflated more on the expectation that others will pay higherprices than on a knowledgeable judgment of true value.The behavior of market economies across the globe in recent years, especially inAsia and the United States, has underscored how large a role expectations have come to play inreal economic development. Economists use the term “time preference” to identify the broadertradeoff that individuals are willing to make, even without concern for risk, between currentconsumption and claims to future consumption. Measurable discount factors are intended tocapture in addition the various types of uncertainties that inevitably cloud the future.Dramatic changes in the latter underscore how human evaluation, interacting withthe more palpable changes in real output, can have profound effects on an economy, as theexperiences in Asia have so amply demonstrated during the past year.Vicious cycles have arisen across South-East Asia with virtually no notice. At onepoint, an economy would appear to be struggling, but no more than had been the case many timesin the past. The next moment, market prices and the economy appeared in free fall.Our experiences with these vicious cycles in Asia emphasize the key role in amarket economy of a critical human attribute: confidence or trust in the functioning of a marketsystem. Implicitly, we engage in a division of labor because we trust that others will produce andbe willing to trade the goods and services we do not produce ourselves.
- 5 -BIS Review   69/1998We take for granted that contracts will be fulfilled in the normal course ofbusiness, relying on the rule of law, especially the law of contracts. But if trust evaporated andevery contract had to be adjudicated, the division of labor would collapse. A key characteristic,perhaps the fundamental cause of a vicious cycle, is the loss of trust.We did not foresee such a breakdown in Asia. I suspect that the very nature of theprocess may make it virtually impossible to anticipate. It is like water pressing against a dam.Everything appears normal until a crack brings a deluge.The immediate cause of the breakdown was an evident pulling back from futurecommitments, arguably, the result of the emergence among international lenders of wideningdoubt that the dramatic growth evident among the Asian “tigers” could be sustained. Theemergence of excess worldwide capacity in semiconductors, a valued export for the tigers, mayhave been among the precipitating events. In any case, the initial rise in market uncertainty led toa sharp rise in discounts on future claims to income and, accordingly, falling prices of real estateand equities. The process became self-feeding as disengagement from future commitments led tostill greater disruption and uncertainty, rising risk premiums and discount factors, and a sharp fallin production.While the reverse phenomenon, a virtuous cycle, is not fully symmetrical, somepart is. Indeed, much of the current American economic expansion is best understood in thecontext of favorable expectations, interacting with production and finance to expand rather thanimplode economic processes.The American economic stability of the past five years has helped engenderincreasing confidence of future stability. This, in turn, has dramatically upgraded the stockmarket’s valuation of our economy’s existing productive infrastructure, adding about $6 trillionof capital gains to household net worth from early 1995 through the second quarter of this year.While the vast majority of these gains augmented retirement and other savingsprograms, enough spilled over into consumer spending to significantly lower the proportion ofhousehold income that consumers, especially upper income consumers, believed it necessary tosave.In addition, the longer the elevated level of stock prices was sustained, the moreconsumers likely viewed their capital gains as permanent increments to their net worth, and,hence, as spendable. The recent windfall financed not only higher personal consumptionexpenditures but home purchases as well. It is difficult to explain the recent record level of homesales without reference to earlier stock market gains.The rise in stock prices also meant a fall in the equity cost of capital that doubtlessraised the pace of new capital investment. Investment in new facilities had already been given amajor boost by the acceleration in technological developments, which evidently increased thepotential for profit in recent years. The sharp surge in capital outlays during the past five yearsapparently reflected the availability of higher rates of return on a broad spectrum of potentialinvestments owing to an acceleration in technological advances, especially in computer andtelecommunications applications.
- 6 -BIS Review   69/1998This is the apparent root of the recent evident quickened pace of productivityadvance. While the recent technological advances have patently added new and increasinglyflexible capacity, the ability of these technologies to improve the efficiency of productiveprocesses (an issue I will elaborate on shortly) has significantly reduced labor requirements perunit of output. This, no doubt, was one factor contributing to a dramatic increase in corporatedownsizing and reported widespread layoffs in the early 1990s. The unemployment rate alsobegan to fall as the pace of new hires to man the new facilities exceeded the pace of layoffs fromthe old.Parenthetically, the perception of increased churning of our workforce in the1990s has understandably increased the sense of accelerated job-skill obsolescence among asignificant segment of our workforce, especially among those most closely wedded to oldertechnologies. The pressures are reflected in a major increase in on-the-job training and adramatic expansion of college enrolment, especially at community colleges. As a result, theaverage age of full-time college students has risen dramatically in recent years as large numbersof experienced workers return to school for skill upgrading. But the sense of increasing skillobsolescence has also led to an apparent willingness on the part of employees to forgo wage andbenefit increases for increased job security. Thus, despite the incredible tightness of labormarkets, increases in compensation per hour have continued to be relatively modest.Coupled with the quickened pace of productivity growth, wage and benefitmoderation has kept growth in unit labor costs subdued in the current expansion. This has bothdamped inflation and allowed profit margins to reach high levels.That, in turn, apparently was the driving force beginning in early 1995 in securityanalysts’ significant upward revision of their company-by-company long-term earningsprojections. These upward revisions, coupled with falling interest rates, point to two keyunderlying forces that impelled investors to produce one of history’s most notable bull stockmarkets.But they are not the only forces. In addition, the sequence of greater capitalinvestment, productivity growth, and falling inflation fostered an ever more benevolent sense oflong-term stable growth. People were more confident about the future. The consequence was adramatic shrinkage in the so-called equity premium over the past two years to near historic lowsearlier this summer. The equity premium is the charge for the additional risks that marketsrequire to hold stocks rather than riskless debt instruments. When perceived risks of the futureare low, equity premiums are low and stock prices are even more elevated than would beindicated solely from higher expected long-term earnings growth and low riskless rates ofinterest.Thus, one key to the question of whether there is a new economy is whethercurrent expectations of future stability, which are distinctly more positive than say a decade ago,are justified by actual changes in the economy. For if expectations of greater stability are borneout, risk and equity premiums will remain low. In that case, the cost of capital will also remainlow, leading, at least for a time, to higher investment and faster economic growth.Two considerations are therefore critical to higher asset values and highereconomic growth. The first is whether the apparent upward shift in technological advance willpersist. The second is the extent of confidence in the stability of the future that consumers andinvestors will be able to sustain.
- 7 -BIS Review   69/1998With regard to the first: How fast can technology advance, augmenting the pool ofinvestment opportunities that have elevated rates of return, which engender still further increasesin expected long-term earnings? Technological breakthroughs, as history so amply demonstrates,are frustratingly difficult to discern much in advance. The particular synergies between new andolder technologies are generally too complex to anticipate.An innovation’s full potential may be realized only after extensive improvementsor after complementary innovations in other fields of science. According to Charles Townes, aNobel Prize winner for his work on the laser, the attorneys for Bell Labs initially, in the late1960s, refused to patent the laser because they believed it had no applications in the field oftelecommunications. Only in the 1980s, after extensive improvements in fiber-optics technology,did the laser’s importance for telecommunications become apparent.The future of technology advance may be difficult to predict, but for the periodahead there is the possibility that already proven technologies may not as yet have been fullyexploited. Company after company reports that, when confronted with cost increases in acompetitive environment that precludes price increases, they are able to offset those costs,seemingly at will, by installing the newer technologies.Such stories seem odd. If cost improvements were available at will earlier, whyweren’t the investments made earlier? This implies suboptimal business behavior, contrary towhat universities teach in Economics 101. But in the real world, companies rarely fullymaximize profits. They concentrate on only those segments of their businesses that appear tooffer the largest rewards and are rarely able to operate at the most efficient frontier on all frontssimultaneously. When costs rise, the attention of management presumably becomes focusedmore sharply on investments to limit the effects of rising costs.But if cost-cutting at will is, in fact, currently available, it suggests that a backlogof unexploited capital projects has been built up in recent years, which, if true, implies thepotential for continued gains in productivity close to the elevated rates of the last couple of years.Even if this is indeed the case, and only anecdotal evidence supports it, security analysts’ recentprojected per share earnings growth of more than 13 percent annually over the next three to fiveyears is unlikely to materialize. It would imply an ever-increasing share of profit in the nationalincome from a level that is already high by historic standards. Such conditions have led in thepast to labor market pressures that thwarted further profit growth.The second consideration with respect to how high asset values can rise is: Howfar can risk and equity premiums fall? A key factor is that price inflation has receded to quite lowlevels. The rising level of confidence in recent years concerning future outcomes has doubtlessbeen related to the fall in the rate of inflation that has, of course, also been a critical factor in thefall in interest rates and, importantly, the fall in equity premiums as well. Presumably, the onsetof deflation, should it occur, would increase uncertainty as much as a re-emergence of inflationconcerns. Thus, arguably, at near price stability, perceived risk from business-cycledevelopments would be at its lowest, and one must presume that would be the case for equitypremiums as well. In any event, there is a limit on how far investors can rationally favorablydiscount the future and therefore how low equity premiums can go. Current claims on a source ofincome available 20 or 30 years in the future still have current value. But should claims on thehereafter?
- 8 -BIS Review   69/1998An implication of high equity market values, relative to income and production, isan increased potential for instability. As I argued earlier, part of capital gains increasesconsumption and incomes. Since equity values are demonstrably more variable than incomes,when equity market values become large relative to incomes and GDP, their fluctuations can beexpected to effect GDP more than when equity market values are low.Clearly, the history of large swings in investor confidence and equity premiumsfor rational and other reasons counsels caution in the current context. We have relearned inrecent weeks that just as a bull stock market feels unending and secure as an economy and stockmarket move forward, so it can feel when markets contract that recovery is inconceivable. Both,of course, are wrong. But because of the difficulty imagining a turnabout when such emotionstake hold, periods of euphoria or distress tend to feed on themselves. Indeed, if this were not thecase, the types of psychologically driven ebbs and flows of economic activity we have observedwould be unlikely to exist.Perhaps, as some argue, history will be less of a guide than it has been in the past.Some of the future is always without historical precedent. New records are always being made.Having said all that, however, my experience of observing the American economy day by dayover the past half century suggests that most, perhaps substantially most, of the future can beexpected to rest on a continuum from the past. Human nature, as I indicated earlier, appearsimmutable over the generations and inextricably ties our future to our past.Nonetheless, as I indicated earlier, I would not deny that there doubtless has beenin recent years an underlying improvement in the functioning of America’s markets and in thepace of development of cutting edge technologies beyond previous expectations.Most impressive is the marked increase in the effectiveness in the 1990s of ourcapital stock, that is, our productive facilities, the issue to which I alluded earlier. While grossinvestment has been high, it has been, in recent years, composed to a significant extent ofshort-lived assets that depreciate rapidly. Thus, the growth of the net capital stock, despite itsrecent acceleration, remains well below the peak rates posted during the past half century.Despite the broadening in recent decades of international capital flows, empiricalevidence suggests that domestic investment still depends to a critical extent on domestic saving,especially at the margin. Many have argued persuasively, myself included, that we save too little.The relatively low propensity to save on the part of the American public has put a large premiumon the effective use of scarce capital, and on the winnowing out of the potentially leastproductive and, hence, the least profitable of investment opportunities.That is one of the reasons that our financial system, whose job it is to ensure theproductive use of physical capital, has been such a crucial part of our overall economy, especiallyover the past two decades. It is the signals reflected in financial asset prices, interest rates, andrisk spreads that have altered the structure of our output in recent decades towards a differentview of what consumers judge as value. This has imparted a significant derived value to afinancial system that can do that effectively and, despite recent retrenchments, to the stockmarket value of those individual institutions that make up that system.Clearly, our high financial returns on investment are a symptom that our physicalcapital is being allocated to produce products and services that consumers particularly value. Amachining facility that turns out an inferior product or a toll road that leads to nowhere will not
- 9 -BIS Review   69/1998find favor with the public, will earn subnormal or negative profits, and in most instances willexhibit an inability over the life of the asset to recover the cash plus cost of capital invested in it.Thus, while adequate national saving is a necessary condition for capitalinvestment and rising productivity and standards of living, it is by no means a sufficientcondition.The former Soviet Union, for example, had too much investment, and without thediscipline of market prices, they grossly misplaced it. The preferences of central planners wastedvaluable resources by mandating investment in sectors of the economy where the output wasn’twanted by consumers -- particularly in heavy manufacturing industries. It is thus no surprise thatthe Soviet Union’s capital/output ratios were higher than those of contemporaneous free marketeconomies of the West.This phenomenon of overinvestment is observable even among more sophisticatedfree market economies. In Japan, the saving rate and gross investment have been far higher thanours, but their per capita growth potential appears to be falling relative to ours. It is arguable thattheir hobbled financial system is, at least in part, a contributor to their economy’s subnormalperformance.We should not become complacent, however. To be sure, the sharp increases inthe stock market have boosted household net worth. But while capital gains increase the value ofexisting assets, they do not directly create the resources needed for investment in new physicalfacilities. Only saving out of income can do that.In summary, whether over the past five to seven years, what has been, withoutquestion, one of the best economic performances in our history is a harbinger of a new economyor just a hyped-up version of the old, will be answered only with the inexorable passage of time.And I suspect our grandchildren, and theirs, will be periodically debating whether they are in anew economy.
BIS Review   68/1998Mr. Stals discusses “The many facets of interest rates”   Address by Governorof the South African Reserve Bank, Dr. Chris Stals, at a Breakfast Meeting of the InsuranceBrokers Council of South Africa, on 2/9/98.1. IntroductionNobody will deny it that South Africa has extremely high interest rates at thisstage. In the context of South Africa’s own historical record and measured against a current rateof inflation of about 6½ per cent, nominal interest rates are extremely high. In the context of theworld environment, and particularly within the group of emerging market economies, the level ofSouth African interest rates lies in the upper quartile, but is still beaten by a number of othercomparable countries. Six of the 24 emerging markets listed in the weekly publication of theEconomist, for example, have higher short-term interest rates than South Africa at this stage.Nobody will deny it that the high level of interest rates is bad for the SouthAfrican economy, particularly at the current stage of the business cycle and a rather depresseddomestic economic situation. It is only the few savers we still have in the country, and theold-aged people who live off their interest income, who may benefit from these high interestrates. On the other hand, the high interest rates will most probably reduce consumption financedwith borrowed funds, and also investment in fixed capital, equipment and inventories. The futureproduction capacity of the economy is therefore constrained by the present adverse financialconditions. In terms of domestic needs, South Africa now requires a stimulation of the economy,and would prefer lower interest rates to encourage economic development.There is also a fairly general consensus of opinion that the present high interestrates were recently forced on South Africa by the international financial situation. The so-calledEast Asian crisis that started to surface in Thailand more than a year ago spilled over into theeconomies of many other countries. Even countries with more stable economies such asAustralia, New Zealand and Canada were adversely affected by these developments. Emergingcountries far away from the East Asian epicentre such as Mexico, Colombia, Brazil andVenezuela have been infected by the problem. Countries with economies in transformation suchas the Czech Republic and Poland also suffered and the recent catastrophic developments inRussia cannot be completely divorced from the East Asian crisis. In the end, South Africa alsocould not escape from the turmoil.There are major differences of opinion among economists inside and outside ofSouth Africa on what the reaction of the official macroeconomic policymakers in South Africashould be to soften the blows for the economy. At the one extreme there is the InternationalMonetary Fund that believes that much more restrictive monetary and fiscal policies should havebeen applied in South Africa in recent months to fend off the attacks of international speculatorsand short-term profiteers.At the other extreme we find economists in South Africa with major private sectorinterests who believe that the Reserve Bank should have kept interest rates artificially low with acomplete disregard of the consequences this would have had for the exchange rate of the randand subsequent inflation. There are those who believe that the Reserve Bank should have donemore to keep the exchange rate stable, even if it should have required the reintroduction ortightening of exchange controls.
- 2 -BIS Review   68/1998There are many naive critics in South Africa who believe that the Reserve Bank isfully responsible for the high interest rates and that the Reserve Bank indeed used its mythicalpowers to force interest rates to these destructively high levels. In their ignorance they believethat the Reserve Bank can even at this stage pull the rabbit from the hat and instantaneouslybring interest rates down again. Unfortunately, in the real world such miracles are just notpossible.2. What caused interest rates to go upTo avoid confusion in this debate, the real causes for the recent sharp rise ininterest rates should be revisited. It will be recalled that in the first quarter of this year there waswide-spread optimism that interest rates in South Africa could decline further during the courseof 1998. The Reserve Bank had already reduced its Bank rate from 17 to 16 per cent in October1997, and to 15 per cent on 9 March 1998. Inflation was declining, foreign portfolio investmentsflowed into the country, the foreign reserves were rising and the exchange rate of the rand wasunder pressure to appreciate.However, the situation changed dramatically in May 1998 when non-residentsreviewed their investment strategy and started to withdraw some of the funds they had previouslyinvested in South African bonds. During the four months January to April 1998, non-residentinvestors increased their holdings of South African bonds by approximately R16 billion. Overthe next four months, that is from May to August 1998, they reduced their holdings of SouthAfrican bonds by about R19 billion.This dramatic change of strategy had an almost immediate negative effect on theoverall demand and supply conditions in the South African financial markets. The yield onlong-term government bonds rose from just below 13 per cent at the beginning of May to a peakof over 21 per cent last week. Other interest rates followed the upward trend and established theextremely high levels we now have for the Reserve Bank’s rate for repurchase transactions, theprime overdraft rate, and the mortgage lending rate of banking institutions.In this process, triggered by a decline of investors confidence in the emergingmarkets of the world, little concern was shown for the depressed conditions in the South Africaneconomy. No consideration was given to the needs, desires or expectations of the people ofSouth Africa. Neither the Minister of Finance nor the Governor of the Reserve Bank wasconsulted by the markets before interest rates were forced to higher levels. The whole processwas driven by external factors that swept across many of the smaller economies of the world likea huge tidal wave. The switch from a R16 billion inflow of capital for investment in SouthAfrican bonds in the first four months of 1998 to an outflow of an almost similar amount in thenext four months dramatically changed the demand versus supply conditions in the SouthAfrican financial markets. In the situation, it would have required a massive creation of moneyby the Reserve Bank to prevent interest rates from rising to the extent they did. Such a creation ofmoney in turn would have added fuel to the inflationary pressures that were already stimulated bythe depreciation of the rand.3. What can now be done to bring interest rates down?It is amazing to read in the financial press in South Africa almost every day theaccusation that the high interest rates in South Africa at this stage are a reflection of the Reserve
- 3 -BIS Review   68/1998Bank’s deliberate “high-interest-rate-policy”. The present level of interest rates is often describedas being “artificially” high because of Reserve Bank intervention in the market. These criticsoverlook the fact that the Reserve Bank indeed raised the amount of accommodation madeavailable to banking institutions at the daily repurchase tender for central bank funds fromR4.1 billion early in May to R9.8 billion at this stage. This action by the Reserve Bank obviouslyprevented interest rates from rising even further and, if anything, created an artificially low levelof interest rates in the country. Perhaps with some justification, this policy of the Bank wasrecently criticised by the International Monetary Fund.The Reserve Bank also made a huge amount of forward cover available to SouthAfrican residents with outstanding commitments in foreign currency, and to non-residentinvestors with open rand positions in South Africa with the objective of discouraging them fromsending more funds out of the country. This policy undoubtedly contributed towards maintaininginterest rates at a lower level as the IMF quite correctly pointed out. In South Africa, the Bank iswidely criticised for having provided this forward cover, but at the same time also blamed for the“high” interest rates.After four months of heavy pummelling by the markets, South Africa now findsitself in a situation where:• the exchange rate of the rand has depreciated by about 25 per cent;• the banking sector has lost a lot of liquidity;• interest rates have risen to a level where borrowing from the banking sector forthe financing of additional economic activity has become almost prohibitive.There is therefore an understandable pressure on the Reserve Bank to dosomething that will bring interest rates down immediately and effectively for all borrowers in theSouth African market. Can the Reserve bank do anything to salvage this situation?A simplistic view is that the Bank should reduce the rate for its repurchasetransactions and therefore provide accommodation to banking institutions at a lower cost. Thisview overlooks the fact that the repo rate of the Reserve Bank is determined on a daily basisthrough a tender system, and is no longer fixed by the Bank. Should the Reserve Bank thereforewant to reduce the repo rate, it will have to offer more central bank funds (“high-powered”money) to the banking institutions.In deciding on its policy, the Reserve Bank must, however, take into account:• the recent large outflows of funds through the Bond Exchange. An expansion ofdomestic liquidity in this situation could facilitate the outflow of funds;• existing relationships between interest rate margins, spot exchange rates andforward rates. A disruption of these relationships can easily lead to newspeculative transactions against the rand;• the continuing high rates of growth in bank credit extension and in the moneysupply; and• the need to keep inflation in check in the aftermath of a depreciation of the rand ofmore than 20 per cent since May this year.
- 4 -BIS Review   68/1998In this situation, it will be irresponsible for the Bank to create more money in aneffort to force interest rates down. Advantages, if any, to be gained from such a policy will bevery short-lived.A solution in the short-term for the South African dilemma can only come fromthe original source of the problem, that is, from the international financial markets. Confidencemust return to the many international fund managers who have decided in recent months towithdraw substantial amounts of portfolio investments from the bond markets of the smallereconomies around the world. These fund withdrawals not only forced interest rates to higherlevels, but also created turmoil in the foreign exchange markets. A return of stability to thesemarkets will pave the way for lower interest rates in South Africa, and in many other affectedcountries of the world. For any individual country such as South Africa to try to break out ofthese shackles at this stage will be almost impossible, unless impenetrable brick walls will beconstructed around the South African economy to isolate it from the rest of the world.4. Can South Africa survive with these high interest rates?As already mentioned, the high level of interest rates at this stage is not consistentwith the current needs of the South African economy. There is, however, very little we can do toget ourselves out of the dilemma in the very short-term.The present unsatisfactory situation emphasises the long identified need for SouthAfricans to save a greater percentage of our income or, to put it in more sensible economiclanguage, to consume less. We must remember that, in terms of the macro-economy,consumption financed with borrowed funds counts as negative saving. By borrowing from banksto finance current expenditure, we actually use up tomorrow’s income today.The situation also emphasises once again that the South African total productionmachinery must become more competitive. We must make ourselves not only moreself-sufficient in the provision of finance for our own economic development, but also in theproduction of the goods and services we need for domestic consumption and real investment. Inother words, we must reduce our dependence on the rest of the world and eliminate ourvulnerability for recurrent balance of payments crises.As long as these high interest rates are forced on us by the international situationover which we have no control, a slow-down in total economic activity will be unavoidable.Sensible adjustment to the realities of the situation will, however, avoid a major recession that isalready predicted in some quarters, and feared by many. To delay a spending decision today, doesnot mean a permanent abolition of a justifiable need, but realistic deference to the economicdisciplines and constraints of an adverse global situation, until international conditions improveagain.In the meantime, we should not lose confidence in the resilience of the SouthAfrican economy, and in its ability to weather the current storm. Looking around the worldtoday, we still have, even in the present adverse climate, many reasons for remaining optimisticabout the medium and longer-term prospects for the South African economy. Our bankingsystem remains sound, our financial markets operate with great efficiency, and a huge pent-updemand for goods and services needs but little encouragement to re-stimulate the economy.
BIS Review   67/1998Mr. Yam discusses “Intervention true to guiding policy”   Discussion by the ChiefExecutive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. Joseph Yam, published in South China MorningPost on 24/8/98.The current debate revolving around government intervention in the stock and futuresmarkets to deter currency manipulation brought a feeling of nostalgia to me. It made me recall the manydebates on government intervention there were within the administration when Sir Philip Haddon-Cavewas financial secretary.I was then, in the late 1970s, a young economist in the Economic Services Branch of theGovernment Secretariat, with little responsibility and a lot to learn. Those debates were, somehow, rathermore healthy and more intellectual. There was certainly less mud being thrown around.But the contrast is understandable. Today, this is a controversial issue. There areinterested parties airing their grievances through punchy and articulate expressions of their views on thisphilosophical issue of interventionism. This is also an issue in which, in a more politicised environmentand at a time when the community is enduring the pain of economic adjustment, the politically mindedsee great political mileage. A government with the whole of the legislature arguably in opposition makesa vulnerable target.It is so easy to wave the banner of free markets and condemn any governmentintervention, and be seen to be righteous and knowledgeable; notwithstanding that the governmentconcerned has been so successfully running the freest economy in the world. But we must be humble andthank those wanting to lecture us on free markets, if only for the purpose of keeping us on our toes.Hong Kong is changing and one would expect any dynamic city to be different after thepassage of 20 years. But, surprise, surprise, the policy of positive non-interventionism has not changed.Many may have chosen to ignore or forget the true meaning of this policy, but not the administration ofthe HKSAR. Certainly, I have not forgotten it. And, having worked continuously and closely with fivefinancial secretaries in succession, I can vouch for all of them in their firm adherence to this policy ofpositive non-interventionism. It applies also to the specific case of the current intervention in the stockand futures markets. As a firm believer in such a policy, I am responsible for conducting the intervention.The nostalgia has prompted me to take time off watching the markets to read some of thelong-forgotten literature on positive non-interventionism. This gives me great pleasure, particularly whenI see the rare sentences and, if I am more fortunate, paragraphs attributable to my drafting that survivedthe final texts. Yes, Sir Philip was a great financial secretary with a great mind. Even many of our criticshold him in high regard. I hope that in quoting him, our stance in the stock and futures market can be putinto a context that our critics may be able better to appreciate.As early as November 1973, at the Conference on Managers in a Changing Hong KongEnvironment, Sir Philip spoke on, amongst other things, the role of public policy. He said that, “theGovernment must accept such responsibilities as are necessary to ensure that management decisions arenot frustrated by imperfections in the operation of the market mechanism, leading to economicinefficiency or social distress which only the Government can remove.”In September 1979, he talked about interventionism and the adjustment mechanism,amongst other things, in a speech on the Hong Kong Economy in Transition. He said that: “A pragmaticview dictates an admission that interventionism can be relevant to the maintenance of economic stabilityin Hong Kong even in the general context of a philosophy of positive non-interventionism”. In the samespeech he cautioned against taking for granted the “efficiency with which [the] essentially automaticadjustment mechanism operates in restoring equilibrium”. He then went on in the same speech to identifyareas that could be collectively referred to as market imperfections which justifies market intervention.
- 2 -BIS Review  67/1998But it was the speech he made to the Federation of Hong Kong Industries in December1980 (and as Principal Assistant Secretary for Economic Services then it was my honour to have a handin drafting part of the speech) in which he made abundantly clear his stance on the policy of positivenon-interventionism. Here I quote two paragraphs of his speech in full.Sir Philip said: “I have frequently described the Government’s economic policy stance asbeing one of “positive non-interventionism”. Not surprisingly, perhaps, some have claimed that this isreally just a fancy term for laissez-faire or, less kindly, that it covers up a “do-nothing” approach. This issimply not so: positive non-interventionism involves taking the view that it is normally futile anddamaging to the growth rate of an economy, particularly an open economy, for the Government toattempt to plan the allocation of resources available to the private sector and to frustrate the operation ofmarket forces, no matter how uncomfortable may be their short term consequences.”Sir Philip added: “But in my description of our economic policy stance, I do qualify theterm ‘non-interventionism’ with the adjective ‘positive’. Perhaps in the past I have not spelled out theimplications of this adjective clearly enough. What it means is this: that the Government, when facedwith an interventionist proposal, does not simply respond that such a proposal must, by definition, beincorrect. Quite the contrary.“Generally speaking, or so I would like to argue, the Government weighs up carefully thearguments for and against an act of interventionism in any sector of our economy and on the demand orsupply side in the light of present and likely future circumstances. The Government then comes to apositive decision as to where the balance of advantage lies. It is true that, more often than not, we cometo the conclusion that the balance of advantage lies in not intervening; and, I must confess, I would bealarmed if we didn’t. Yet, in all cases, the decision is made positively, and not by default, and it is not thenon-outcome of a do-nothing approach. But, there are many examples of the Government deciding,usually on the advice of its boards and committees, to intervene, in one way or another, in the free playof market forces.”Indeed there are many examples of intervention. We built the airport because, withoutgovernment intervention, it would simply not have been economically viable. We built roads and bridges.We provided public housing, medical services, the list is long. But we tend to do less than otherjurisdictions and so the size of our public sector in relation to gross domestic product is one of thesmallest in the world.Specifically in the monetary and financial systems, there is significant intervention in theform of the regulation of financial markets and the supervision of financial institutions. This is preciselybecause we feel that, in the words of Sir Philip, ‘the balance of advantage’ lies in so intervening andbecause ‘imperfections in the operation of the market mechanism [may lead] to economic inefficiency’.In very much the same spirit, we intervened in 1996 and built a real time payment systembecause the private sector was not able to come up with this highly desirable piece of financialinfrastructure. We have been intervening since the beginning of 1990 to develop the Hong Kong dollardebt market, again because the market was considered essential for effective financial intermediation,and, regrettably, the private sector was not able to develop one that is properly structured.The linked exchange rate system is also a product of the policy of positivenon-interventionism. The Government intervened to fix the exchange rate because we found out in 1983,and since, that there is a need for a monetary anchor. In the absence of such an anchor, the value of ourcurrency will be, in mathematical terms, an indeterminate. In other words, it is not something that thefree market can determine in the best interest of the community without intervention.We have had four speculative attacks on our currency since the outbreak of financialturmoil in the region in the middle of last year.
- 3 -BIS Review   67/1998It is very well known to almost everyone in the market that a handful of hedge fundshave on each occasion conducted a double play in the stock futures market and the currency market. Wehave come to realise how this double play works, although it has only become apparent, at least to us, inthe third and fourth attacks in June and August this year respectively.On each occasion, interbank interest rates were pushed higher, to varying degrees, with aview to engineering a sharp fall in the stock index futures.While the August episode is still being played out, it is clear that these currency attacks,or manipulations, have introduced a large interest rate premium for the Hong Kong dollar over the USdollar. This currency manipulation premium amounts to around three to four percentage points. With thecommunity already in considerable pain, having to go through the inevitable, and already very sharp,economic adjustment necessitated by financial turmoil in Asia, we can do without the pain beingdisproportionately exacerbated by those manipulating our currency in order to benefit from their shortstock futures positions. There is further the serious risk of this double play creating a situation ofover-shooting in the stock and other asset markets, undermining the stability of our otherwise robustfinancial system.I must emphasise, however, that I am in no position to judge whether or not there hasbeen overshooting and, if so, the extent of the overshooting. But we can all see that markets canovershoot badly and uncontrollably if we just look around us in the region. Whatever accusations one canthrow at the Indonesians - “crony capitalism, nepotism, corruption, racism, poor macroeconomicmanagement, neglect of financial development” - even if all these were true, they still do not justify theextent of the meltdown of their currency and their financial system, and the distress they are in. But thebrutal reality is that they are now in that position.Markets panic and overshoot, and if we are not careful, we can easily be pushed into thatsituation. And the culprits would be the handful of hedge funds having little or no interest in Hong Kong,not to mention in our well being, other than it being a free market which they can manipulate and fromwhich they can take money, somewhat like an ATM machine, as others have put it.The HKSAR administration is run by people who have put Hong Kong on the map as thefreest economy in the world. It is clear to us that there are, again quoting my great teacher Sir Philip,“imperfections in the operation of the market mechanism”, possibly leading to “economic inefficiency”and “social distress”. So the administration decided to intervene to deter currency manipulation, to getrid of the unnecessary and unfair pain that has been inflicted on the community as reflected in thecurrency manipulation interest rate premium, and to avoid market adjustments overshooting in panic intoan uncontrollable tailspin.Consistent with Sir Philip’s view that interventionism should be “relevant to themaintenance of economic stability in Hong Kong”, and with Exchange Fund Advisory Committeebacking, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen made the order to intervene in the free play ofmarket forces.There has been no departure from the long established policy of positivenon-interventionism that has served Hong Kong so well in the past. Those who think that we have sodeparted should try and refresh themselves of what this policy really means.And no one needs to take my word for it. Those are the words of Sir Philip, the architectof that policy and someone who commanded and still commands a lot of respect.Indeed as Monetary Authority chief, I have no responsibility over that policy. It rests onthe broad shoulders of Sir Donald Tsang who is carrying it bravely. Let us all make a little effort to givehim the support that he needs, spiritual or otherwise, by trying to gain a better appreciation of what thepolicy of positive non-interventionism really means.
- 4 -BIS Review  67/1998Whilst on the subject of intervention, may I reiterate that our intervention in the stockand futures market to deter currency manipulation does not imply any weakening of our resolve to adhereto the linked exchange rate system. This resolve has never been stronger. Indeed, as I have mentionedelsewhere, there simply is no better alternative for Hong Kong. The experience of many of ourneighbouring economies in the past year or so underlines why.As the financial storm in this region spreads to almost everywhere now, and withincreased intensity, the discipline of currency board arrangements of our linked exchange rate system isour best safeguard for our long-term prosperity and stability.
BIS Review  66/1998Mr. Carse reports on the initiatives taken concerning financial industries in Fujian,Hong Kong and Taiwan   Speech by the Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority, Mr. David Carse, at the Symposium on the Financial Exchange and Cooperation of Fujian,Hong Kong and Taiwan, held on 8/8/98.I am pleased to be here this morning to welcome you to this Symposium. The ChineseBanks’ Association is to be congratulated for organizing this important initiative with the co-sponsorshipof the Fujian Provincial Government and Chinatrust Commercial Bank. The idea of the Symposium, as Iunderstand it, is to facilitate the exchange of ideas concerning the financial industries in the three regionsand the exploration of cooperative opportunities between them.2. Such an initiative could not have come at a better time. The current financial crisis iscreating havoc among the Asia economies. Initially, the damage was felt in the financial sector. But thefull impact is now being seen in the real economy as output and trade are crippled by higher interestrates, the burden of foreign currency borrowing and the credit crunch. The Mainland of China, HongKong and Taiwan have survived the crisis in better shape than most other economies in the region. Butthey have not been unaffected as events of this week have demonstrated in Hong Kong where we havewitnessed further speculative pressure on the Hong Kong dollar.3. In this kind of uncertain economic environment, it is all the more important that weshould be trying to maximize the opportunities to develop trade and investment links betweenneighbouring economies. That is why this Symposium is timely and important. The existing economiclinks between Fujian, Hong Kong and Taiwan provide a solid platform on which to build for the future.Taiwan and Hong Kong are already major trading partners with Taiwan’s exports to Hong Kongaccounting for 23.5% of its total exports in 1997. Visitors from Taiwan also account for a significantproportion of the total number of visitors to the territory and thus make a major contribution to the touristindustry in Hong Kong which, as you will know, currently needs all the help it can get.4. Trade between Hong Kong and Fujian is also growing rapidly in both directions andboth Hong Kong and Taiwan are a major source of overseas investment into the Province. There are over10,000 Hong Kong enterprises in Fujian.5. The Hong Kong presence in Fujian includes a number of banks from Hong Kong,including Bank of East Asia. The same bank also maintains a branch in Taiwan which puts it in a goodposition to take advantage of the triangular trading links between Fujian, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In itsrole as an international financial centre, Hong Kong is also the host to a number of banks from Taiwan.The Taiwanese presence here consists of 4 licensed banks, 2 restricted licensed banks and 3representative offices. There are also a significant number of other Taiwanese banks which haveexpressed the intention to establish representative offices here. We are processing these applications inan orderly fashion on a “first-come first-served” basis. It has long been our policy not to allow in toomany banks from the same region or country too quickly. As in the case of the Japanese regional banksand the Korean banks we therefore operate a queuing system. I know that this can sometimes befrustrating to those who are at the back of the queue. But I would like to made it clear that these is noreluctance on our part to admit banks from Taiwan, as the existing presence here clearly demonstrates. Iam sure that Dr. Jeffrey Koo will also testify to this.6. Hong Kong is currently going through tougher times as a financial centre. Someforeign banks have cut back their lending here and a few banks have actually left. This has reflectedproblems back home rather than discontent with Hong Kong. However, it is true that Hong Kong mustreduce the cost of doing business in order to remain competitive, and that is why the current fall inproperty prices and rents, while painful, is also necessary. I am confident that Hong Kong will emergefrom the current crisis with a better-balanced economy and with even stronger fundamentals. Above all,it can continue to rely on its main strategic advantage as a financial centre - namely, its proximity to theMainland of China. This places it in an ideal position to intermediate the trade and investment flowsbetween places like Fujian and Taiwan.
- 2 -BIS Review  66/19987. In conclusion, I would like to repeat my welcome to you and to express my hope thatyour discussions today will lay the foundation for even greater cooperation between Fujian, Hong Kongand Taiwan in the future.
BIS Review   65/1998The changing face of exchange control and its impact on cross-borderinvestment opportunities in South Africa   Address by the Governor of the South African ReserveBank, Dr. Chris Stals, at the Annual Australia/Southern Africa Business Council Meeting held inSydney on 23/7/98.1. The history of exchange control in South AfricaThe beginning of exchange control dates back to 1939 when South Africa, as amember of the now defunct British Sterling Area, was asked, together with other members of theSterling Area, to introduce restrictions on the outflow of funds to non-Sterling Area countries. Thisensured the free movement of funds, emanating mainly from the United Kingdom, within theSterling Area.After World War II, the Sterling Area exchange controls were gradually phased out,but in South Africa in 1961 the controls were extended and given a specific South African function.This followed upon disrupting internal political clashes (the Sharpeville incident), and SouthAfrica’s withdrawal from the British Commonwealth. Exchange control in South Africa was nowintended to provide some protection to the domestic economy from the adverse effects of large-scaleoutflows of capital. For the first time, exchange control also restricted the repatriation ofnon-resident investment funds from the country.During the period 1961 to 1993, exchange control was extended from time to time,mostly in reaction to a worsening of South Africa’s internal political situation, and increasingexternal pressures in general. For example, in 1976, after the uprising of school children in Soweto,proceeds of the sale of non-resident owned securities in South Africa were blocked and eventuallyconverted into securities rand, tradable only at a substantial discount at a second tier (lower value)exchange rate. After the United Nations introduced world-wide economic and financial sanctionsagainst South Africa in 1986, a standstill on the repayment of a major part of South Africa’s foreignindebtedness was introduced, providing for an extended negotiated redemption of the outstandingamount.By the time that the major social and political reforms were introduced in SouthAfrica in the early nineties, there existed a very comprehensive system of exchange control thatcovered certain current account transactions and the inflows and outflows of both resident andnon-resident investment funds.2. The phasing out of exchange controlThere was general consensus that exchange controls created many distortions in theSouth African economy. Interest rates, the exchange rate, financial asset and property prices, andeven production costs in the domestic economy were affected by the comprehensive exchangecontrols. The system prevented the important price mechanism of the market economy fromfunctioning properly. This led to the maldistribution of scarce resources and the functioning of theeconomy at levels below its optimum capacity.After the democratic election for a new Government of National Unity took place inApril 1994, and international punitive actions against the South African economy were removed,there was general consensus within the new Government that exchange controls should also beremoved. There was, however, major disagreement on how fast the controls should disappear. At theone extreme were supporters, mostly in the private financial sector, of a “big bang” approach. Theypleaded for the immediate removal of all the controls. On the other hand, there was substantial
- 2 -BIS Review   65/1998support for a more gradualist approach and for the dismantling of the exchange controls over anextended period of time.The Reserve Bank supported the latter approach, mainly for the following reasons:• Years of economic sanctions, boycotts, disinvestment campaigns and thewithdrawal of foreign loan funds from South Africa depleted the country’sforeign reserves. At the time of the elections of April 1994, the Reserve Bankowned, on a net basis, zero foreign reserves.• During the long extended period of exchange controls, backlogs developed, and ahuge pent-up demand for an outflow of capital emerged. Overdue loans had to berepaid to non-residents, and no South African residents were allowed toaccumulate foreign assets of any significance over a period of more than thirtyyears.• Distortions were by that time so much embedded in the South African financialstructure that the sudden removal of exchange control would not only haveexerted pressure on the country’s low level of official foreign exchange reserves,but could also have forced painful immediate structural changes that would haveunduly disrupted the domestic economy in the short term.The South African authorities therefore decided on a gradual phasing-out of theexisting exchange controls. Beginning already in 1993, the following relaxations were accordinglyintroduced over the past five years:• As a first priority, all exchange controls applicable to current account transactionswere removed. South Africa now fully complies with the requirements of ArticleVIII of the International Monetary Fund.• Secondly, controls on non-residents were removed. The debt standstillarrangements of 1985 were finally rescheduled towards the end of 1993, and thefinancial rand system (two-tier exchange rate) was terminated in March 1995.Non-residents are now completely free to introduce funds for any purpose intoSouth Africa, to repatriate such funds and to transfer out of the country currentand capital gains earned on their investments without restriction.• Resident corporates (companies) were gradually enabled to make directinvestments in foreign subsidiaries, branches or joint ventures by transferringlimited amounts of funds from South Africa, and by raising funds abroad throughequity and loan issues. In the process, direct investments of about R50 billion(US $10.7 billion) were acquired by the South African corporate sector over thepast four years.• Resident institutional investors were given permission in June 1995 to diversifypart of their total assets into foreign currency denominated investments. At thisstage, they may hold up to 15 per cent of their total assets outside of SouthAfrica. In total, the financial sector has now acquired about R55 billion (US$11.8 billion) in the form of portfolio foreign investments.• Last year, in June 1997, private individuals were given permission to makelimited investments in their own names outside of South Africa. At this stage,
- 3 -BIS Review   65/1998individual taxpayers in good standing with the tax authorities may invest up toR400 000 per individual outside of South Africa. A modest amount of foreignexchange equal to less than R2 billion has since then been absorbed under thisconcession• Many other smaller exchange control restrictions were either eased or removed,for example on short-term trade financing, inter-bank financing arrangements andthe transfer of legacies, donations and emigrants’ funds. Administrativeprocedures were simplified and banks (authorised dealers in foreign exchange)were mandated to approve many transactions without prior reference to theReserve Bank.There remains but one major area for relaxation, and that is in respect of therestrictions still applicable to the so-called “blocked” funds of former residents of South Africa.Apart from settling-in allowances, the remainder of the assets of emigrants is blocked in SouthAfrica and becomes non-transferable. Income earned on blocked funds, however, is not subject tothe restrictions.South Africa has therefore now reached a stage where there are no effective exchangecontrols any more on current account transactions and on the movement of funds of non-residents.Resident corporates, financial institutions and private individuals all have limited scope to makesome investments outside of the country and have, on a combined basis, now accumulated more thanR100 billion of foreign assets. Backlogs that existed in 1994 for the outflow of non-resident fundshave been accommodated in full, and those that existed for the outward investment of resident fundsare gradually being absorbed. On balance, South Africa has now removed more than seventy percent of all the exchange controls of the past.3. The inflow of capital into South AfricaThe macroeconomic argument for the removal of exchange control is based on theassumption that, on balance, in a liberalised economy, over time capital inflows will exceedoutflows. Despite the need to accommodate large accumulated backlogs, this philosophy wasvindicated by developments in the capital account of the South African balance of payments over thepast four years.Non-resident investors increased their holdings of South African equities by aboutR63 billion (US $13.5 billion) from 1 January 1995 up to the end of June 1998, and also invested anet amount of about R30 billion (US $6.5 billion) in South African bonds. The total portfolioinvestment capital inflow of more than R90 billion was mainly used for financing the acquisition offoreign assets by South African residents, as already mentioned above.Taking account of the relatively large net inflows of portfolio foreign capital,outflows to finance foreign investment by residents, and all other capital movements, the capitalaccount of the South African balance of payments still showed a net inflow of funds from abroad ofR53 billion over the period from the beginning of 1995 up to March 1998. The inflows were morethan sufficient to cover modest current account deficits and to raise the total gross foreign exchangereserves of the country to a level of R45 billion (US $9.0 billion) at the end of March 1998. At thislevel, the total foreign reserves were sufficient to cover about three months’ imports of goods andservices. In terms of international standards, the level of the foreign reserves is still relatively low,but at least much more comfortable than at the end of March 1994, when the gross foreign reservesof the country amounted to only R10.3 billion (US $3.0 billion).
- 4 -BIS Review   65/1998One of the disappointing aspects of the capital inflows into South Africa over the pastfour years has been the relatively small amount of direct foreign investment made in the country. Notmore than 25 per cent of the total inflows represented direct foreign investment, and the rest came inas portfolio investment in securities, loan capital and short-term financing facilities.4. Restructuring of the financial sectorThe gradual removal of exchange controls was accompanied by some majorrestructuring of the financial sector in South Africa. To encourage competition in the market, moreforeign banks were allowed to establish themselves in the country. More than 20 foreign banksopened up branches or subsidiaries in South Africa, and more than 60 foreign banks now do businessin the country through representative offices. Together with about 35 domestic banking institutions,the South African banking industry is now providing, on a competitive basis, excellent and modernfinancial services to the country. The industry is healthy, well-managed and subject to financialregulation and supervision based on the principles of the Basle Committee guidelines and coreprinciples.While the gradual phasing-out of exchange control continued, the financial marketswere also restructured, liberalised and made more flexible to accommodate almost explosiveincreases in volumes. In the capital market, three separate specialised institutions were created toprovide, respectively, for equity trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), bond trading onthe Bond Exchange of South Africa, and trading in derivatives on the South African FuturesExchange.Two years ago, the JSE introduced major reforms to provide for corporate ownership,foreign ownership (of stock brokers), dual capacity trading, negotiated commissions and electronicscreen trading. The JSE is continuing to improve its facilities by providing for the immobilisationand dematerialisation of stock, and for improved clearing and settlement arrangements. With alisting of about 700 different securities, a total market capitalisation of about US $275 billion and aturnover of about US $45 billion last year, the JSE is now classified as one of the major stockexchanges of the world.The most spectacular increase in the total volume of transactions over the past fewyears took place in the Bond Exchange of South Africa. Total turnover in this market increased fromthe equivalent of US $553 billion in 1995, to US $927 billion in 1997, that is an increase of 67.6 percent over just two years. The relaxation of the exchange controls made an important contribution tothe development of the Bond Exchange. Total gross transactions by non-residents in this market lastyear exceeded the equivalent of US $257 billion, or almost 30 per cent of total turnover.Interest is also growing in the South African Futures Exchange. The total number ofcontracts traded in this market increased from 3½ billion in 1995 to more than 5 billion in 1997.A further important development that flowed from the globalisation process is theemergence of a Euro-rand market where the outstanding amount of rand-denominated loans raisedby non-South African borrowers from non-South African investors now amounts to aboutR36 billion. A substantial part of the proceeds obtained from these loan issues was reinvested inSouth African bonds.The market in foreign exchange in South Africa is also growing rapidly. The averagedaily turnover in this market now exceeds US $10 billion. Of particular importance is the expansionin forward cover operations in this market, where South African banks now carry a fully coveredforward sales (or purchases) book of about US $180 billion.
- 5 -BIS Review   65/1998The Reserve Bank recently introduced steps to encourage a more active developmentof the domestic inter-bank market for funds. It is the objective to ensure that short-term interest ratesshould be flexible, and should fluctuate to reflect changes in underlying market conditions. Theeffective rate at which central bank funds are made available to banking institutions is nowdetermined on a daily basis through a tender system for repurchase transactions, entered intobetween the Reserve Bank and banking institutions. This greater flexibility in short-term interestrates is of particular importance in light of the growing volume of, and greater volatility in,short-term international capital movements.As a further step in the development of the financial system, the Reserve Bank at thebeginning of this year also upgraded the national payment, clearing and settlement system. The newsystem provides for an electronic on-line real-time link between participating banks, and for securefund transfers between these banks. It enables the banks to monitor and manage their liquiditypositions continuously, and provides for electronically managed end-of-day settlement of interbanktransactions. As from the beginning of October, it will become possible to settle transactions on anintra-day basis as and when instructions are received within the system.The gradual phasing-out of the exchange controls was therefore accompanied by asimultaneous process of liberalising, modernising and upgrading of the domestic financial system. Inthe process, the removal of the exchange controls did not create any major disruption in the domesticmarkets, and the health and soundness of the South African financial institutions were protected.Both processes, however, should be seen as part of the wider movement ofinternational financial globalisation. Without introducing these changes, it would not have beenpossible for South Africa to participate in the process of world-wide integration of financial markets.The removal of exchange controls and the simultaneous upgrading of the domestic financial system,opened up the way for South Africa’s participation in this process.5. The Southern African Development CommunityA further consequence of the socio/political/economic reforms in South Africa overthe past few years was a natural greater involvement for the country in the economic developmentprocess of the African continent. Apart from a more active participation in continental initiativesworking through the Organisation of African Unity, the United Nations Economic Commission forAfrica, and the African Development Bank, South Africa is taking an active part in the activities ofthe Southern African Development Community (SADC).Fourteen countries of the Southern African region now belong to this formalagreement for economic co-operation, with the long-term goal of eventual economic integration.South Africa plays a leading role in the development of financial and investment co-operationamongst the participants in SADC.Within the structured institutional framework of SADC, a Committee of Governorsof all the central banks of the region was established. This Committee introduced a number ofco-operation projects intended to develop the financial systems and markets of the region. Theapproach of the Governors Committee at this stage is first to develop the financial infrastructures ineach of the countries, before venturing into the more challenging task of macroeconomicco-ordination or integration.One of the important projects in the work of the SADC Governors Committee is toremove remaining exchange controls within the region. Where practicable, countries are encouraged
- 6 -BIS Review   65/1998to do this even faster than what has been programmed for the overall phasing out of the controls. It isenvisaged that there will eventually be a relatively free movement of goods, services and capital inthis vast area with a total population of more than 180 million people.6. The financial globalisation processThe phasing out of exchange control and the restructuring of the financial system areimportant preconditions for South Africa’s greater participation in the financial globalisationprocess. As can be deducted from some of the statistics quoted in this address, South Africa is nowfirmly on the road of greater participation in the expanding international financial markets.Recent events in the wake of the East Asian financial crisis proved once again,however, that the globalisation process is not without risk. The easy movement of large amounts offunds into and out of countries with relatively small economies can at times be very disrupting.During the four months January to April 1998, non-residents increased their holdings of SouthAfrican bonds, acquired through the Bond Exchange, by more than R16 billion. Over the next tenweeks, that is during May, June and the first half of July 1998, they reduced their holdings again byR12 billion.Both the inflows and the outflows of capital on this occasion disrupted the SouthAfrican financial markets and complicated the implementation of monetary policy centred on themedium-term objective of maintaining financial stability in the interest of optimum economicgrowth. In the situation and against the background of a rather depressed domestic economy, theyield on long-term government bonds increased from 12.7 per cent on 30 April 1998, to 16.4 percent on 6 July, before it declined again to 15.5 per cent last week.The Reserve Bank’s fluctuating repo rate similarly showed wide fluctuations andincreased from 14.8 per cent in early May to a peak of 24.0 per cent on 22 June, before settling downat a level of about 21 per cent. All banking institutions in the country were forced to raise theirdeposit and lending rates by about 6 percentage points since the end of April. The prime overdraftrate of the major commercial banks now stands at 24 per cent. With the latest measure of inflation atonly 5 per cent per annum, real interest rates are at an extremely high level.The exchange rate of the rand also came under a lot of pressure. After beingrelatively stable for a period of about 18 months from October 1996 up to the end of April 1998, therand depreciated from R5.05 against the US dollar in the middle of May to R6.62 = $1 on 6 July1998. Since then, the exchange rate appreciated again to fluctuate around the R6.00 = $1 level forthe last few days. At this level, the rand, measured against a basket of currencies, is still about 18 percent down from where it was at the beginning of this year.Some critics do believe that the removal of the exchange controls is partly to beblamed for this greater volatility in financial conditions. They advise South Africa, therefore, toreintroduce some of the controls, for example, the two-tier exchange rate system. This view is notshared by the monetary authorities in South Africa. Despite the gyrations of recent weeks, we stillbelieve that the advantages of participation in the financial globalisation process will, over time,bring more advantages to the South African economy than disadvantages.7. Concluding remarksThe policies of the phasing out of exchange control, the restructuring andliberalisation of the financial system and the promotion of active participation in the process offinancial globalisation, have created many opportunities for cross-border investment in South Africa.
- 7 -BIS Review   65/1998Foreign banks, fund managers, institutional investors and manufacturing concerns are extendingtheir financial business with South Africa in the form of:• conventional short-term trade financing;• short-term inter-bank financing facilities;• loans extended for medium and longer-term periods to South African borrowersin both the private and public sectors;• portfolio investment in equities, bonds and financial derivatives, acquired throughthe various capital market exchanges; and• direct investment in the form of subsidiaries, branches, or joint ventures withSouth African undertakings.Developments in recent years also led to the creation of an active Euro-rand marketoutside of South Africa, and to a greater involvement of South Africa in the economic developmentprocess of the Southern African region.These exciting developments have already created opportunities, also for theexpansion of financial relations between South Africa and Australia. I believe many moreopportunities exist and are waiting for the financial and other economic entrepreneurs in SouthAfrica and in Australia to be exploited.Our two countries should not always be regarded as major export competitors in theworld markets for base minerals and other commodities. There are also many areas where oureconomies are complementary and where our policies can be supportive in the global environment.This applies particularly when it comes to our efforts of integrating our financial markets into theworld environment.
BIS Review   65/1998Bank of Japan’s August report of recent economic and financial developmentsBank of Japan communication, XX/8/98.The Bank’s View1Japan’s economic conditions continue to deteriorate.With respect to final demand, public investment seems to have bottomed out. Netexports have resumed to increase mainly due to a decline in imports. However, business fixedinvestment has been decreasing significantly, and housing investment has weakened further. Privateconsumption has not yet shown a resumption. Against this background of weak final demand,substantial production cutbacks continue. As a result, inventories have decreased somewhat, but thelevel is still high. With the decline in expenditure and production, corporate profits continue todecrease, and employee income remains below the previous year’s level. In addition, the ratio of joboffers to applications has dropped to a historically low level, and the unemployment rate hasincreased further. As a whole, employment and income conditions have worsened.Although the above indicates a continued negative interactions of production,income, and expenditure, a further deterioration in the economy is expected to cease gradually fromthe effects of the comprehensive economic stimulus package including additional public works andthe special income tax reduction. Given the current considerably low level of economic activities,however, the positive influence of the package on private demand will likely be limited, and theeconomy’s immediate transition to a self-sustained recovery is hardly expected. In thesecircumstances, the relevant bills have been submitted to the Diet to rebuild the stability of thefinancial system. Moreover, the new administration is planning to launch new economic stimulusmeasures, including additional public investment in the supplementary budget for fiscal 1998 and thereduction in personal income taxes and corporate taxes. The materialization of these policies alongwith their effects on corporate and household sentiment should be carefully monitored.With regard to prices, wholesale prices are on a downtrend, and consumer prices(excluding the effects of institutional changes2) remain below the previous year’s level. With respectto the factors affecting the outlook, the downward pressure on domestic prices induced by thedecline in import prices is weakening. In addition, the expansion in the output gap in the economy isexpected to slow in line with the implementation of the comprehensive economic stimulus package.Nevertheless, reflecting the present large output gap, the downward pressure from domestic factorsis unlikely to weaken considerably, and hence, prices are likely to be weak for some time.As for financial markets, yields on long-term government bonds and stock prices rosetoward mid-July 1998 reflecting growing anticipation for permanent tax cut. However, they havedeclined since then as a wait-and-see posture has prevailed among market participants with thegrowing attention to the concrete measures of the new administration’s economic policies.Meanwhile, Euro-yen interest rates and the Japan premium indicate strong market concernsregarding credit risks of financial institutions and liquidity risks at end-September 1998, the end ofthe first half of fiscal 1998.With respect to monetary aggregates, growth in M2+CDs has been slowing, reflectingthe sluggish private bank lending. These developments basically reflect the further decline in thecredit demand of private firms with the worsening of overall economic activities, along with thecontinued cautious lending stance of private banks.                                                     1 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meetingheld on August 11, as the basis of monetary policy decisions.2 The rise in medical service charges due to the medical insurance system reform of September 1997.

BIS Review   64/1998Mr. Ferguson remarks on themes in international bank supervision   Remarks byMr. Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., a member of the Board of the Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, before the International Banking Conference, Federal Financial Institutions ExaminationCouncil, in Arlington, Virginia on 20/7/98.Themes in International Bank SupervisionThe scope of my introductory remarks for your conference today is broad and toucheson a number of topics, some of which will be more fully developed by other speakers later in thisseminar.Risks and Benefits of a Global Banking SystemLet me start by addressing the question of what value and what risks might arise fromhaving a more global banking system such as the one developing currently. Academic and popularliterature is full of articles arguing both sides of the case. Conceptually, global banking, by which Imean both direct entry and cross-border inter-bank lending, may influence macro-stability in bothpositive and harmful ways. Those who see potential harm argue that trans-national banks stimulatecapital flight, particularly in developing markets, and in stressful times may be a source of capitaloutflows and currency crises. Second, some analysts argue that foreign banks may lack commitmentto their host country and will flee, or withdraw credit, when faced with problems in local markets orin their home market. A third concern is that the participation of foreign banks may be associatedwith broader efforts at deregulation and may overwhelm domestic banking supervisors, creating ariskier environment.Those on the other side of the debate argue that participation in global banking is asource of stability and improved banking practice. Proponents of this view claim that foreign banksmay directly bring new and better basic banking skills, more sophisticated management techniques,and products better suited to managing and spreading risk. Through the benefits of competition,these commentators argue, local banking skills and services will be improved. In addition, someobservers see indirect benefits from the participation of foreign banks. They argue that global banks,as either direct entrants or as inter-bank lenders, may accelerate the development of ancillaryinstitutions, such as rating agencies, accounting and auditing firms, and credit bureaus, whichacquire and process information. Similarly, banks that participate in many national markets mayimprove information disclosure about the banks themselves as the foreign banks compete to gainmarket share by demonstrating their comparatively sound financial condition. Finally, theproponents of this view argue that participation by cross-border banks may stimulate improvementsin the supervisory and regulatory framework.I believe that those who argue for the benefits of having a country open to globalbanking may have the better of the argument. We know, however, that whether foreign banks are asource of stability or fragility depends very much on the market, banking and supervisoryenvironments that they find in the host country. There are conditions that must accompany, or betterstill, precede a country’s decision to participate in today’s global banking market. If the participationof foreign banking competitors, either directly or through inter-bank lending, comes withimprovements in the underlying bank credit underwriting culture, the capability of bank supervisors,and the degree of transparency, then the benefits of foreign bank participation will eventuallyemerge. On the other hand, if foreign banks participate in a country in which neither the markettransparency, nor domestic banks, nor bank supervisors are prepared to change, I believe that theparticipation of foreign banks, by itself, will not necessarily be beneficial and could prove to be
- 2 -BIS Review   64/1998negative. Therefore, entry of foreign banks, either directly or as participants in the inter-bank lendingmarket, without movement to better information, better supervision and better banking, providesaccess to credit, but not necessarily an increase in macro-stability. To argue the benefits of globalbanking in the abstract, removed from these required conditions, therefore seems to miss the truefocus.Lessons from the Asian CrisesLet me now turn to the broad-based lessons that the Asian crisis teaches us. One ofthe most important contributing factors to the current financial crisis in many of the emerging Asiannations was the weakness of their banking systems, as well as weakness of bank supervision withinthose countries. It seems clear now that, Asian banks, as well as their government supervisors,violated some of the fundamental principles of banking and banking supervision. Banks’ managershad not developed adequate processes for underwriting loans and monitoring their continuedperformance, or of establishing sufficient and timely reserves to buffer expected loan losses. Some ofthese problems stemmed from lending directed by governments, which led to expectations that thegovernment would support such loans, if needed. But, the primary cause of these credit problemsstemmed from banks’ failure to deploy effective tools of credit risk analysis.The absence of credit risk analysis led to financial structures that were inherentlyfragile. Banking supervisors in these countries proved ill-equipped to compensate for the fragility.Poor allocation of credit undermined the prospects for sustained economic growth. Some borrowerscould not service their loans. As these domestic banks’ loan portfolios deteriorated and theirfinancial condition eroded, their creditors, domestic and foreign, looked at them more critically, andbegan to withdraw their funding. In short, the deteriorating condition of borrowers hurt the bankingsystem, which increased economic harm to the rest of these countries’ economies.Two other features of these countries’ financial systems have compounded theproblems caused by poor lending practices and inadequate supervision. First, standards for thetransparency and disclosure of private financial information were extremely lax. It was difficult forcreditors, foreign or domestic, to distinguish good risks from bad, and this caused them to both grantand, later, withdraw credit from borrowers within these countries without full knowledge ofborrowers’ creditworthiness. This latter reaction exacerbated the crisis for the businesses andcitizens of these countries. Second, creditors to banks no doubt relied to some extent on a publicsafety net to back up their claims. This was true not only of small depositors, but also of foreignbank creditors. As it turned out, the presumption of public support was at least to some extentmisplaced.Therefore, participation in the global banking market did not work to save thesecountries from fundamental information, banking and supervisory weakness. The fact that theinformation, credit and supervisory cultures had not yet changed, even with the participation offoreign banks and the extension of inter-bank credit, meant that ultimately these financial systemswere proved fundamentally flawed.We have also learned, or relearned, other lessons because of the handling of thesecrises. First, prolonged delay in tackling systemic banking sector weakness invites further weakness,not strengthening. Delay in the hopes that the economy will grow banks out of their problems, isattractive, but is actually a trap. Because of the credit allocation role that banks play in manyeconomies, delay allows problems to grow. Inefficient banks are allowed to allocate creditinefficiently, and open, insolvent banks, in effect distribute taxpayer money to bank shareholders,employees and borrowers. Second, extra attention is required to solve systemic bank weaknessesbecause of the inherent pitfalls associated with banks that are “too-big-to-fail”. Because the threat of
- 3 -BIS Review   64/1998closing very large banks may not be credible, it may be more difficult for supervisors to pressurevery large banks to improve their operations. As a consequence, supervisors need to have clear legalauthority, and political support, to order banks to take a variety of steps to improve their operations.This is a lesson that we in the United States learned only recently, and supervisors here are nowrequired to order banks to take remedial actions as capital falls below 8 percent.Reactions of the International Supervisory CommunityThe international supervisory community has heeded these lessons and reacted tothem. International recognition of the need for strong, effectively-supervised banking systems is thereason that the Basle Supervisors Committee issued its 1997 paper, “Core Principles of EffectiveBanking Supervision.” Bill Rutledge, Senior Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork, will discuss this paper with you after your break this morning. I cannot overstate theimportance of adopting such core principles of sound banking and banking supervision in theinternational banking system, and also the need to develop a workable mechanism for enforcing theimplementation of these standards.The Asian crisis also underscores the importance of transparency. Adequate marketdiscipline depends on investors having information that is sufficient in quantity, reliability, andtimeliness. In recognition of this, the Basle Committee is now exploring the possibility of settingbenchmarks for providing information about financial institutions that should be available to bothsupervisors and markets. International progress toward greater transparency is a vital initiative forthe markets and sound supervision. More broadly, I believe that the time is appropriate to hasten thewide-spread adoption of international accounting and disclosure principles that raise the standard foraccounting treatments in all countries. These standards should focus on three goals. First, anyinternational accounting principles should provide the basis for depicting a clear and fair picture ofthe condition of the bank and of corporate creditors. Second, any principles should provide a meansby which firms identify and disclose their major risks, such as funding, foreign exchange orconcentrations. Finally, compliance with these principles should be sufficient to support marketconfidence in the basic integrity of a firm’s published financial statements and other disclosures.Because of the increasing complexity of financial instruments and the speed ofmovement in financial markets, intrusive supervision has become less meaningful, if not virtuallyimpossible. Thus the federal banking agencies have adopted a risk-focused approach to bankingsupervision that emphasizes the adequacy of banks’ internal risk management systems. Events in thefinancial markets today occur too quickly to give anyone a comfortable learning curve in grapplingwith financial problems. I believe that our objective should be to make managers and institutionsbehave as if there were no safety net and align their natural market-driven decisions with supervisoryobjectives. Together with the traditional approaches of loan review and transaction monitoring,market-based supervision will best ensure the continued viability of the banking sector. We should,and are, actively searching for other methods to create incentive-compatible regulation andsupervision.The Asian situation highlights the value of a reliable system for US bankingsupervisors to assess banks’ country risk, which I know has occupied some of you recently. As manyof you are aware, the federal banking agencies, through the Interagency Country Risk ExposureReview Committee (ICERC), are developing an improved guide for examiners in evaluating thecountry-risk exposure in banks. This system will permit examiners to be more thoroughly informedon countries in which US banks have exposure and allow for a better cross check against banks’country risk management systems. New risk-focused examination procedures will also be aby-product of the current review of management practices.
- 4 -BIS Review   64/1998Finally, the Asian crisis and the speed with which it occurred demonstrate the needfor effective international communication and coordination. You confront this need in your dailywork in supervising global financial conglomerates. These large diversified companies, which arebecoming more prevalent in domestic and global markets, blend banking, securities, and otherfinancial activities in a single diversified company operating across national borders and traditionalindustry lines. This presents a significant supervisory and examination challenge because most of thelegal systems of the countries in which these firms operate are structured along national or smallergeographic regions. Many of these countries, including the United States, continue to employdifferent supervisory approaches, implemented by different regulators, for each traditional sector ofthe financial services industry. The crossing of national and industry lines can result in numerousfinancial services supervisors having responsibility for theoretically distinct pieces of these financialconglomerates, but no supervisor having clear authority to coordinate supervision of the entirejigsaw puzzle of each conglomerate. This is a critical deficiency because these conglomerates areworking to coordinate and integrate their business operations and supporting systems to the greatestextent feasible.This is why the Joint Forum on Financial Conglomerates in February issued itsconsultative documents, “Supervision of Financial Conglomerates”. This international coordinatinggroup is a joint initiative of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the InternationalOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and the International Association of InsuranceSupervisors (IAIS). The Joint Forum’s consultative documents make concrete recommendations forsteps that supervisors in each of the securities, insurance, and banking sectors can take to enhancesupervision of the group-wide risk exposures of these global and inter-industry conglomerates. Onekey recommendation is for the international supervisory community to agree on one or morecoordinators to facilitate international and inter-industry cooperation. The specifics need to beclarified, but you should all be aware of this international initiative, while also recognizing that morework remains to be done in this country to deal with the complex issues that arise from theinternational and inter-industry activities of these firms.Domestic Supervision of Foreign Banking OrganizationsMoving now from Asia to domestic issues, the International Banking Act (IBA) isperhaps the most notable of the laws governing the activities of foreign banking organizations(FBOs) here in the United States. The IBA requires, among other things, that, in order to approve abranch application, the Board must determine that a foreign bank is subject to comprehensivesupervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by its home country supervisor. This requirement,as you are undoubtedly aware, is commonly known by the initials CCS. I believe that the FederalReserve should continue to be rigorous in applying the CCS standard. The Board should also takegreat care in allowing entry into the United States by foreign banks from a country where CCS is notyet in place. In these countries, appropriate conditions could be imposed on the operations of the USbranch to help compensate for the lack of full CCS.Finally, let me raise an issue that symbolizes our global interdependence: the majorchallenge of being ready to turn the calendar page on December 31, 1999. As you are all well aware,the Federal Reserve, as well as the other banking agencies, have a keen interest in the Year 2000readiness of all banks in the United States and overseas. While all banks must address Year 2000readiness issues within their organizations, the issue appears to pose special problems for foreignbanks operating branches and agencies in the United States. To address the Year 2000 problem forthese banks, and international banking generally, the Federal Reserve is taking an active role in anumber of international initiatives, most notably including the Joint Year 2000 Council, which isjointly sponsored by the major international bodies for cooperation between financial marketregulators. The Joint Year 2000 Council has made a good start at its task. I am sure that it will
- 5 -BIS Review   64/1998continue to raise the visibility of this issue, help all countries recognize the magnitude of the Year2000 challenge, and provide guidance to and assistance for supervisors and financial marketparticipants in understanding the steps they need to take to meet the challenge. I refer you inparticular to the Council’s current paper on guidance to supervisors, which gives concrete steps onassessing preparations by financial institutions. Going forward I know that the Council intends toprovide guidance on developing testing programs and contingency plans.One focus of our concern with protecting the banking system in the United States isthat many US offices of foreign banks may be particularly exposed if their parents are not ready forthe Year 2000. Therefore, we have asked the US branches and agencies to confirm that they will beable to continue to conduct business using the usual standards for readiness that we apply todomestic banks. We are also examining foreign banking branches and agencies, as we have withdomestic banks under our supervisory authority. The initial round of examination of US branchesand agencies has been completed, and individual foreign banks are being made aware of the results.There are, of course, a number of competing initiatives that further stretch the limitedinformation systems resources available to achieve preparedness. In Europe and other parts of theworld, the introduction of the Euro, and the coordination of systems within the Euro-countries, isrequiring extensive planning and programming. In Japan, the “Big Bang” will likely take topmanagement focus from Year 2000 systems issues. Particularly in light of these competing demandsfor system resources internationally, foreign and US banks need to recognize the magnitude andimportance of the Year 2000 conversion effort. Banks need to take action now to devote sufficientresources to this critical mission. Senior management of banks and FBOs is responsible for dealingwith Year 2000 issues. It is not a technical issue alone; it is also a strategic business issue.ConclusionI believe that the emergence of modern international banking is probably likely to bebeneficial. While international banking holds the potential for macro-stability, the history offinancial crises, including the current ones in Asia, also shows how weakness in banking systemsand banking supervision may contribute to macro-instability. The prescription to avoid, or at leastminimize the impact of, future crises includes a combination of solid banking skills, well-conceivedbanking oversight at the national level, greater transparency, risk-focused and incentive-compatiblebanking supervision, and coordination among international banking supervisors.While creating this long-term environment, we must also respond to the moreimmediate challenge of protecting our domestic financial system from poorly supervised foreignentities and from the risks inherent in technology as we go into the new millenium.
BIS Review   63/1998Bank of Japan’s July report of recent economic and financial developments1   Bankof Japan communication, 21/7/98.The Bank’s View2Final demand remains weak and production has declined significantly. Employment andincome conditions continue to deteriorate, and corporate sentiment is weakening further. As a whole,Japan’s economic conditions have deteriorated.With respect to final demand, public-sector investment seems to have bottomed out. Netexports, which decreased temporarily in the first quarter of 1998, have resumed to increase mainly due toa sharp decline in imports. Business fixed investment, however, has decreased significantly, and housinginvestment remains weak. Private consumption has shown little sign of recovery, although thedeterioration has stopped. Against the background of weak final demand, the level of inventories remainshigh, and the decline in industrial production is accelerating. As a result, corporate profits have furtherdecreased, and employment and income conditions have deteriorated conspicuously as seen in the fall inwages below the previous year’s level.Although the above indicates negative interactions of production, income, andexpenditure, a further deterioration in the economy is expected to cease as the effects of thecomprehensive economic stimulus package, including additional public works and the special income taxreduction, become full scale. However, given the current considerably low level of economic activities,the positive influence of the package on private demand will likely be limited, and the economy’simmediate transition to a self-sustained recovery is hardly expected. In these circumstances, measures torebuild the stability of the financial system have been devised, and the reform of the taxation system isexpected to be discussed actively. The materialization of these policies along with the effects oncorporate and household sentiment should be carefully monitored.With regard to prices, wholesale prices continue to fall, and consumer prices (excludingthe effects of institutional changes) have declined slightly below the previous year’s level. With respectto the factors affecting the outlook, the downward pressure on domestic prices induced by the decline inimport prices is weakening. In addition, the expansion in the output gap in the economy is expected toslow in line with the implementation of the comprehensive economic stimulus package. Nevertheless,reflecting the present large output gap, the downward pressure from domestic factors is unlikely toweaken considerably, and hence, prices are likely to be weak for some time.As for financial markets, stock prices and yields on long-term government bonds haverebounded since mid-June 1998. This may be attributed to a slight recovery in market sentiment,although still weak, responding to the announcement of the Comprehensive Plan for FinancialRevitalization, the so-called Total Plan, and to the emergence of expectations for permanent tax cut.In money markets, with the heightened awareness toward financial problems at a bank,concerns over credit risks of financial institutions strengthened once again, and upward pressure oninterest rates suddenly mounted toward the end of June. However, with the ample provision of funds bythe Bank of Japan and the announcement of the Total Plan, market anxieties settled down, and theupward pressure on interest rates gradually eased.With respect to monetary aggregates, growth in M2+CDs has been slowing, reflecting thesluggish private bank lending. These developments appear to strongly reflect the further decline in credit                                                     1 This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meetingwas held on July 16, 1998.2 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at the MonetaryPolicy Meeting held on July 16, as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
- 2 -BIS Review   63/1998demand of private firms with the worsening of overall economic activities, and the continued cautiousattitudes of private banks in extending loans.Meanwhile, some firms, especially small and medium-sized firms, have been facingdifficult financing conditions in terms of both funds availability and fund-raising costs. This influence onthe overall economy continues to warrant careful monitoring.
BIS Review   60/1998Mr. Duisenberg reports on the outcome of the second meeting of the GoverningCouncil of the European Central Bank   Introductory statement by the President of the EuropeanCentral Bank, Dr. W. Duisenberg, at the press conference held in Frankfurt on 8/7/98.The Governing Council first assessed current economic developments in the euroarea. The general picture is one of continued economic expansion combined with broadly lowinflation.Several forecasts made during spring 1998 have even suggested slightly lowerrates of inflation for 1998-99 compared with expectations in autumn 1997. As far as pricedevelopments are concerned, inflation as measured by the harmonised consumer price index(HICP) is estimated to have risen slightly in April, to 1.4%, but has not increased further in May.Output growth has remained strong in recent quarters, with annual growth ratesclose to or even exceeding 3%. Economic growth has been driven increasingly by domesticdemand rather than net exports, as might be expected at this stage of the cycle. Privateconsumption and stockbuilding have been the main factors underlying domestic demand to date.The favourable conjunctural situation has started to feed through into the labourmarket, although improvements here have in some countries been too slow to appear. It isevident, however, that economic growth alone will not reduce the urgency to proceed withstructural adjustments in order to tackle unacceptably high rates of unemployment.As regards monetary and financial developments in the euro area, the annualgrowth rate of the broad money supply (M3H) accelerated in April to around 6% from 5.5% inMarch. The growth rate of M1, the narrow money supply, also picked up, to around 10%. Weshall monitor these developments very carefully.In principle, the economic performance I have just described provides afavourable environment for continued fiscal consolidation. It is with some concern that weobserve that in a number of member countries the prospects for this to actually develop seem tobe, to put it mildly, rather subdued.In this respect, I should like to underline three aspects. First, any “growthdividend” resulting from the current cyclical upturn should be used to bring deficit and debtlevels down, rather than relaxing control over expenditure. Second, most Member States need togo a step further, and indeed improve structural balances as they are not yet in compliance withthe obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact. This implies that the benchmark for fiscalpolicy must now be a budget close to balance or in surplus - in surplus especially in countrieswith high ratios of debt to GDP. Third, further structural adjustments in fiscal policy would alsohelp to improve the policy mix in some countries and in the euro area as a whole from the start ofStage Three.I would not at the present time want to try to convey too strong an impression ofthe implications of these various economic developments for the appropriate stance of monetarypolicies in euro area Member States. Although the responsibility for these policies remains withnational central banks until the end of this year, the Governing Council had an extensive andthorough discussion on a euro area perspective of monetary policy. We will continue to studythis issue closely before we enter the regime of a single monetary policy. For the time being, it isencouraging to see the credibility of monetary policy being reflected in the exchange rates of
- 2 -BIS Review   60/1998euro countries. There is currently no sign of exchange rate tensions among euro area currencies.Forward exchange rates are expected to be virtually identical to central rates, suggesting that thepre-announced rates are considered credible. I consider this a remarkable achievement.Following its review of economic developments, the Governing Council settled anumber of organisational issues.i. It adopted the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank. Thesewill be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities;ii. It approved, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, the establishmentof eleven ESCB committees to assist in the work of the European Systemof Central Banks (ESCB). The committees are as follows (listed inalphabetical order): Accounting and Monetary Income Committee,Banking Supervision Committee, Banknote Committee, ExternalCommunications Committee, Information Technology Committee,Internal Auditors Committee, Legal Committee, Market OperationsCommittee, Monetary Policy Committee, Payment and SettlementSystems Committee, and Statistics Committee;iii. It formally adopted a budget for the European Central Bank for the secondhalf of 1998 and agreed on the establishment of a Budget Committee toassist the Governing Council in ECB budget-related matters;iv. It laid down specific rules applicable to staff transferring from theEuropean Monetary Institute to the European Central Bank. ECBDecisions relating to the Conditions of Employment will be published inthe Official Journal of the European Communities.The Governing Council also took a number of decisions relating to variousaspects of its preparatory work for Stage Three.(a) Monetary policy issuesThe Governing Council decided on the introduction of a minimum reserve systemby the ESCB at the start of Stage Three. Among the three main functions that a minimum reservesystem could usefully perform, the Governing Council attaches particularly high importance toits contributions to the stabilisation of money market interest rates and to the enlargement of thedemand for central bank money by creating or enlarging a structural liquidity shortage in themarket.In the light of the potential burden which a minimum reserve system could imposeon the private sector and the effects it might have on the financial activity of credit institutions inthe euro area, the Governing Council has decided on features which fulfil the two money marketmanagement purposes outlined above, while at the same time allowing an adequate remunerationof minimum reserves.A number of details of the minimum reserve system that will be applied werealready specified in previous documents published by the European Monetary Institute.Additional features agreed upon yesterday include the liability base, the lump-sum allowance andthe rate of remuneration. With regard to the latter, the ECB will remunerate minimum reserveholdings at a level corresponding to the rate of its main refinancing operations. The GoverningCouncil intends to decide on the exact specification of the minimum reserve system in November
- 3 -BIS Review   60/19981998 at the latest. This decision, in particular as regards the reserve ratio (which is currentlydefined within a range of 1.5% - 2.5%), will be based on the early data from the new system formoney and banking statistics.Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to youthis morning.It is intended that the precise features of the minimum reserve system will bepublished in the form of an EU Council Regulation. For this purpose, the Governing Counciladopted an ECB Recommendation for an EU Council Regulation on the application of minimumreserves by the European Central Bank. In accordance with the provisions of the Statute of theESCB, the EU Council, acting by a qualified majority and after consulting the EuropeanParliament and the Commission, is expected to adopt this Regulation.The Governing Council also adopted ECB Recommendations for EU CouncilRegulations concerning the collection of statistical information by the ECB and concerning thepowers of the ECB to impose sanctions. All three ECB Recommendations will be published inthe Official Journal of the European Communities for general notice.(b) Foreign exchange issuesThe Governing Council decided on the size and form of the initial transfer offoreign reserve assets to the European Central Bank from the national central banks participatingin the euro area. This transfer is to take place on the first day of 1999. It has been decided that theinitial transfer will be to the maximum allowed amount of EUR 50 billion, adjusted downwardsby deducting the shares in the ECB’s capital subscription key of the EU central banks which willnot participate in the euro area at the outset. The transfer will thus be equal to 78.9153% ofEUR 50 billion, i.e. approximately EUR 39.46 billion.The Governing Council furthermore agreed that this initial transfer should be ingold in an amount equivalent to 15% of the sum I have just mentioned, with the remaining 85%being transferred in foreign currency assets. I should stress that the decision on the percentage ofgold to be transferred to the ECB will have no implications for the consolidated gold holdings ofthe ESCB.The precise modalities of the initial transfer will be finalised before the end of theyear.Before the end of the current year the Governing Council will also have to adoptan ECB Guideline pursuant to Article 31.3 of the Statute of the ESCB, which will subject alloperations in foreign reserve assets remaining with the national central banks - including gold -to approval by the ECB.In connection with the setting-up of common market standards, the GoverningCouncil also reached agreement on a number of issues related to the quotation and publication ofreference exchange rates for the euro. Specifically, it was agreed to recommend to marketparticipants the “certain” method for quoting the exchange rates for the euro(i.e. 1 euro = X foreign currency units) and to have daily reference exchange rates for the eurocomputed and published by the ECB.
- 4 -BIS Review   60/1998Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to youthis morning.(c) Payment systems issuesThe Governing Council decided on the conditions for the participation of thenon-euro area EU central banks and credit institutions in the TARGET (Trans-EuropeanAutomated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer) system. In TARGET the ESCB willprovide central bank liquidity in the course of the day (i.e. intraday liquidity) to the extentnecessary to avoid delays in the execution of payment orders. If intraday liquidity is notreimbursed at the end of the day it becomes overnight credit granted by the ESCB, which, forevident monetary policy reasons, cannot be offered to institutions outside the euro area.Nonetheless, non-euro area EU central banks and institutions in those countries will beconnected to TARGET.The Governing Council considered that giving such institutions outside the euroarea unlimited access to intraday credit would have created risks for the conduct of monetarypolicy that it was not ready to take. A facility will therefore be put in place to enable the non-euroarea EU central banks to provide collateralised intraday credit in euro to their credit institutions,subject to a ceiling both at the level of the non-euro area EU central banks and at that of non-euroarea credit institutions. There will also be a liquidity deadline, set at 5 p.m., for non-euro areacredit institutions so that they do not incur an overnight overdraft in euro.Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to youthis morning.The Governing Council also agreed that a report on recent developments in thefield of electronic money - and their monetary policy implications - would be published inSeptember 1998.(d) Legal protection of euro banknotesFinally, the Governing Council agreed on a number of legal instruments aimed atenhancing the protection of euro banknotes. In particular, an ECB Decision on thedenominations, specifications, reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of banknotes has beenadopted, as well as an ECB Recommendation regarding the adoption of certain measures toenhance the legal protection of euro banknotes and coins. Both documents will be published forgeneral information in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
BIS Review   59/1998Mr. Tietmeyer discusses the role of the IMF in the global economy   Opening addressby the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof. Hans Tietmeyer, at the symposium “The Role of theIMF in the Global Economy” held in Frankfurt am Main on 2/7/98.A mass of analyses, commentaries and proposals have already appeared concerning thecrisis in some emerging markets and the problems in certain countries in transition. Many have helped toenlighten us, but some have merely created more confusion. I hope that today’s symposium will belongin the enlightening category.The title of the symposium sums up the main issue: we are living more and more in aglobal economy. This has been caused by two driving forces; firstly, political factors: the opening ofgoods and services markets worldwide, which has been gradually proceeding for decades theever-growing liberalisation of capital transactions, and the internal orientation of countries in transitionto market-based structures. Secondly, technical developments are having an ever-increasing impact: thealmost perfect information technologies now available, and the highly efficient transportation systems.These two aspects are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. The political openingstrengthens the economic incentives to seek newer and better technical solutions. Conversely, technicalprogress creates powerful pressures to liberalise markets as it makes the maintenance of barriers moreand more inefficient and expensive.The benefits and challenges of globalisation are inextricably linked. Above all,globalisation brings major benefits for everyone. The most important benefits are: greater efficiencythrough stronger competition, a better allocation of resources and, consequently, falling costs.Ultimately, the rising standard of living worldwide owes much to the gains produced by globalisation.But it has other noticeable effects, too. Globalisation demands considerable internalflexibility from economies, and, at the same time, credibility from the national political decision makers.And the integration of previously national markets increases interdependency. As a result, national andregional crises can no longer be considered in isolation. Contagion is a constant danger in the world oftoday and tomorrow.That is why, in addition to each country’s primary duty to prepare for and preventfinancial crises in its own territory, joint efforts at the global level are also meaningful and necessary.And this is without question the task of the IMF.Some people believe that the recent financial crises would not have happened if there hadbeen no globalisation and that, consequently, the gradual opening of markets is the main cause of theproblems. But that view is too short-sighted. The main causes are the misguided or at least risky policiespursued by the countries in question. Essentially that also applies to the countries affected indirectly.Their own internal weaknesses make them vulnerable.It is also true that the global financial markets, with their tendency towardsshort-termism, are sometimes a factor in making the magnitude of the potential reversal so great. If acountry then loses the confidence of investors because of a political error, it is punished hard - sometimestoo hard, at least for a time.IIThe outbreak of the crisis in some Asian countries poses some new questions becausesome of the key fundamentals were quite sound: In many cases the public fiscal balance was in surplus orat least was not in excessive deficit. Unemployment was fairly limited. The monetary policy stance wasmostly quite restrained, and inflation remained moderate for a long time. For quite a while currentaccount deficits were financed by capital imports apparently unproblematically.
- 2 -BIS Review   59/1998Some indicators even showed an exceptionally positive trend. In particular, the savingand investment ratios were comparatively high, and real growth in this region was stronger thanelsewhere. Until a short time ago, the title of such a symposium might well have been “The Asianeconomic miracle”.On closer inspection, however, it can be seen that the economic successes of recent yearsalready carried the seeds of the later crisis: massive short-term capital inflows, asset inflation in theequity and property markets, in some cases a misallocation of capital, currency appreciation in real terms,decreasing competitiveness and growing current account deficits. These symptoms also pointed tointernal weaknesses and political mistakes: for example, an over-rigid pegging of the exchange rate to thedollar and inadequate efficiency of the domestic financial sector.Certainly, there are good reasons for pegging an exchange rate to another currency.Credible pegging to a stable anchor can help to reinforce internal discipline. And it can help to lower therisk premium demanded by investors.But there are other considerations which can become a danger if the exchange rate ispegged too rigidly: They can make it hard to pursue the objective of internal monetary stability. Interestrate policy becomes a hostage to the exchange rate, for - given strong capital inflows - an interest raterise often has an opposite impact on monetary expansion than the one intended. A persistent stability gapcan then arise in comparison with the anchor country which over time can endanger the competitivenessof exports. In addition, the fixed exchange rate encourages residents to borrow in foreign currency atrelatively favourable nominal interest rates. However, they expose themselves to substantial risks if theirown currency has to devalue.In this way the policy of rigid exchange rate pegging helped to make some countriesvulnerable to a change in mood in the markets and hence to a rapid reversal of financial capital flows.Moreover, in some cases the domestic financial sector was underdeveloped and not veryefficient. Not infrequently the financial institutions were subject to political pressure. And thesupervision was not particularly effective.When the capital began to flow back out of these countries, this soon led, in conjunctionwith a vulnerable financial sector, to a massive disruption of the economic system. Hence mistakes inmonetary policy, omissions in supervising financial institutions and insufficient domestic competitivestructures in some cases made the crises possible in the first place and were largely responsible for thescale of the crises.A number of Asian countries tolerated the emergence of a bubble economy and evidentlydid not correctly assess the associated dangers. However, the financial and foreign exchange marketscannot move out of step with real economic conditions in the long run. A reversal will occur one day -suddenly and mostly in an exaggerated form. That is dangerous for the countries concerned, but alsoquite often for others, too.An overall analysis of the problem must include some further aspects:Firstly, the crisis has not yet been overcome, despite the IMF’s intervention and despitethe reforms initiated in a number of countries. The causes - but also the resistance to solutions - are oftendeep-seated. It is very hard to change long-established patterns of behaviour and accustomed routines.Yet policy makers in the countries concerned cannot and should not shy away from these challenges - inthe self-interest of the countries concerned but also in the interest of others.It is encouraging that certain countries have taken important steps to tackle thesechallenges and are reaping the first rewards. That also confirms that the IMF has pointed these countriesin the right direction.
- 3 -BIS Review   59/1998And secondly, some structural problems of the Asian emerging economies are by nomeans unique. Such problems also exist elsewhere, and often have similar causes: in some countries intransition the financial sectors are too weak; external debt is often rather short-term and denominated inforeign currency to an excessive extent.In some industrial countries there are at the moment tendencies towards exaggeratedasset prices. One must ask oneself whether the prices reflect the true value of the underlying assets andwhether perhaps the potential for a reversal is becoming too great.The situation in Japan is a special problem. The efforts to overcome the difficulties inthat country via monetary and fiscal policy means have been unsuccessful so far. But it is not exclusivelya problem of finding the right macroeconomic course.It would seem that there is still too little competition on the goods and especially thefinancial markets in Japan. In particular, the problems in the financial sector, which have accumulatedover years, demand convincing, forward-looking solutions. At the same time a problematic vacuum existsin some areas and the political response has been too hesitant and vague with respect to the necessarycorrections. It is to be hoped that the new announcements will soon be followed by convincing andconfidence-building actions.IIIIn dealing with financial crises, the Fund has learned many lessons in the past few yearsand has accumulated important experience with the strategy of intervening very early with massiveamounts. The rationale behind this strategy is more or less as follows: the best way to counter a crisis ofconfidence in a country, once it has broken out, is to take resolute action to provide comprehensiveconditioned financial assistance and so to set an unmistakable signal. In my view, however, the results ofthis strategy have not been particularly encouraging in a number of cases.At least three serious drawbacks are apparent: Firstly, the frequent application of thisstrategy is simply very expensive for the Fund.Secondly, levels of financial assistance that are announced very early on act like a kindof benchmark. And in the next crisis they are considered the absolute minimum. If the internationalcommunity were to offer less, the countries concerned and the financial markets could well interpret thisas indifference, as proof of a kind of benign neglect - or even malign neglect.And thirdly, an early, massive intervention by the IMF undermines the ability of thefinancial markets to function in the long run. Functioning markets need not only the chance to makeprofits but also the possibility to punish mistakes through incurring losses. Otherwise there is a danger ofa moral hazard. And not only for the policy makers of the countries concerned. The markets, too, willend up underestimating the risks because they are confident of a bail-out. This leads to globalmisallocation of capital and shifts costs on to the public sector.Basically, this reveals the central problem of any form of interventionist economicpolicy: the other players come to expect interventions and anticipate the later measures. On balance, ithas become clear that an interventionist strategy for managing financial crises can easily lead to a deadend.
- 4 -BIS Review   59/1998IVSo how can the IMF escape from this dead end on a lasting basis? Naturally, there is nomagic formula. But there are a few general conclusions.The first requirement is that the Fund should concentrate less on correcting a marketoutcome that has already occurred. Instead it should try to influence the ex ante setting in which thefinancial markets operate and to improve their functioning.That begins with improved prevention. Above all, this requires more transparency andinformation so that the financial markets can form their expectations more rationally and morerealistically and so that the IMF itself can assess the need for action more quickly. Specifically, thismeans publishing more data (especially on the maturity structure and denomination of external debt),publishing timelier data and at shorter intervals (if possible, monthly instead of twice-yearly) and usingmore sources, that is not only the data of the borrowers themselves but also data from the lendingfinancial institutions in the industrial countries.Improving the data quality of a number of countries will certainly require a substantialintensification of basic statistical work and more openness. However, the return of benefits is likely to beconsiderable.The advantages of greater transparency are obvious. The countries concerned have agreater recognition of the need to take certain action. The “ownership” of adjustment programmes, inparticular, increases. And there are less uncertainties for the market players.The limits of such transparency must lie where confidentiality and the “internalopenness” of advisory or decision-making processes have to be upheld. But in the integrated world oftoday it must also be clear that national sovereignty is increasingly coming up against its limits.The IMF itself can contribute towards more information. But it is not a rating agency.The ultimate responsibility for correctly assessing chances and risks in a given country remains with theplayers in the financial markets.In the broader sense, greater prevention also includes technical support. For example, theinternational community can and should provide support, especially in the field of banking supervision,where a number of emerging economies evidently still have some weaknesses. The BIS recently set upthe Institute for Financial Stability in order to train expert staff, and the committees of the G-10 centralbank governors, which mostly meet in Basle, have now intensified their cooperation with therepresentatives of the emerging economies.In addition, the IMF should take account of the recent experience and specific conditionsof countries when making its policy recommendations. For example, the level of development of thedomestic financial sector needs to be taken into account in assessing the right route to the liberalisationof capital transactions. And when recommending an exchange rate peg, the country’s ability to cope withsuch a regime needs to be considered carefully.Finally, one aspect of prevention should surely be that the IMF, wherever economicpolicy weaknesses are apparent, should exert greater pressure if necessary on the government concernedbefore a crisis has broken out, even if the extent to which this can be done publicly is a very sensitivequestion.For the main contribution towards effective crisis prevention must be made, of course, bythe countries concerned themselves. That applies to emerging economies and countries in transition, tothe poorer developing countries and, not least, to the industrial nations as well.
- 5 -BIS Review   59/1998A necessary precondition for winning the confidence of the markets is convincingeconomic and political action (good governance). No one can ignore market mechanisms in the long runwithout causing economic damage. And political power must not be misused in order to secure personaladvantages and to distort the domestic economy with lucrative monopolies.VWhen a crisis does break out, the IMF should again pay more attention to its catalyst roleas a moderator and coordinator. The primary aim must be to maintain or restore the crisis countries’access to private capital.Therefore the IMF should contribute towards bringing creditors and debtors togetherround the table at an early stage and towards working out market-based solutions. I fully agree with whatMr. Michel Camdessus said in a recent interview in a German newspaper: “Moral hazard exists.Overcoming this problem, however, requires the involvement of the private creditors. Their participationis the backbone of our activity”.Clearly, not every case is identical. It is naturally easier to perform the role of moderatorif - as in some Asian cases - the creditors are in the main commercial banks. In some cases in Asia theIMF seems to have been rather late in seizing that chance. If the groups of creditors - as in the Mexicocase - are more widely spread and heterogeneous, it may be more difficult to bring all the interestedparties together around one table. On the other hand, if non-banks are involved more heavily, the dangersof a spreading financial crisis in the sense of a systemic risk also tend to be smaller.The IMF should also minimise its provision of financial assistance not least becausethese are public resources which it is distributing. It should therefore itself bear only the absolutelynecessary portion of a financing package. It can define a maturity and an interest rate for the resourceswhich it provides that give the debtor an incentive to repay them as soon as possible. Finally, of course,the IMF must make its help subject to certain requirements, that is it must define the conditionality. Thatis part of the IMF’s mandate and is also in the interest of the world community.In defining the conditionality it is imperative to tackle the underlying causes. Time aftertime it has become clear that macroeconomic measures alone often do not suffice. In Asia - as elsewhere- it has become apparent instead that one of the root causes was the insufficient soundness and robustnessof the financial sector.The work of the committees in Basle and the efforts of the Fund have laid the basis forappropriate rules and appropriate supervision. The key need now is to translate that into action. For manyof the countries concerned that may not be easy. But the gains will make the effort worthwhile.Moreover, effective financial supervision and robust financial sectors are a prerequisite for the furtherliberalisation of capital transactions as envisaged by the IMF and supported by us.VISince last autumn the IMF has come under heavy criticism from some quarters - mostunfairly in some cases. The proposals for improving the situation range from abolishing the IMFaltogether to setting up additional institutions.We can be certain of two things: Firstly, the IMF is now over 50 years old. When ahuman being reaches that age we say that he or she is still capable of doing outstanding work, hasacquired great experience but, of course, is not infallible. Secondly, the overall setting has changedtremendously in the past decades. The world has long since moved away from fixed exchange rates withlimited capital transactions. Today the exchange rates of the major reserve currencies are flexible and themarkets are becoming increasingly integrated worldwide.
- 6 -BIS Review   59/1998But I do not believe that the Fund’s age and the changed setting mean that the IMF issuperfluous. On the contrary! In this context I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we inGermany have already notified the Fund of our agreement to an increase in our quota in order tostrengthen the financial basis of the Fund’s activities.But, of course, providing money is not enough. An interdependent, global economyrequires not only efforts to achieve political cooperation but also vigilant watchdogs. In the first instance,it is the market players themselves who are responsible for exercising vigilance. It is not the Fund’s taskto take over or replace the watchdog function of the markets.But in improving the functioning of the financial markets, the IMF also pinpoints theresponsibility of the private investors themselves. For this reason the IMF must concentrate on itsoriginal function of acting as a catalyst. This central role of the IMF needs to be strengthened rather thanreduced. In performing this role, the IMF will contribute to enhancing the stability and openness of theglobal economy. That is a challenge for at least another 50 years!
BIS Review   58/1998Mr. Bäckström’s opening remarks at the Conference on Monetary PolicyRules   Opening remarks by the Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Urban Bäckström, at theConference on Monetary Policy Rules, in Stockholm, on 12-13/6/98.It gives me great pleasure to open this conference, which is a joint arrangement bySveriges Riksbank and the Institute for International Economic Studies. First of all I want toextend a warm welcome both to the authors of the seven interesting papers and to all thediscussants who will be participating in our proceedings. All those who are attending theconference are likewise heartily welcome and we hope they will take an active part in the seriesof discussions. For us at the Riksbank, as well as  for me personally, the opportunity ofwelcoming such a large assembly of leading international experts and central bankrepresentatives is a notable landmark in the practical task of restoring price stability in Sweden.Monetary policy has attracted a great deal of research in recent years. Much of thisresearch work has concerned major practical issues that are highly relevant for those of us whoare engaged in monetary policy’s daily round. I should like to take this opportunity of thankingall of you here who have made contributions in this field. My thoughts go, not least, to TorstenPersson and Lars Svensson, who also as advisors have provided valuable assistance to uspractitioners to the Riksbank.One thing is clear: the sounder the theoretical foundation for monetary policy, theeasier is the life of a central bank governor.Sweden on the way to establishing price stabilityThere has been something paradoxical about Swedish economic policy.After the period of generally high inflation that started with OPEC 1, Sweden wasone of the last of the industrialised countries to re-focus economic policy on price stability. Thenotion that a trade-off exists between inflation and unemployment lived on in Sweden for longerthan in other countries. It took rather a long time for the drawbacks of a level of inflation thatwas relatively high, for an industrialised country, to be widely recognised.At the same time, Sweden has a long tradition in the field of central banking. TheRiksbank, founded in 1668, is the world’s oldest, still-functioning central bank. This gives usthree hundred and thirty years experience. It was in Sweden, too, that the first banknotes—inEurope at least—were introduced in the seventeenth century. A monetary policy focus on pricestability, which is one of the themes for our forthcoming discussions, has always been animportant item on the central bank policy agenda. A well-known Swedish economist, KnutWiksell, was a clear exponent of the idea in the late nineteenth century. As it happens, headdressed an audience on the subject here in Stockholm a hundred years ago almost to the day,namely on 14 April 1898. In one of his books he wrote:“If prices rise, the rate of interest is to be raised; and if prices fall, the rate ofinterest is to be lowered; and the rate of interest is henceforth to be maintained at its new leveluntil a further movement of prices calls for a further change in one direction or the other.”Just over three decades after his address in Stockholm, Sweden had to leave thegold standard in September 1931. The objective of monetary policy was declared to be to use“every available means to maintain the Swedish krona’s domestic purchasing power”. In this way
- 2 -BIS Review   58/1998the Riksbank was the first central bank to declare openly that its monetary policy norm was pricestabilisation.Notwithstanding this long tradition, after inflation’s rising trend in the post-warera, Swedish economic policy’s reorientation toward price stability did not begin until the late1980s and early 1990s. That was a decade or so after such realignment had been initiated in othercountries. By then, Sweden had experienced twenty years of inflation that averaged 8 per cent ayear. That was the longest inflationary period since the early nineteenth century. In contrast, inthe one hundred and forty years from 1830 to 1970, inflation in Sweden had averaged an annualrate of 2 per cent. So one can say that in the present decade we have been re-establishing ourroots.Sweden’s policy realignment in the early 1990s was, however, more painful thananyone could have foreseen. One conceivable explanation is that, having waited longer thanother countries, the road back to price stability was more difficult for us. There were also anumber of exceptional events along the way. What was perhaps the worst bank crisis of thecentury erupted in the wake of the 1980s’ bubble economy. Exchange rate turmoil was such that,during some dramatic days, the instrumental rate was hiked to 500 per cent. In the early 1990sthe budget deficit grew to be the largest in the industrialised world. There are many similarities,as well as some differences, between the financial crisis in Sweden and those in Mexico andSoutheast Asia.In recent years the situation in Sweden has become more stable and, with aresolute economic policy, developments have taken a positive turn. The bank crisis has beenresolved, the economy is in an expansionary phase and inflation expectations are low. Step bystep, the credibility of the new regime is being established. Experience in other countries clearlyshows that the consolidation of a changeover to a low-inflation regime takes many years.Inflation target’s historical roots and advantagesThe idea of focusing monetary policy on price stability goes back, as I mentionedearlier, at least to Wiksell’s arguments a century ago. It seems to me that Wiksell’s emphasis ondeflation being as important to avoid as inflation has much to do with the acceptance of thispolicy today.In Sweden and many other countries, the old idea, in the 1950s and 1960s, that atrade-off exists between inflation and unemployment resulted in an increasingly high level oftrend inflation. When the drawbacks of active economic policies of this type became apparent,people in general and their representatives also feared the other extreme - a monetary policy thatconsistently aimed at keeping inflation as low as possible. Some countries, of which Sweden isone, are basically averse to deflation. So a regime whereby monetary policy has a systematic,long-term commitment to keeping inflation at a predetermined level of 2 per cent, neither morenor less, represents what many people perceive as a balanced approach to avoiding deflation aswell as inflation. This has made it easier to establish the legitimacy of the regime in the publicmind.Some relevant issues for a practitionerLet me now turn to some matters which a practitioner finds important and whichwill also be touched upon during the coming two days.
- 3 -BIS Review   58/1998One issue concerns the indicator of inflation that is appropriate to use as anexplicit target. The practical considerations in this respect are complex and are currently beingdebated in Sweden. The consumer price index has the advantage of being familiar to a widepublic. Besides measuring trend inflation, however, it also gives information about pricefluctuations that stem from transitory supply-side shocks, for example changes in indirect taxesand interest costs. With the CPI as the target variable, the central bank encounters problems inthe public discussion because shocks of various kinds are liable to result in temporary deviationsfrom the target. If some indicator of underlying inflation is targeted instead, however, it is likelyto be relatively unfamiliar to people in general. Neither is it entirely clear how the optimalindicator of underlying inflation should be constructed.Whichever alternative one chooses, it is essential in my opinion that the centralbank be prepared to contribute to as open a discussion as possible, so that its ambition ofachieving and maintaining price stability is not lost sight of and the public’s ability to hold thecentral bank responsible for the conduct of monetary policy is not weakened.Another issue is the choice of a targeting horizon for the monetary policy. Thisrelates to the trade-off between output volatility and inflation volatility. As it stands this sentenceis correct but very difficult to understand.A short horizon for inflation targeting, say keeping inflation at the target levelfrom quarter to quarter, yields a very stable inflation rate. In order to maintain this target,however, the central bank must make drastic adjustments to the instrumental rate and this causesa high degree of variability in real economic activity. A long target horizon may well implygreater variability in the inflation rate but would allow for more gradual interest rate adjustmentsand smaller real economic fluctuations. In our approach the normal target horizon is set atbetween one and two years.A third issue is the degree of transparency. It is widely agreed that transparency isnot merely compatible with an inflation target regime but actually essential if the regime is tofunction properly. For one thing, the central bank must be accountable for its conduct ofmonetary policy. This is a question of monetary policy’s basic legitimacy, which is important notleast when the central bank operates independently. For another, the actual implementation ofmonetary policy needs to be as predictable as possible.Would maximum transparency be preferable? Is there really any point at which aline should be drawn or would it be more reasonable to try to identify a certain minimum level oftransparency? Should the minutes of monetary policy meetings and the voting be published?Would it even be right to allow the central bank’s monetary policy meetings to be shown ontelevision?For my part, it seems reasonable to publish relatively detailed minutes ofmonetary policy meetings without revealing exactly who said what at which stage in thediscussion. It is, after all, important that discussion during the meetings is open andunprejudiced, so that the participants can listen to their colleagues’ arguments, change theirminds in the course of a meeting and accept joint responsibility for the decisions that are made.At the same time, it is important that each individual is responsible for arguing for his or herposition. I can also see a case for reporting how votes are actually cast. This is, in fact, alreadythe practice of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.
- 4 -BIS Review   58/1998Monetary policy and asset pricesFinally some words about a matter that is not directly on the agenda for ourdiscussions. I am referring to how monetary policy should respond to asset prices. The reason forbringing it up today is threefold. First, it is a matter that is widely discussed today in manyinternational forums as well as in many central banks. Second, as a practitioner I would like toencourage our leading international experts present here today to study it further in the years tocome in order to develop more knowledge in this area. It could be the topic for a futureconference. My third reason is more personal. Before I came to Sveriges Riksbank I was statesecretary at the Ministry of Finance and involved in the management of Sweden’s financialcrises. The obvious question for me is why did it happen and how can we prevent it from everhappening again.I have already touched on the question of monetary policy’s target variable, which,as we all know, is a very complicated matter. An additional dimension is whether asset pricesmore formally should be included in the target variable for monetary policy?The question about monetary policy and asset prices is by no means new. At thebeginning of this century economists like Irving Fisher were already emphasising the importanceof following not just consumer prices but also asset prices. Some decades later, the tradition fromFisher was taken up by Alchian & Klein in what has became a well-known paper from 1973. CPIcan be seen as a measure of “current service flow prices”. Asset prices in turn measure “futureservice flow prices”. A weighted index consisting of CPI as well as asset prices could serve as aninter-temporal indicator of living costs. The underlying idea was that such an index couldcontribute to a monetary policy aimed at price stability. The authors argued that if the centralbank concentrates solely on the development of consumer prices, monetary policy may be eithertoo contractive or too expansionary, the reason being that consumer prices usually react moreslowly than asset prices to a contractive or expansionary impulse from monetary policy. There isthen a risk of monetary policy having a destabilising tendency.Alchian & Klein found, however, that the construction of such an index was ratherdifficult in practice; but they did underscore the importance of monetary policy’s taking thedevelopment of asset prices into account. Recently, Charles Goodhart drew attention to what isnow the twenty-five year old paper by Alchian & Klein; he, too, sees difficulties involved in aweighted index of consumer and asset prices. The conclusion is probably that asset prices shouldnot formally be included in the target variable for monetary policy.Asset prices are, however, taken into account in a regime that explicitly targetsinflation in terms of the consumer price index or a variant of this. This occurs via householdwealth effects and corporate capital costs, which influence total demand, alter the output gap andthereby modify inflation prospects. If asset prices rise so strongly that, via increased demand,inflation tends to rise above the targeted rate, the central bank will normally respond bytightening the monetary stance. Conversely, the monetary stance will be eased if asset prices fallso much that inflation is liable to be below the target. Thus far the analysis is fairlystraightforward. Even if asset prices do not feature explicitly in the target variable, they will betaken into account in a monetary policy model that targets the consumer price index.Sweden had a combination of high inflation and rising asset prices in the 1980s. Itmight then be argued that policy failed to concentrate on price stability in terms of the consumer
- 5 -BIS Review   58/1998price index. It should be noted that with the fixed exchange rate regime at that time, theoverheating in the economy was primarily a matter for fiscal policy. Price bubbles developed inasset markets, followed later by price falls for shares and real estate, for example. This in turn ledto the severe bank crisis. But can the Swedish bank crisis be explained simply in terms of aninsufficient focus on price stability?The example of Japan in the 1980s suggests that consumer price stability may notbe a sufficient condition for precluding bubbles in asset prices and financial instability. Withtrend inflation averaging two per cent a year, the situation in Japan in the 1980s was very close towhat we now commonly mean by price stability. Yet the Japanese economy still moved towardsa period of grave financial instability.Thus, the question practitioners have to consider is how to deal with a situationwhere asset price effects are taken into account with reference to consumer price inflation butwhere there may still be a risk of asset price bubbles that may lead to financial instability, adestabilisation of the real economy and a severe downward effect on consumer price inflationlater on.One could argue that the effects of a large rise in asset prices on aggregate demandmay be smaller than the effects of a large fall if such a fall increases general uncertainty andleads to more cautious spending behaviour. If the collapse of a bubble in asset prices has a muchstronger effect than the preceding boom, it may be optimal to increase interest rates to raise theprobability of bursting a bubble even though such a policy action may temporarily lead to lowerconsumer price inflation in the short term than otherwise would have been desired. The reasonfor this conclusion is that that bursting the bubble sooner rather than later reduces the probabilityof a still larger bubble later on with an even greater downward effect on consumer price inflation.Hasn’t experience taught us that a growing risk of instability may be indicated bya steep increase in asset prices at a time when the credit supply have been expanding at anunsustainable rate for some time? If such a situation happens to coincide with low prospects forconsumer price inflation, might there then be grounds for the central bank to depart from itsinflation target for the time being in order to curb the increase in asset prices?That special circumstances might prompt a temporary departure from a centralbank’s inflation target is not a novel suggestion. It has been discussed, for example, in thecontext of natural disasters, large supply shocks and so on. And what is a full-blown bank crisisif not a serious economic disaster?At the same time, curbing rapidly rising asset prices when prices of goods andservices still show little sign of turning upwards is not exactly an easy task for the central bank.One of the difficulties lies in justifying this to the general public. Another is whether an assetprice bubble is actually developing; does the central bank really have better information than themarket participants? A third problem is that an interest rate hike might exacerbate the subsequentcourse of events when asset prices are corrected. Fourthly, the central bank’s ambition to steerasset prices directly could perhaps pave the way to a much larger bubble in the future. In otherwords, can safeguards against financial bubbles and an absence of subsequent economicconsequences lead to a moral-hazard type of phenomenon among the market participants?Circumstances must evidently be very special to warrant central bank action tocounter asset price bubbles if there is no concurrent upward pressure on consumer price inflation.
- 6 -BIS Review   58/1998It is also reasonable that the central bank presents a clear case for such a course of action anddoes so before such a special situation arises.The Riksbank has started a biannual series of reports on the financial system’sstability. The idea is to draw lessons from our recent experience of a bank crisis and be in aposition - should the need arise in some distant future - to discuss any policy measures that mightbe called for in the event of a risk of financial instability. This could also be done in our InflationReports.The situation today in Sweden is very different from the 1980s. Asset prices havebeen rising steeply since 1994 but indebtedness did not turn upward until quite recently. Thissuggests that the risk that the banking sector will experience significant problems in the event ofa fall in asset prices is relatively small today. However, we must continue to monitor risks in thisfield in the years to come.ConclusionNow when we are assembled here for an important conference, with interestingcontributions from a number of the world’s leading experts in the field, we would do well to betemperate in our appraisal of what we believe we know today. To this end I shall quote LawrenceSummers. In connection with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s symposium on“Achieving Price Stability”, Summers considered the major changes that have occurred inmacroeconomic thinking in the past two decades and then rounded off by saying:“It would be a misreading of history to think that we have now identified finaltruth or that some of the views expressed here will not look archaic twenty years from now.”That is a stimulating and challenging statement. Think how dull life would seem ifwe ever arrived at the final truth. As luck would have it, the increasingly complex reality inwhich we live is an endless source of challenges for researchers as well as central bankcolleagues throughout the world.ReferencesAlchian, A. & Klein, B., (1973), “On A Correct Measure of Inflation”.

1BIS Review 132/1999Ms Hessius comments on the inflationtarget and the state of the economy in SwedenSpeech given by Ms Kerstin Hessius, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, before the SwedishEconomic Association, in Stockholm on 12 December 1999.*      *      *I would like to begin by thanking you for inviting me to come and speak at this meeting of theSwedish Economic Association. I am looking forward to this evening’s discussion. Sweden is now inits seventh year with an inflation target since it was announced at the beginning of 1993. A number ofother OECD countries have also been pursuing inflation target policies for several years, so by nowthere is a rich fund of experience to draw on.This evening I intend to take up some of the challenges for monetary policy under an inflation targetregime, bearing in mind in particular the position of Sweden. How active should an independentcentral bank be in stabilising economic conditions? What form of interplay between monetary andfiscal policy leads to favourable economic development when monetary policy is directed towards aninflation target? Naturally this is a big question, so I intend here to confine myself to a few key points.In conclusion, I thought I would make a few remarks on the “new economy”.Stable conditions rather than stabilisation policyStable conditions in the form of less variability in the real economy mean enhanced welfare for societyas a whole.One essential question is whether, in general terms, short-term stabilisation policies should be pursuedin an attempt to bring about high real growth in the long term. It is worth emphasising here thatmonetary and fiscal policy differ in how promptly they react to changes in economic circumstances.In principle, the Riksbank can adjust its instrumental rate at any time whatever so as to stimulate orcurtail demand. At the same time, however, the impact of such measures can be expected to peak onlyafter 1 to 2 years. This means that monetary policy should be framed primarily with a view to itslong-term effects.Fiscal policy, in contrast, can have a major direct impact on the economy, but its most importantcomponents resist rapid change. There are administrative costs associated, e.g. with changing tax rates,and changes in regulations take time to implement. This means that fiscal policy is difficult to adaptquickly to meet changed economic prospects.This leads to the conclusion that even if monetary policy can react immediately to changes in theeconomic situation, neither monetary nor fiscal policy should aim to influence economic conditions inthe short term, i.e. to function as instruments of “fine tuning” stabilisation policy. Instead, bothmonetary and fiscal policy should be designed so as to create stable long-term conditions.The contribution made by monetary policy to welfare is precisely to create as stable conditions aspossible in the economy by means of the inflation target policy. As this task is formulated in theRiksbank Act, the objective of the Riksbank’s operations shall be to pursue price stability and topromote a secure and efficient system of payments.The role of fiscal policy should include shaping the tax system so as to create the best conditions forthe highest possible potential output. Changes in the Government’s financial savings and therequirement that there should be a surplus in the public finances over the course of a business cycleboth work to create greater confidence in economic policy. The orientation of the budget policy, likethat of monetary policy, is of great significance for the way the economy develops. If the fundamentalrules of the game are stable, the actors in an economy will dare to make long-term decisions.
BIS Review 132/19992Of course, it would also be desirable for monetary policy and fiscal policy to work together in such away as to moderate major variations in employment and growth, i.e. so as to reduce cyclicalfluctuations around potential growth.Since this may be difficult to achieve in practice, one question that arises is what is the optimal modeof interaction for fiscal policy and monetary policy within the framework of the inflation targetregime.What happens in an inflation target economy if fiscal policy completely disregards the state of theeconomy?What happens, e.g. when the economy is in a boom if fiscal policy is conducted along excessivelyexpansive lines? In the absence of a credible nominal anchor in the economy, e.g. in the form of aninflation target, demand increases further. This in turn leads to a tendency on the part of firms to raisetheir prices, particularly in a situation where production is constrained by bottlenecks. In addition,employees will demand higher wages, and the combined effect will be to create a spiral with risinginflationary pressure, such as we experienced, for example, in the 1980s.Adjustments towards a higher price level can occur over an extended period but will gradually set inmotion processes that put a brake on growth. This is a manifestation of the established theory that it isnot possible to raise the long-run productive capacity of the economy with short-term stimulationpolicies.What happens in this scenario if the central bank has an inflation target? When inflationary pressure inthe economy increases, the central bank will tighten monetary policy so as to prevent the inflationtarget from being exceeded.Such a course of events would result in an unfavourable policy mix. The stimulation provided byfiscal policy would be counteracted by the monetary policy, which would mean that even the positiveshort-term effects of the stimulation would decrease or even become negative. Moreover, if thestimulation provided by fiscal policy is very powerful, this could lead to expectations of an increasedrisk that the inflation target cannot be upheld, which would then lead to rising inflation expectationsand higher risk premiums on Swedish interest-bearing papers. Households and companies may feelgrowing uncertainty both about developments in public revenues and expenditure, and about theformulation of monetary policy. This can be costly for the economy if it leads to a failure to carry outinvestments and to unnecessarily cautious decisions about the allocation of resources. To sum up,then, it becomes more costly to pursue an excessively expansive fiscal policy when monetary policy isguided by an explicit inflation target.A good policy mix makes for better conditionsA better policy mix arises if the orientation of fiscal policy does not make for higher inflation riskpremiums. It can avoid this if the orientation of fiscal policy appears to be sustainable in the long run.The surplus-target in the public finances is a good example of this.One means by which the confidence felt by the general public in economic policy can be monitoredconsists of inflation expectations, which should not diverge substantially from the Riksbank’s inflationtarget. When expectations of inflation diverge from this target in the longer term - whether upwards ordownwards - it implies that monetary policy should be adjusted so as to steer expectations backtowards the target.In this connection it is important to observe that a central bank whose inflation target commands highcredibility often has more scope for acting than one that has little credibility. Assume, for example,that an economy where the credibility of the inflation target is high experiences a positive disturbanceto the business cycle, leading to higher demand. Since the inflation risk premiums are low, employeeswill not need to demand extra high nominal wages to insure themselves against unexpectedly highinflation. This is because it can be anticipated that the central bank will tighten monetary policy. Thisin turn will mean that less stringent measures will probably be required than would be needed by acentral bank that had not yet established its credibility.
3BIS Review 132/1999Turning more specifically to the situation in Sweden, it can be said that the macroeconomic conditionstoday are favourable: inflation is low, budget deficits have been transformed into surpluses and theprospects for growth are good. However, economic policy is a continuous learning process and thesuccesses of recent years should not be taken as evidence that the structural problems have beensolved. On the labour market, for example, structural rigidities remain; also, the tax-pressure is stillhigh, which inevitably distorts incentives to work and save. As far as monetary policy is concerned,the credibility of the inflation target regime has as yet hardly been tested in a period of economicupturn.What does this mean for how much and how often monetary policy should react to changes in theeconomic outlook? This, of course, is a question that the Executive Board of the Riksbank addresseson an ongoing basis, communicating its views in inflation reports, the minutes of its meetings andspeeches. In general terms, it can be said that the need for action should be based on the outlook fordomestic demand, the stringency of fiscal policy and international trends. In addition, inflationexpectations play a key role as an overall indicator of inflationary pressures. In a situation whereinflation risk premiums are low, an independent central bank with a price stability target can alsocontribute to stabilising the economy around its potential growth.How far does this responsibility extend? According to the way the Riksbank has explained the target,annual inflation measured by the CPI is normally to be restricted to 2% with a tolerance interval of±1 percentage point. In the event of a deviation from this target, inflation is normally to be broughtback on target within 1-2 years. In the event of a major deviation, caused for example by a majorexternal disturbance, there may, however, be reason to extend the horizon of the target so as to limitfluctuations in production and employment. In other words, in these circumstances it may be toodifficult or too costly for monetary policy to quickly bring inflation back on target.The “new economy”Let me now take up another question that is the subject of much discussion both in the media and inacademic circles: the existence of a “new economy”. When people talk about this, their eyes are turnedprimarily towards the American economy. The concept seems to be capable of covering manyphenomena. In this context I define the “new economy” as an increase in the potential growth of theeconomy.In the last few years, the growth of the American economy has surpassed most forecasts. Not only hasthe rate of growth been high in historic terms during the present upswing - around 3.5% per year onaverage since the end of 1991 - it has besides been very stable and unusually long lasting. At the sametime, unemployment has fallen to near 4%; levels this low have not been witnessed since the 1960s.However, in distinction to previous booms, there has been no increase in the rate of inflation and theunderlying rate of inflation has been more than halved since 1991, from over 4% to 2%. Publicfinances have improved considerably, from a deficit of 5% of GNP in 1991 to an expected surplus ofaround 1% this year.Looking at productivity per hour worked in American business, which is perhaps the best measure ofhow good a country’s growth potential is in the longer term, this has risen sharply, by over 2.5% onaverage since 1997; this figure can be compared with an average growth of productivity of around1.5% over the period 1974-96. A substantial part of the improved productivity of labour can beexplained by very high investments - so-called “capital deepening” - not least in computer equipment.In spite of the fact that unemployment has continued to fall throughout the period, the growth ofproductivity has been impressively high. This is remarkable considering the fact that the new jobshave principally been created in the service sector, where productivity generally increases at a lesserrate than in manufacturing.Three principal groups of reasons for the positive trend in America can be distinguished.One important reason behind the upswing appears to be good economic policies. Since the beginningof the 1990s, fiscal policy has been directed towards achieving a balanced budget, and for a year or sonow the budget has been balanced. In order to achieve this, taxes have been raised, expenditure
BIS Review 132/19994diminished and budgetary procedures made more stringent. Monetary policy has been directedtowards keeping inflation low and stable and has succeeded in warding off both destabilisinginflationary and deflationary pressures at an early stage. The policy mix of monetary and fiscal policytherefore appears to have been favourable.A number of structural factors seem to have been important. Deregulations in many sectors andincreased globalisation have intensified already tough competition and increased the pressure on thepartners on the labour market, leading to greater flexibility in the labour market and enhancing labourmobility. The increased and more effective use of new technology (IT) has raised productivity, and theuse of JIT (Just-In-Time Inventory Management) has meant that the match between supply anddemand in the economy has improved. The increased openness in the economy that has resulted fromamong other things the NAFTA and GATT agreements, has meant that foreign trade has functioned asa “shock absorber” for fluctuations in domestic demand.Finally, fortunate circumstances seem to have played a part. With the end of the Cold War at thebeginning of the 1990s, resources were freed up, principally in the military sector, which could be putto more productive use in the private sector. Further, both the Mexican crisis and the Asian crisis havebeen shocks that have checked certain tendencies towards overheating and thus also inflation, yetwithout leading the economy into recession. During the crises, a “flight to quality” appears to have ledto falling long interest rates, which has benefited stock exchange prices and strengthened the dollar.Foreign investors have been willing to finance the deficit in America’s current account, which atpresent comes to about 4% of GNP.To sum up, it seems likely that a certain rise in the growth potential has taken place in the USA duringthe 1990s and that inflationary tendencies have declined. Just how much nevertheless remains an openquestion. The OECD, for example, has raised its estimate of the potential growth rate to just over 3%.However, in the past three years growth has amounted to more than 4% on average, which means thatthe OECD regards some of the factors discussed above as temporary in nature and expects growth toslacken as these factors die away.In the course of the very powerful upturn in the American economy, significant imbalances have builtup at the same time. Among other things, the deficit in the current account has never been as great as itis now, and recently consumption has been increasing more rapidly than household incomes, whichmeans that the savings ratio has been at a record low. Sooner or later these imbalances will need to becorrected. However, a discussion of how this might come about lies beyond the bounds of what Iintended to talk about this evening.Are there traces of a “new economy” in Sweden?–Since Sweden switched from a fixed exchange rate to an inflation target, monetary policyhas been designed so as to reach this target and thereby create credibility. Monetary policyhas succeeded in stabilising prices and at the present time long-term inflation expectationsapproach the Riksbank’s target of 2%. The changes in fiscal policy, which have entailedamong other things a reform of budgetary procedures and the imposition of a ceiling onpublic expenditure, have had positive effects. This is manifested, for example, in the budgetsurpluses now being produced. Overall, we have made good progress towards achievingmacroeconomic stability and therefore appear to fulfil the requirements for “good economicpolicy”, even if we have fulfilled these for a considerably shorter time than the USA.–If, on the other hand, we look at structural factors, our problems were perhaps also worsefrom the start. The Swedish economy is less open to competition than the American. Forexample, even adjusted for differences in value added taxes, the level of prices in Sweden ison average 15-20% higher than in the USA. Many deregulations that were carried out longago in the USA, such as the deregulation of the transport sector, for example, have beencarried through more recently in Sweden and there are many indications that we have not yetseen their full impact. However, competition in many markets is expected to increase inSweden in the future, in part as a result of increased globalisation and European integration.One area in which very little has been done is the labour market, which is very rigid andregulated compared with the American.
5BIS Review 132/1999–Where the introduction of new technology is concerned, Sweden has gone further in this thanmany other OECD countries. For example, we have the highest number of Internet users percapita in the whole world.–Like the American economy, the Swedish economy is very open to the world around it andSweden has a long tradition of free trade. To some extent this counteracts the tendenciestowards limited competition on the Swedish market.–But on the other hand, as yet we have seen no clear indications in the statistics of the impactof the new economy. For example, Sweden shows no signs of the strong growth ofinvestment that has been seen in the USA in the last four to six years. Further, there are noindications that the productivity of labour has increased very much, which appears to havebeen an important element of the strong growth in America.In the opinion of the Executive Board of the Riksbank, as stated in the Inflation Report (1999:3), thetrade-off between inflation and growth has improved to some extent, even if there is considerableuncertainty about how much. In conclusion, the Swedish economy appears to have undergone onlysome of the structural changes that the American economy has implemented. It remains to be seenwhether the “new economy” can have any further impact in Sweden.
1BIS Review 132/1999European Central Bank Press Conference introductory statementsIntroductory statements given by Dr Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank,and Mr Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Press Conference, heldin Frankfurt on 2 December 1999.*      *      *Ladies and gentlemen,The Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of today’s meetings of the GeneralCouncil and the Governing Council of the ECB, the latter of which was attended by Mr Niinistö,President of the EU Council.Let me first report that the Governing Council decided to confirm the reference value for monetarygrowth, namely an annual growth rate of 4½% for the broad aggregate M3. This decision was taken onthe grounds that the components underlying the derivation of the first reference value in December1998, namely the Eurosystem’s definition of price stability and the assumptions for trend real GDPgrowth and the trend decline in M3 income velocity, have remained unchanged.As before, the Governing Council will assess monetary developments in relation to the reference valueon the basis of a three-month moving average of annual growth rates. The Governing Council hasdecided henceforth to review the reference value on a regular annual basis, with the next review totake place in December 2000.Against this background, the Governing Council wishes to emphasise that the trend growth potentialof the euro area could be considerably enhanced by structural reform in the labour and goods markets.The Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy would take such changes into account, as appropriate. Thederivation of the reference value of 4½% is an expression of a medium-term-oriented approach. Thegenerous liquidity situation in 1999 will have to be borne in mind.The ECB will issue a press release today providing some background information on the review of thereference value carried out today by the Governing Council. The press release will also recall the roleof the reference value within the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy.The Governing Council also conducted its regular review of the outlook for price developments andthe risks to price stability in the euro area, this time including a review of the most recent forecasts andprojections. After this examination, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of theEurosystem was left at 3.0% and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and on the depositfacility were maintained at 4.0% and 2.0% respectively.Allow me to outline the main elements of our assessment of the latest information on monetary,financial market and other economic developments.With regard to monetary developments in the euro area, the data up to October 1999 - which still referto the period before our decision to raise interest rates - confirmed the picture of a generous liquiditysituation in the euro area. The annual growth rate of M3 in October 1999 was 6.0%. This compareswith 6.2% in the previous month. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, coveringthe period from August to October 1999, was unchanged at 6.0%, and thus stood 1½ percentage pointsabove the reference value of 4½%. The growth of the most liquid components of M3 remained verydynamic. In addition, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector continued to exceed 10%.As we have noted on previous occasions, these monetary and credit developments are considered tohave been driven mainly by the low level of interest rates, as well as by the pick-up in economicactivity in the euro area.The initial reaction of euro area financial markets to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy move of lastmonth was favourable. In particular, this was signalled by the continued decline in long-termgovernment bond yields and the immediate substantial reduction in market uncertainty regarding the
BIS Review 132/19992evolution of future long-term interest rates. Later in November, long-term bond yields in the euro areabegan to rise again gradually, in connection with developments in international bond markets andfavourable expectations for world growth.Indeed, the global economic outlook remains positive, and the view that the world economy is set forhigher growth appears to be shared by the major international organisations. At the same time, theexpectation that growth differentials between the main economic regions will narrow in the course oftime is widespread. While real GDP growth in the United States is generally expected to ease, it isexpected to accelerate in the euro area. Overall, relatively wide growth differentials between the majorworld economies will give way to a more balanced scenario, thereby underlining the potential for theeuro to appreciate.With regard to developments in economic activity in the euro area, the latest data confirm astrengthening of growth in the course of the second half of 1999. In particular, production growth inthe industrial sector saw a further upturn in the third quarter and various survey data suggest that thiswill continue in the final quarter. All available projections indicate that this upward momentum willlead to an acceleration in real GDP growth, from around 2% this year to close to 3% in both 2000 and2001.Consumer price increases, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), haverecently resumed their upward trend, as expected. In October the annual rate of change in the overallHICP was 1.4%, up from 1.2% in September and August owing to higher price increases for food andnon-energy industrial goods. The impact of higher oil prices on energy prices in the HICP, which hadaccounted for most of the upward pressure since June 1999, was countered in October by moremoderate increases in other energy components. Some additional counterweight to the upwardmovement in goods prices came from a further moderation of increases in prices in the services sector.In general, the overall upward trend is expected to continue until early 2000 as a result of the increasein oil prices since spring 1999. Forecasts available suggest that price increases will neverthelessremain below 2% in the course of 2000 and 2001. However, the actual developments will very muchdepend on the behaviour of a number of factors, and in particular on wage developments remaining inline with price stability. In addition, our assessment has to take due account of prevailing uncertainties.On the upside, these relate to, inter alia, the behaviour of money and credit aggregates, thedevelopments in oil prices and the path of the effective exchange rate, all of which are closelymonitored with regard to their impact on price stability. On the downside, main factors are linked tothe effects of deregulation and liberalisation.In conclusion, the current monetary policy stance should ensure a sustainable expansion ofnon-inflationary economic activity in the euro area. In line with its monetary policy strategy, theGoverning Council will remain vigilant with regard to any risks to price stability arising either fromdomestic or from external sources and act in a timely manner.Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to introduce some of the additional topics wediscussed during our meetings.The Governing Council today also took a decision on the subject of the minimum reserve system. Asyou may be aware, interbank liabilities are not subject to reserve requirements. In this respect, theECB allows those credit institutions which cannot provide evidence of their interbank liabilities - inthe form of debt securities issued with an agreed maturity of up to two years or money market paper -to apply a standardised deduction to the aforementioned liabilities in the computation of their reservebase. Since January 1999 this standardised deduction has been set at 10% for both types of securities.Today, following a review of new statistical evidence available, the Governing Council decided toincrease the standardised deduction to 30%. This decision shall have effect as from the determinationof the reserve requirement to be fulfilled in the maintenance period starting on 24 January 2000. Aseparate press release presenting this decision and some background information on standardiseddeductions from the reserve base will be issued to you here today.The Governing Council today approved the ECB’s budget for 2000, which gives the ECB the greenlight to recruit further staff needed to support the ongoing activities of the ECB. This will bring theECB’s staff to slightly over 1,000; the number of staff employed to date stands at 750.
3BIS Review 132/1999At its meeting on 18 November 1999 the Governing Council approved the publication of an update ofthe book on “European Union balance of payments statistical methods” (the “B.o.p. Book”). Thisimportant book documents the statistical methodologies applied in Member States in compilingbalance of payments statistics and, as such, improves the transparency of the compilation of euro areastatistics. This new version includes additional chapters on: (i) investment income; (ii) estimationmethods, especially for goods, investment income and portfolio investment; (iii) financial derivatives;and (iv) the stocks compiled for international investment position statistics. The book was publishedon the ECB’s Web site at 4 p.m. yesterday and will be available from the ECB in hard copy formatduring the course of next week.Finally, let me inform you that the General Council discussed the monetary policy objectives,strategies and intentions of the non-participating EU central banks against the background set by themonetary policy of the Eurosystem. This is the second time that such an exercise has been undertakensince the ECB was established.
BIS Review   108/1998Mr Jalan looks towards a more vibrant banking systemInaugural address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Mr Bimal Jalan, to the BankEconomists [apostrophe?]Conference (BECON’98) held at Bangalore on 16/12/1998.IntroductionI am happy to join this special gathering of bankers and deliver the inaugural address to theconference of bank economists . This year’s meeting of bank economists is particularly importantas it is being held against the background of one of the worst meltdowns of the financial systemexperienced by a number of economies.The recent financial market developments show that we have come to live in a world ofconsiderable uncertainty, where prudence and foresight get rewarded while errors, inadequatejudgements and bad decisions impose severe costs on the individual financial intermediary aswell as on the financial system as a whole. In today’s liberalised financial environment, savers,investors and financial intermediaries are widely dispersed, not necessarily confined to domesticboundaries. This has made capital extremely fluid and highly sensitive to policies andperformance of the financial systems of the recipient countries. Pursuing policies and practicesthat ensure improved efficiency and continued stability of the financial system has assumedcritical importance in the present context of a more open world economy.In India, over the past few years, we have made substantial progress towards improving theperformance of our financial system and putting in place a new financial regime which relies lesson detailed controls and directions and more on initiative, autonomy in decision-making andaccountability. Policy initiatives since 1992 in this regard have been directed at building strengthand ensuring the safety and stability of the financial system. Compared with the experience ofmany developing countries embarking on financial sector reform, we have trodden cautiouslyand in an orderly fashion, which has helped us in minimising the adjustment costs involved inthe process. This, however, should not lead to any complacency, particularly in the context of thepresent fluidity of international capital markets and the increased vulnerability of developingeconomies to sharp fluctuations in macroeconomic situations. These disturbances tend to getexaggerated if the financial system is fragile and lacks depth in absorbing internal and externalshocks.It is important to note that the number and frequency of bank failures in the world have increasedrapidly in recent years. These failures have occurred both in countries which followed relativelymore open policies as well as the ones exercising control in different degrees. Recent experiencesin East Asia and elsewhere have brought to fore the criticality of a financial system’s stability forensuring sustainability of openness in invigorating economic growth. In one important sense italso marks a departure from the excessive emphasis laid on the proposition that financialliberalisation per se will lead to higher growth. While developing financial institutions andmarkets is important for growth, it may not, however, prove sufficient to provide desirableoutcomes if the safeguard systems are not very sound and the financial system is unstable.It is in the above context that the theme of this year’s bank economists’ conference, namely tostrengthen the Indian financial system, assumes critical importance. Indeed this is a concern formost developing countries at present. Many of them have initiated a fresh round of structuralreforms in their financial systems. A number of international agencies, including the Bank for I would like to acknowledge with thanks the help of Shri M.S. Mohanty and Shri Partha Ray of the Reserve Bank ofIndia in the preparation of this lecture.
– 2 –BIS Review   108/1998International Settlements (BIS), are also currently engaged in identifying factors that raise thevulnerability of financial systems and devising new safety standards that would help promotestability. In India, the second Report of the Narasimham Committee has recently addressed anumber of vital issues pertaining to the health and stability of the financial system and the actionthat is necessary to strengthen it. Some of these recommendations have been implemented in therecent monetary and credit policy announcements.As professional bankers and economists, you are no doubt seized of the challenges that the recentdevelopments in international financial markets have posed for the Indian financial system. Whathas been our experience of financial reforms so far? Where do we stand in terms of financialstability considerations? What are the tasks ahead if the Indian financial system is to improve itscompetitive strength substantially and strengthen itself to withstand the pressures of instability?What role should the bank economists be playing in this environment? Let me try and address afew of these issues in my remarks this morning.A Review of DirectionsThe significance of the financial system for an economy arises from at least three major sources.First, it performs various transformation functions relating to intermediation of funds in theeconomy. Secondly, it provides the mirror image of the underlying real economy and the basicmacroeconomic balances. Thirdly, it is one industry whose basis of operation is underpinned inpublic trust. The strength of this bond between the banking system and people in general dependson how the financial viability of the banking system is perceived. The organisation and conductof financial markets should be such that they reflect the underlying fundamentals of theeconomy. The financial system as a whole must remain sound and stable in order to enjoy a highlevel of public confidence.Until recently, the improvement in various transformation functions of the financial system wasthe focal point of reform initiatives in many developing countries. The basic issue was how tocreate a competitive environment for the financial system and to put in place a policy regimewhich would lead to improved allocative efficiency of the financial sector and enhancement ofsaving and investment activities of the economy for attaining faster rates of economic growth. Asfinancial markets developed and matured, the two-way interaction between the financial andnonfinancial policies grew in importance. In the recent years, the increased market exposure ofthe financial system and its vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks have highlighted the need forgreater internal controls and the need for strengthening prudential norms and regulations. In anenvironment of rising importance of cross border capital flows, perceptions and expectationsplay major roles in shaping events and this consideration can be particularly heightened if thefinancial system is perceived to be weak and unsound. It is not surprising that financial reforminitiatives globally have now moved to the strategic considerations of ensuring continuedstability of the financial system.In India, since the formal announcement of the first initiative of financial sector reform in theUnion budget of 1991–92 to the Second Report of the Narasimham Committee in 1998,considerable ground has been covered in putting in place a financial system which can meet therequirements of a more competitive and open economy. By and large, financial reforms in Indiahave proceeded in four major directions.First, setting the policy conditions right and removing the operational constraints of the financialsystem. What the reform process has tried to achieve is to lower the share of pre-emptedresources in the total resources of the banking system through gradual liberalisation of the cash
– 3 –BIS Review   108/1998reserve ratio and the statutory liquidity ratio. While the medium term target of 25% and 10% setfor the CRR and SLR, respectively, have been, by and large, achieved, these ratio levels are stillhigher than what would perhaps look ideal in the international context. Our relatively highreliance on the cash reserve ratio has been necessitated by the needs of monetary policyoperations. As financial markets develop, allowing for a greater role for the interest rate in theeconomy, the dependence on this instrument of monetary policy would need to come down infuture.The second directional change has been in the area of creating a more competitive environmentin the financial sector through reform measures such as relaxation of entry and exit norms,reduction in public ownership in the banking industry and letting banks access the capital marketin order to meet their funding requirements. The objective is to bring out the best result in termsof pricing and quality of banking services over a period of time.The third important direction of reform has been the strengthening of market institutions andallowing greater freedom to financial intermediaries. These reforms have taken the form ofgradual liberalisation of interest rates, development of money, capital and debt markets andgiving operational flexibility to banks in the management of their assets and liabilities subject, ofcourse, to prudential guidelines. In simple terms, these changes imply a greater degree ofexposure of individual financial institutions to the domestic and international economicenvironment.In this connection, a distinction needs to be made between two types of market developments,which have implications for the financial system. One is developments in respect ofmacroeconomic fundamentals of the economy which impact on the interest rate, exchange rateand other asset prices. This is a normal phenomenon in any economy and has implications for thebalance sheets of the financial intermediaries. Institutions which do not have an organisedapproach in anticipating events, undertaking pre-emptive actions and designing a suitableresponse to unanticipated developments can find themselves in a difficult situation, particularlyin times of a large degree of fluctuations in macroeconomic variables. The dangers posed bymarket and credit risks arising out of macroeconomic shocks need to be given special attention ina liberalised financial system. Our reform initiatives in this area are still in the formative stage.The second type of market developments which have implications for the financial sector relatesto asset price bubbles, which may be related to a high concentration of bank lending to one ortwo sectors which have a boom and bust cycle of their own. This form of market exposure can beunhealthy and lead to irreparable shocks. Although the impact of such cycles on our bankingsystem is quite limited, international experience suggests that, unless prudential measures are inplace, banks can be potentially vulnerable to asset price pressures that can generate systemicrisks for the financial system.The fourth important element of reform concerns the “safety” aspects of the financial system.This is the core of the challenges facing the financial system at present. When the reform processwas started in 1992, there was a massive problem of cleaning the balance sheets of banks whichhad deteriorated over the years. Successive reform initiatives in this area have been aimed atprescribing certain prudential standards for the financial system and addressing certain structuralweaknesses which could minimise their recurrence in future. Measures such as incomerecognition norms, asset classification, meeting minimum capital adequacy standards throughrecapitalisation and devising a supervisory framework are steps in the direction of ensuring thesafety of the financial system.
– 4 –BIS Review   108/1998Where Do We Stand?The key indicators of banking sector performance during the past few years mark certainnoticeable changes. For example, the net profit of the scheduled commercial banks as apercentage of their total assets has been turned around from a negative figure of –1.0% on anaverage during 1992–93 and 1993–94 to a positive of 0.5% during 1994–95 to 1997–98. In thecase of most public sector banks, business per employee and profit per employee have shownimprovement in the recent period. Certain other indicators also look good. By 1997, almost allpublic sector banks had achieved the minimum capital adequacy norm of 8%. The gross and netnon-performing assets of the banking system as a percentage of advances declined to 16% and8.2%, respectively, by March 1998. In terms of percentage to total assets, gross and net non-performing assets declined to 7.0% and 3.3%, respectively, by March 1998.I think the present statistics are not unfavourable for the banking system as a whole. As thesecond report of the Narasimham Committee has observed, “this improvement has arrested thedeterioration in these parameters that had marked the functioning of the system earlier”. Keepingin view the current macro economic and international financial situation, the Committee hasnoted that:“There is still, however, a considerable distance to traverse. The process of strengthening thebanking system has to be viewed as a continuing one. There is no finite end to improving thelevels of efficiency and profitability. In fact, the situation is one where the system has to copeconstantly with changes in the broader environment in which it functions and face newchallenges that these developments impose on it” (p. 18).The banking sector indicators in India need to be seen against the backdrop of increasedvulnerability of the financial systems of developing countries and the need for improving itsefficiency and stability. The Narasimham Committee has presented a detailed analysis of variousproblems and challenges facing the Indian banking system and made wide-rangingrecommendations for improving and strengthening its functions. Let me shortlist a few key areas,which must concern us at this stage.The Indian banking system is still perceived as a relatively high cost banking. This is because ofthe relatively high operating cost of the banking system. A comparative analysis indicates thatwhile the average operating cost of banks as a percentage of assets was about 2.3% in Indiaduring 1990–91 to 1995–96, it was 1.1% in China, 1.6% in Malaysia, 1.9% in Thailand, 1.0% inJapan and 2.1% in G10 Europe. One of the major problems posed by a relatively highintermediation cost in our case is that it gives rise to uneconomical banking. It raises thenecessity of maintaining a relatively high interest income spread and a high real lending rate.This adversely affects financial intermediation and growth in the economy.Operating costs depend on labour productivity, technology, innovation and organisationaleffectiveness of a bank to harness various static and dynamic economies from the productionprocess. On the economy-wide scale, these factors differentiate the weak from the strong bankingsystem and provide internal strength and stability to the system. Without gaining sufficientadvantage in this respect, it is difficult to think of a significant improvement in the bankingsystem in future.A key issue relates to the banking sector’s non-performing assets (NPAs). The amount of grossand net NPAs have been on the rise, although the rate of their growth has been below the overallrate of expansion of advances. Apart from absolute size, the distribution of non-performing
– 5 –BIS Review   108/1998assets is skewed across banks. Still a large number of public sector banks have net non-performing assets ranging between 10 to 20% of net advances. The Narasimham Committee hasunderlined the need to reduce the average level of net NPAs for all banks to 3% by 2002 and tozero for banks with international presence. I think this is an important requirement for ourbanking system and is crucial to maintaining the viability of the system in future. A two-prongedstrategy identified by the Committee viz., to reduce the backlog NPAs and improve themanagement efficiency and stricter enforcement of prudential norms, has to be acted upon to dealwith this challenge.Another critical aspect is the soundness of the banking system and how this is reflected in thepractices and principles followed by banks. Prudential norms and supervision are necessary, butthey are no substitute for the internal control system and sound business practices. The ability todistinguish between a normal business risk and an abnormal one, managing such risks anddefining a prudent limit for risks are essential functions for the bankers. For a long time, Indianbanking did not have a tradition of dealing with various forms of market risks. The critical roleof managing such risks has now come into the open, especially against the experience of therecent East Asian crisis, where markets fell precipitously because banks and corporates did notaccurately measure the risk spread that should have been reflected in their lending activities. Nordid they manage such risks or provide for them in their balance sheets. In India, the ReserveBank has recently issued comprehensive guidelines to banks for putting in place an asset-liabilitymanagement system. Formal guidelines will be issued shortly in the light of suggestions receivedfrom banks. But, ultimately risk management is a culture that has to develop from within theinternal management systems of the banks. Its critical importance will come into sharp focusonce current restrictions on banks’ portfolios are further liberalised and are subjected to thepressure of macro economic fluctuations.While developing a system of internal control and risk management is of critical importance forthe banking system, there is no escaping the fact that a permanent improvement in the state ofIndian banking is not possible without addressing the long-term structural weaknesses of thesystem. Our banking system operates with a large continent-wide network of branches, yet thescale economies in the banking industry are limited, owing  to the fragmented organisationalstructure. Today, size is becoming increasingly important for strategic business planning in everysphere of the economy. The banking sector is no exception. When competition is the key issue, itis the market structure and regulation that need careful attention. Furthermore, given the multi-tier financial system of our economy, and the complementarity and synergetic relations amongthese different tiers, it is difficult to isolate the efficiency of the banking system from that of thelong-term financial institutions, cooperatives, rural banks and non-bank financial companies. Amore meaningful reorientation of objectives and functions of various tiers of financialinstitutions would be necessary in dealing with the long-term issue of enhancing thecompetitiveness of the system as a whole. It is also important to ensure that the ownershipstructure of Indian banks is such that managerial decision-making is not affected by non-economic considerations, and banks are able to raise sufficient capital in line with theirincreasing volume of business.Another crucial issue, especially in the present context, relates to banks’ special role in the creditdelivery system. There is no inherent conflict between the canons of sound banking and banks’proactive role in credit disbursements to promote growth. These two objectives arecomplementary to each other. High growth leads to high credit off-take and credit availabilityconditions influence growth prospects of an economy. Ultimately, it is the credit business whichis central to the profitability of the banking system. To the extent that excessive risk aversion
– 6 –BIS Review   108/1998among bankers restricts credit growth in the economy, it has adverse effects on the profitabilityof the banking system as well as on economic growth.Credit disbursement to the rural sector and small-scale industries require special attention frombanks. The Gupta Committee recommendations involving greater flexibility and discretion to thelending banks in the agricultural sector in matters of collateral, margin, security, no duescertificate, composite cash credit limits etc., have to be implemented by the banks expeditiously.Similarly, special treatment has to be accorded to small-sector units in improving theiraccessibility to institutional finance with a view to enabling them to emerge as profit centres forthe banking system. Given its critical importance in the manufacturing and export activities inthe economy, it is unlikely that the banking system’s profitability and efficiency can growwithout exploiting the opportunity provided by the small-scale industrial sector. The KapurCommittee has recently made a comprehensive set of recommendations for improving the creditdelivery system for small-scale industries, which are being implemented in phases.The International ContextAn important effect of the Asian economic crisis, and of the recent developments in Japan, hasbeen that there is now a much greater international focus on the soundness of the domesticbanking system in all countries – developed and developing. Unlike previous financial crises, thepersistent crisis in the real economy in East Asia and also Japan is generally believed to havebeen accentuated by the weakness in the financial sector rather than the other way round. Thehealth of the banking sector and the prudential and regulatory framework are thus no longer amatter of domestic concern only. A country’s ability to access capital markets as well asinvestments abroad is likely to depend on whether the domestic financial system is perceived tobroadly conform to international prudential and supervisory norms. In fact, the world standardsthemselves are being put to a severe test by the changing nature and ramifications of bankingcrises in several parts of the world. What were earlier considered to be the ideal prudential normsfor preventing individual bank failures have been proved to be severely inadequate to deal withsystemic instability or prevent the contagion effects.In various international fora, an intensive effort is now underway to evaluate the existing normsand practices being followed by banking systems in different countries and to assess how farthese norms have helped or prevented instability in the banking system. India has been fullyparticipating in these discussions and is helping in the formulation of norms and guidelineswhich take into account the views of the developing countries, where market structures andgrowth objectives are different than in industrial countries. Issues currently under scrutinyinclude: the corporate governance system in banks, risk management, banking regulation andsupervision, transparency and accountability and public policies relating to moral hazards inbanking sector. The Basle Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision have underlined theneed to adhere to 25 basic principles for adopting an effective supervision system in theaftermath of the East Asian crisis. More detailed work is now in progress after the recentpublication of three reports by the Willard Group, constituted by the Bank for InternationalSettlements, on enhancing transparency and accountability, strengthening financial systems andmanaging international financial crises.The Willard Group reports have argued for improving the credibility and accountability of thebanking system through more transparent accounting practices and better disclosure norms. Theyhave drawn attention to the need to develop a stable and efficient financial system throughstrengthening the corporate governance system and risk and liquidity management among banksand putting in place a proper safety net arrangement for the banking system. They have also
– 7 –BIS Review   108/1998argued for a more organised approach in preventing international financial crises and a moreorderly system of creditor and debtor coordination and effective solvency laws.The recent international consensus on preserving the soundness of the banking system has veeredaround certain core themes. These are: effective risk management systems, adequate capitalprovision, sound practices of supervision and regulation, transparency of operation, conducivepublic policy intervention and maintenance of macroeconomic stability in the economy.An important issue which we, along with other countries, would need to address is how to ensurethat individual banks govern themselves according to the best practices in corporate governance.This, as mentioned before, involves according utmost importance to prudent business practices,such as developing an effective internal control system, monitoring and managing the wholerange of financial and commercial risks, and instituting a proper system of asset and liabilitymanagement in order to avoid term mismatches in portfolios. A proper cushion needs to be keptby way of capital reserves against market exposure and capital size should set a limit for the riskexposure of an individual financial institution. Apart from capital adequacy standards, the newinternational norms of banking regulation and supervision require a more proactive role for theregulator in enforcing an effective mechanism for evaluating, monitoring and managing risks inthe financial system. This in turn would need stricter accounting, valuation and reporting normson the part of banks.The Basle core principles have also identified a number of challenging areas for regulators andsupervisors, which must be satisfied to ensure orderly conduct of financial system and topromote its soundness and stability. Transparency in banking operation is also something whichhas to receive top priority given the current nature of capital markets. Transparency andaccountability demand realistic valuation of assets, public disclosure norms and prudentialreporting by banks to help depositors and investors form an informed opinion about the state ofthe financial system, thereby enabling them to react in an orderly fashion to asset price changes.Moreover, public intervention policies in the form of explicit or implicit guarantees may have tobe such that they do not lead to “moral hazard” in the form of undue risk-taking by banks andlaxity in observing market disciplines.India must remain in the forefront of the movement for ensuring soundness of the bankingsystem by adopting best practices and best international standards of performance and prudence.Actions have already been initiated in this direction. The challenge now is to accelerate thisprocess so that the banking and the financial system in our country can contribute to thesustained growth of the real economy with price stability.Role of Bank EconomistsBefore I conclude, let me say a word about the role of Bank economists in facilitating the reformprocess. This annual conference is a testimony to the economic talent that our banking systemhas developed over the years. Almost all our banks have economic research departments oreconomic cells which are staffed by highly qualified economists with long experience in bankingand the financial sector. The issue that I would like to pose before this conference is: are wemaking the best and most effective use of economists working in the banking sector to improvethe functioning of banks, and for that matter, the operational efficiency of the financial sector asa whole? In commercial organisations like banks, economics departments have the advantage ofnot being excessively burdened with day-to-day problems of running the banks or ensuring thesafety and profitability of individual transactions. They are in a position to take a strategic orlonger-term view of the comparative or competitive advantage of their individual banks as well
– 8 –BIS Review   108/1998as identify areas of portfolio weaknesses and the costs/benefits of various kinds of services andproducts offered by them. They also have the opportunity to study from their vantage point andfrom a practical angle the working of the financial system and various improvements needed tostrengthen the financial intermediation function.However, for bank economists to be able to perform these functions, it seems that somereorientation of the role that is assigned to them is necessary. There is also a need for some“attitudinal” change on the part of economists themselves. Those who work in the commercialbanking sector have to be prepared to accept operational responsibility, to work in the field, andto familiarise themselves fully with the commercial aspects of their bank’s work. Their work hasto be operationally relevant, and it must contribute to the financial soundness of bank’soperations. This is possible if bank economists also have branch-level experience and experienceof working in non-economic departments with line responsibility.At present, the role of economists in our banking sector seems to be too narrowly defined. Theyare viewed as keepers of data, particularly macroeconomic data, and undertake periodic reviewor analysis of macroeconomic trends in the economy. They are seldom involved in undertakingany operational work or in developing strategic policy choices or even in treasury or foreignexchange functions. All over the world, with deregulation and globalisation of the financialsector, the role of economists in the banking sector has been changing and becoming more andmore focussed on the analysis and valuation of the risk associated with various alternatives,particularly in emerging economies that are subject to greater volatility in the financial sector. InIndia, however, the role of economists has been somewhat slow in changing.It may perhaps be useful for this conference to initiate a process of discussion on the variousissues and to reassess the role that members of this distinguished body can play in pushingforward the process of reform in our country. The challenges ahead are gigantic, but they are alsoexciting. Given the determination, I have no doubt that India can have one of the most vibrantfinancial systems in the world.I would like to acknowledge with thanks the help of Shri M. S. Mohanty and Shri Partha Ray ofthe Reserve Bank of India in the preparation of this lecture.* * *
BIS Review   107/1998Mr Macfarlane’s statement to the House of Representatives Standing Committee onEconomics, Finance and Public AdministrationOpening statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr I.J. Macfarlane, to theHouse of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and PublicAdministration in Sydney on 15/12/98.Thank you, Mr Chairman,It is a pleasure to be here in front of your Committee again. As you mentioned, the need to makeadjustments to the composition of the Committee after the October Federal election means thatwe are meeting about five weeks later than our normal timetable. Given the uncertainty about thetiming of the hearing, and the importance we attach to regular communication with the publicabout the economy and the Bank’s activities, we decided to keep to the regular timetable forreleasing our Semi-Annual Statement on Monetary Policy, which came out in early November.So there is a substantial gap between the Statement and this hearing. On the whole, we feel thatour Statement still represents a reasonable summary of our views on events that had taken placeover the preceding six months. The world has not changed dramatically since the Statement wasissued. We have, however, made an adjustment to the stance of monetary policy, following theDecember Board meeting. This was as a result of our continual process of evaluating incominginformation, and our assessment of the outlook for the year ahead, and the various risks attachedto our forecasts. Our judgement was that, even though most of the data coming in weresuggesting growth was running ahead of earlier expectations, the likelihood was that growthwould decline in 1999. At the same time, the likelihood of overshooting the inflation target wasjudged to have declined. Hence, we viewed a small further easing of policy as a prudent measure.The good economic outcomes over the past year will, I suspect, be a recurring feature of ourdiscussion today. It might be helpful, therefore, if I start by reviewing the forecasts I presentedseven months ago and make some observations about how recent developments compare withthem.What I said last time could be summarised as:• GDP would grow by about 3 per cent during 1998;• the unemployment rate would remain relatively stable;• we had passed the trough of inflation and it would rise gradually, reaching about 2 per centby the end of the year; and• the current account deficit would average about 5½ per cent of GDP for 1998.I also said that I thought this combination of events would be a reasonably good result forAustralia in view of the difficult external situation we were facing, particularly among our Asianexport markets. In the event, the external situation did not get any better, but Australia’seconomic performance has exceeded our expectations, and, to the best of my knowledge, theexpectations of virtually all forecasters.It now looks as though GDP growth during 1998 will be about 4 per cent, rather than the 3 percent that seemed likely in May. A good deal of the additional growth is attributable to strongeroutcomes than we had expected in the June and September quarters. The remainder is a result ofupward revision to earlier data across most of the recent quarters. Consistent with this strongerthan expected growth, the rate of unemployment has continued to edge down, rather than stayingflat. Over the past three months it has averaged 7.9 per cent, compared with 8.1 per cent in thefirst quarter of 1998 and 8.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1997.
- 2 -BIS Review   107/1998On inflation, it seems clear that the trough has passed, and our best guess for the rise in the CPIover the four quarters to December 1998 is, in round figures, still about 2 per cent. But it is alsotrue to say that inflation shows signs of not increasing by as much as historical relationshipsmight have led us to expect, given the fall in the exchange rate. On the current account deficit, itnow looks as though it has averaged around 5 per cent of GDP in 1998 rather than the 5½ percent we expected at the last hearing.I would summarise the situation as being one where the forecast errors were within the normalranges that occur with forecasts of this type. The thing we can take some comfort from, however,is that no-one can accuse us of being Pollyannas because in each case the outcome was slightlybetter than the forecast. Growth has been stronger, the widening in the current account deficitsmaller and, at the margin, the rise in inflation slightly smaller than we had expected.I now propose to make a few general comments about how we are expecting future events tounfold. Over the course of the year before the Asian crisis commenced, that is 1996/97, theeconomy grew by 4½ per cent. In the first year affected by the Asian crisis - 1997/98 - it grew by4¼ per cent. Despite starting 1998/99 at a similar pace, we have to accept that we will not beable to continue at this rate. Growth through 1998/99 is more likely to be somewhere between2½ and 3 per cent. Implicit in this is that the coming quarterly growth rates will be noticeablylower than the ones we experienced over the past year.Some slowing seems to be inevitable, given the weaker outlook for the world economy. Since welast met in May, most forecasters have revised down expectations. The IMF, to take just oneexample, has revised down its forecast for world growth in 1998 from 3 per cent to 2 per cent,and for 1999 from 3¾ per cent to 2½ per cent. If these estimates are a reasonable guide, then theexternal environment will remain difficult and income from external sources constrained. Ofcourse, domestic demand has been, and remains, much stronger than external demand, and soAustralia’s expenditure has run ahead of national income over the past year. But that gap cannotbe expected to continue to grow at the same pace indefinitely, and so both domestic demand andGDP growth must be expected to come down over coming quarters. With slower growth in theoffing, we expect that the unemployment rate will flatten out. Of course, we said that last time;now we are suggesting it will occur at a slightly lower rate of unemployment than we formerlyexpected.We expect the four-quarters-ended increase in the CPI to be about 2½ per cent by the end of thefinancial year - that is, in the short term, we expect inflation performance to be consistent withour target. Of course, any forecast of inflation beyond that period is only as good as itsassumption about the future path of the exchange rate.Given the current tendency towards lower commodity prices, we are assuming some furtherwidening in the current account deficit to about 5½ per cent of GDP in 1998/99. With an annualfigure of this size, it would not be surprising to see a quarter or two of it running at over 6 percent of GDP. I made the same comment in March this year, and again in May at our previoushearing. I expected that it would have come to pass by now, but it has not. It would not surpriseme, however, if it does happen some time in the next year.This set of outcomes, or something like it, would represent a good performance for an economyin its eighth year of expansion facing a difficult, but not disastrous, external environment. Iexpect that it would be well received by the domestic and international investment community,though one can never take this for granted. And, of course, if the assumptions we are makingabout the world economy turn out to be too optimistic, all bets would be off.I now come to the second part of my testimony, in which I attempt to answer the question of whywe have done better than most other countries in Asia or the Pacific Rim. In doing so, I am
- 3 -BIS Review   107/1998conscious that the story is not yet over, so this is really an interim report. I think a number offactors have been involved and I will list them in no particular order. As we go through them, itwill become apparent that they are all intertwined.First, I think the Asian crisis hit at a time when the Australian economy was in good shape, partlyfor cyclical reasons. By mid-1997, the economy was growing strongly and inflation was lowerthan our target. Had we not received a contractionary impulse from the Asian crisis, we may havebeen facing the need to tighten policy because of a potential overheating. No-one will ever know,but it is a possibility. I am conscious that attributing our performance over the past 18 months toour good starting point is rather superficial because it does not explain why the starting point wasso good. But I will come back to that later.Second, I think we have benefited from the flexibility of our exporters, who have switched fromthe contracting Asian markets into the expanding North American and European ones, and into anumber of other markets we do not usually think of as being important to us. The nature of ourexports - with so much of them being commodities - has helped, but the efforts of our marketingcompanies and authorities should not be ignored. Even so, it has not proved possible to preventexports from falling, and over the year to the September quarter they fell by 2 per cent in volume.Third, Australia has benefited from a greatly improved perception of the soundness of itseconomic policies. The fact that the budget has moved back into surplus - where it should be inthe mature phase of an economic expansion - has been important. So has nearly a decade of lowinflation. Also important on this occasion has been the recognition that Australia scores well onsuch factors as its regulation of banks, other financial institutions and stock exchanges, and thatits underlying body of commercial law and accounting practice is at or close to world bestpractice.Not only have the international capital markets taken a better view of Australia, but we also seemto have more confidence in ourselves. Business and consumer confidence initially fell as theAsian events unfolded, but they did not fall excessively - for the most part they fell from wellabove average to about average. In the past three months, they have tended to rise moderatelyagain as figures about the economy have confirmed that it has performed better than mostexpected.The fourth explanation for why growth has held up is a catch-all one - the economy just seems tobe more flexible and adaptable than before. The only clear evidence of this is that productivity -whether labour productivity or total factor productivity - has increased faster in the 1990s than inearlier decades. For example, total factor productivity has increased at an average annual rate of1.7 per cent during the expansion of the 1990s, compared with 0.7 per cent in the 1980s and 1.2per cent in the 1970s. To me, this suggests that the painful adjustments that have been made overthe past decade or so are paying off. By this, I mean the changes that have been made to increasecompetition in previously sheltered industries. This, of course, includes greater exportorientation, but also greater competition in utilities and transport, which has reduced costs toother industries. It also includes the downsizing of the public sector, which has releasedresources. Finally, our labour relations practices and wage setting machinery now have a degreeof flexibility that has surprised the sceptics.I now come to a fifth factor, which most commentators view as being important - namely, thefact that in response to a contractionary external shock, the Australian dollar was allowed to floatdown. This is the way the textbooks say the situation should be handled, and is in sharp contrastto the severe domestic squeeze that can result in the cases of countries with fixed or quasi-fixedexchange rates.
- 4 -BIS Review   107/1998The domestic economy has benefited from the lower exchange rate because exporters’ incomeshave been held up and the incentive to export maintained (while at the same time assisting thoseindustries that are competing against imports). The domestic economy has also benefited becausewe have not had to put up interest rates in order to maintain our external parity (as in a fixedexchange rate) or to prop up a floating rate that threatened to fall so far that it would have hadundesirable inflationary consequences. Raising interest rates in response to an externalcontractionary shock is not something that you normally would want to do, although in extremecircumstances it may become necessary.I have heard people say that it is a good thing that, unlike some other countries, we were relaxedin the face of a falling exchange rate. I can assure you all that we were never relaxed. Havingfollowed the Australian dollar on virtually a daily basis for 15 years, I know that you can nevertake it for granted. While the floating rate is the best system we have had, like all asset pricesfreely determined in unconstrained markets the Australian dollar is prone to bouts of instabilityor overshooting. On three occasions - in January, June and August - a downward overshootingthreatened and we responded with foreign exchange intervention. On each occasion, stability wasre-established and, unlike the experience of the mid-1980s, we did not raise interest rates. Butthis does not mean that that option was not on the table. It was, and financial markets knew this;as a result, 90-day rates were well above cash rates in both June and August. Fortunately, thingsturned out well, and so the option did not have to be used.Thus, the exchange rate was centre stage. The general direction of its movement was performinga very useful function, yet the short-term dynamics were such that it often threatened to go toofar. It has been a delicate balancing act, but one with a favourable outcome. Over the past twoyears, the economy has been able to grow at over 4 per cent per annum without significantupward pressure on inflation (which has averaged 1.6 per cent over the same period). This isbetter than almost anyone expected.Another way of approaching the question is to ask why we at the Reserve Bank were able toaccept this continuation of high growth and depreciating exchange rate without having to tightenmonetary policy (in fact, being able to ease it slightly at the beginning of this month). The answeris that the combination has not to date seriously threatened our inflation target. Why has it turnedout this way?The answer, I think, is that we are beginning to receive the big dividend that low inflationprovides.The economy has gradually adjusted to nearly a decade of low inflation and, although theadjustment is still not complete, the benefits are becoming apparent. Inflationary expectations aremuch lower and more stable; wage contracts are now often two or three years in duration; loans,including housing mortgages, often have interest rates fixed for long periods; and businessesknow that they can no longer automatically pass on any cost increase secure in the knowledgethat it will get lost among the multitude of other price increases. This new less volatileenvironment allows the floating exchange rate to do its job of stabilising the domestic economyin the face of an external shock. It does so by reducing the tendency for the expansionary effectsof a falling exchange rate to be dissipated in the form of rising inflation. It also goes withoutsaying that the low inflation environment makes the task of monetary management a lot easier.I think we can take some satisfaction about how events have turned out over the past two years,but we should not become complacent. This particular episode, which started as a regional Asiancrisis, is far from over. We should not think that we can see the end of it just because it hasalready been running for 18 months. For a start, the United States has only recently started itsslowdown, and uncertainty about the US outlook seems greater at present than for some time. Inaddition, Japan remains gripped by powerful contractionary forces. That could put continued
- 5 -BIS Review   107/1998pressure on commodity prices. Much has been said recently about how Asia has passed the worstof its problems, and on many measures this is so. But the contractions have been very severe inmany cases, and no-one is expecting a quick or strong recovery.I do not wish to say any more at this stage. You will note that I have dealt exclusively with thedomestic economy, but I think that is appropriate since I have spoken so much recently in otherplaces about Asia, the world economy, and international financial markets. My colleagues and Iare, of course, happy to answer any questions you may have on the topics I have not covered, orfor that matter, on the ones I have.
BIS Review   107/1998Bank of Japan’s monthly report of recent economic and financial developments1Bank of Japan, Communication, 17/12/98.The Bank’s View2The economic deterioration in Japan has moderated somewhat, mainly as a result of the increasein public investment.With respect to final demand, business fixed investment has been declining significantly, andhousing investment continues to be sluggish. Private consumption, as a whole, shows someweakness. Meanwhile, net exports (exports minus imports) are basically on an upward trend, andpublic investment has started to increase considerably. Reflecting this development of finaldemand and some progress in inventory adjustments, especially in those of durable goods, thedecline in production has been slowing.Corporate profits continue to worsen, and employment and household income conditions havedeteriorated as the ratio of job offers to applications has recorded a historical low and winterbonuses are expected to decrease. Financial conditions are improving in some firms with theeffects of the policy measures taken by the government and the Bank. Nonetheless, firmsapparently cannot remove their anxiety about fund-raising conditions. Consequently, corporateand household sentiment remains cautious, and a recovery has not been observed in privatedemand.With the implementation of the government’s comprehensive economic stimulus package andrecently launched emergency economic measures, the economy is likely to be underpinnedmainly by public investment towards [= during?]the first half of fiscal 1999. Furthermore, theBank’s monetary and financial measures and the government’s measures to alleviate the creditcrunch are expected to take effect gradually. Nevertheless, an immediate self-sustained recoveryin private demand is hardly expected since corporate profits and household income aredeteriorating and the constraints from corporate finance are likely to persist for some time, owingto cautious lending attitudes of private banks. Moreover, attention should be paid to the effects ofthe appreciation of the yen since early autumn and the uncertainty in financial and economicdevelopments abroad. To lead Japan’s economy into a steady recovery, it is important to preparean environment where firms and households can regain confidence in Japan’s economic futureby, for instance, promptly restoring the stability of the financial system.With regard to prices, reflecting the expansion in the output gap, wholesale prices are on adowntrend, and corporate service prices are weakening. Consumer prices have increased slightlyabove the previous year’s level, owing to the rise in prices of perishables. Excluding this effect,however, consumer prices basically continue to be weak. As for the outlook, the economicdeterioration is likely to moderate, mainly as a result of the increase in public investment.Nonetheless, distinct narrowing in the output gap is hardly expected for the time being as privatedemand remains sluggish. Furthermore, the continued decline in wages and the appreciation ofthe yen since early autumn are likely to exert downward pressure on prices. Hence, the decline inprices, especially in wholesale prices, may somewhat accelerate in the future.                                                     1 This report was written based on data and information available when the Bank of Japan Monetary PolicyMeeting was held on December 15, 1998.2 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at theMonetary Policy Meeting held on December 15, as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
- 2 -BIS Review   107/1998Turning to the financial markets, Japanese banks are successfully raising foreign currency fundsnecessary to cover a huge shortage at the year-end. Reflecting this, the Japan premium and Euro-yen rates have peaked out, and the market’s anxiety, which had previously intensified, isgradually settling down. In the meantime, market interest rates on instruments maturing after thefiscal year-end (March 1999) are on an upward trend, suggesting continued concern of marketparticipants over liquidity risk.Yields on long-term government bonds have rebounded since late November. Although stockprices considerably recovered after hitting the recent bottom in October, they have recentlysoftened again. The yield spread (the government bond yield minus the expected earnings onstocks) remains extremely small or negative, reflecting market participants’ continued cautiousoutlook on the future of the economy.With regard to corporate finance, firms are further seeking to secure ample on-hand liquidity infear of more difficulties in raising funds, especially toward the end of this fiscal year when thelarge-scale redemption of corporate bonds is scheduled. Meanwhile, private banks are continuingtheir cautious lending stance.In these circumstances, various policy measures seem to have prevented serious credit shrinkage:the enhancement of [the ?]credit guarantee system[s ?] contributed to a recent increase in loansto small and medium-sized firms; and the Bank announced the introduction of new measures, inaddition to the continued ample supply of funds, to facilitate firms’ financing activities.Fundamentally, however, firms are still under severe fund-raising conditions. How corporatefinancing conditions towards the year-end and the fiscal year-end develop, and how suchdevelopments influence business activities and the whole economy, continues to warrant carefulmonitoring.
BIS Review   105/1998Mr Crockett considers what regulatory consequences should be drawn from the mostrecent crises in financial marketsRemarks by the General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements, Mr AndrewCrockett, to the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt/Main on 20/11/98.You have asked me to talk about the regulatory implications of recent crises. Before I do so, it isimportant that we understand the relative roles of regulators and bank management in avoidingexcesses and managing risks appropriately. As you all know, the regulatory and supervisoryfocus has shifted in recent years from quantitative controls and explicit rules to monitoring banksoundness through the quality of internal controls and the banks’ risk management culture. Withthis, greater emphasis has been placed on responsibility of bank management and stakeholders,through market discipline, to ensure prudent operations. I think we all agree that bank managersand market participants are better equipped and ‘incentivised’ for this task than supervisors. Andthere is no going back to a world of quantitative controls.At the same time, it is understandable that the ability of banks to repeatedly walk open-eyed intomassive overexposure should lead to questions being asked about the wisdom of this change inregulatory and supervisory focus. I will not address this question here. But if the banking andwider financial community is to resist pressures for re-regulation, it is necessary that it shouldpay much greater heed to the responsibilities for prudent operations that are now more explicitlytheirs and theirs alone.What regulatory consequences should be drawn from the most recent crisis in thefinancial markets?Coming to the question you asked, I think it is useful to distinguish between the crisis inemerging markets and the recent heightened volatility in financial markets in advancedeconomies. Even though there are undoubted linkages between them, the regulatory implicationsto be drawn are rather different.Concerning what has happened in emerging markets, there are at least three basic lessons fromrecent experience. The first is that structural weaknesses in the financial system can be verycostly. The second is that there are important feedbacks between macroeconomic instability andproblems in the financial sector. And the third is that financial instability can spread contagiouslyfrom country to country. The Asian crisis began when the overvalued Thai baht had to bedevalued. The currency crisis then interacted with financial system weaknesses to produce a deepeconomic recession. And the difficulties in Thailand were rapidly propagated across the regionand beyond.From this experience, the most important regulatory consequence to be drawn is the need forrapid strengthening of financial systems. Among the most important shortcomings of financialsystems in Asia were: severe currency and maturity mismatches; excessive concentration oflending; insider and politically directed lending; inadequate accounting and loan classificationprocedures; weak capitalisation; and unsatisfactory supervision.Correcting these fundamental problems will be neither quick nor easy. A strong financial systemrequires the development of deep-rooted ‘credit culture’, in which lending instruments areproperly related to the risks they are used to finance. Lenders need to become better able toassess borrowers on an arm’s-length basis, understanding their businesses and their various risks,matching cash flow to debt servicing obligations and appreciating the appropriate role of
– 2 –BIS Review   105/1998collateral. And supervisors need a strengthened capacity to identify and correct sources ofvulnerability.Fortunately, there now exists a standard by which banking systems and supervisory arrangementscan be judged. This is the ‘Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision’ issued last year bythe Basle Committee on Banking Supervision. Virtually all countries have now accepted theseprinciples and pledged to adopt them. This is not the place to go into the Core Principles indetail. But let me just note four aspects of them that are of key importance. First, they cover allphases in the life of a bank, from initial licensing, through ongoing supervision, to eventualclosure procedures. Second, they apply to both domestic and internationally active banks. Third,the rules are applicable to banks operating in emerging markets as well as to those of industrialcountries. And fourth, they have been developed by an internationally representative group ofsupervisors. The Core Principles therefore have the comprehensiveness and the legitimacy to actas the basis for a thorough-going strengthening of banking systems worldwide.The difficult part, of course, will be implementation. A major effort will be required involvingbanks, national supervisory authorities and international organisations and expert groups. TheBIS and the Basle Committee will play their part both in implementation and in providingtraining and technical assistance to help countries bring their systems up to scratch. Althoughprimary responsibility for overseeing implementation of the Principles falls to the IMF, the BasleCommittee will be drawing up a compliance methodology for use by the IMF in its surveillanceactivities. And as regards training, we have recently announced the establishment of the BISFinancial Stability Institute, which will be headed by Mr John Heimann, who is well known inthe banking community and Mr Erik Musch, former Secretary General of the Basle Committee. Ihope this Institute will make an important contribution to disseminating best supervisory practiceand supporting the effort to strengthen banking systems.I now turn to the lessons to be learned in the industrial countries from the rather extraordinaryepisode of market turbulence that began in mid-August. The Russian debt moratorium of17 August sparked a widespread flight to quality, which was followed by a generalised drying-upof liquidity in many markets. This prompted fears that lenders would ‘disengage’, leading to acredit crunch.Fortunately, markets have more recently gained a certain measure of stability. But we shouldcertainly try to understand what went wrong and how we can avoid such episodes in the future.One problem was that lenders had unrealistic expectations about the extent to which their loansto emerging markets would be protected. It is therefore important that cross-border lending beassessed on a stand-alone basis, and that supervisors make sure that the pricing and managementof such exposures are not undertaken on a false basis. In other words, a tightening-up of creditrisk procedures is called for.Another source of difficulty was that the models used to assess market risk were based toosimplistically on established statistical correlations. They did not take adequately into accountother types of risk, such as liquidity, volatility and event risk. Widely used value-at-risk modelscaused financial intermediaries to liquidate assets when volatility in asset prices increased. Thisselling, in turn, caused volatility to increase further and resulted in additional selling. The factthat most market participants used the same basic model led to common reactions, amplifyingherd-like behaviour. Consideration therefore has to be given to ensuring that common behaviourby market participants does not exacerbate market instability.
– 3 –BIS Review   105/1998It has to be recognised that all model-based approaches to controlling market risk embodyassumptions, explicit or implicit, about market liquidity. The drying-up of liquidity in periods ofmarket turbulence, as market participants seek to disengage from exposure, invalidates a basicpremise on which risk management is built. It is therefore all the more important that VaR-basedapproaches to risk containment are supplemented by stress-testing.How do you think national governments have fared in implementing BIS rules?The scorecard in this connection is not very good. If one looks back at the history of the past 10or 15 years, financial crises have succeeded themselves with depressing regularity. In theemerging markets, there are [15] cases in which the direct resolution costs of banking sectorcrises have exceeded 10% of GDP. And among the industrial countries, systemic strains havebeen just as evident. The Savings and Loan debacle in the United States; the Scandinavianbanking crisis; financial fragility in Japan; and individual cases of failure or severe difficulty,such as Barings and Crédit Lyonnais: all these episodes show there is much to be done in theadvanced countries also.Let me make a few simple points:First, capital ratios do not mean much without prudent and consistent accounting practices. Timeafter time, banks have failed even though they had shortly before declared strong capital ratios.And whole banking systems have been declared sound at a certain moment, only to have severeweaknesses revealed shortly afterwards. The reason, of course, is accounting practices that allowbad loans to be called good. It is of the utmost importance that asset impairment is quicklyrecognised.Second, the Basle rules are not just a matter of capital requirements. Banking is about themanagement of risk. Banks need systems and controls at all levels that foster the accuratemeasurement and monitoring of risk, and permit risk to be accurately priced and rigorouslycontrolled. This goes well beyond the maintenance of certain balance-sheet ratios which, we allknow, are at best an imperfect measure of the riskiness of a portfolio.Third, good supervision is no substitute for a developed ‘credit culture’. The best supervisors inthe world cannot enforce a culture when the basic soil is not receptive. As I noted earlier, theonus here lies squarely with banks’ management and their boards of directors.Fourth, to keep a banking system healthy, it is necessary to have clear procedures for dealingwith institutions that get into difficulties. Too often, troubled banks are allowed to remain inoperation as losses mount and their capital erodes. Forbearance is used to put off difficultdecisions in the hope that things will somehow get better on their own. Industrial countries havebeen just as guilty as developing ones in this regard. Early intervention procedures therefore needto be spelled out so that institutions in difficulties are dealt with before they infect the rest of thesystem.Let me conclude: the international financial system has had a close shave. With luck, and skilfulmanagement from now on, there is a good chance that things will now get better. But there areimportant lessons to be learned if the system is to be made more resilient on a durable basis.
BIS Review  104/1998Mr Thiessen reviews the Canadian economy and monetary policy in unsettled timesSpeech by the Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mr Gordon Thiessen, to the Greater VictoriaChamber of Commerce in Victoria, British Columbia on 7/12/98.When the Asian crisis erupted in the summer of 1997, few observers anticipated thatinternational financial markets would still be under its influence more than a year later. Mostexpected that the crisis would be contained and resolved relatively quickly. But then who couldhave foreseen a year ago that the Japanese situation would deteriorate as much as it has; or thatRussia would declare a debt moratorium, jolting markets everywhere, and increasing financialpressure on parts of Latin America?All these unexpected developments have slowed world economic activity. Canada’s very openeconomy has not been immune to these forces. The sharp decline over the past year in thedemand for, and the prices of, the key primary commodities we produce has taken its toll. BritishColumbia has been particularly hard hit because it produces and exports a larger share of suchgoods than other Canadian provinces. These developments have been reflected in the value ofour currency, which has declined substantially against the U.S. dollar.All this seems to have provided fertile ground for some pessimistic scenarios. Indeed, somecommentaries have raised the spectre of global recession and deflation, implying a consequentdownturn for Canada. Are such concerns justified, or are they an overreaction to events?I believe that the pessimistic commentary has been overdone. Given the global uncertainty andfinancial market volatility of the past year, Canada has been coping relatively well. It is normalfor people to feel queasy and to fear the worst when caught in the kind of stormy seas we haveencountered in the past year. But the important thing to remember is that these days Canada isbetter positioned to ride out the storm. And we will feel much better if we can keep our eyes onthe horizon – for there are signs that the sky is clearing.What I would like to do this morning is to put the recent changes in the global economic andfinancial environment in perspective. Next, I will look at the implications for the world economyand for Canada in particular. I will finish with a discussion of the Bank of Canada’s response tothe international turbulence.Global financial problems in perspectiveI will spare you the detailed chronology of the past year’s events. You are probably already toofamiliar with it. Rather, I intend to focus on what has made this latest episode of global financialturbulence more troublesome than others in recent history. This should help us see recentdevelopments in the Canadian economy and in monetary policy in a clearer light. It should alsoprovide some insight on what needs fixing in the international financial system and whatmistakes to avoid in the future.So, why has the 1997–98 financial turmoil been more widespread and long-lasting? The way Isee it, there were two main reasons. First, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that too manyincautious international portfolio investments were made in the wake of the growingglobalization of capital markets. Second, it has taken Japan much longer than expected to dealwith its serious economic and financial problems, problems that long predated the Asian crisis.
– 2 –BIS Review  104/1998Let me explain why I think these factors have had such an impact this time around.First, the matter of incautious international investment practices – what was the problem here?With the opening up of financial markets and with the decline in interest rates in industrialcountries, a growing number of investors were attracted to higher returns abroad. “Abroad” oftenmeant the so-called emerging market countries, particularly those in Asia. With their rapid ratesof economic growth year after year, these countries seemed to have great investment potential.But foreign investments, especially in emerging markets, are far more complex than domesticones. And assessing these investments can be very tricky. For one thing, investors are dealingwith companies operating far away, in a very different economic and political environment. Foranother, financial regulatory and supervisory practices in some of these countries are less well-developed and transparent. In addition, investors may have felt rather well “protected” from risks– for a couple of reasons. First, past assistance packages by the International Monetary Fund(IMF) and other international agencies may have led them to believe that the internationalcommunity would always come to the rescue if worst came to worst. Second, many investmentadvisers evidently were not terribly fussed about the exchange rate risk because most Asiancurrencies were fixed to the U.S. dollar. It is all too easy to forget that having a fixed exchangerate is not in and of itself a guarantee that a currency will not decline in value – which in fact iswhat many of these currencies have done.In the end, huge amounts were placed in emerging markets in the 1990s by mutual funds,pension funds, financial institutions, and their clients, evidently without full appreciation of therisks involved. Moreover, many banks in these emerging markets were also taking large risks.They were borrowing short term from foreign banks, in U.S. dollars, at relatively low rates, andlending out long term, in domestic currency, at high rates – often to domestic real estatedevelopers.When pegged exchange rate systems in Asia broke down under pressure, because they were fixedat levels that had become incompatible with changing economic fundamentals, both local andforeign investors rushed for the exits. And as exchange rates tumbled and interest rates soared, ahost of other long-standing problems, especially related to weak banking systems, wereunearthed. Investors that got burned in Southeast Asia tried to reduce their exposure to allemerging markets.Initially, emerging countries outside Asia managed to withstand the pressure – until the outbreakof the Russian crisis. That Russia was running into serious fiscal difficulties had been wellknown for some time. But its decision to declare a unilateral moratorium on its debt last Augustshook markets everywhere, and even the most sophisticated investors became very agitated. Theresulting global reassessment of risk, and the greater weight placed by investors on security, ledto a movement of funds out of emerging market bonds and corporate bonds into more secureU.S. Treasury bonds. Interest rates rose in the markets for riskier securities, and liquiditytightened – hence, the concerns through the autumn about a global “credit crunch” and recession.The second factor that has exacerbated the global financial turbulence this time is the surprisingseverity and intractability of Japan’s long-standing economic and financial problems. Remember,Japan is the second largest economy in the world. Most of us expected that, once the Japaneserecognized the seriousness of their problems, they would move quickly and decisively to fix
– 3 –BIS Review  104/1998them. A stronger Japanese economy would have made a significant difference to the outlook forthe world economy. And it would have helped to speed up the turnaround in Southeast Asia –much as a strong U.S. economy facilitated the adjustment in Mexico, following the 1994–95crisis in that country. The deterioration of the Japanese economic and political climate in thespring and early summer of 1998 was an important factor in the intensified market pressures thatprecipitated the Russian crisis last August.What to do about the global turmoil?So what are we to conclude from all this?The last thing we should do is retreat behind national borders and start placing restrictions on thefree flow of international capital. That would be very unfortunate. Even though capital flows maysometimes prove difficult to handle, especially for small countries, there is much to be gainedfrom access to world savings – provided those savings are used prudently and productively. Whatwe must do is find ways to minimize the costs, without giving up the benefits.The Bank of Canada believes that a flexible exchange rate is very useful in this context. Undersuch a system, borrowers and lenders are constantly aware of the exchange rate risk, and the kindof pressures that built up behind the fixed exchange rates in Asia last year are much less likely toemerge.I should also note that a good deal of work has already been done by the international communityto strengthen the global financial system and reduce the risk that these recent problems willrecur. In their October communiqué, the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of theG-7 countries outlined a series of initiatives. These are designed to: increase the transparency ofthe international financial system; promote international standards of good practice; strengthenincentives to meet such standards; provide assistance to developing countries to reform andreinforce their economic and financial systems; and put in place a process for crisis managementthat envisages the involvement of private lenders at an early stage.But all this, you may say, is to improve the international navigation and radar systems in thefuture. Meanwhile, we are still in difficult seas, wondering what’s up ahead and worrying whatmay hit us next.How worried should we be about the world economy and the outlook for Canada?Keeping our eyes on the horizonI can tell you that there are positive factors in the picture as we look ahead. Let me elaborate,starting with the global environment. Perhaps the most reassuring element is that the economicexpansion in the main industrialized countries, except Japan, is still well sustained. Rememberthat these countries account for more than half of world output. The U.S. economy, in particular,remains strong, growing much faster than anticipated in the third quarter. So even if it slows, thateconomy – Canada’s main export market – will still be operating at relatively high levels. Themajor European economies, as a group, are also expanding moderately. And a number ofindustrial countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and many countries incontinental Europe, have lowered their interest rates to help sustain domestic spending.
– 4 –BIS Review  104/1998Japan is still the main uncertainty at this point. But the recent legislation to rehabilitate itsbanking sector, which is at the core of Japan’s problems, and other measures proposed tostimulate the economy are grounds for cautious optimism. If these are implemented in a sensible,systematic fashion, the world economic outlook will brighten considerably.Another factor that added to the pessimism through the early autumn was the concern about a“credit crunch” in the United States that could spread elsewhere, including here in Canada.However, the recent interest rate reductions by the U.S. Federal Reserve have eliminated theworst scenarios envisaged at the time. Some of the rise in interest rates on “less-than-prime”debt, which occurred during the autumn because of concerns in global markets about risk andliquidity, has reversed. And the availability of credit is slowly improving.This is not to say that we are completely out of trouble yet; or that there is no longer considerableuncertainty out there. But, for the reasons I have discussed, I certainly do not believe that thescenarios of worldwide recession and deflation are very likely as we look ahead.As for Canada, it is true that we have been hit hard by the more than 15% decline in commodityprices over the past year. It is also true that those lower prices, together with the slowing worldeconomy, are affecting our export industries – a fact that this audience probably knows only toowell. It is also evident that the nervousness and volatility in financial markets have made someCanadian consumers and businesses less confident, affecting domestic spending plans. As aresult, the Canadian economy has expanded much more moderately this year than in 1997, whenit grew by more than 4% (fourth quarter over fourth quarter).As we look ahead to 1999, the considerable degree of global uncertainty that is still lingeringmakes all economic forecasts more tentative than usual. Because financial stability is soimportant for household and business confidence, the expansion of our economy will beinfluenced by how quickly global financial markets stabilize. Still, with accommodativemonetary conditions and recent solid employment gains, spending by Canadian households andbusinesses, while slowing, should continue to contribute to an expanding economy. And, basedon the Bank’s current assessment of the world economic outlook and Canada’s improvedcompetitiveness, our exports should continue to grow.The monetary policy response to the international turbulenceLet me now turn to monetary policy. You will not be surprised to hear that throughout thisperiod, the conduct of policy has been influenced by these exceptional internationaldevelopments.The sharp drop in commodity prices has inevitably meant lower incomes and wealth forCanadians. And we have had no choice but to adjust. Because we are on a floating exchange rate,much of the adjustment has taken place through a decline in the external value of the Canadiandollar. Had we been on a fixed exchange rate, we would still have had to adjust. But theadjustment would have been more difficult, since it would have had to come mainly throughdownward pressure on output, employment, and wages.The depreciation of the Canadian dollar since the fall of 1997, while distressing, had for the mostpart been relatively orderly before the Russian crisis in August. At that point, pressure on ourcurrency intensified because of a frantic worldwide capital flight to more secure U.S. assets and
– 5 –BIS Review  104/1998an exaggerated sense internationally of the importance of commodities for Canada. The move outof “commodity currencies” was intensified by fears that Russia would start dumpingcommodities on world markets.As the decline in the Canadian dollar accelerated through August, medium- and long-terminterest rates, including mortgage rates, began to rise sharply at a time when comparable U.S.rates were falling. We took this as a signal of potential loss of confidence in Canadian dollarinvestments that could prove very costly for the economy. To head that off, we raised the BankRate by one percentage point in late August.Our action, and the subsequent return of some stability to markets in the United States andelsewhere, helped to restore confidence in Canadian dollar assets. And medium- and longer-terminterest rates came back down.When the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered its target interest rate three times between Septemberand November, because of concerns about a possible “credit crunch” and an expected slowing intheir economy, we followed with similar reductions in our Bank Rate. These cuts wereappropriate, given the importance of the U.S. economy to Canada, our continued low inflationrate, and the improving international financial climate.I know that the depreciation of the Canadian dollar has been a source of concern and dismay tomany people. One concern is that a weak currency blunts the incentives to improve productivityin the export sector. I must say that this is more likely to be a problem if the weakness of thecurrency reflects an inflationary environment. But such is not the case in Canada today. Inflationis low and stable, and the Bank of Canada is formally committed to keeping it that way.At the same time, I most certainly agree that we should always be looking at our economicpolicies from the perspective of their likely impact on the growth of productivity. After all,productivity is what matters for a sound economic performance and for rising standards of livingover time. Currently, the low Canadian dollar provides an opportunity for Canadian businesses toexpand their presence in foreign markets. But they must also continue to work hard to increaseproductivity and to ensure that they stay competitive as our currency regains strength.What about monetary policy – what is it doing to further productivity? The focus of Canadianmonetary policy is on domestic price stability. This means keeping inflation low and stable overtime – currently within a target range of 1% to 3%. The Bank aims to avoid both inflation anddeflation. And if we are successful, we will have provided Canadians with greater predictability,fewer cyclical fluctuations, and sustained low interest rates. I believe that a monetary policy thatseeks to provide this kind of environment is the most conducive to productivity growth overtime.Concluding remarksTo conclude, let me just say that Canada cannot escape the uncertainties that have clouded theglobal economic outlook. The pace of economic expansion in Canada is not as robust as it was ayear ago. But our economy should continue to grow over the next year, supported byaccommodative monetary conditions and sustained U.S. demand.
– 6 –BIS Review  104/1998Although it may be difficult to see while we are still battling the waves of global instability, thefact is that we are coping better this time around because our economy is in sounder shape. Andthis gives me reason to remain rather positive about our economic future.* * *
BIS Review   103/1998Mr King explores lessons from the UK labour marketText of the Employment Policy Institute’s Fourth Annual Lecture delivered by the DeputyGovernor of the Bank of England, Mr Mervyn King, held in London on 1/12/98.It is both an honour and a challenge to deliver the fourth EPI lecture. It is an honour to follow insuch distinguished footsteps, and it is a challenge to tackle the subject of the link betweenmonetary policy and the labour market. Few subjects are as emotive. Wages, jobs andunemployment feature as frequently in the popular press as they do in academic articles. TheBank of England must learn from one in order to convey our message in the other. And we arefortunate in that labour economics is a field in which British economists have been – andcontinue to be – at the forefront of research. That I can say objectively because I am not myself alabour economist. So tonight I shall be exploring lessons from the labour market for theMonetary Policy Committee. The Employment Policy Institute has played an important role inbringing together those undertaking research on labour markets and those involved with policydecisions. In particular, its Employment Audit provides a valuable commentary on currentdevelopments.The labour market is unlike any other market. Indeed, for many people the very language ofeconomists – equilibrium unemployment, market-clearing wages – seems incompatible with thehuman dimension of unemployment and deprivation. Are the 16 million unemployed people inthe European Union merely an equilibrium, on the one hand, and a statistic, on the other? But formost people the labour market is the market where – for better or worse, in sickness or in health– they sell their time and their skills at a market price. That price determines, in large part, theiropportunities and economic welfare. Wage rates have a much greater significance in influencingthe distribution of real incomes than do the prices of almost anything else. As a result, the labourmarket cannot be divorced from broader social and political considerations.If their terminology and language are sometimes insensitive, what do economists have to offer byway of ideas about unemployment? The prize for the most important idea and most insensitiveterminology surely goes to Milton Friedman for the concept of the natural rate of unemployment.I shall discuss shortly the significance of this idea for monetary policy. But for a more elegantadvocacy of a similar position it is necessary to delve further back in history.This month sees the 75th anniversary of the publication of what Milton Friedman described asJohn Maynard Keynes’ best book: A Tract on Monetary Reform. It is undoubtedly one of themost persuasive polemics ever written on the subject of monetary policy. To coincide withpublication in December 1923, Keynes gave a lecture to the National Liberal Club in which hetalked about “the triple evils of modern society”. From the notes he used for that lecture – printedin his Collected Writings – we can see that Keynes regarded the evils as, first, the “vastenrichment of individuals out of proportion to any services rendered”; second, the“disappointment of expectations and difficulty of laying plans ahead”; and, third,“unemployment”. Fat cats, short-termism and the jobless society: Keynes was ahead of his time.All these, Keynes argued, were “mainly due to instability of the standard of value”. Over the past20 years, Britain faced the same three problems. The income distribution widened and therewards for those with special talents, and even for some with no apparent talent, increasedsignificantly more than earnings for the unskilled. Both inflation and expectations of inflationwere high and unstable, making it more difficult for firms to plan for the long term. And theunemployment rate rose to double-digit levels.
– 2 –BIS Review   103/1998Keynes argued that the way to prevent those triple evils from undermining society was pricestability. Central bankers should be as vigilant in countering deflation as in preventing inflation.The link between unemployment and inflation has been a central theme in macroeconomics forthe remainder of the century.Following the publication of A Tract on Monetary Reform, Keynes received a letter from noneother than the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. “Dear Keynes,” he wrote, “I write toyou in this familiar fashion because we are both old Kings’ Scholars, though not of the sameelection.” So far, so good. Regrettably, however, the then Deputy Governor’s only comment onthe book appeared to be that he was grateful to Keynes for writing in a style which an educatedman could read with pleasure, and for having the book printed in a particularly attractive style.This Deputy Governor has learned a great deal from Keynes’ book. I refer to it in almost everylecture I give. In this lecture I shall discuss three aspects of the significance of the labour marketfor monetary policy. The first of these concerns the link between unemployment and inflation inthe transmission mechanism of monetary policy.The second issue is how the Monetary Policy Committee uses the available empiricalinformation about the UK labour market when deciding on interest rates. How do unemploymentfigures and earnings data enter the MPC’s decisions?The third issue is the way in which unemployment enters the objectives of monetary policy. Withan explicit inflation target, is it true that the MPC neither cares about unemployment nor takes itinto consideration when setting interest rates?The labour market and the monetary transmission mechanismThe theory of unemployment has spawned more concepts, and – without doubt – more acronyms,than almost any other field of economics (apart, perhaps, from measures of price inflation). Ishall return to the language of unemployment later. But I want first to discuss the two conceptswhich are at the heart of any discussion of monetary policy and the labour market. They are thenatural rate of unemployment and the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation,usually known as the NAIRU.The concept of the natural rate of unemployment introduced by Milton Friedman and EdmundPhelps 30 years ago is the level of unemployment that – as Friedman famously described –would be “ground out by the Walrasian system of general equilibrium equations” reflecting thestructural characteristics of the labour and product markets. Friedman was the first to recognisethat this natural rate of unemployment was neither constant over time nor immune to policyinfluences.The natural rate hypothesis implies a vertical long-run Phillips curve. In other words, if themonetary authorities attempted to “peg” the level of unemployment below the natural rate, thenthis in time would cause the inflation rate to rise indefinitely. The work of Friedman and Phelpssoon proved highly relevant. The futility of using monetary policy to choose between differentcombinations of unemployment and inflation became only too apparent in the 1970s. Monetaryshocks can – and in the early 1980s and 1990s did – cause unemployment to deviate from itsnatural rate, but only for a period. As inflation expectations catch up with the consequences ofthe monetary shock, unemployment returns to the natural rate.
– 3 –BIS Review   103/1998But the responses of unemployment and inflation expectations to monetary shocks are far fromimmediate. Indeed, Friedman speculated that the full adjustment to an unexpected change ininflation might take up to “a couple of decades”. Such long lags in the dynamics of the labourmarket mean that there is unlikely to be a simple relationship between deviations ofunemployment from its natural rate and changes in the inflation rate. Chart 1 shows that it didindeed take almost 20 years to bring inflation and inflation expectations (implied by financialmarket returns on indexed and conventional gilts) down from double-digit levels to the currenttarget of 22%, accompanied by a large rise and subsequent fall in unemployment.The idea of the NAIRU can be thought of as a conceptual response to inertia in the system whichmeans that the response of the economy to shocks will be protracted. In 1975 Franco Modiglianiand Lucas Papademos introduced the concept of the non-inflation rate of unemployment – theNIRU – defined as “a rate such that, as long as unemployment is above it, inflation can beexpected to decline”. Note in passing that more appropriate terminology would be the non-increasing inflation rate of unemployment (NIIRU). Modigliani and Papademos recognised thatthe NIRU would be affected by macroeconomic shocks. They argued that there was evidence tosuggest that “over the last two decades the NIRU [in the US] was held down by a favourabletrend in the terms of trade between the private nonfarm sectors on the one hand and importedgoods and farm products on the other. A termination or reversal of this trend would tend to raisethe NIRU, at least temporarily.”It is ironic that two of the most prominent economists of countries synonymous with art andbeauty – Italy and Greece – (one a future Nobel prize winner and the other a future central bankgovernor) should have given birth to an unattractive acronym that has spawned so many evenmore unappealing cousins. The first, and most feted, offspring – the NAIRU – was introduced byJames Tobin five years later. NIRU, NIIRU, NAIRU – tongue twisters for the Financial TimesChristmas quiz, or measures of the Inflationary Trigger Point? Take your choice. For the sake ofsimplicity I shall adopt the conventional term, NAIRU, to represent the entire family.So what is the relationship between the natural rate of unemployment and the NAIRU? Thenatural rate of unemployment and the NAIRU are quite different concepts. The former describesa real equilibrium determined by the structural characteristics of the labour and product markets– the grinding out of Friedman’s Walrasian general equilibrium system (modified, if necessary,by non-Walrasian features of labour markets such as imperfect competition, search behaviourand efficiency wages). It exists independently of the inflation rate. In contrast, the latter, as wellas being affected by these structural characteristics, is also affected by the gradual adjustment ofthe economy to past economic shocks that determine the path of inflation. Because it is definedas the unemployment rate at which there is no immediate pressure for a change in the inflationrate, it is a reduced form – not a structural – variable.This difference is reflected in the methods used to generate empirical estimates of the twoconcepts. The natural rate of unemployment can be estimated only by reference to a structuralmodel of the labour market which has explicit microeconomic underpinnings and which can beused to identify the characteristics determining the natural rate. Empirical estimates of the naturalrate would typically be related to inflation only in the long run when the effects of shocksaverage out. In contrast, the NAIRU is estimated using a system of time-series equations relatinginflation to past and present economic shocks. The sole criterion for judging the success ofestimates of the NAIRU is their short-term correlation with inflation. Indeed, the NAIRU asdefined here – and in recent work by Estrella and Mishkin (1998) – is the level of unemploymentsuch that the difference between it and the current rate of unemployment is all that is necessary todescribe short-run inflationary pressure.
– 4 –BIS Review   103/1998Although the NAIRU will tend towards the natural rate of unemployment in the long run, there isno reason to expect there to be a close relationship between the two measures in the short run.The natural rate is likely to move only relatively slowly over time in response to changes in itsstructural determinants. In contrast, the NAIRU will vary both with changes in the natural rateand in response to macroeconomic shocks. So those who argue that estimates of the NAIRU aretoo time-varying to be plausible are, I think, in danger of missing the point.The NAIRU can be used as an ex-post device to describe the level of unemployment at whichinflation started (or would have started) to increase. But the usefulness of these estimates as anex-ante predictor of future inflationary pressure depends critically upon the economicenvironment. In particular, for estimates of the NAIRU to be a good predictor of future inflation,the natural rate would need to be relatively stable, and the magnitude of likely shocks would needto be small. This perhaps goes some way to explaining why estimates of the NAIRU in the recentpast have appeared to contain more ex-ante information about future inflation in the US than theyhave in Europe.More fundamentally, the distinction between the natural rate and the NAIRU illustrates thedifficulty of using those concepts for the month-to-month implementation of monetary policy.The natural rate, although clearly relevant to the dynamics of inflation, is not sufficient to explainchanges in the inflation rate. The NAIRU, which is defined to be a measure related to short-runinflationary pressures, requires knowledge of the reduced form of the transmission mechanismand the history of shocks to the economy. But that knowledge is required also for a forecast forinflation, and so the NAIRU itself provides no additional information over that contained in theforecast. Indeed, estimates of the NAIRU could be described as a by-product of the process offorecasting inflation.As an example, consider the impact of the appreciation of sterling from mid-1996 until late 1997.Retail price inflation can be thought of as a weighted average of domestic and imported inflation.The substantial real appreciation of sterling since mid-1996 has for a while reduced the importedcomponent of UK inflation and so, in turn, retail price inflation, below the level that it wouldotherwise have reached. In essence the NAIRU fell relative to the natural rate. That restrainingeffect on inflation will gradually wear off and begin to be reversed if sterling continues to fall.The issue of whether the domestic inflation component would fall to a level consistent with theinflation target by the time this temporarily depressing effect wore off was central to themonetary policy debate during the summer.The example of sterling’s appreciation shows how a macroeconomic shock, entirely independentof the labour market, can affect the relationship between the rate of unemployment and the rateof inflation. The rise in sterling is likely to have reduced the NAIRU via two separate channels.First, in the short run, the relationship between domestically generated inflation – of which wageinflation is a substantial element – and retail price inflation shifts because of lower importedinflation. Second, the temporary improvement in the terms of trade that followed the rise insterling in 1996 reduced the wedge between the real consumption wage – which is of relevanceto employees and which reflects a mix of both domestic and imported inflation components –and the real product wage – which is of relevance to employers and which reflects the prices onlyof domestically produced goods. That reduction in the wedge is likely to have reduced thepressure on nominal wage growth for any given level of unemployment.So it is quite possible to believe that the NAIRU has fallen even if the natural rate has not. Butthis is likely to be temporary. As the impact of sterling’s appreciation on wages and prices wearsoff, the NAIRU will, other things being equal, rise towards the natural rate. But other more
– 5 –BIS Review   103/1998lasting changes may reduce the natural rate (and hence the NAIRU). For example, a range ofgovernment policies, including changes to the Jobseekers Allowance, the New Deal and the newWorking Families Tax Credit, have increased incentives to work. The National Minimum Wageworks in the opposite direction. Assessing the impact of these structural factors on the naturalrate is no easier than calculating the effect of macroeconomic shocks on the NAIRU. But it isuseful to distinguish the two concepts, not least because they can move quite differently in theshort run.Enough of this theory, some of which may appear largely semantic. None of it is, of course,either new or original. But understanding the language of unemployment matters. RichardRogerson, in the Journal of Economic Perspectives last year, posed the question: “Have thelanguage and concepts developed by economists in their study of unemployment served their roleof fostering clear communication of findings and allowing issues to be sharply defined?”Professor Rogerson’s conclusion, you will perhaps not be surprised to hear, was a resounding no.Neither the natural rate nor the NAIRU are terms well chosen to win friends and influencepeople. After all, there is nothing natural about the natural rate.Whatever we call them, it is crucial to recognise that there is considerable uncertainty about thelocation of both the natural rate of unemployment and the NAIRU. Even in the United States,where there appears to be no obvious trend in the natural rate, estimates of the 95% confidenceinterval for the NAIRU are typically from 5% to 7.5%. In the UK where both structural reformsand macroeconomic shocks have had a larger impact than in the US, the range of uncertainty iseven greater. Perhaps the most honest answer to the question of what is the natural rate was thatgiven by Milton Friedman to the Wall Street Journal in January 1995: “I don’t know what thenatural rate is, neither do you, and neither does anyone else.”The labour market and monetary policy in practice?How do these concepts affect monetary policy in practice? And what role does analysis of thelabour market play in the Monetary Policy Committee’s decisions on interest rates?Using the language of unemployment developed earlier, the MPC has to assess whether thecurrent level of unemployment differs significantly from the NAIRU and, as importantly,whether it is likely to remain so in the future. It may do that explicitly by taking a view on thelevel of the NAIRU, or it may do it implicitly by producing a forecast for inflation. In practice,we focus directly on an inflation forecast.But the need for policymakers to focus on the level of unemployment and the level of outputeach time they assess the stance of monetary policy is unavoidable. Alan Greenspan has to do it.MPC members have to do it. Knowing that the growth rate of GDP is (or is likely to be) above orbelow its trend rate of increase is of little value unless one also knows where the level of outputis relative to potential. This is a basic, but fundamental, point. If, for whatever reason, the levelof unemployment is below the natural rate, a rise in unemployment is unavoidable. That may beundesirable. But any attempt to avoid it will simply result in a longer, or more pronounced,correction at a future date. In order to hit the inflation target the MPC needs to minimisedeviations in the level of output from potential, not in the growth rate of output from its trend.The need to focus attention on the level of economic activity is of course well understood by theacademic community. It is now standard practice in the literature on monetary policy to assumethat the authorities seek to minimise a social loss function, defined in terms of the deviation ofthe level of output or unemployment from their equilibrium values, and in terms of the deviation
– 6 –BIS Review   103/1998of inflation from its desired value. But if this is so obvious, why, in discussions of the economicconjuncture and economic policy, is so much attention placed on growth rates rather than onlevels? Why are commentators and pundits so concerned with whether economic growth is goingto be above or below its trend rate, or even whether it is likely to be above or below zero? That isnot what matters for economic policy nor, more importantly, for social welfare.An excessive focus on growth rates of output and employment, rather than on their levels, mayreflect a rather natural, but dangerous, optimism about the degree of spare capacity in theeconomy. After all, is not the belief that we could always achieve lower unemployment withoutan increase in inflation the mark of a kinder, gentler, altogether more civilised approach toeconomic policy? Or is it simply wishful thinking? As Greg Mankiw put it:“Wishful thinking is one reason that monetary policy has historically been excessivelyinflationary… To my mind, wishful thinking is as worrisome a problem for monetary policy astime inconsistency.”Genuine concern for the unemployed means a recognition that sustainable reductions inunemployment require a combination of monetary stability on the demand side andmicroeconomic reforms such as the New Deal on the supply side. As Alan Blinder has remindedus, we need soft hearts and hard heads, not the other way round.Despite suggestions to the contrary, the MPC does have soft hearts and hard heads, and does notbase its assessment of the labour market – never mind its decisions on interest rates – solely onestimates of the growth of average earnings. An assessment of the overall tightness of the labourmarket requires all the available data – both quantity and prices – to be analysed. The wealth anddiversity of published labour statistics means it is rare for them all to point in the same direction.The MPC’s analysis of the labour market is like the construction of a jigsaw puzzle. The piecesof data are assessed alongside each other in order to build up as clear a picture as possible. Nosingle piece of data is interpreted in isolation. And no single piece of data is, in itself, decisive.The growth of wages and salaries is an important indicator of domestically generated inflation.But this does not imply that there is some magical threshold defining “acceptable” and“unacceptable” rates of earnings growth. In the short run, the link between earnings growth andinflation is complicated by a whole host of factors, including exchange rate movements, cyclicalvariations in productivity and profit margins, irregular bonus payments, and one-off adjustmentsto tax rates and other “wedge” effects. It is true that given the UK’s historical levels of annualproductivity growth of around 2% and the inflation target of 22%, it would be a cause forconcern to the MPC if average earnings increased by much more – or much less – than 4.5% ayear over a prolonged period without there being a corresponding change in trend productivitygrowth. That is not because the Committee has a view about the appropriate level of pay awards.It is not our job to second-guess what businesses should or should not pay their employees. Noris it because we think earnings growth causes inflation – inflation is a monetary phenomenon.Rather it is because sustained earnings growth much above or below these rates may indicate thatthe level of utilisation in the labour market has reached a level inconsistent with the inflationtarget.The June meeting of the MPC drew particular attention to the rise in headline earnings growth asmeasured by the Average Earnings Index. But that should be viewed against a background ofincreasing concern about the tightness of the labour market. In its meeting in April, the MonetaryPolicy Committee noted that “labour market data on quantities were signalling a tighter positionthan the price [earnings] data”. At that time, the Labour Force Survey and claimant count
– 7 –BIS Review   103/1998measures of unemployment had both fallen below their previous troughs recorded in the springof 1990, and were still declining. This position was evident across all categories ofunemployment, as can be seen from chart 2 which shows the various measures of joblessnessreported in the EPI’s Employment Audit. In addition, employment and total hours worked wererising quite strongly; recruitment intentions were at their highest level for nine years, with thelevel of vacancies at Jobcentres, and the average duration of these vacancies, both well abovetheir 1988/89 peaks; and survey measures of recruitment difficulties were also at high levels.The underlying rise of the Average Earnings Index had increased to 42% by the beginning of1997, but was little changed by the end of the year. If I had been asked to deliver the thirdAnnual EPI lecture, rather than the fourth, the main question you might have expected me tograpple with would have been why earnings growth had not at that point risen by more, given the1.0 million fall in unemployment and the 1.4 million rise in LFS employment since the end of1992. As a Committee, we discussed at some length during the spring of this year why thechanges in the quantity measures had not fed through to higher earnings growth. We discussedwhether the natural rate of unemployment (and the NAIRU) might have declined due to anincrease in trend productivity or improvement in the functioning of the labour market. We alsoconsidered whether there had been independent influences on the NAIRU stemming from falls ininflation expectations or the effects of sterling’s appreciation.It is against this background that the MPC’s decision to raise rates in June should be seen. Theincrease in headline earnings growth to 4.9% in February, from an upwardly revised 4.6% theprevious month, appeared consistent with other labour market indicators. But we were fullyaware of the evidence suggesting that the rise in earnings growth had been, and for a couple ofmonths would continue to be, affected by unusually large bonus payments. If this was true,earnings growth might well have fallen back once the bonus effect had dropped out. Given theuncertainties in this area, the Committee concluded that it should not place too much weight onthe latest numbers. Instead, it stepped back and examined the underlying trend in the labourmarket over the previous two years. We noted that private sector earnings growth had been risingthroughout this period and that reported wage settlements displayed a similar profile. Given thislonger-term perspective, the Monetary Policy Committee concluded that capacity constraints inthe labour market were threatening the attainment of the Government’s inflation target.Of course, since then, the earnings data have been successively revised, rebased and suspended –a piece of the jigsaw has temporarily gone missing. As you can see from chart 3, the profile ofthe old series showed a steady rise in earnings growth from around 33% in mid-1995 to nearly52% or so by the spring of this year. In sharp contrast, the revised and rebased data (before theywere suspended) followed roughly the shape of a slightly squashed capital N. From a trough of3% at the end of 1995, earnings growth was estimated to have risen to a peak of over 53% inFebruary and March 1997 before falling back below 4% in early 1998 and then bouncing backabove 5% again by May.How would the MPC’s analysis of the labour market have changed if the revised (but nowsuspended) data had been available six months earlier? That question is not easy to answer. Thequantity data would still have suggested that the labour market was both tightening and, byhistorical standards, tight. The MPC would therefore have had the unenviable task of trying tounderstand why the steady tightening in the quantity measures had produced a zigzag path formeasured earnings growth. We would also have had to try to understand why the zigzag profileof the new Average Earnings Index was not visible in other measures – shown in chart 4 – ofnominal earnings growth, such as wage settlements and private surveys. As I have said
– 8 –BIS Review   103/1998elsewhere, trying to reconcile the new earnings series with other labour market data is far fromeasy.The Chancellor wrote to Giles Radice, the Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, on 23October announcing that he had asked Sir Andrew Turnbull and myself to conduct a review ofthe revisions to the average earnings figures. The review, which is considering bothmethodological and managerial issues, is being carried out by Martin Weale of the NationalInstitute, supported by Peter Sedgwick of the Treasury. Martin and Peter have made an enormouseffort over the last month or so to finish the review as quickly as possible. However, exactlywhen the Report will be finished and what it will conclude are, I am afraid, still not known. As aresult, the ONS has yet to decide when to resume publication of the average earnings series. All Ican say today is watch this space.The labour market and the objectives of monetary policyIn the final part of my talk, I want to turn to the question of what this analysis of the labourmarket implies for monetary policy. One of the – perhaps the – most important economic andsocial problems facing Europe is the high level of unemployment: 16 million unemployed peoplethroughout the European Union, a rate of over 10%, with young people under 25 accounting foralmost a quarter of this total. That represents a major failure of economic policy. But is it afailure of monetary policy? To go one step further, should the objectives of monetary policy –whether enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty or in the Chancellor’s remit for the Monetary PolicyCommittee – be altered to include an explicit reference to unemployment? Many think so. Forexample, the new German Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine, has said that his aim was a“European monetary policy that supported growth and employment as well as price stability”.Nearer to home, the TUC has called for the MPC to be given a wider remit to includeemployment as well as inflation. And several newspaper editorials have argued for a broaderremit for the MPC.The fact that the proposition appeared in a newspaper does not of course mean that it isnecessarily compelling. As my newsagent told me the other day: “Don’t believe everything youread in the newspapers – they are all in the hands of the media.”The argument for including employment explicitly in the formal remit of the Monetary PolicyCommittee is often bolstered by reference to the objectives of the Federal Reserve in the UnitedStates, which is charged by statute with promoting “the goals of maximum employment, stableprices, and moderate long-term interest rates”. At first sight, this appears to contrast with theremit of the MPC which is: “(a) to maintain price stability and (b) subject to that to support theeconomic policy of Her Majesty’s Government, including its objectives for growth andemployment”. But what matters most is the intellectual framework underlying the behaviour ofthe central bank. The Federal Reserve’s remit does not make clear if the FOMC is supposed totry to exploit some long-term trade-off between employment and inflation. But the practice isclear. Under Alan Greenspan’s leadership, the FOMC has firmly rejected the notion that byaccepting a somewhat higher rate of inflation it is possible to achieve a permanently higher levelof employment.It is conventional to express the implications of a vertical long-term Phillips curve in terms of thestatement that unemployment can be held below the natural rate only by accepting acceleratinginflation – or, to be more precise, an inflation rate higher than anticipated by wage bargainers.Equally, however, the statement can be turned the other way round. If the central bank issuccessful in pursuing, over a number of years, a constant rate of inflation, then unemployment
– 9 –BIS Review   103/1998cannot remain above the natural rate indefinitely. Not only can central banks not bringunemployment down below the natural rate for long, neither can they be accused of keepingunemployment persistently above the natural rate. Monetary policy cannot influence levels ofemployment in the long run. There should be no surprise about this. A central bank can use itschosen instrument – interest rates – to hit a nominal target – such as an inflation target, or atarget for the exchange rate or even the growth of nominal GDP – but it cannot use a nominalinstrument to target some desired level of a real variable, such as the growth rate of output or thelevel of unemployment.None of the above means that monetary policy has no impact on unemployment. To the contrary,monetary policy does affect the movements of employment and unemployment over the businesscycle. And the remit of the MPC makes clear how we should take this consideration into account– as I explained a year ago in a lecture at the LSE. By aiming consistently and symmetrically tohit the inflation target, the MPC should ensure that inflation is, on average over a number ofyears, close to the target of 22%. Shocks of various kinds will mean that inflation will oftendeviate from the target and the MPC is required to take action to bring inflation back to thetarget. But it will do so gradually, if to do otherwise would have damaging consequences foremployment or output. By looking ahead and aiming to bring inflation back on track over ahorizon of two years or so, the MPC should be able to avoid undesirable volatility ofemployment and output. That is part of our remit.ConclusionsLet me briefly draw two conclusions from my analysis tonight. First, the concept of a natural rateof unemployment, and the existence of a vertical long-run Phillips curve, are crucial to theframework of monetary policy. They help us focus on levels of output and employment ratherthan simply their growth rates. They also mean that there may be times when, although a rise inunemployment is undesirable, it is unavoidable. But the natural rate is of much less help inoperational decisions on interest rates made month by month. This is because the natural rate isdetermined by microeconomic structural factors that are not easy to observe, and which are likelyto change over time, and may not bear any close relationship to inflationary pressures in the shortrun.More easily observable in terms of its relationship to inflation and unemployment is the conceptof the NAIRU. This differs from the natural rate when macroeconomic shocks affect the rate ofinflation corresponding to any degree of excess demand in the labour market. Since the NAIRUrepresents the current reduced-form relationship between inflation and unemployment, it ispossible to calculate the prospects for inflation without any need to refer to such a variable as theNAIRU. It is a convenient shorthand concept for purposes of exposition, but not a necessary toolfor operational decisions on interest rates.Second, the contribution of monetary policy to employment objectives is to promote economicstability in its broadest sense. I referred at the outset to Keynes’ view that the “triple evils” of anunequal distribution of income, instability of expectations and unemployment were all related toan unstable and unpredictable monetary standard. The solution, Keynes suggested, was to setmonetary policy to hit a target for prices, or a low and stable inflation rate. He argued 75 yearsago that monetary policy should be devoted to regulating the supply of money so that “the indexnumber of prices will never move far from a fixed point”. Keynes went on to say that:“The Bank of England since the war has always done exactly the opposite of what the latestscience recommends. I conclude from this that their opposition comes, not from mere obstinacy
– 10 –BIS Review   103/1998or conservatism, but from their not yet understanding the point. I am, therefore, optimistic aboutthe future.”It took the Bank of England almost 70 years to get to that point and introduce an inflation target.The objective of stability is best achieved by an inflation target because it stresses both whatmonetary policy cannot do – reduce unemployment in the long run – and what it can do – react toshocks in order to minimise undesirable volatility in output and employment. To that end, thepursuit of an explicit and symmetric inflation target is the relevant objective of monetary policy.With an inflation target and, more recently, the new Monetary Policy Committee, bothunemployment and inflation have fallen significantly. I hope and believe that, with these newinstitutional arrangements, although we shall certainly make mistakes in the setting of monetarypolicy, we should be able to avoid the instabilities of the past 30 years which did so much todamage Britain’s economic standing.We should never forget that – as Milton Friedman pointed out in his 1968 Presidential Address(quoting in turn John Stuart Mill) – monetary policy becomes important for society only when itgoes badly wrong. That is the basis for my proposition that a successful monetary policy shouldbe boring, and that successful central bankers should be seen as neither heroes nor villains, butsimply as competent referees, allowing the game to flow and staying out of the limelight. In theend, a central bank is doing its job when no one notices that it is there. So if, over the past 40minutes, I have been sufficiently boring then I promise to carry on in that vein. If not, then Ipromise to mend my ways.ReferencesBlinder, A.S., (1987) “Hard Heads, Soft Hearts: Tough-Minded Economics for a Just Society”,published by Addison-Wesley Publishing CompanyEstrella & Mishkin (1998) “Rethinking the Role of NAIRU in Monetary Policy: Implications ofModel Formulation and Uncertainty”, paper prepared for The National Bureau of EconomicResearch conference on Monetary Policy Rules, Islamorada, Florida, January 15–17, 1998Friedman, M., (1968) “The Role of Monetary Policy” American Economic Review, March: 1–17Keynes, J.

BIS Review   102/1998Mr Heikensten reviews the financial crisis and looks at monetary policyAddress by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr Lars Heikensten, to the SwedishShareholders’ Association in Stockholm on 30/11/98.Many thanks for the invitation to participate this evening. For more than a year now, discussionsabout global economic developments have in many respects been occupied with the financialcrisis—the crisis that was first Asian, then also Russian and finally seen as global. Economicanalyses are full of words like uncertainty and unpredictability; no one can yet tell what theeffects will finally be.The crisis has clearly demonstrated how mobile capital has become, as well as the close globalinterrelatedness of national economies. This has intensified the debate about the global financialsystem, its advantages and drawbacks. How can crises of this type be prevented from happeningagain? And how can the present crisis be overcome? An answer to the latter question is of majorimportance for future economic development. Things that happen in Bangkok have turned out tobe important for shareholders in Stockholm.One night in BangkokFor a number of years the rest of the world regarded the Asian economies as something of amiracle. Their growth was astonishing and the high saving and investment ratios gave theimpression that this would continue. Orderly public finances were accompanied by exchangerates that seemed to be completely firm. The prospect of undiminished growth attracted aninflow of capital to the Asian Tigers from investors in the West who were looking for a highreturn and a greater diversification of risk.There is no single factor which explains why the tiger economies changed, in the eyes ofinvestors, into paper tigers. There are even those who argue that the crisis arose not so muchfrom altered economic conditions as from general nervousness among investors. The answer isprobably a combination of the two, with a number of economic and political factors thattriggered a chain reaction from country to country. One serious problem in these countries wasthat their banking systems had not been fully prepared for the incoming avalanche ofinternational capital. In much the same way as in the 1980s in Sweden, the good supply of capitalhad pushed up prices for equity and real estate, thereby creating a bubble. In some countries,moreover, a current account deficit and the fixed exchange rate had become untenable. Anothercommon denominator was the very short-term profile of external borrowing.Uncertainty about the future path of these economies gradually grew. Investors becameincreasingly cautious. The devaluation of the Thai currency in July 1997 caused a sharp reaction.Capital flows to the region were stopped. Currencies depreciated sharply and interest rates rose.The currencies of Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea followed in the wake of the Thai baht.The gold turned to sandAt first the crisis was seen as a regional problem, with no substantial effects in other parts of theglobal economy. Investors focused instead on other regions and last spring there was a quieter,though still nervous, period. This proved, however, to be the calm before the storm. On 17August the Russian government announced a freezing of rouble debt and a devaluation of therouble.
– 2 –BIS Review   102/1998This markedly altered the mood among international investors. The combination of anunexpectedly large devaluation and a unilateral suspension of rouble debt payments heightenedinvestors’ aversion to risks. If this could happen in Russia, perhaps it could happen in othercountries, too. The imposition of capital controls in Malaysia accentuated the concern.The crisis therefore spread to other emerging markets, not least in Latin America. Stock marketsfell around the world. The possibility that industrialised countries might be hit by other effectsthan those related to trade gave the crisis a new dimension. The problems in the US hedge fundLong Term Capital Management (LTCM, perhaps something of a misnomer for a company benton reaping quick profits on invested capital) aroused fears that large losses might make banksexcessively cautious and thereby restrict access to borrowed capital. Many forecasters now beganto revise their assessments of global economic development.Watch out!The most obvious cause of lower global growth is decreased net exports to the crisis-burdenedcountries. Countries that trade with the debt-burdened countries experience a weakening ofgrowth as falling exports are accompanied by a gradual increase in their imports. At first thedirect trade effects are not expected to be all that large; but as other regions are affected by thecrisis, they may be more pronounced.New risks then arise that are more difficult to assess because they relate to sentiment andconfidence. One factor of importance for the rate of global economic growth is consumer andbusiness confidence. There are some statistical signs that confidence has fallen. Future prospectshave become less bright above all in the United States and the United Kingdom, but also in manyof the prospective euro countries. Swedish households are more doubtful about the generaleconomic future but still believe their personal economic situation will improve. Companies arealso somewhat more pessimistic.Another potential threat to economic growth was detected in the summer and early autumn. Theproblems in LTCM led to talk of a credit crunch. Briefly, this is a situation in which banks, aftersome bad experiences and loan losses, do all they can to reduce risk exposure and slim balancesheets; as a result, the banks cannot be induced to finance even the most stunning commercialideas. Without access to investment capital, economic activity declines.Certain signs of an approaching credit crunch could be discerned in financial markets, above allin the United States. They first took the form of an aversion to supplying credit to all but thesoundest borrowers. Later there was a reluctance to provide long-term loans to anyone,regardless of their credit rating.The weakening of growth and inflation prospects in the light of the financial unrest has promptedcentral banks to lower interest rates this autumn. The interest rate cuts have contributed to thesomewhat calmer situation recently in financial markets. Interest rate differentials betweenindustrialised countries and emerging market economies have tended to narrow from a high leveland so have spreads in the western markets between borrowers with different credit ratings. InSweden, the spread between treasury and housing bonds has fallen from 0.9 percentage points inmid October to 0.5 percentage points at present.Stock markets have also recovered from the sharp fall during the autumn. In the United States,equity prices have now rebounded to the levels of before the period of nervousness. Currentequity prices are notably bullish and mirror expectations of very good growth and high business
– 3 –BIS Review   102/1998profits. The recovery on the Stockholm Stock Exchange has not been quite as strong; after a fallof around 40 per cent from July to October, the index is now at the same level as at the end ofAugust.Although there now seems to be somewhat less risk of the global crisis becoming moreprofound, it will probably still lead to a weaker international economic development that willalso affect the situation in Sweden, not least during 1999. During the autumn the Riksbank’sappraisal of both growth and inflation in Sweden has been revised downwards. Inflationarypressure in our economy is very low and expectations seem to have been adjusted to it remaininglow. A more detailed picture of inflation prospects is contained in our Inflation Report, which isto be published this Thursday.The name of the gameDevelopments this autumn and the way in which the Asian crisis has spread across the globehave broken some market perceptions. Loan payments were suddenly suspended unilaterally bysuch a large country as Russia. And the problems in a single US hedge fund turned out to be solarge as to render the situation in financial markets uncertain and require rescue operations by themajor commercial banks. The world was not quite what it had been. A number of observers,including the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, even considered that what had happened waswithout precedent in the global economy.The crisis has enlivened the discussion about global financial systems. In the short run, it is theacute crisis that must be resolved. The interest rate cuts, not least in the United States, haveplayed an important part here. In the longer term, conditions must be created whereby the globalfinancial system functions sensibly. Matters that are being discussed in the longer perspectiveinclude the role of the IMF and how to help the problem countries. There is also the question ofensuring that countries and private agents, instead of distorting reality, provide an accuratepicture of their situation. Other matters are the construction of systems so that early warnings aresounded if, for example, the situation in the bank sector is becoming untenable, and how toprevent investors from building up such large risks. The discussion also concerns the freemovement of capital and how its negative effects can be restricted.Permit me to dwell fairly briefly on these large and important matters. This is a discussion towhich we at the Riksbank will no doubt be returning. Solutions to some of the questions arerelatively easy to find; others will require a great deal of lengthy discussion over a considerableperiod and may even then not be entirely satisfactory.The IMF to the rescueThe immediate resolution of the crises in Asian countries and, most recently, in Brazil has beenspearheaded by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Thailand, Indonesia and South Koreawere offered financial support by the Fund, subject to certain conditions. These loan termsconcerned both the formulation of economic policy and some structural measures. Interest rateswere to be increased, accompanied by fiscal restrictions to restore a balance or a surplus togovernment budgets. Consolidation of the banking system and stricter supervision were alsorequired. Reforms in other fields were demanded to make the economy function more efficiently.The economic recession in the problem countries turned out to be considerably deeper thanexpected. The IMF has been criticised for requiring tough restrictive measures. With growth inthe Japanese economy at a standstill, moreover, these countries did not have the benefit of an
– 4 –BIS Review   102/1998external stimulus. International investors and banks were not prepared to renew loans tocountries which had obtained support from the Fund. The currency depreciation continued. Someadjustments were made to the IMF programmes.Broadly speaking, the Fund’s management of the crisis has been criticised from two standpoints.One is that the Fund’s terms are too harsh and tend to contribute to domestic poverty without anybenefits in real economic or financial terms. The other standpoint is that the IMF hands outmoney far too readily to all comers without demanding enough in return.The support currently provided by the Fund is intended to enable the crisis-burdened countries tospread the necessary adjustments over a longer period than would otherwise have been possible.There is then less risk of output falling sharply. It can also help to forestall financial marketunrest. The latter can benefit other countries that might otherwise be hit, more or lessundeservedly, by large movements in exchange rates and interest rates. Moreover, IMF supportcan induce other lenders to provide financial assistance. The programmes drawn up by the Fundhave led industrialised countries to come forward and contribute financial support.In situations like this the IMF can also serve as a much-needed whipping-boy. Governments incrisis-burdened countries can point to the Fund as the task-master behind various measures andthereby achieve reforms that are essential but troublesome.All this presupposes that the Fund’s demands on the crisis-burdened countries are properlybalanced. The programmes must make financial markets confident that the countries willultimately be able to repay the loans. Some critics consider that the IMF, instead of adapting tothe changeover from previously regulated markets to globally interrelated markets, is simplyfollowing the beaten track without sufficient heed to the new environment.Earlier crises had more to do with purely macroeconomic factors which the IMF could remedy byfollowing a relatively simple diagnostic procedure — focusing on the balance of payments —and prescribing the medicine that suited the country in question. Today’s crises call for measuresover a wider field. Ordering an interest rate increase, for instance, as a cure for exchange rateinstability is not as self-evident a solution when higher interest rates are liable to worsen a weakbanking system’s difficulties or undermine government finances.At the same time it is important that the IMF concentrates on the crisis-burdened countries’fundamental macroeconomic and financial problems. An ambition to tackle a wider range ofissues may run into trouble. No matter how well-grounded the structural changes may be, theFund can, for example, be accused of exerting an undue influence on policy in the problemcountries or of serving the trade policy interests of other countries.There is broad agreement among the industrialised countries that it is the IMF which should actin situations like the one in Asia. The IMF is also our own organisation; Sweden is representedon the Board and cannot dissociate itself from what the Fund is doing. An active discussion isnow in progress to learn from recent developments. So far, however, no general consensus hasbeen reached except as regards increased transparency in many respects.Openness and oversightOne recipe for a sounder financial system that has been discussed and agreed on is bettertransparency both among private players and on the part of the IMF and various public agents.Some of the problems could be avoided if a fair picture of the situation were provided, for
– 5 –BIS Review   102/1998instance by ensuring that statistics are correct and generally available. In some cases, investors’assessments concerning Southeast Asia had a misleading foundation, for example as regards thesituation among banks and large companies as well as the size of foreign reserves.Advocating more transparency comes naturally to a Swede. We put the case frequently, at homeas well as in international fora. The IMF, for example, ought to be able to present its countryassessments more openly. We have already taken steps in this direction that we hope will exertnatural pressure on other countries to do likewise. At the same time, this is a good illustration ofthe IMF as the sum of its members. Even in the group of Nordic countries there are members thathave pulled in a different direction.The IMF should also go further in explaining its actions so that these are better understood. Justas we consider that independent central banks have to be open in order to gain support for whatthey are doing, so must the IMF generate greater popular and political support for its work.Another requirement for a sounder financial system is better oversight and supervision of thefinancial system in each country. Over the years there have been numerous instances of wherethe combination of free capital movements and inadequate supervision can take us if things gowrong. As Swedes, the bank crisis in the early 1990s gave us a ringside view of theconsequences. One good result of that crisis — a late compensation, if you will — is that todaythe Swedish banks are less exposed.A decade ago, international agreement was reached on the amount of capital banks are requiredto hold so that they are in a position to weather troublesome times. Last year the Basle capitaladequacy requirements were augmented with 25 core principles for determining whether or not acountry’s banking system is sound and its bank supervision effective. A first step towards betterbank supervision is to ensure that more countries are in fact complying with the rules andprinciples that have already been established. It has been proposed that a country’s access tocapital from the IMF be linked to the degree to which it observes these principles. The competentnational institutions for banking supervision should also be scrutinised and adapted, so that theypossess the resources for coping with the new financial environment.Another step towards better supervision involves an ongoing development of the existing rulesand regulations so that they are appropriate for today’s reality. One matter that is being discussedis a review of the capital adequacy standards. The banks’ lending operations, for instance toLTCM, were astonishing. In this context I can mention the discussions that are in progress abouthighly indebted players and how they can be included in supervision to prevent them takingunduly large risks.Sound risk diversificationOne of the issues — probably one of the knottiest — that are being discussed is how problemcountries can obtain financial support without this giving rise to expectations that a country withfinancial problems will always be rescued by some international institution.If private investors get the idea that any profits will accrue to them and can rest assured thatsomeone else will intervene and absorb any losses, they will be all the more prone to take riskypositions. Investments that would normally not be attractive will find takers because there iseverything to gain and nothing to lose. This can result in the form of moral hazard that involvesunduly risky behaviour. Signs of such behaviour have been found. Spreads between governmentbonds issued by industrialised countries and emerging market countries such as Russia suggest
– 6 –BIS Review   102/1998that investors expected to be bailed out and were therefore not demanding full compensation forrisks.Moral hazard could conceivably also result in a particular country or countries taking excessiverisks, though this is presumably much less likely. The political cost to a country of becomingbankrupt is exceedingly high, as is almost too clear from developments in South Korea, Thailandand Indonesia.So what can be done to counter moral hazard in the financial system? One, seemingly self-evident, remedy is to get the private players to carry a larger share of the burden when problemsarise. That in turn could make them act more prudently. This is being discussed. The crux,however, is that the investors and banks concerned are caught in what is known as prisoner’sdilemma. Smart investors count on being able to take a little extra risk and then be the first toexit when things go wrong. The dilemma they face, however, is that when everyone makes asimultaneous dash for the exit, most of them are trapped because the market then ceases to beliquid.One possibility is a system, involving a third party, whereby individual investors are made torealise that less headlong behaviour in the throes of a crisis could be more advantageous for themas well as for everyone else. The remaining cake can then be divided more fairly among all thoseinvolved. One procedure for this, adopted in connection with the Asian crisis, could be tomonitor bank lending globally. This was tried out in the case of South Korea; the banks werepersuaded to renew credits pending a more orderly solution. Another matter that is beingdiscussed is how bonds could be constructed with a clause that makes it possible to implementthe type of procedure that applies to default.The markets and capital movementsThe Asian crisis has clearly demonstrated the mobility of international capital. Technical andfinancial developments have meant that positions can be taken and closed much more quicklythan before.Some of the rapid shifts in many countries’ exchange rates and interest rates do not seem to havebeen motivated by changes in the macro economy or other fundamental factors. This raisesdifficult questions. Capital movements of this kind may ultimately elicit political reactions thatthreaten the existence of free capital markets.The complexity of the issue is illustrated by consequences of the new Basle rules. These rulesprescribe capital cover for the mark-to-market value of many assets. This is basically a goodthing in that it reduces the risk of failures. But together with the models on which riskassessments are based (using historical data), rules of this type probably also tend to accentuateflock behaviour among international investors. Continuous marking to market does give a fairpicture of the situation in each company but probably also leads to an increased need for quickfinancial rearrangements. A price change in one country immediately alters the spectrum of risksand this triggers a wave of buying and selling.Perhaps we must acknowledge at this stage that we have been a little too optimistic about theworkings of the international financial system and self-regulating mechanisms, in much the sameway as we were about Sweden in the late 1980s.
– 7 –BIS Review   102/1998Seen in this light, the demands for extensive capital controls that are now being aired in thedebate are hardly surprising. This would not be practicable, however, particularly not in thelonger run.There are examples — Chile in recent years is one — where measures for controlling short-termcapital seem to have worked well. It should be underscored, however, that these measures havebeen one item in a very soundly implemented economic policy that also includes tight budgets,institutional and growth-enhancing reforms, and lower inflation.Chile’s experience is therefore by no means directly applicable to other countries. Anotherimportant point is that Chile’s aim has been to become less dependent on short-term foreigncapital. The measures have not restricted outflows — which is liable to be counterproductive —but made inflows less attractive.Just where the discussion of capital movements will take us remains to be seen. Here, too, thereis reason to underscore the importance of transparency and rules that work properly. Anothermatter that has been raised in the debate is the importance of carrying out deregulations andstructural changes both in an orderly manner and in the right sequence.Measures of this type will probably not suffice to solve all the problems connected with freecapital movements. A continued discussion is therefore needed without an unduly strongideological gloss. However, such a discussion is unlikely to result in any dramatic changes in theinternational financial system.The winner takes it all?The world economy has recently been going through a deep crisis — an Asian crisis that hasacquired a global dimension. The ultimate effects of the crisis are difficult to predict but itscourse to date should be a lesson to many.— Households have been reminded that saving in equity is not without risks. How long thisreminder will last is another matter — US stock markets have already shot up againtowards new all-time highs.— Large investors with a high level of debt have also been cautioned. An exceptionally highreturn presupposes exceptionally high risks and thereby entails large losses if things gowrong.— The banks have learned similar lessons, particularly those that used highly leveragedfunds as a way of accommodating high risks. But even those who function as overseers offinancial systems — governments and central banks — have learned something from thelatest crisis. Work has been stepped up to create a lastingly robust framework for thesatisfactory functioning of the global financial system.Today I have concentrated on the financial system in the longer perspective. But in the midst ofall the uncertainty about the present situation, there is one thing about which we can be quitesure: this is not the last financial crisis. Now that the situation in financial markets has becomesomewhat more stable, we should not suppose that everything is all right again. The financialmarket players — savers, investors, fund managers, supervisors and overseers — must not lowertheir guard. Not again.
BIS Review   101/1998Mr Macfarlane talks about exchange rate regimes and Australia’s experience with themSpeech by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr I.J. Macfarlane, to the Asia PacificForex Congress in Sydney on 27/11/98.IntroductionFirst, I would like to add to what Mr Hawke has already said by extending my personal welcometo Australia for the 1998 Asia Pacific Forex Congress.I am glad to see that the Asian Pacific Congress is continuing to thrive. A regional associationsuch as this is important because, according to the latest BIS world market survey, the Asianregion accounts for about one quarter of global foreign exchange turnover. I am hopeful thereforethat, as the practitioners in this region, your discussions here over the next couple of days willmake a contribution to resolving some of the issues that recent events have exposed.When this Congress last met in Hong Kong a year ago, the so-called “Asian crisis” had alreadystarted, but few could have anticipated the toll it would eventually take, not only on financialmarkets but also on these countries’ economies more generally. None of us thought that most ofthe economies of Asia would be in recession by now, or that the effects would have spread tonon-Asian emerging markets. I am sure the Congress this year will provide plenty of topics forlively discussion because foreign exchange markets are so central to all that has happened. If wecast our minds back to July last year, we will recall that initially the events in Thailand andelsewhere were seen as a “currency crisis” before they became a general economic crisis.I am pleased that the Australian Government has been able to play a constructive role in helpingto understand the difficulties in the region, and then to assist in efforts to overcome them.Australia was, in fact, the only country apart from Japan which contributed to all three financialassistance packages in the region. The Australian authorities were able to play a useful rolebecause they had been building an understanding of regional developments for many years, inpart reflecting the strong trade links with the region, but also a more general interest on the partof our business and academic communities. Bureaucratic ties, including among central banks,had also been strengthened, particularly through EMEAP, the group of 11 regional central banksand monetary authorities that has been meeting regularly since 1991.This understanding led Australia to see more quickly than most other countries the difficultieswith the Indonesian rescue package, and it used what influence it had with the IMF to argue for amore flexible approach. Recently, Australia has pressed for APEC to lend its support to theproposed reforms to the international financial system put forward by the three G22 workingparties. We recognise that there is a danger that the momentum could be lost if governments inthis region do not keep up the pressure.Exchange rate systemsOne of the areas in which the reshaping of ideas has already begun to occur is that of exchangerate systems. Until 1997, most countries in Asia maintained some form of pegged exchange rate.In the case of Hong Kong, this was a type of currency board, while other countries maintainedexchange rates which, although often referred to as floating, were managed within a tight rangeagainst the US dollar, or some weighted index dominated by the US dollar.
– 2 –BIS Review   101/1998Most of the latter group of countries have had to abandon their systems under the pressure ofrecent events. Currency boards such as Hong Kong’s (or Argentina’s, for that matter) seem tohave survived rather better (though at a high price in terms of lost GDP). As a result, it iscommonplace to hear these days the view that countries can choose to have a fixed exchange rateby way of a currency board or a pure float, but not any of the possible systems in between.I confess to some misgivings about this conclusion. I think it is mainly attractive to people wholike intellectually pure systems, but we live in a very impure world. I think a lot more analysisneeds to be undertaken before we can be confident of such a conclusion. For a start, HongKong’s version of a currency board is very different to Argentina’s. Secondly, we need toexamine countries like Singapore, Taiwan or Chile, which do not fall into either of the polarcases, but whose economies seem to have done relatively well in difficult circumstances.Whatever the solution is, it will involve making very difficult choices. I am reminded of thiswhen I look back over the many meetings I attended with Asian central banks in the middle yearsof this decade. The ever-present topic of conversation was what to do about the large inflows ofcapital they were attracting. Everyone knew that they were “excessive” in the sense that theywere much larger than needed to cover the relatively small current account deficits, were difficultfor the economies to absorb productively, and were putting a lot of upward pressure on theirrelatively fixed exchange rates. There were basically three alternatives open to them:Persevere with the relatively fixed exchange rates and sterilise the inflows to make sure thatmoney supply and inflation did not accelerate; put in place some form of control to limit theamount of capital inflow; or float the exchange rate.As we know, they chose the first alternative. We look at the result and say they made a mistake.But the second alternative – capital controls – was effectively ruled out by international pressurein anything other than a crisis situation. Remember, while the international debate has nowreached some form of consensus that “Chilean” style controls on inflows can play a useful role,this is a very recent development.That leaves the third alternative – a move to a floating exchange rate – and this looked ratherdaunting to them. I am not aware of any country, including developed countries, that have madethe move without being forced to do so by some form of crisis.The reality is that, even though the theoretical benefits of floating are clear enough, the transitioncan be, and often is, difficult. Certainly, that was our experience in Australia in the mid-1980s.In the case of the Asian economies, a move to floating may have brought things to a head soonerin that it would have removed the exchange rate certainty that underpinned the capital inflowsthat were driven by interest rate differentials. But exchange rates which were already seen asbeing overvalued would have risen further, compounding the subsequent correction.With the benefit of hindsight, it now seems clear to me that it would have been difficult to avoidsome sort of crisis. With so much internationally mobile capital pouring into economies withrelatively small financial sectors, there was virtually no prospect of a smooth return to normality.Australia’s exchange rateSo far, I have talked about possible exchange rate regimes and how difficult it has been for Asiancountries to come to terms with these – what of Australia’s experience? As most of you will
– 3 –BIS Review   101/1998know, Australia spent the first 40 years of the postwar period trying just about every form offixed exchange rate that was possible. First of all, the Australian dollar was fixed to the poundsterling, then fixed to the US dollar, then fixed to a trade-weighted basket, then a variable peg toa trade-weighted basket. Finally, we floated, and in two weeks’ time we will mark the 15thanniversary of the float of the Australian dollar. We are very comfortable with the floatingexchange rate, and I know of no serious body of opinion in Australia that would want it any otherway now that we have come to terms with it. In fact, it is widely seen as being an importantfactor helping Australia put in a good economic performance during the Asian crisis.We certainly have allowed our exchange rate to adjust to reflect economic circumstances, mostparticularly the international cycle in economic activity and commodity prices. We have notresisted these broadly-based economic changes and the Australian economy has benefited as aresult. Since 1986 the Australian dollar has fluctuated around a stationary average value, with thecycle being quite pronounced: peak-to-trough movements of around 30% have been common.While we are prepared to accept significant moves in the exchange rate, we do not follow anapproach of benign neglect. When the exchange rate moves, we ask ourselves if it is telling usanything about policy settings. With our inflation-targeting framework, the central issue isalways what the exchange rate move means for inflation, not only in the near term but also in thelonger term.There have been instances when monetary policy has been adjusted in response to exchange ratemoves, but they have not been frequent. We have also used intervention to influence theexchange rate, finding it particularly useful in circumstances where market imperfections areresulting in overshooting, as markets tend to do from time to time.Judging when this tendency to overshooting exists is always difficult at the time, and – like mostthings in life, including making the sorts of decisions you all make in foreign exchange trading –usually easier with at least some hindsight. As a rule of thumb, however, the exchange rate is notovershooting unless it has already moved a considerable way from its “normal” level, or at least alevel that can be explained by what is happening in the economic and financial environment.As you know, there is considerable debate about the effectiveness of intervention, even amongcentral bankers. Some of this stems from a lack of clarity about what it aims to do. Interventionshould not be viewed as a substitute for necessary adjustments in monetary policy. It is alsoexpecting a lot of it to think it can support a fixed exchange rate during times of crisis. But, in afloating exchange rate regime, intervention can play a useful role in limiting extreme movementsin the exchange rate.This is the approach we have taken in Australia. The result is that our interventions tend to beinfrequent, coming mainly at or near the peaks and troughs of the exchange rate cycle. By andlarge, judged against our aims, we believe our interventions have been successful. They have alsobeen successful when judged against the test proposed by Milton Friedman, i.e. whether or notthey are profitable. The Bank has fairly consistently made profits from its interventionthroughout the post-float period.During the past year, the Bank intervened on three occasions. These occurred after the rateagainst the US dollar had already fallen by a considerable amount. In other words, our policy onintervention has not prevented the exchange rate from falling enough to do the job we expect afloating exchange rate to do. Australia has been able to maintain growth of about 4% in the pastyear, at a time when most of our main trading partners in Asia have experienced negative growth.
– 4 –BIS Review   101/1998Our exchange rate system and the robustness of our financial sector have been two of the keys tothis performance.I would hope that countries that have only recently entered the world of floating exchange ratescan draw some hope from this. The move from pegged to floating exchange rates is never easy.Soon after the Australian dollar was floated, it fell by over 30%, not dissimilar to the fallsrecently experienced by some of our Asian neighbours. There is no doubt that this causedconsiderable dislocation to the economy at the time, requiring strict and somewhat unpalatablepolicy decisions. But I think that businesses, markets and the authorities all learned from thatexperience, showing that it is possible to emerge from such disturbances with the economy andthe financial system in much better shape. I hope that this will also be true for the countriescurrently experiencing difficulties. The very recent signs of greater stability in regional marketscan give us some confidence that this will be the case.
BIS Review   100/1998Mr Wellink considers monetary relations between the euro zone and new member statesSpeech by the President of the Netherlands Bank, Dr A.H.E.M. Wellink, at the European FinanceConvention in Vienna on 23/11/98.I should start with a warning to those who favour early accession of Central and EasternEuropean countries to the European Union. Somebody once said the following about the part ofEurope I live in: “I do not find Northern Europe an ideal zone for human habitation. It is a fineplace for industrial productivity, but its climate breeds puritans and the terrible dictates of theProtestant Work Ethic. The Romans were right to pull out when they did.” So please be wellaware of whom you seek to live with in a more institutionalized setting. But, let me addimmediately that times have changed. For instance, the Romans have found it attractive to bereunited with us in EMU.Today, I want to discuss the issue of monetary relations between Central and Eastern Europe andthe European Union. Accession to the EU is understandably a hot issue in the countriesconcerned and it rightly guides their medium-term macroeconomic policy orientation. At thesame time the turbulence in the global financial markets poses some immediate policychallenges. Two issues are particularly at stake: (1) to what extent is Eastern Europe hit by theconsequences of the Asian and Russian financial crises? and (2) what is the best policy approachin the current international environment? I will first discuss these two issues. Later on, I willbroaden my horizon and raise some issues related to the future accession of these countries to theEU.Contagion? Economies in transition have not been shielded from contagion effects, which startedafter the Russian financial crisis. Financial market volatility increased sharply. Headline stockmarket indices significantly dropped in August and exchange rates were under downwardpressure. However, the situation seems to have improved meanwhile. Although it is probably tooearly for a final assessment, until now the effects on the real economy have been relativelylimited, also because trade relations have dramatically changed in the past and their focus is nowmuch more towards the West. The countries that had made significant strides since the beginningof the 1990s in establishing a well-functioning market economy have weathered the financialstorms rather well. This is ample proof that they are on the right track. Their main challenge istherefore to ensure that the ongoing stabilization and reform efforts continue even if, or should Isay especially if, external conditions deteriorate further.External conditionsLet me say a few words about these external conditions. I believe that we should not be overlypessimistic about economic growth in the industrial countries. The euro zone remains an area ofstability, even though we have seen some downward adjustments to growth expectations for nextyear. Growth performance in the United States was quite strong in the third quarter, evenstronger than had been expected. Interest rates in a number of countries – the US, the UK andseveral European countries – have been lowered. Signs are that the economic downturn inSoutheast Asia has bottomed out. With the help of the IMF, Brazil has established a strongadjustment package. These are all hopeful signs that we might have reached a turning point andthat things should now gradually show a turn for the better. But at the same time, given recentgrowth expectations, we should not be overly optimistic either.Inside and outside the European Central Bank, there is much discussion about the level ofinterest rates in Europe. Supporters of interest rate reductions are pointing to the worsening
– 2 –BIS Review   100/1998economic conditions in the world and to the lead given by the US central bank, the FederalReserve System. Let me try to put things in perspective here. In the Governing Council of theECB we are carefully considering developments in economic and monetary conditions in theeuro zone. So far, the internal dynamics of the euro zone are still relatively strong. At the sametime, we are certainly not blind to developments in the “outside” world. One should take intoaccount, however, that for the euro area as a whole the average three-month market interest ratehas come down from 4.2% early this year to 3.7% now. The current level is about 150 basispoints lower than that in the US. In addition, we need to keep in mind that the US and Europe areat different stages of the business cycle. Therefore, monetary conditions seem easier here than inthe US. I would stress that aggressive calls for lowering interest rates from politicians – apartfrom being against the letter and the spirit of the Maastricht Treaty – involve the danger ofmaking the interest rate issue the acid test for the independence of the ECB. Europe and theworld are better off with a monetary policy that is consistently oriented at the medium term thanwith efforts on our side to fine-tune the development of the business cycle.Current monetary policy challenges in Eastern EuropeThis brings me to the issue of current monetary policy challenges in Eastern Europe. In a generalsense, key words are credibility and transparency. These words are used quite often, but they areall the more relevant in turbulent times. The overall aim should be to create “sound money”. Thisimplies (1) price stability and (2) a sound financial and payments system. For a central bank toattain the goal of price stability, it must have not only full power to formulate and implementmonetary policy but also the confidence of the general public and financial markets. That iswhere transparency comes in. Being transparent is essential in order to educate people and makethem understand the reasons for policy changes.The current monetary policy approach in most Eastern European countries recognises theimportance of the basic principles of credibility and transparency. Through July of this year, wehave seen the “costs of success” in several countries. Improved confidence on the part of foreigninvestors led to capital inflows that were very large compared to the size of the economies of therecipient countries. Coping with the inflationary pressures created by these capital inflows wasthe main challenge facing monetary policy. Following the aggravation of the crisis in Russia,however, the countries experienced significant capital outflows. Obviously, such sudden shifts ininvestor behaviour do create severe strains for the day-to-day management of monetary policy.The authorities from these countries have skilfully reacted by adjusting their monetary strategy ina practical manner. In Poland and Hungary, for instance, the central banks have provided clarityabout the medium-term development of the exchange rate, thus contributing to anchoringexpectations. Most laudably, the countries in Eastern Europe have refrained from imposing newrestrictions on capital movements. This is very important indeed and it seems to have beenrewarded in financial markets.Accession to the EULet me now turn to the future relationship between the European regions, more specifically to theintended enlargement of the European Union towards the East. Many years ago, fathers in theUnited States would tell their sons to go West in search of fortune. Perhaps fathers in WesternEurope may in the not too distant future tell their sons: “Go East, young man.”The countries of Central and Eastern Europe are catching up quickly and may one day becomethe most dynamic economies and societies in Europe. In the meantime, it is clear that EasternEurope is looking towards the West.
– 3 –BIS Review   100/1998The so-called “fast-track” countries of Central and Eastern Europe will hopefully be ready to jointhe European Union some time from now, although a number of further reforms still need to beimplemented. This is especially true for financial markets and the banking sector. There havebeen many political statements on the most likely year for accession. It is of course, for thepoliticians to decide on this. In my view, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe should begiven enough time to prepare themselves properly for becoming part of the Single Market.Moreover, given the substantial differences among them, the candidate member states should belooked at on a case-by-case basis.Some transitional provisions are likely to be necessary for new member states after joining theEuropean Union. Without such provisions the expansion of the European Union may need to bepostponed for many years, which is clearly undesirable. Moreover, in the past such provisionshave also been applied to new entrants, including Spain, Portugal and Greece.It is essential to strike a proper balance. The acquis, the body of legislation which applies to allEU member states, must remain the common denominator. Member states can decide to workmore closely in some areas, but they cannot detract from the acquis. Member states must satisfycertain requirements in the monetary and financial sphere, even those member states that have aderogation with respect to monetary union. These requirements are essential for the functioningof the single market. Transitional provisions may be required. However, permanent exemptionsor lengthy transitional periods would be inappropriate as they could threaten the internalcohesion of the Union.Monetary relationsLet me be a bit more specific about monetary relations and let me start with the period beforemembership. In the run-up to the accession to European Union, prospective member statesshould take a pragmatic approach to the implementation of monetary policy. It seems only logicalthat the exchange rate against the euro will gradually be assigned an increasing importance in themonetary policy considerations of candidate member states. An implicit or explicit orientation ofmonetary policy towards the exchange rate against the euro can also be justified by the relativeimportance of trade relations between the two regions. Some 50–60% of foreign trade of thecountries of Central and Eastern Europe is with the European Union.Where pragmatism is called for, it does not make sense to establish all kind of institutional bellsand whistles in the monetary field. Rather than participating in any formal exchange ratemechanism with the euro before EU membership, countries in Central and Eastern Europeshould focus on economic reform. During such a period, monetary and exchange rate policiesshould provide for sufficient flexibility and should take account of the specific circumstances ofthe country concerned. For instance, given the current levels of inflation, it may be wise for somecountries to maintain a crawling currency peg for the time being. For other countries a strongercommitment – a fixed peg or a currency board – may be more appropriate. Before accession, thiscan only be a unilateral decision. Only after joining the European Union can new member statesparticipate in ERM-II, as indeed they are expected to, assuming that a credible peg against theeuro can be established at that time.Preconditions for stable monetary relationsOf course, linking the currency to the euro cannot be a substitute for conducting stability-orientedmacroeconomic and structural policies. Rather, any formal link to the euro should be preceded bypolicy measures which make the intended currency link a credible one. Given today’s importance
– 4 –BIS Review   100/1998of capital flows to exchange rates, such policy measures should also cover areas that areimportant to capital flows.Allow me to say a few words on the approach towards capital movements. Undoubtedly, hotmoney is a hot issue at the moment. Restrictions on capital flows have proven less than effectivein times when investor confidence turns sour. Introducing controls to limit capital outflows in themiddle of a crisis is doomed to fail. They may afford some temporary relief, but when peoplewant to get their money out of the country, they will succeed in doing so in the end. Whatremains is long-term damage to investor confidence. Liberalizing the capital account further isthe more promising route.Adequate sequencing of short-term capital inflows may be required in order to gain time foradjusting the domestic financial sector to the competitive pressures that follow from capitalliberalization. It should be realized, though, that such an approach should go hand in hand withan improvement of supervision and a strengthening of the financial sector. This should be highon the policy agenda in Eastern Europe. There has been considerable progress on capitalliberalization in these countries and it is expected that, under OECD rules, capital movementswill be free of restrictions pretty soon. The major challenge now is to ensure that therestructuring of the financial sector keeps pace, an area where there is still much to be done.It is well-known that in the communist past many banks used to be a part of, or closely related to,the central bank. In addition, many of the borrowers used to be companies with close ties to thegovernment. As a result, there were few incentives for risk control and return enhancement.Instead, some banks used to generate profits by exploiting certain privileges which no longerexist.What is necessary, and what has been done to some extent in some countries, but not all, isprivatizing state-controlled banks and promoting free market entry. This will provide bankmanagers with the right incentives to make risk/return assessments. Adequate bank supervisionand financial markets oversight are required to ensure that sufficient weight is given to riskcontrol. Foreign ownership may help to transfer certain specific banking skills to candidatemember states, even though I do not favour a big January sale of financial institutions in thecountries concerned.The current problems in certain Asian countries show that a bad loan overhang can severelyimpede the functioning of the economy. Balance sheet restructuring in countries in Central andEastern Europe may require intervention by the competent authorities in some cases. It may benecessary to let some banks fail. It may be necessary for governments to take over bad loansinherited from the communist era. This would enable some credit institutions to conduct businessmore effectively. In order to prevent moral hazard, the rescue of selected credit institutions canonly take place under certain conditions, most likely including the lay-off of those responsible formaking these loans.Importantly from a macroeconomic point of view, any debt restructuring involving governmentmoney should find expression in official figures for government debt. This would provide abetter insight into the actual financial situation in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.Reducing uncertainties in this respect is likely to build up confidence and attract rather than deterforeign investors.
– 5 –BIS Review   100/1998Concluding remarksI have spoken on the monetary relations between the euro zone and the countries of Central andEastern Europe. Let me conclude by presenting some ideas about the relations between theEuropean System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the central banks of the candidate member states.Although candidate member states obviously cannot take part in ESCB meetings before theiraccession to the European Union, it could be useful to invite the governors of the central banks ofthe “fast-track” countries once a year to attend a special meeting of the General Council of theECB. This would be similar to the current practice for the Council of Economics and FinanceMinisters (Ecofin). Apart from that, the ECB staff could be asked to make a yearly assessment ofthe state of progress in applicant countries.Finally, the Governing Council of the ECB will be requested to give its opinion on the expansionof the European Union towards the East. For now, I would like to conclude that the authorities ofthe candidate member states seem to be very capable of taking the right decisions in providingtheir people with a stable economic environment.
BIS Review   99/1998Mr. Macfarlane puts recent suggestions for improving the operation of the internationalfinancial system into perspectiveTalk by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. I.J. Macfarlane, to CEDA AnnualGeneral Meeting Dinner in Melbourne on 25/11/98.It is a pleasure to be in Melbourne again for CEDA’s Annual General Meeting. The last time Iaddressed this group two years ago I spoke about the Australian economy, monetary policy andwages. Events have moved on a good deal since then, and I hope what I have to say tonightreflects this.The biggest change is that attention is now more focussed on the international economy than ondomestic events. This change can be dated from the start of the Asian crisis in the middle of1997, and has continued through more recent episodes which have affected other emergingmarkets as well as financial institutions in developed countries. These events have led a numberof participants in international markets, myself included, to question some aspects of the presentinternational financial system, and to make suggestions for improvements.I have said a number of things recently that have sounded a bit out of character from a centralbanker. Both I and my deputy have shown a lot of sympathy for our Asian neighbours and feltthat it is unfair to place the blame for their current plight solely on their own policy inadequacies.We have also said that the present international financial system is unstable, that hedge fundsshould be brought into the disclosure and supervision net and that the western policyestablishment was wrong to encourage emerging markets to embrace the free movement ofinternational capital so early in their development.This has led some people to wonder what has come over us, and to question whether we havedeserted orthodox economics to follow more populist creeds. I have been asked whether we nolonger believe in markets, and whether we have become proponents of capital controls. Thesequestions worry me because they suggest that, for some people, there are only the two polarpositions, and that if you express some reservations about one, you are automatically placed inthe other. For these reasons, I want to spend some time tonight trying to place the recentsuggestions for improving the operation of the international financial system in some sort ofperspective.1.From the Perspective of AustraliaFrom the perspective of the Australian economy, the move to financial deregulation, and to thelifting of restrictions on international capital movements, has been a success. We can date itapproximately from the floating of the exchange rate, and the abolition of exchange controls, in1983. Although we characterise this 15-year period as being an era of deregulation, that is only avery approximate description. While the authorities have stopped setting prices such as theexchange rate or the interest rates banks can charge on mortgages, there is still a large ever-evolving body of regulation in place aimed at ensuring financial stability and efficient and fairmarkets. The stock exchange and the futures exchange have a comprehensive set of rules thatparticipants must adhere to, and, of course, they are also regulated by ASIC. The banks andinsurance companies are regulated by APRA, the payments system by the Reserve Bank, andcompetition policy is enforced by the ACCC. Underlying all this, are the body of commercial lawand the accounting standards.
- 2 -BIS Review   99/1998This approach to organising financial markets - which, in deference to common usage, I will callthe deregulated approach - has not been without its critics. A common criticism is thatinternational capital has forced the Australian Government to run macro-economic policies thatwere not in the interests of the domestic economy. By this, the critics mean policies that aretighter than the ones they favour. I have never agreed with this proposition. There has been anon-going struggle in Australia by governments of both sides to return fiscal and monetary policyto sustainable long-run settings after the turmoil of the 1970s. The influence of financial marketshas been a helpful one in bringing this about. Now that policies are in a sustainable andresponsible position, I am not aware of financial markets pushing for tighter policies.The other common criticism is that financial markets in Australia have been unstable. Thesimplest answer to this charge is to point out that they would have been more unstable over thepast 15 years if we had tried to find a path through the ups and downs of the world economy witha managed exchange rate and a set of interest rate ceilings. We would not have had the dailymovements as under the present system, but the pressure would have built up and when the dambroke, as it assuredly would have, the crisis would have been worse.While I am confident that the deregulated system performed better than a continuation of the oldregulated one would have, I do not want to give the impression that it is without fault. We arealready on record as accepting that the exchange rate went down too far in the mid-1980s, thatasset prices such as shares and, later, commercial property underwent a boom and bust at the endof the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, partly as a result of excessive lending by newly-deregulated banks. Our whole approach to foreign exchange intervention is based on our viewthat the foreign exchange market is not “efficient” in the academic sense, but that it is prone toovershooting in both directions from time to time.In other words, we do not have an idealised view of how deregulated asset markets behave - wehave a realistic “warts and all” view. But even holding that view, we are confident that aderegulated model with no obstacles to capital movements is the best one for Australia. It took usa long time to adopt it, but there is now wide support for it at the political, policy adviser andcommunity level, and I hear no suggestions that we should change it. But that does not mean thatwe should be urging every other country to adopt this model regardless of their state ofdevelopment. Eventually, I think it will be in the interest of emerging market economies to do so,but the sequencing of this and other policies is crucial.2.An Emerging Market PerspectiveWhen we look at international capital movements from the perspective of an emerging marketeconomy, the view can be very different.For a start, the size of the financial sector in an emerging market is often extremely small relativeto the flows of capital that emanate from developed countries. As Paul Volcker has put it:“One common characteristic of (emerging market) countries, some large inpopulation and area, is the small size of their financial sector. The aggregate size ofthe banks in the typical emerging country is now the size of a single regional bank inthe United States - precisely the kind of bank that is told that it is too small to survivein today’s turbulent markets.”1                                                     1 Speech to Institute for International Finance, Washington, October 1998.
- 3 -BIS Review   99/1998What is a small adjustment of investment strategy for a few major banks or mutual funds may bea large injection or withdrawal of funds for an emerging market.Second, it is clear that for most of the Asian emerging markets, some of the capital inflow thatoccurred in the mid to late 1990s was not, in any sense, needed. It was more than the amountrequired to finance their current account deficit, and it certainly was not needed to support theirexchange rate because these were under unwelcome upward pressure throughout the period. Thepurist would say that if they did not want the inflow they should have let their exchange ratesfloat upwards. This would have eventually curtailed the short-term inflows that result when afixed exchange rate tries to co-exist with a positive interest differential. But what we do notknow is how high the exchange rate would have needed to rise in the process and the extent towhich this would have added to the economic difficulties. Remember the Thai currency crisiswas triggered by the perception that the baht had become over-valued because it was tied to arising US dollar. In short, if capital flows are very large relative to the size of the economies, theyare, one way or another, going to cause distortions.Of course, the above considerations would not matter if the international capital markets were asmoothly adjusting mechanism that constantly kept the exchange rate in line with the evolvingfundamentals. But this is not what people observe - they see booms and busts and do not believethe proposition that the market is always right. Attempts by academic economists to persuadethem that the free market always, or nearly always, gives the correct equilibrium price areunconvincing. The public’s scepticism is well placed because the intellectual underpinning of thefree market position in relation to asset price determination - the Efficient Markets Hypothesis -is very weak. In all the exchange rate tests of which I am aware, the hypothesis has beencontradicted by the facts.The third difference from an emerging market viewpoint is their relatively under-developedfinancial infrastructures and regulatory frameworks. They do not have as strongly a based systemof regulating stock markets or banks or the underlying body of commercial (includingbankruptcy) law or accounting practices. They also have serious deficiencies in the allocation ofinvestment which unduly favours those who are well-connected to the government, the banks orboth (the so-called “crony capitalism”). I have no intention of denying that these are seriousshortcomings and that they should be rectified as quickly as possible if the countries concernedare going to achieve first world living standards. But we have to be realistic about how quicklythese things can be achieved; in our own countries, these changes took decades or generationsrather than years.Such problems are heightened by the phenomenon of contagion, a fourth element particularlystrong among emerging markets. In cases of panic, financial markets are not very discriminating.When one country suffers a withdrawal of capital, others come under pressure. Partly, this can begeography, as physical proximity can often mean economic and financial linkages. But eveneconomies on the other side of the globe, with few direct linkages, can be affected for no otherreason than that they are classified as “emerging markets”.Such countries might well have some weaknesses such as those noted above which, given timeand a measure of economic and financial stability, might be adequately addressed. But underconditions of widespread desire to shed risk, they become immediate stumbling blocks formarkets. This can put intense pressure on the policy authorities and economies of these countries- pressure which few countries can withstand easily.
- 4 -BIS Review   99/1998For these reasons, the picture looks different from the perspective of the emerging marketeconomies. What is good for us after a long period of evolution need not be good for anothercountry at a much earlier stage of that evolution. In modern parlance, it is essential to get thesequencing right. Countries have to attain a high standard of financial infrastructure andregulation before they can submit themselves to the potential instability inherent in the totallyfree movement of capital. In the meantime, they should integrate themselves as closely as theycan into the international capital market and, as their markets evolve towards maturity, they cantake additional steps progressively to liberalise their regulatory regimes. To expect them to do itin the other order is to ask them to run before they can walk.3.What Should We Do About It?Fortunately, there is now a widespread agreement that something has to be done to improve theinternational financial system. The degree of instability, if it continues unchecked, could leadmany participating countries to question the whole legitimacy of the system. The severity of thecontractions in Asia is the most striking example, but so is the sudden recognition that a hedgefund can become so important that its failure could pose a systemic threat to the United Statesand international economy. The fact that the second most important exchange rate in the world -the US dollar-Yen rate - could move by 20 per cent in a month without there being a materialchange in fundamentals has also caused concern. I think there is now agreement that somethinghas to be done, and it is heartening to see that the United States has taken a leadership role,including by convening the Group of 22 and its three working parties. I also think that theAustralian Government has played a very useful role - first by its representations to the IMFurging more flexibility in its handling of the Indonesian crisis, and secondly by its attempt tokeep the momentum of APEC heading in the direction of more liberal trade policies.Change is already occurring in that the western policy establishment is no longer pushingemerging market economies to move quickly to full capital account convertibility. As recently asOctober last year the IMF, at its Annual Meeting in Hong Kong, was hoping to get its members’endorsement of a change to its Articles to make it easier for it to encourage countries to adoptfull convertibility. This proposal was not put forward at the 1998 Annual Meeting in Washingtonbecause it was clear that it would not get support. There also seems to be greater tolerance forcountries which have a generally outward-looking policy framework, but which have put in placesome impediment to very short-term capital movements. I refer here to Chile’s depositrequirement on foreign borrowing and to Singapore’s and Taiwan’s restrictions on their bankslending domestic currency offshore.The more important task is to get on with the job of improving the international monetarysystem, with the specific aim of reducing the degree of instability. Some of this is the job of theemerging market countries, and in the first instance involves increasing disclosure by thesecountries’ governments, companies and banks. As well as making markets better informed, andbetter able to judge the risks they are taking, the aim here is to make some progress on reducingthe previously opaque links between governments, banks and companies, or, in other words, toimprove governance. In addition, there is a lot of work to be done to bring the supervision offinancial institutions up to standard - a task which will take a lot of personnel, training and time.These changes are extremely important and require a lot of effort on the part of the emergingmarket countries. They also mean that a lot of time-honoured ways of doing things will have tobe replaced. This is bound to meet opposition, and it will require political courage as well aseconomic expertise to achieve results. It will be made a lot easier if the developed economies arealso seen to be examining whether there are aspects of their regulations that are contributing to
- 5 -BIS Review   99/1998the instability of the international system. The most obvious reform here is to do somethingabout the extent to which current regulations allow excessive leverage in financial markets. Theimmediate focus should be the close inter-connections between hedge funds, investment banksand commercial banks. The hedge funds have become the privileged children of the internationalfinancial scene, being entitled to the benefits of free markets without any of the responsibilities.Our reconstruction of the transactions that hedge funds undertook in Australia in June suggeststhat they could engage in almost infinite leverage in their off-balance sheet transactions if they sochose. One has to ask whether the Basle capital requirements are excessively generous in theirtreatment of financial market activities. A related problem is the weakness in banks’ creditassessment processes that allowed them to build up some very large exposures to hedge fundsand other financial institutions.No matter how effective the above changes turn out to be, no-one expects that they will eliminateeconomic crises altogether. There still will be a need for improved crisis management.Here, the most useful suggestion goes under the title of private sector burden sharing. This isdesigned to be used in a future crisis when a country’s international reserves are exhausted andits exchange rate is plunging as a result of capital flight. In order to reassure markets, countriesare often tempted to guarantee a variety of foreign borrowings, with the result that their taxpayersincur large losses while foreign lenders escape unscathed. Private sector burden sharing wouldstop the capital flight by bringing foreign creditors, the debtor country and the IMF together towork out a rescheduling, probably with a standfast arrangement to hold things together whilenegotiations take place. Thus, the burden would be shared more evenly, and the pressures onexchange rates could be reduced.Another way in which crises can be handled better is illustrated by the recent IMF package forBrazil. It was an improvement on the Asian packages in two respects. First, the conditions wereagreed on in advance in behind-the-scenes negotiations between the IMF and Brazilianauthorities. This was much better than the public tug-of-war between national authorities and theIMF that occurred in Thailand and Indonesia. Second, I also note that the conditions are not aswide-ranging as in Indonesia, for instance. I agree with Martin Feldstein2 that the IMF conditionsshould confine themselves to matters that bear directly on the currency crisis, namely fiscal,monetary and banking policy, rather than trying to reform the automobile, shipbuilding or cloveindustry, as in Indonesia.4.ConclusionIt is important that we find a way of reducing the present extreme variability in internationalcapital flows. It is also important that we find a way of managing future crises in a way thatreduces the cost to the crisis country and shares the burden more evenly, and so reduces themoral hazard to lenders. If we do not succeed in doing these things, we face the prospect of asignificant number of countries losing faith in open, market-based economic systems. It would betragic if our failure to reform an unstable international capital market resulted in a return toinward-looking policies in the international trade in goods and services. And that may yethappen.One reaction to the instability of the international financial system would be for countries tounilaterally impose quite restrictive controls on inward and outward capital movements, and thusmiss out on the benefits that access to foreign capital can provide. We have already seen this                                                     2 “Reforming the IMF”, Foreign Affairs, March/April 1998.
- 6 -BIS Review   99/1998starting, and it would be regrettable if it were to spread. Even if this does not happen, there is stilla possibility of other reactions which may be equally, or more, unhelpful to the world economy.In particular, I fear that a number of emerging market countries will take another form of safety-first policy by building up large international reserves - a new type of mercantilism. The problemwith this solution is that to build up the reserves they would have to run current accountsurpluses for the foreseeable future. How will they do this? Will they be tempted to restrictimports, subsidise exports or maintain undervalued exchange rates? All of these are what used tobe called “beggar thy neighbour” policies. The whole world cannot do this, so who will run thecorresponding current account deficits? The final irony, if this situation eventuates, would be thatwe would have an international system in which the poor countries lend to the rich so they canspend more than their income.
BIS Review   98/1998Mr. George gives an assessment of where the UK economy has come from and where it isheadedSpeech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, given at the Institute ofDirectors Annual Dinner in London on 19/11/98.My Lord and President, Deputy Lord Mayor, Your Excellency, My Lords, Ladies andGentlemen.Let me put some of the recent newspaper headlines alongside the facts, in order to put things inperspective.First, on the world economy, the headlines read:• Meltdown warning in the wake of economic slowdown.• G7 nations try to halt slide to depression.• Last ditch bid to avert global crisis.And these are just the supposedly serious newspapers!The facts are that world output growth is expected by the IMF to be 2% this year and 21/2% next- compared with 4% in 1997. And the OECD expects growth in the OECD area of 21/4% thisyear, 13/4% in 1999, recovering to 21/4% in the year 2000 - compared with 3% in 1997. Thatcertainly is a very marked slowdown, but it is hardly meltdown or recession.And on our own economy - the headlines read:• Recession looms.• The economy is hurtling headlong towards recession.And even:• It’s official - the economy is shrinking.The facts are that for the past 6½ years the British economy as a whole has grown at an averageannual rate of over 3% - which is well above its long term trend rate of some 2% - or, if you areoptimistic, some 2½%. And we were still growing, at an annual rate of some 2% in each of thelast two quarters, on the latest published data.At the time these headlines were written a month or so ago not one of the 28 independentprofessional forecasting organisations surveyed by Consensus Forecasts was expecting output tofall in 1999; and their average expectation was for 1% growth next year. That is broadly in linewith our own latest best guess in the MPC. Your own most recent IOD forecast in Septembersuggested slightly stronger growth next year. It is true that Consensus Forecasts have sincerevised down their mean expectation - to just over ¾% growth; but even now only one of the 28contributors expects output to fall.On unemployment in the UK the headlines read:* Jobs gloom deepens as layoffs soar.* More jobs go as recession looms.* Jobless up as worldpain hits Britain.
- 2 -BIS Review   98/1998And the facts? At the time these headlines were written, the unemployment rate, both nationallyand in virtually every region of the UK, apart from the South East and East Anglia, was thelowest it has been since at least the early 1980s.I could go on.Headlines: UK heads for credit crisis. Closed for credit. Credit card sales dive. Facts: bank andbuilding society lending up by 0.7% in the latest month (September) and by 8.8% over the pastyear. Credit card lending was up by over 26% on a year ago.Headlines: House prices hit as recession clouds gather. Facts: house prices rose by 6.7% over thepast year on the Halifax index and by 7.5% according to the Nationwide.Now I say all this, President, not to draw attention to the proclivity of headline writers, and someeconomic/financial commentators, to sensationalise. My serious point is that, especially at a timeof unusual uncertainty as at present, we all need to focus more carefully than ever on theevolving facts, and on the more probable outcomes and not allow ourselves to becomepreoccupied with extreme, even if possible, outcomes.Against that background, let me offer you my own assessment of where the UK economy hascome from and where it is headed.Since the recession of the early 1990s the economy as a whole has, as I say, grown at an averageannual rate of just over 3% - well above trend. During this period we were steadily reabsorbingthe spare capacity created by the recession, and this was reflected in a gradual improvement inthe labour market - in a net increase in employment of 1.7 mn people since the end of 1992, andin a persistent fall in unemployment to - as I say - the lowest rate for nearly 20 years. Meanwhile,underlying consumer price inflation has averaged 2.7% over the past 5 years, the lowest ratesince the early 1960s - and it has been exactly on target - at 2½% - in each of the past 3 months.About 2 years ago it began to become evident that demand and output growth, in the economy asa whole, was picking up speed. And as we moved into and through 1997, it became increasinglyobvious that unless we acted to tighten monetary policy, in order to moderate the rate of growth,we risked overheating, particularly in the labour market, where reports of shortages not just ofskilled but even of unskilled workers, were becoming widespread.The situation was seriously complicated by an increasing imbalance between the domestic andthe internationally exposed sectors of the economy. Domestic demand for goods, and particularlyfor services, was unsustainably strong, and large parts of the economy were doing very well onthe back of that - though they didn’t make too much of a song and dance about it. But othersectors, those most exposed to international competition - most of agriculture, large parts ofmanufacturing and some service sectors - were already then having a much more difficult time.Understandably, they were more vociferous. They had been hit, initially, by the exaggeratedstrength of sterling against the major European currencies in the run up to decisions about theeuro. And they were hit, subsequently, by the successive waves of turmoil spreading through theworld economy which saw exchange rates fall and demand dry up in Asia and elsewhere.So, faced with this dilemma, what were we to do? It is true that the external factors - unhelpful asthey were in a more fundamental sense, in terms of the imbalance in the economy - did act as arestraining influence on overall aggregate demand and on inflation, and that meant we hadsomewhat more time than we would otherwise have had to moderate the growth of domesticdemand. But even allowing for that we in fact had no choice but to tighten policy.
- 3 -BIS Review   98/1998It wasn’t that we didn’t know that the internationally-exposed sectors were under the hammer -we’d have had to be blind as well as deaf not to have known. Our problem was that if we hadheld back more than we did, in order to shelter the exposed sectors, we would have put the wholeeconomy - including the sectors we were trying to protect - at risk of accelerating inflation. Andthat would have meant eventually having to tighten policy more abruptly, which would muchmore certainly have plunged the economy into serious recession, a bit further down the road.The harsh reality is that monetary policy can only target the economy as a whole - it cannotrealistically seek to shelter particular businesses or particular sectors or particular regions,however much we might all wish it were otherwise. And, in relation to the economy as a whole,the effective choice in the situation we faced was not whether or not to tighten, but whether totighten sooner, and by less, or later, by more.So we raised interest rates through the second half of last year - and again in June - trying, as bestwe could through our tactics, to minimise any further unwanted upward pressure on sterling.But things have now clearly moved on.The outlook for the world economy deteriorated further through the summer under the impact ofa series of new shocks. Japan, the world’s second largest economy, slipped further into recession.Russia - which had only weeks earlier embarked on an IMF program - saw the collapse of therouble and default on its debt. And acute nervousness spread through many of the world’sfinancial markets. Although there has been some improvement in sentiment over the past monthor two, and although the US and European economies continue to expand, the likelihood remainsthat world economic growth will be significantly slower than had been expected earlier in thesummer. Slower growth of world activity is bound to prolong the restraining external effect ongrowth and inflation in the UK, even though the exchange rate has now started to weaken.At the same time there are also now clearer signs of overall slowdown in our own economy. Theevidence for this is less obvious in the backwards-looking economic and monetary data than it isin the forward-looking surveys, but even so the data suggest that we are beginning to see aneasing of pressure, including an easing of pressure in the labour market. And the surveysthemselves now point to a slowdown in service sector growth, including retail distribution, aswell as a sharper decline in manufacturing output.This prospect is consistent with the reports which we receive directly from the Bank’s network ofregional agents and their 7000-odd industrial and commercial contacts around the country.Of course we pay very careful attention to this forward-looking evidence of developments in theeconomy alongside the data, and, like others, we have revised down our forecasts for outputgrowth and inflation. And we have eased monetary policy quite sharply in the past two months,in the light of that evidence.Our current best guess - published in last week’s Inflation Report is that, after the interest ratecuts, the growth of overall output next year will be around 1%, picking up through theMillennium to around trend in the second half of the year 2000. Meanwhile, we expectunderlying inflation to remain close to the target rate of 21/2% - though perhaps a little abovethat rate during the course of next year. Now no-one likes to see the economy slowing down, butsome slowdown was necessary at this point in the economic cycle in order to avoid aninflationary upsurge. And if in fact it proves to be as mild as most of the forecasts - including ourown - suggest, it will be a huge improvement on anything we have seen at this stage in the cyclefor decades.
- 4 -BIS Review   98/1998It is true of course that the economy may turn out to be weaker than in our central projection.That projection is the MPC’s very carefully considered view as to the most probable outcome,but there is considerable uncertainty around it; and the risks are somewhat more on the downthan on the upside. We don’t have a crystal ball. And we don’t pretend to know at all preciselyjust how things will in fact turn out - that’s why we publish our forecasts in the form of a fanwith a wide range of uncertainty around the central case. The people to watch out for in this fieldare those who do claim to know precisely. What we have to do, in actually operating monetarypolicy is to monitor all the relevant evidence as it emerges for signs that the economy is provingto be either stronger or weaker than we expect, and modify our view of the prospect forinflation - and our monetary policy - in the light of that. And in that context I repeat theassurance, which I gave recently to the TUC in Blackpool, that we will act symmetrically. Wewill be - have been - just as rigorous in reducing interest rates with the overall evidence pointingto the balance of risks to inflation on the downside, as we have been - and will again be - inraising rates with the evidence pointing to a significant or sustained overshoot of the inflationtarget.Now there are those - perhaps even one or two of you here this evening - who regard thisassurance as cold comfort. It misses the point - they say - because the present approach tomonetary policy focuses too narrowly on inflation. What we want - they say - is a monetarypolicy which puts more emphasis on growth and employment. You hear this complaint not justin this country but increasingly these days in Continental Europe. I must say, President, that itleaves me totally bemused.What it suggests is that growth and price stability are seen as alternatives - you can have a bitmore of one if you’re prepared to accept a bit less of the other. I must confess that I thought thedebate had advanced beyond that point and that we really had learned from bitter experience thatthere is no trade-off of this sort. In anything other than the short term you can’t have one withoutthe other.We’ve tried all too often in the past to increase the growth rate of the economy simply bypumping up demand - without sufficient regard to the underlying, supply-side, capacity of theeconomy to meet that demand. The result, repeatedly was inflationary boom followed byinevitable bust, and this repeated experience itself engendered a pervasive and damaging short-termism, in both industrial and financial business behaviour. That simply made the positionworse next time around. What we - and the Bundesbank, and the ECB in future - have to try todo is to keep overall demand growing broadly in balance with the underlying supply-sidecapacity of the economy, aiming to dampen rather than aggravate the economic cycle; andconsistent price stability - certainly not falling prices but not accelerating price increases either -is the measure of our success in achieving that broader objective over time. The debate is notabout the ends, it is about the means. Price stability has never to my mind been simply an end initself - it would be a pretty dry and unsatisfying objective if that were all that we were about. Thewhole point about price stability - even when, as now, it involves a temporary slowdown in thegrowth of activity - is that it is a necessary condition for the sustainable growth of activity andemployment and rising living standards, which are of course the truly good things of life, andwhich we surely all want to see. That is, I think, what we have seen over recent years.
BIS Review   97/1998Mr. Duisenberg elucidates the European System of Central Banks’ stability-oriented monetarypolicy strategySpeech by the President of the European Central Bank, Dr. W.F. Duisenberg, at the Institute ofEuropean Affairs in Dublin on 10/11/98.1. IntroductionOn January 1 - in only fifty-two days - Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) willcommence. A single monetary policy will be adopted for the entire euro area - a continent-wide zoneof eleven sovereign states and almost 300 million people.The advent of the euro offers great opportunities for Europe and Europeans. Transaction costs willbe reduced. Pricing will become more transparent between European countries, encouraging greatercompetition and innovation in goods and financial markets. A truly single market will be created.Above all, though, Monetary Union offers a unique opportunity to establish and maintain pricestability throughout the eleven countries that will comprise the euro area from 1 January 1999. I amconvinced that by meeting the Treaty mandate and fulfilling the unambiguous commitment of theGoverning Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintaining price stability we shallensure that the single monetary policy makes the greatest possible contribution towards raising thestandard of living of Europe’s citizens and improving growth and employment prospects. Pricestability, consequently, is at the core of the “stability culture” that we are creating in Europe.Today, I should like to describe how we intend to meet our primary objective in the unique - andpotentially difficult - circumstances attending the birth of the euro. At the heart of our approach isthe “stability-oriented monetary policy strategy” recently adopted by the Governing Council andannounced to the public last month.First and foremost, this monetary policy strategy is designed to ensure that the Governing Council ispresented with the information it requires to make effective monetary policy decisions. The Councilmust act in a forward-looking and pre-emptive manner, changing interest rates to containinflationary or deflationary pressures before such trends become entrenched.Monetary policy is most effective when it is credible, that is, when the public is convinced thatmonetary policy will successfully maintain price stability over the medium term. Indeed, aside fromenjoying your Irish hospitality, bolstering this conviction is the main purpose of my speech.Reassuring you and the wider public of the Governing Council’s commitment to price stability - andthereby building up the credibility of our new “stability-oriented monetary policy strategy” - will notonly make my own job easier over the coming years. It will also increase the overall benefits ofmaintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole.Speeches such as this are important. They illustrate the commitment of the European System ofCentral Banks (ESCB) to openness and accountability in its decision-making. Openness andaccountability are necessary complements to the independence of the ESCB, on which the credibilityof the single monetary policy rests. Moreover, the monetary policy strategy must be clear andtransparent so that there is no confusion or ambiguity about the objective of monetary policy andhow this objective will be achieved.To this end, the ESCB’s stability-oriented strategy has been designed and presented in a verystraightforward, realistic and, if I may say so, honest way. These features are central to clarity andtransparency. They complement the many other efforts we have made - and will continue to make -
- 2 -BIS Review   97/1998to ensure that our communication with the public is open and transparent. Statements will bereleased and press conferences, including question and answer sessions, will be held immediatelyfollowing Governing Council meetings. Regular monthly publications will be produced by the ECB.Discussion papers and technical analysis by the ECB staff will be published for professional reviewand scientific assessment. In all these regards, the ESCB is exceeding the reporting requirements laiddown in the Maastricht Treaty, which are already among the most stringent applicable to any centralbank.Furthermore, in these articles and other presentations, we shall address various economic issuesfacing Europe, not least the issue of the high level of unemployment. In doing so, we shall make thebest possible use of the knowledge of experts throughout the ESCB and ensure that this expertise isavailable to the wider public and the policy-making community.In this context, let me emphasise that the Governing Council of the ECB is very concerned about theunacceptably high rate of unemployment in the euro area. However, an inflationary monetary policywould not solve Europe’s serious unemployment problem. On the contrary, an inflationary policywould not only unacceptably flout the Maastricht Treaty; a Treaty, let me remind you, that has beenratified by all the Member States of the European Union and endorsed by the public in referenda inseveral countries, including Ireland. An inflationary monetary policy would almost certainly lead tohigher unemployment in the medium run, as long-term interest rates would rise and the benefits ofprice stability would be lost. Such a policy would therefore be entirely counterproductive. Let me bevery clear: in the interest of all European citizens, the Governing Council is determined to protectprice stability. The ESCB’s independence is a means to facilitate the achievement of this goal. Onlyby preserving price stability and thereby creating the stable environment required for continuedhigher employment and growth, can the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) serve the publicand address the public’s understandable concerns.In describing the ESCB’s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy today, I shall emphasise thetwin principles of clarity and transparency that are vital in order to establish the credibility - andtherefore ensure the success - of the single monetary policy.Monetary Union is a unique event. It is likely to prompt considerable changes in economicbehaviour and the institutional structure. These changes will be to the benefit of Europe’s citizens,not least as the benefits of price stability are reaped. Nonetheless the inevitable and not totallyunpredictable changes in behaviour prompted by the introduction of the euro create uncertainty. Thisuncertainty will complicate the task of implementing the single monetary policy.Against this background, the ECB Governing Council has chosen a distinct monetary policy strategy,one that reflects the special circumstances that it faces at present. Given a natural desire to build onthe success of national central banks in bringing inflation down to its current low level during theconvergence process, the strategy ensures as much continuity as possible with the existing strategiesof the national central banks (NCBs) of the participating Member States. Nevertheless, the chosenstrategy takes into account to the extent necessary the unique situation created by the transition toMonetary Union.I shall proceed by describing the three main elements of the stability-oriented strategy. First, I shalldiscuss the quantitative definition of the ESCB’s primary objective, namely price stability. Second, Ishall outline the prominent role played by money in the overall strategy. Third, I shall describe theanalysis of a wide range of other financial and economic indicators that will enter the policydiscussion. Finally, I shall conclude by arguing that the stability-oriented strategy adopted by the
- 3 -BIS Review   97/1998ESCB is, in the present circumstances, both clearer and more transparent than any of thealternatives. In consequence, I am confident of its future success.2. The quantitative definition of price stabilityThe Maastricht Treaty assigns the ESCB the primary objective of maintaining price stability. In theinterest of accountability, the Governing Council of the ECB has decided to publish a quantitativedefinition of price stability, against which its success in fulfilling the Treaty’s mandate can besensibly judged by the public.In this context, at its October meeting the Governing Council of the ECB agreed that “price stabilityshall be defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) forthe euro area of below 2%”.In this way, the Governing Council has clearly and unambiguously defined its objective. If and whenwe do not meet this objective, we are obliged to explain why this is the case and what we are goingto do about it. Let me emphasise the over-riding priority we attach to this objective. This priority isnot only a consequence of our legal obligations under the Treaty. It is also rooted in our belief –supported by both decades of experience and a substantial body of theoretical and empiricalresearch – that maintaining price stability in the euro area is a pre-requisite for a sustainable andlasting improvement in the standard of living of Europe’s citizens and can lay the foundation forimproving growth and employment prospects in the future.The definition we have published is clear. In particular, a specific price index is identified withwhich to assess the maintenance of price stability. The HICP for the euro area was chosen because itis both sufficiently harmonised across the different countries of the euro area at the start of StageThree and consistent with the public’s usual focus on consumer prices.Using the index “for the euro area” highlights that euro area-wide developments, instead of specificnational or regional factors, will be the only determinants of decisions regarding the single monetarypolicy.As I have emphasised in the past, this definition signals the aversion of the Governing Council toboth inflation and deflation. The phrase “below 2%” clearly delineates the rate of inflation in theHICP deemed consistent with price stability. The wording “year-on-year increases” implies thatdecreases in the HICP - that is to say deflation in the measured price index - would not be consideredconsistent with price stability.The Governing Council also announced that “price stability is to be maintained over the mediumterm”. In doing so, it realistically acknowledged that disturbances to the price level can occur in theshort run - for example, those caused by changes in indirect taxes or commodity prices - that cannotbe controlled by monetary policy of the ESCB. Such factors may lead to occasional falls in theHICP, or occasional increases above 2%. These are quite normal and consistent with a meaningfuldefinition of price stability. By focusing on the medium term, the ESCB’s monetary policy willensure that these transitory deviations from the definition do not become sustained over the mediumterm.By maintaining price stability over the medium term, the appropriate forward-looking and medium-term orientation is imparted to monetary policy. This will ensure that policy reactions to threats toprice stability are measured and deliberate. Such actions will not introduce unnecessary instability oruncertainty into the economy, while nevertheless ensuring that price stability - and the attendantbenefits - are maintained.
- 4 -BIS Review   97/1998The prominent role of money in the ESCB’s monetary policy strategyLet me now turn to the role money will play in the ESCB’s stability-oriented monetary policystrategy.Ultimately, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. Assigning a prominent role to money within theoverall stability-oriented strategy therefore guarantees that the monetary origins of inflation will notbe neglected in the regular economic and financial analysis driving monetary policy decisions.Moreover, money is a visible “nominal anchor” for monetary policy that will help to stabilise thepublic’s medium-term inflation expectations, enhancing the credibility and effectiveness of monetarypolicy.To signal the prominent role attached to money, the Governing Council of the ECB will announce aquantitative reference value for monetary growth. In this regard, some commentators have assumedthat the ESCB has adopted a conventional monetary target, but simply called it by a different name.However, before announcing a formal intermediate monetary target, certain conditions have to bemet. These requirements have been met in the past in several euro area countries, and successfulmonetary targeting strategies have been pursued. However, one must recognise that, at present, theevidence as to whether these technical preconditions will be satisfied for the euro area as a whole inStage Three is inevitably sparse. Monetary Union will cause changes in the financial system andeconomic behaviour, as ten different currency zones are merged into the single euro area. As Imentioned in my introduction, most of these changes will be of great benefit to individuals and firmsin Europe. However, these behavioural and institutional changes are likely to change the relationshipbetween money, interest rates and prices that has been observed in the past.Consequently, a realistic alternative to a monetary target - that is, the reference value for monetarygrowth - will be announced. As I mentioned earlier, this reference value ensures as far as possiblecontinuity with successful monetary strategies pursued in the euro area in the past. Nevertheless, it isa different approach that reflects the special circumstances facing the ESCB at the start of StageThree.This reference value will have two key features:• first, it will be derived in a manner that is clearly  consistent with - and serves the purpose of -price  stability;• second, it will be constructed such that, in the absence of  special factors or other distortions,deviations of monetary  growth from the reference value will signal risks to price  stability.The relationship between actual monetary growth and the pre-announced reference value willtherefore be regularly and thoroughly analysed by the Governing Council. Where deviations occur,an explanation will be sought. If this explanation points towards a threat to price stability, monetarypolicy will react appropriately in order to address this threat. However, in contrast to the reactionthat would normally follow under a conventional monetary targeting regime, interest rates will notbe changed in an attempt to correct deviations of money growth from the reference value over theshort term.The Governing Council would not wish to react in a mechanistic fashion to monetary developments,precisely because the signals implied by the money data could be scrambled by the technicaluncertainties I have mentioned. By announcing a reference value and openly explaining how it willbe used, the Governing Council is presenting its monetary policy strategy to the public in a way thatreflects the manner in which it discusses policy itself. This is the essence of transparency.
- 5 -BIS Review   97/1998A number of issues remain to be finalised with regard to the quantitative reference value formonetary growth. First, the broad monetary aggregate for which the reference value will beannounced has to be defined. Second, the reference value for monetary growth for 1999 will have tobe derived and published. Progress on these two important issues is well under way and I anticipate afinal announcement by the Governing Council in December.1. A broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments in the euro areaAlthough the monetary data contain information vital to monetary policy-making, monetarydevelopments alone will not, of course, constitute a complete summary of all the economicinformation necessary to enable appropriate policy decisions to be taken. In the ESCB’s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, money is accorded a prominent - but not an exclusive - role.There is a clear need for the Governing Council to look at a wide range of other economic andfinancial indicators. Consequently, in parallel with the analysis of monetary growth in relation to thereference value, a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks toprice stability in the euro area will also be undertaken. This assessment will systematically analyseall the other information about the economic and financial situation, ensuring that the GoverningCouncil is as well-informed as possible when making its monetary policy decisions.Outside the ESCB, some commentators have labelled this broadly-based assessment an “inflationforecast”. Failure to publish “the” inflation forecast is seen by some as contrary to the principle oftransparency. I am afraid that both views are flawed. Allow me to explain why.While it is true that accurate forecasts can contribute to the success of an appropriately forward-looking monetary policy, the ESCB should not be judged on, or held accountable for, the accuracy ofits internal forecasts. Rather, its performance in maintaining price stability in the medium termshould be used by the public to judge the success of the ESCB’s policies. Consequently, thepublication of a forecast is only important in so far as it helps to achieve price stability throughincreasing the clarity and transparency of the policy-making process. In this regard, there are someimportant problems with publishing a single “official inflation forecast”.Relying on a single forecast that attempts to summarise all the information available from a widerange of indicators would be misguided. The Governing Council will not wish to be presented with asingle number to which it will have to react mechanistically, if at all. In contrast, the GoverningCouncil will want to know the economic reasons behind the projected risks to price stability. Theappropriate monetary policy response to a threat to price stability will depend on the nature of thethreat. The Governing Council can only understand the nature of the risk if it is presented with a fullset of data. From these data, it can attempt - with the help of various staff analyses - to identify thenature of the disturbance to price stability. Having identified the threat, an appropriate policyresponse can be selected and implemented.Even with the best intentions, making an inflation forecast requires numerous subjective judgementsabout developments in the economy. Adjustments will need to be made to forecasts to allow for thebehavioural and institutional changes caused by the transition to Stage Three. Even purely“model-based” forecasts reflect the preferences of those who constructed the models. Against thisbackground, publishing an inflation forecast would obscure rather than clarify what the GoverningCouncil is actually doing. The public would be presented with a single number intended tosummarise a thorough and comprehensive analysis of a wide range of indicator variables. However,such a summary would inevitably be simplistic. Moreover, because publishing a single inflation
- 6 -BIS Review   97/1998forecast would be likely to suggest that monetary policy reacts mechanistically to this forecast,publication might mislead the public and therefore run counter to the principle of clarity.The publication of an inflation forecast might be problematic in other ways. If the ESCB were topublish a projection based on the assumption of unchanged interest rates, then, when inflationary ordeflationary pressures arose, the projection might be interpreted as suggesting that price stability isactually in jeopardy. However, this would be very misleading. The Governing Council of the ECB isfully committed to the maintenance of price stability according to its published definition and wouldchange monetary policy in order to address and contain the threat to price stability. However, thepublication of the forecast itself might introduce an independent destabilising effect into privateinflation expectations, inadvertently undermining the credibility of the single monetary policy,making price stability harder to maintain and reducing the overall benefits of doing so. As I havesaid in the past, under certain circumstances the publication of the inflation forecast itself may leadto some form of implicit indexation of wages, imparting a costly self-sustaining momentum to suchforecasts.If the ESCB were to publish an inflation forecast that incorporated the effects of its policy changes,rather than assuming that monetary policy was unchanged, then it would inevitably forecast pricestability over the medium term. This follows from the unambiguous commitment of the GoverningCouncil to meeting its primary objective of maintaining price stability. Publishing such a forecastmight be reassuring, but it would not be very informative.Clearly, the Governing Council could have decided to announce some form of inflation forecast andjustify policy decisions by reference to it. Interest rate increases or decreases could then be explainedon the basis that the inflation forecast pointed to threats to price stability. However, this presentationof monetary strategy to the public is likely to involve a circular argument. For example, interest rateincreases would be justified on the basis that the inflation forecast pointed to an inflation rate higherthan that consistent with price stability. However, critical observers might soon argue that theinflation forecast was above the target precisely because there was a perceived need to raise interestrates. Simply publishing a forecast does not explain why interest rates need to be changed.Moreover, as I have said, simply presenting a forecast to the public does not explain how theconclusion that a rate rise is required has been reached. On both grounds, publishing the forecastdoes not enhance the transparency and clarity of the strategy.The strategy we have chosen at the ESCB avoids this danger. Based on this strategy, the GoverningCouncil will inform the public regularly of its assessment of the monetary, economic and financialsituation in the euro area. Moreover, when policy decisions are made, the reasoning behind specificdecisions - including the economic rationale according to which judgements have been made - willbe communicated to the public. By presenting the analysis that is actually driving the policydecisions, the ESCB is being both clear - since this analysis is informative about policy changes -and transparent - since the presentation to the public will reflect the type of discussion I expect tooccur in the Governing Council itself.2. ConclusionIn the present circumstances, the Governing Council has decided that following any mechanicalpolicy rule to determine monetary policy in the euro area would be inappropriate. Putting “all oureggs in one basket” would be especially dangerous at the start of Stage Three, given the uncertaintiesthat we face. Indeed, a mechanistic approach is unlikely to produce good policy decisions under anycircumstances. To pretend otherwise to the public would be misleading and dangerous.
- 7 -BIS Review   97/1998Nevertheless, the ESCB’s monetary policy strategy must be clear and transparent if we are toconvince the public of our commitment to maintaining price stability and our ability to do so. Wemust be seen to be operating in a solid and coherent framework that leads to consistent and effectivemonetary policy decisions.The stability-oriented monetary policy strategy adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB offersjust such a framework. Having been designed to respect the principles of clarity and transparency, Iam confident that this strategy will be successful. By maintaining price stability in the euro area, theESCB will thus lay part of the necessary foundation for Europe’s future economic stability andprosperity.
BIS Review   97/1998Bank of Japan’s November report of recent economic and financial developments in JapanBANK OF JAPAN, COMMUNICATION, 17/11/98.The Bank’s View1Japan’s economic conditions still continue to deteriorate.With respect to final demand, public investment orders have increased significantly. Net exports(exports minus imports) seem to be basically on an upward trend. Business fixed investment,however, has been declining under increasingly severe conditions for firms’ fund-raising. Housinginvestment has also declined further. In addition, private consumption has shown some weakness.Against this background of weak final demand, production has been reduced substantially. As aresult, inventories are decreasing, but the ratio of inventory to sales remains high due to sluggishshipments. With the decline in expenditure and production, corporate profits continue to worsen, andemployee income is decreasing. Employment and income conditions have deteriorated as the ratio ofjob offers to applications has recorded a historical low and the unemployment rate remains at a highlevel.As the above indicates, there remain continued negative interactions of production, income, andexpenditure. In addition, there is a growing concern among firms for fund availability toward theends of the calendar year and the fiscal year, given the increasingly cautious lending stance offinancial institutions and the mounting difficulty in fund-raising in the capital market.With the effects of the comprehensive economic stimulus package and the recent monetary easing,the deterioration of the economy is expected to moderate gradually. Nevertheless, the economy ishardly expected to recover immediately, judged from the strong negative interactions and theconstraints from corporate finance mentioned above. Moreover, the appreciation of the yen sinceearly autumn may exert pressures on corporate profits for the latter half of the fiscal year, and thereis a growing uncertainty in financial and economic developments overseas. These additional factorsalso need careful monitoring. In the above circumstances, a new legal framework to rebuild thestability of the financial system was established in October. It is desirable that, based on thisframework, banks’ capital base should soon be strengthened sufficiently to restore marketconfidence. Furthermore, the government is planning to launch emergency economic measures bythe middle of November. The materialization of these measures and their effects on corporate andhousehold sentiment should be carefully monitored.With regard to prices, wholesale prices are on a downtrend reflecting the continued expansion in theoutput gap. Corporate service prices are weakening further, and consumer prices have fallen belowthe previous year’s level. Given the persistently strong negative interactions of production, income,and expenditure, the expansion in the output gap is unlikely to cease despite the expected effects ofthe comprehensive economic stimulus package. Furthermore, the continued decline in wages and theappreciation of the yen since early autumn will exert downward pressure on prices. Hence, thedecline in prices, especially in wholesale prices, may somewhat accelerate in the future.In the financial markets, interest rates on Euro-yen deposits maturing after the year-end rose after themiddle of October. This is partly because Japanese financial institutions––facing the intensifiedseverity in raising foreign currency funds as reflected in the expansion of the Japan premium––haveraised yen funds vigorously to turn over the funds to foreign banks in exchange for foreign                                                     1 The Bank’s view on recent economic and financial developments, determined by the Policy Board at theMonetary Policy Meeting held on November 13, as the basis of monetary policy decisions.
- 2 -BIS Review   97/1998currencies. Meanwhile, Treasury bill (TB) rates lowered close to zero with an increase of TBpurchase by foreign banks that had raised yen funds at very low rates.The interest rate differential between Euro-yen deposits and TBs expanded considerably in parallelwith the heightened market concern over Japanese banks’ foreign currency liquidity risk at the year-end. Recently, however, the anxiety about worldwide credit crunch, which had once intensified ininternational financial markets, appears to be alleviated, and Japanese banks have shownconsiderable progress in raising foreign currency funds.Stock prices have rebounded slightly, reflecting favorable market sentiments toward the enactmentof laws aiming to stabilize and revitalize Japan’s financial system and the movement of business tie-ups and restructuring in the financial industry. However, looking at the recent development of bondand stock markets as a whole, market participants seem to remain cautious over the outlook of theeconomy.With regard to corporate finance, firms are further seeking to secure ample on-hand liquidity.Reflecting such increase in credit demand, the growth rate in M2+CD continued to show a slightincrease in September.Meanwhile, Japanese private banks have taken more cautious attitude in extending loans, facingsevere fund-raising environments and deteriorating business conditions of borrower companies.Particularly as the year-end nears, their cautious lending attitude seems to be adversely affecting notonly small and medium-sized firms but also large ones.In commercial paper and corporate bond markets, issuance rate differentials are further expandingacross firms according to their creditworthiness. The development of severe corporate financialconditions toward the year-end and their influence on the economy continue to warrant carefulmonitoring.
BIS Review   95/1998Mr. Carse looks at the importance of the euro for Hong Kong   Speech by theDeputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr. David Carse, at a Seminaron the euro, held in Hong Kong on 9/11/98.IntroductionLadies and gentlemen,I am very pleased to be here this morning to speak at this seminar on the euroorganized by the Vocational Training Council in conjunction with the British Consulate-Generaland the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers. With the introduction of the euro less than two monthsaway, this is obviously a good time to hold such a seminar. It is also fitting to hold it in HongKong where our fixed exchange rate system gives us a natural sympathy for its logical extension,the single currency. We are fortunate to have a number of experts on the euro here today to giveus the benefit of their views, including my former colleague from the Bank of England, JohnTownend.My role in the seminar is to say a few words on the importance of the euro forHong Kong. I will also take the opportunity to brief you on some of the regulatory steps whichwe have been taking to prepare for the euro.The introduction of the euro is a truly momentous change in the global economicand financial landscape. It is not simply a change of currency for the participating countries,though that in itself is a major event. Rather, it is a crucial step in the economic and monetaryintegration of the European Union (“EU”) countries and the creation of the single market. Thischange will involve 300 million consumers, 16% of world GDP and 29% of world trade. Thisdemonstrates why the euro is an important event for Hong Kong. As the UK Chancellor of theExchequer recently made clear, we are now living in a global economy, in which each economycan directly affect the prospects of every other. Where the economy concerned is the size of theEU, its potential to affect other economies - for good or bad - is without question.This is reinforced by the existing trade and financial links between Hong Kongand the EU countries:• the EU ranks 3rd among Hong Kong’s trading partners in the world;• in the first eight months of this year, the EU accounted for HK$245 billion or13.2% of Hong Kong’s total trade - much of this represents entrepot tradebetween the EU and mainland China;• the EU is the largest external investor in Hong Kong, accounting for overHK$200 billion or 34% of the total;• more than 700 EU companies use Hong Kong as regional headquarters orregional offices;• the EU is the 2nd largest source of visitors and 4th largest source of touristearnings for Hong Kong;• there are over 50 licensed banks and other authorized institutions in HongKong from the EU countries, the largest concentration in Asia.
- 2 -BIS Review   95/1998Clearly, what happens in the EU matters to Hong Kong. What therefore will bethe impact of the euro on the participating countries? There should certainly be a number ofeconomic benefits, including in particular:• a huge increase in transparency from the single currency which will make iteasier to compare prices across national frontiers. This will boost competition,bring down costs and prices, and improve efficiency;• a reduction in transaction costs, in particular from the elimination of foreignexchange commissions. This will encourage trade and cross-border investmentflows;• lower interest rates in individual countries from the elimination from theforeign exchange risk premium. This will reduce financing costs and stimulateinvestment and output;• the development of larger and more liquid debt and stock markets across theeuro zone. This will create a vast new pool of capital for companies, thusgiving a further stimulus to investment;• tighter fiscal discipline on the member countries under the Stability andGrowth Pact and monetary discipline exercised by the new European CentralBank. Both these should ease inflationary expectations and produce a morestable financial environment for the euro zone.In summary, the single currency should be able to deliver higher economic growthand therefore increased demand for imports by the euro countries. As one of the EU’s majortrading partners, this should benefit Hong Kong. Hong Kong may also be able to take advantageof the increased flow of funds for global investment which may be forthcoming from a greatlyenlarged European capital market. Furthermore, to the extent that an offshore euro marketdevelops, Hong Kong would be an obvious location for this in Asia. This reflects the existinglarge presence of European banks in Hong Kong and our role as a bridge between Europe andmainland China. Finally, Hong Kong is one of the world’s largest holders of foreign exchangereserves and the euro will provide interesting opportunities for diversification of our portfolio.Of course, the advent of the single currency also brings with it certain risks. Thediscipline imposed by the single currency will not always be comfortable, particularly when thebusiness cycles diverge in different member countries. This could set up tensions which could atworst lead to a break-up of monetary union or at least undermine confidence in the euro. Thecurrent dispute between politicians and the European Central Bank over interest rate policymight be a foretaste of what is to come. A break-up of monetary union seems highly unlikely, butthe potential for internal wrangling is clearly there and that could be disruptive to world financialmarkets.There must also be at least a possibility that closer integration of the EU couldmake it more self-contained and inward-looking. Intra-EU trade could increase, while that withthe rest of the world and Hong Kong could diminish. Moreover, will the enlarged EU capitalmarket suck in capital from Asia to Europe? In the first four months of this year, for example,
- 3 -BIS Review   95/1998Japanese net purchases of European securities totalled US$9.9 billion, while net sales of bondsand stocks in Asia totalled US$2.1 billion. Extended diversion of capital to Europe wouldundermine Asia’s growth prospects as well as Hong Kong’s position as an international financialcentre. This could also happen if the European banks are tempted to consolidate their business inAsia to focus their efforts on their enlarged home market.This is not the occasion to be pessimistic. Overall, I believe that the euro will be agood thing for Europe and for the world economy. But as with any major change in the worldfinancial architecture, Hong Kong will need to monitor developments closely and respondquickly to emerging threats as well as opportunities.Let me now turn to the HKMA’s regulatory response to the euro in Hong Kong.First, banks in Hong Kong need to be prepared to handle and account for the euro, particularlyduring the awkward transitional period before the legacy currencies disappear entirely. If they arenot ready, many of the potential benefits of the euro for Hong Kong will simply not materialize.We have therefore issued advice to the banks on the steps that they need to take, such as: reviewof business strategies and business processes that might be affected by the Euro; review of nostroaccounts in the legacy currencies; adaptation of information systems; and review of contracts thatmight be affected by introduction of the euro.Secondly, we have thought it sensible to introduce legislation that will provide forcontinuity of contracts in relation to the introduction of the euro. In doing so, we are followingthe example of the EU itself as well as some other jurisdictions. In theory, such legislation maybe unnecessary since the well-established “lex monetae” or “law of the currency” principlemeans that the currency of a payment obligation should be determined by the law of the countryof that currency. This means for example that a payment obligation payable in French francswould become payable in euros after the introduction of the euro because that is the situation thatapplies under the law of France.However, despite this general principle, concerns have been expressed that partiesto contracts might argue that the introduction of the euro represented a fundamental change ofcircumstances, bringing the contract to an end or requiring its terms to be adjusted. In addition,another feature of the introduction of the euro is that it will replace the ECU at a rate of one forone on 1 January 1999. The ECU is a currency basket but not a currency in its own right. The“lex monetae” principle does not apply in this case and therefore the euro will not automaticallysubstitute for the ECU in contracts.It is to remove uncertainty on these points that we have decided to legislate. Webelieve that this is appropriate for an international financial centre such as Hong Kong. Thefinancial and legal community in Hong Kong strongly supports this view.This is just one specific example of how Hong Kong is affected by theintroduction of the euro. There will undoubtedly be more far-reaching effects on our economyand our financial system as the single currency takes root. This is why this seminar is timely andimportant. I hope that you will find it enjoyable and useful.
BIS Review   95/1998Mr. Chon reports on recent economic trends in Korea and the Bank ofKorea’s monetary policy response to them   Speech by the Governor of the Bank of Korea,Mr. Chol-Hwan Chon, at a press conference hosted by the Seoul Foreign Correspondents Club inSeoul on 4/11/98.I - Introduction…I am very pleased to be with you today to talk about the recent economicdevelopments in Korea.Nowadays almost all countries around the world have become closely linked toeach other in a global information community, owing to the rapid advances intelecommunications. The advisory role and influence that the international press exercises overthe economic development of any one country have correspondingly increased. You yourselvesas foreign correspondents in Korea have shown keen interest and provided valuable advice,admonition and encouragement in our attempts to defuse the crisis that broke out a year ago.We are most grateful. So, let me take this opportunity to voice my sincere thanksto you all. And I hope that today’s meeting, although all too brief, will help you gain a clearerunderstanding of the Korean economy today and the thrust of monetary policy in the future.II - Recent Economic Trends in KoreaReal EconomyFirst, let us look at the recent performance of the Korean economy.As you know, we have been going through serious hardships. Domestic demand interms of both consumption and investment has been deeply depressed by the shock of thecurrency crisis and the effects of structural adjustment.Exports have also been sluggish mainly because of the severely subdued demandin our major markets, including Japan and Southeast Asian countries.GDP growth for the first half of this year was down sharply to -5.3 per cent asagainst the 4.9 per cent of the latter half of the previous year. Viewed by quarter, the secondquarter’s growth rate slid further to -6.6 per cent from -3.9 per cent in the first quarter. GDPstatistics for the third quarter have not been compiled yet, but indicators related to production,consumption and investment remained subdued.Unemployment rose to 7.3 per cent in this September from 3.1 per cent at the endof last year, as the economic recession deepened and firms downsized in the process ofrestructuring.And the number of unemployed shot up dramatically to 1.6 million in September,which was more than three times as many as the half million a year before.Consumer prices had risen steeply in the period from last December to thisFebruary, affected by the massive depreciation of the Korean won. But they have held broadlysteady since this March. This can be put down to the stable movements of the exchange rate andinternational raw material prices, along with the depressed domestic demand.
- 2 -BIS Review   95/1998Turning to the current account, we have seen a swing from a deficit of 8 billiondollars in 1997 to a large surplus of some 31 billion dollars for the first three quarters of thisyear.Much of this improvement, though, must be attributed to the sharp reduction inimports, brought about by the subdued domestic demand, which has more than offset the effectof the decline in exports.Foreign Exchange and Financial MarketsNow let us move on to the foreign exchange and financial markets.Helped by the large surplus on the current account and the conversion of most ofthe outstanding short-term foreign debt of financial institutions to long-term obligations, theforeign exchange market has stabilized substantially. Usable foreign exchange reserves rose to 45billion dollars at the end of this October, which was above the year-end target level of 41 billiondollars agreed as a conditionality element of the IMF’s standby arrangements.Since mid-March, the exchange rate has regained stability, moving in a range ofsome 1,300 to 1,400 won per US dollar.Total foreign debt, as defined by the IMF standard, has also been reduced by 4billion dollars since the end of last year. It stood at 151 billion dollars at the end of this August,thanks largely to the considerable contraction in the foreign liabilities of the financial and privatesectors. Moreover, the environment for the rollover of outstanding borrowings by Koreanfinancial institutions has become markedly more favorable in the international financial markets.Fresh foreign borrowings, though, are still not so easy.In step with the improved foreign exchange market conditions, the Bank of Koreahas steadily reduced its market intervention rate from a high of around the 35 per cent level inDecember 1997 to its current 7 per cent. This has brought about a matching decline in marketinterest rates, particularly since it cut its repo rate by 1 per centage point on September 30. Theovernight call rate is running at a level of 7 per cent and the long-term interest rate in terms ofyields on corporate bonds is at the 10 per cent level, both lower than prior to the outbreak of thecurrency crisis.Turning to money supply, the Bank of Korea has essentially maintained a stablemonetary policy stance. But, when necessary, it has been prepared to respond flexibly in order,for instance, to soothe financial market instability that might arise in the course of corporate andfinancial sector restructuring. As a result of the authority’s focus on stability, at the end ofSeptember, reserve money reached 22 trillion won, which was somewhat below the IMF’sindicative limit. And the growth rate of M3 has slowed smoothly from 15.9 per cent in lastDecember to 14.0 per cent this August.As financial markets have regained stability, the incidence of corporate failureshas declined gradually. From this March onwards, the per centage of bills and checks dishonored,which had shot up to 1.49 per cent toward the end of last year, has constantly receded. Recently ithas been running at around the 0.3 per cent level. The monthly numbers for corporateinsolvencies have shown a sharp decrease, from 151 this January to 42 this September.
- 3 -BIS Review   95/1998Having said this, I must point out that the credit crunch has not yet eased.Financial institutions are very prudent in lending to firms, mainly because of the heightenedcredit risk of enterprises in the course of structural adjustment. Their need to maintain acceptableBIS capital adequacy ratios is also, in part, a factor. Accordingly, most small and mediumenterprises, which mainly rely on indirect financing from banks, have been going through seriousfinancial difficulties.III - Monetary Policy ResponseExpected Economic EnvironmentBefore I explain the thrust of monetary policy in the future, let me first sketch outthe expected economic environment. The recession will be prolonged into the fourth quarter dueto the ongoing slackness of private consumption and investment demand, and the substantialslowing of export growth. Although the current account is likely to continue to run a surplusduring the fourth quarter, its scale will be somewhat reduced.Meanwhile, consumer prices seem likely to continue the stable trend ofmovements they have maintained since this March.In the foreign exchange market, the favorable supply-demand conjuncture will besustained thanks to the continuing current account surplus and inflows of foreign capital bothfrom inward foreign direct investment and the proceeds of overseas disposal of corporate assets.Consequently, the foreign exchange rate should continue to move within a stable range for thetime being. However, there are potential factors making for exchange rate instability includingthe unrest in emerging markets, such as Russia and Latin American countries.The overall demand for funds in Korean financial markets is unlikely to be largegiven the deep-seated economic recession. Nevertheless the steady worsening of the cash flow ofenterprises will add to the demand for working capital.So far this year, the burden that maintaining the BIS capital adequacy ratio placeson financial institutions’ management has been eased through the injection of public funds andthe disposal of non-performing loans. However, no major expansion of their lending is foreseenin the near future, due to the persistently high credit risk of enterprises.The Thrust of Monetary PolicyAlthough structural adjustment is never without pain, a deep and prolongeddepression could erode the country’s industrial base and sap Korea’s growth potential.Therefore, the emphasis of future monetary policy is being placed on preventingfurther contraction of the real economy and on promoting structural adjustment.First, the Bank of Korea will maintain a policy stance favoring the stability ofinterest rates in order to encourage the recovery of the real sector, insofar as this does not conflictwith sustaining foreign exchange market stability. Seen in this context, the recent substantialreduction of market interest rates and banks’ lending rates will contribute to relieving thefinancial expenses of the corporate sector, and to restoring consumer and investment confidence.
- 4 -BIS Review   95/1998So far this year, banks have not reduced their lending rates in keeping with thedecline in market interest rates. However, the overall cost of their funds has come down with theshare of outstanding high-cost deposits declining as well as the rapid reduction in rates on newdeposits.Thus there would seem to be greater scope for them to lower their lending rates.Second, while maintaining the stable stance required under the agreement with theIMF and this year’s inflation target, the Bank of Korea will manage market liquidity in a flexiblemanner, closely watching financial market conditions. Action might be required, hypotheticallyspeaking, should interest rates rise to unacceptably high levels in response to the large-scale issueof government bonds, or if there were fears of bottlenecks in the flow of funds, or financialsystem instability in the process of structural adjustment.Third, and most importantly, we intend to take such initiatives as may be neededto solve the credit crunch that continues to bear so heavily on firms in a situation where they areunable to access funds smoothly, despite the ample liquidity in the financial sector.In this context, we will do all we can to encourage banks to expand their lendingto small and medium enterprises by strengthening incentives. In this connection, we are nowconsidering a change of allocation standards for individual bank quotas under the aggregatecredit ceiling, to put more emphasis on lending performance to small and medium enterprises.IV - Concluding RemarksThe Korean economy is now placed in an extremely difficult situation, whereprevious experience and received wisdom provide little guidance. However, all economic actorsfully realize that in order to tackle the problems which led to the crisis, there is no alternativeother than swift and intensive structural adjustment. And we are now resolutely and patientlyfitting the blocks carefully together to build a sound new economy.The Bank of Korea will do its utmost to support this structural adjustment, whilemaintaining monetary stability. Of course, to some foreigners, Korea’s structural adjustment mayappear inadequate or incomplete in some aspects.But may I ask you as informed commentators on the Korean economy to haveconfidence in our resolute determination to carry out thoroughgoing structural adjustment. Yourcounsel and advice in this process will be greatly appreciated.
BIS Review   93/1998Mr. Stals discusses the current economic situation and factors influencingmonetary policy in South Africa in 1999   Address by the Governor of the South AfricanReserve Bank, Dr. C. Stals, at an International Conference arranged by ABN AMRO Bank andKagiso Financial Services, held in Johannesburg, on 3/11/98.1. Domestic economy dominated by international developmentsDuring the past six months the South African economic scene was dominated bydevelopments in the international financial markets. The East Asian financial market crisis,which already started with pressures in Thailand’s foreign exchange market in June 1997, tooksome time before it spread to other emerging markets outside of the East Asian region, and alsoto the smaller industrial countries of the world. More recently, financial markets in majorindustrial countries also became contaminated.In the case of South Africa, the contamination took place through thedisinvestment of foreign funds from the South African Bond Exchange. During the first fourmonths of 1998, non-residents increased their holdings of South African bonds by R16.3 billion.During the next five months, from May to September 1998, they reduced their holdings of SouthAfrican bonds by R22.4 billion. This major switch was directly linked to a reassessment made byforeign investors during April/May 1998 of their investment positions, and the decision to reducetheir exposure in fixed-interest bonds of the emerging market economies.It is interesting to note that non-residents continued to increase their investment inSouth African equities. After increasing their investment in South African shares acquiredthrough the Johannesburg Stock Exchange by R19.4 billion in the first four months of 1998, theyadded a further R17.3 billion during the following five months. The reversal in the investmenttrend on the Bond Exchange was, however, sufficient to change drastically the outlook for theSouth African economy, and some promising economic developments in the first quarter of thisyear were promptly aborted.2. Adverse financial developments lead the downward trend in the economyThe sudden switch of foreign investors’ sentiments had far-reaching effects in theSouth African financial markets:• The immediate effect of the withdrawal of investment funds from the BondExchange was a sudden and sharp increase in the yield on long-term bonds.The average monthly yield on long-term government bonds rose from 12.9 percent in April 1998 to 18.3 per cent in September.• The withdrawal of foreign investments created pressure in the foreignexchange market and the average effective exchange rate of the rand against abasket of currencies depreciated by 21.4 per cent from 22 May 1998 to 31August 1998, to bring the cumulative decline in the external value of the randfrom the end of last year to 24.6 per cent.• The depreciation of the exchange rate encouraged further capital outflows inthe form of negative “leads and lags”, and also led to speculative positionstaken against a further depreciation of the rand. In the end, a net outflow ofmore than R13 billion in the form of private sector short-term capital exertedadditional pressure in the foreign exchange market.
- 2 -BIS Review   93/1998• The outflow of capital reduced liquidity in the banking sector and forced thebanks to borrow more from the Reserve Bank on a day-to-day basis. Theestimated daily liquidity needs of the banks increased from about R2 billion atthe beginning of May to more than R13 billion in early June 1998.• Other interest rates followed the yield on long-term government bonds on itsstrong upward surge. The rate for repurchase transactions from the ReserveBank increased from 14.78 per cent on 12 May 1998 to 24 per cent on 22 June1998, before it settled early in July at a level just above 21 per cent. Bankinginstitutions raised their prime overdraft rate from 18.25 per cent at the end ofApril 1998 to 25.5 per cent on 28 August 1998.• In order to provide liquidity to the drained foreign exchange market, theReserve Bank drew about R8 billion on foreign loan facilities and increased itsoutstanding hedge facilities in respect of future international balance ofpayments commitments from US$ 17.5 billion at the end of April 1998 toUS$ 25.3 billion at the end of June 1998.• Having risen by 32.3 per cent from December 1997 to an all-time high in May1998, the average monthly level of share prices listed on the JohannesburgStock Exchange declined by 38.7 per cent between May to September 1998.Although the financial conditions started to stabilise again in early July 1998, thesituation remained extremely sensitive throughout the next three months, up to September 1998.Exchange rates, yields and interest rates and share prices reacted to rumours, speculativetransactions and adverse international developments, and most of the financial aggregatesshowed great volatility.3. Adverse financial conditions brought negative developments in real economic activityThe adverse developments in the financial markets had a negative effect on analready fragile real domestic economy. The GDP growth rate remained subdued at a level of½ per cent in the first two quarters of this year. All indications are that it became more subduedin the third quarter, and there may even have been some decline in the level of total production.A much smaller decline in inventories during the second quarter of this yearcaused some improvement in the level of gross domestic expenditure from the first quarter. Totaldomestic final demand, however, declined marginally to a rate of expansion of 3 per cent in thesecond quarter. Indications are that the expansion in demand may have been maintained at thislevel throughout the third quarter.The current account of the balance of payments recently also showed the strains ofthe adverse international conditions. The main reason for a substantial weakening in the currentaccount balance from the first two quarters of 1998 into the third quarter lay with anunexpectedly sharp rise in total imports whereas total exports, at least in volume terms, declinedfrom the second to the third quarter.As could have been expected after the depreciation of the rand, inflation movedupwards. The rate of increase in consumer prices measured over a twelve-month period increasedfrom 5.0 per cent in April 1998 to 9.1 per cent in September, and the rate of increase in theoverall producer price index rose from 2.3 per cent in March 1998 to 4.3 per cent in September.
- 3 -BIS Review   93/1998In this environment, the rates of increase in bank credit extension and in themoney supply remained on a high level. Together with the external strains, the situation forced avery restrictive monetary policy approach on the Reserve Bank in order to restore overallfinancial stability to the South African financial markets.The overall South African economy is now going through a cycle that is led verystrongly by developments in the financial markets. The recent decline in real economic activitywas directly caused by the adverse developments in global financial conditions. The East Asiancrisis had started already in the middle of 1997, but had a delayed effect on the South Africanfinancial markets, which deteriorated badly, particularly during the second quarter of this year.Trends in the real economy followed the downward trend in the financial markets with but ashort time lag.4. More stable conditions return to financial marketsAlthough the underlying conditions in the South African financial markets hadalready become more stable in early July, conditions started to improve noticeably only in lateSeptember and early October. Just as the initial negative impact on South Africa was closelylinked to adverse developments in the international financial markets, the recent recovery alsofollowed an improvement in international financial conditions that gained momentum during andafter the 1998 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.The improvement in the South African financial market conditions was reflectedin:• A decline in the net sales of South African bonds by non-residents. The netoutflow in October declined to less than R1 billion and was the smallest forthe past six months.• An easing in the overall liquidity position of banking institutions. The totalliquidity requirement at month-ends declined from R12.2 billion in June toR7.2 billion in September and R5.9 billion in October.• A decline in long and short-term interest rates. The yield on long-termgovernment bonds declined from 20.09 per cent on 28 August 1998 to below16 per cent at this stage. The rate on repurchase transactions from the ReserveBank declined from 21.85 per cent on 13 October to 20.45 per cent today.Banking institutions reduced their prime overdraft and mortgage lending ratesby 1 full percentage point during the past few weeks.• An appreciation of the rand from the very low level reached in July. Duringthe month of October the average effective exchange rate of the randappreciated by 3.9 per cent to reduce the cumulative depreciation since thebeginning of the year to about 17½ per cent.• A significant slowdown during September 1998 in the rates of growth of boththe M3 money supply and bank credit extended to the private sector.Conditions in the financial market will hopefully continue to improve further andto lead real economic activity into recovery in the course of the current business cycle. The recentimprovements in the South African financial market conditions should therefore hopefully leadto an improvement in real economic activity, and particularly in gross domestic production,during the course of next year.5. What monetary policy must take into account for 1999
- 4 -BIS Review   93/1998The tight monetary conditions, high interest rates and restrictive monetary policyin 1998 were forced on South Africa by adverse developments in the international financialmarkets. In the situation, monetary policy had to carry a heavy burden in restoring financialstability to the South African financial markets. Unpopular measures, such as a reduction in bankliquidity and high interest rates, had to be embraced in order to avoid more serious problems,such as a foreign reserves crisis, or a breakdown in the banking system.Provided the encouraging recent trends towards greater stability in theinternational financial markets continues, monetary conditions in South Africa should alsogradually become easier. From the point of view of real economic activity this is, of course, amost desirable development at this stage.There are a number of reasons why any deliberate actions taken by the monetaryauthorities to relax monetary policy should be implemented with caution.Firstly, not all problems in the international markets have been resolved. Theworld is still holding its breath on the vulnerable situation of the Japanese banking and financialsystems; Brazil is still lingering on the edge of a dangerous cliff with its international financialrelations; weaknesses recently surfaced in the financial markets of a few industrial centres; andthe secondary effects of the financial market crisis are only gradually filtering through in theform of a decline in global real economic growth.Secondly, the recent financial turmoil left the South African scene with a fewadditional scars that need time to heal. The depreciation of the rand forced inflation to a higherlevel and even more out of line with the rest of the world; the weakening of the current accountof the balance of payments in the third quarter provides a further warning for caution; a monetarystimulation may easily increase demand without increasing production; and the continuing lowlevel of the country’s official foreign reserves do not provide much scope for manoeuvringunless large foreign capital inflows will again supplement the supply of foreign exchange.Structural deficiencies in the South African economy that restrict the country’seconomic growth potential to a relatively low level place an almost permanent obligation onmonetary policy to remain relatively restrictive. A relaxation of monetary policy would normallystimulate demand and, unless production responds flexibly and quickly to increases inexpenditure, monetary stimulation is inclined to lead either to an unsustainable overall balance ofpayments deficit and/or an unacceptably high rate of inflation. The monetary policy targets in theGovernment’s Strategy for Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) cannot be achievedunless all the other goals for structural adjustment are also achieved at the same time.In view of the depressed real economic situation in the country at this stage, thereis, however, some room for a responsible relaxation of monetary policy, provided theinternational and domestic financial conditions continue to improve further. The Reserve Bankwill move cautiously with and not against any improvement in the underlying conditions, andwill allow market forces to exert normal pressures on important prices such as the exchange rateand domestic interest rates.
BIS Review   91/1998Mr. Hartmann’s welcoming remarks at the Year 2000 meeting in FrankfurtWelcoming remarks by Wendelin Hartmann, a member of the Directorate of the DeutscheBundesbank and Chairman of the G-10 Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS),at the Year 2000 meeting of the European central banks and financial regulators organised by theJoint Year 2000 Council and the Deutsche Bundesbank in Frankfurt/Main on 30/10/98.Ladies and gentlemen, On the occasion of a regional conference of the Joint Year2000 Council, I warmly welcome you here to Frankfurt. As chairman of the CPSS and a memberof the Joint Year 2000 Council it is an honour and a pleasure for me to act as host to thisdistinguished audience. Thank you all for coming to Frankfurt from Europe, Israel and TheUnited States. I wish you a pleasant stay on the Main, and I hope our meeting gives us theopportunity not only to gain new insights but also to produce some useful results that may helpus to meet the enormous challenges that still lie before us.Joint Year 2000 CouncilIn April 1998, the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee onPayment and Settlement Systems, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors and theInternational Organization of Securities Commissions announced the formation of the Joint Year2000 Council. The sponsors´ decision was motivated by their recognition of the severity of thechallenges posed by the century-date change and of the potentially grave implications for thefinancial markets associated with a lack of readiness.The Joint Year 2000 Council views its main task as being that of ensuring a highlevel of attention to the Year 2000 challenge within the global financial supervisors´ community.At a number of regional meetings - of which this Frankfurt conference is one - financial marketregulators and supervisors from both within and outside Europe have an opportunity to sharestrategies and experiences, to discuss possible contingency measures and establish contacts withnational and international private sector initiatives. The first regional event took place in Sydneyfor the Asia-Pacific region in mid-October. The present Frankfurt meeting gathers regulators andsupervisors from all over Europe. Further conferences are to be held in Miami for The Americas,in Riyadh for the Middle East, and in Pretoria for the African continent.The programme of our conference today includes three panel discussions. Thefirst one, on “the challenges to the private and public sector relating to Y2K problem”, addressesYear 2000 issues in a more general manner, whereas the second on “remediation and testing”,and the third, on “contingency planning” treat specific aspects related to Y2K. In a finalsummary panel we will try to find an answer to the question: “Where do we go from here?”(Good question, indeed.)A press conference will take place after the first panel at 10.30 am. Our Joint Year2000 Council chairman, Mr Roger W. Ferguson Jr, Member of the Board of Directors, FedWashington, and I are going to present the Year 2000 problem and its implications for the globalfinancial markets via all media to a - hopefully - broad public.Around 12:30 you will be invited to lunch here at the hotel. Mr Edgar Meister,Member of the Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank and chairman of the Banking SupervisionCommittee of the European Central Bank, is going to give a luncheon address.Scope and impact of the Year 2000 problem
- 2 -BIS Review  91/1998Although generally well known, it has to be repeated: the cause of the Year 2000computer problem is ridiculously simple. In the days when computer memory was scarce,programmers got into the frugal habit of using only two digits to write a date, so that 1998 wasrepresented as 98. But, as 99 is a higher number than 00, millions of computers simply cannotplace the year 2000. Instead, they may read the first year of the new millennium as the first yearof the century, or as a date that does not exist. Even if they pass that test, they still may fail tonotice that 2000, unlike most centennial years, is a leap year. Thus, at the century-date change -or even before - a large number of computer systems, software programs and embedded chipdevices currently used will produce errors or will malfunction – unless the date or program logicis modified. With regard to embedded processors, any operation that functions using data-sensitive technology may be affected, be it medical pacemakers, heating systems, electricity ortransportation.For financial market participants, the Year 2000 problem is especially acute. Sincefinancial institutions rely heavily on automation to manage information, it will be difficult oreven impossible to conduct business if automated applications fail to work properly. Given thenumber and complexity of the date-dependent computerprograms in use, the remediation effortwill often have to be colossal.The interdependence of the world’s markets and economies makes the Year 2000risk a true global problem and perhaps the biggest challenge ever faced by the world’s financialindustry. Difficulties are bound to arise in every region across the globe, and could have adverse(if temporary) economic effects. Unless resolute steps are taken to resolve the Year 2000 issuesin all parts of the world, serious consequences are inevitable.The Bundesbank’s preparation for Y2KAlthough you may get a different impression from recent media reports, inGermany preparation for the century-datechange is in full swing and not at all behind theprogress in other Western European countries. Let me describe briefly the activities in thefinancial sector, seen from a central banker’s perspective.The Bundesbank - like other EU central banks - is confronted with the Y2Kproblem in many respects. Internal preparatory work for the Year 2000 change started in goodtime. The Bank’s management set July 1, 1999 as the deadline for making all affected systemsand technical devices year-2000-proof. By that date, all computer-infrastructure facilities(systems and networks) and data-processing application procedures will be available in testedyear 2000-proof versions. An earlier date is not possible, because conversion work for StageThree of European monetary union is to be completed as a priority. In this context, by the way, alot of preparatory work, mainly in applications for accounting and payment systems, willautomatically be included with respect to Y2K.With regard to the context of national payment and settlement systems, however,the Bundesbank acts as a key service provider but also as a central co-ordinator for cashlesspayments. The Bank’s clearing facilities offer all credit institutions involved in payments acompetitively neutral payment service for settling large-value and retail payments. Naturally, wehave a strong interest in the smooth functioning of our IT- infrastructure. So I am happy to tellyou that the Bundesbank has created a test environment for its public and private clients that isalready in use.  In the area of large-value payments as in the other procedures of electronic
- 3 -BIS Review   91/1998access, the Bundesbank is offering interface tests for verifying year-2000-compatibility ininterbank settlements. The electronic access test-centers are also available for the tests.Customers and software manufacturers can make direct arrangements with the relevant testcenter for the tests to be conducted. In the field of retail payments, the Bundesbank, as theprimary “interface”, provides its customers with the year-2000-compatible processing ofpayment data. It will also ensure that its data-processing procedures are robust enough, shouldindividual customer systems fail to operate in a year-2000-compatible manner.As you all know, the Bundesbank is responsible for monetary policy in Germanytill the end of this year, but will also continue to form part of the banking supervision authorityafter the start of Stage Three of European monetary union. In his luncheon address, my colleagueMr Edgar Meister, who is in charge of the Bundesbank´s Banking Supervision Department, andchairman of the ECB-Committee on this subject, is going to outline the Bank’s actions in thatfield in detail.Co-ordination with other institutions’ activitiesThe Bundesbank is not only a part of the financial sector, but also a fiscal agentfor the government. At the administrative level, the Bank isworking closely with other officialinstitutions to ensure the year-2000-compatibility of public authorities. The activities of thepublic financial sector are managed by the Ministry of Finance. In June 1998, a “Year 2000Forum” was called into being by the German banking and insurance supervisory authorities, theBundesbank and private banking associations as a platform for regulators and official and privatecredit institutions to exchange their views and experiences.The government activities relating to the Y2K challenge as a whole are being co-ordinated by the Ministry of Economics. In this position, the ministry is also overseeing thepreparatory activities of the industrial sector in Germany. Special attention is being given to thereadiness of core infrastructure providers because of their major significance for economicactivity in general. In particular, given the financial sector’s heavy dependence ontelecommunications, water, energy and transportation, any failure to meet the Year 2000challenge in any of these sectors could lead to serious disruptions at the national andinternational levels. In addition to that, it would probably adversely affect all contingency plansof the entire economy. As you know, our latest Joint Year 2000 Council Bulletin also focuses onthis matter, and I hope that we will have an opportunity to attract public attention in this respectat the forthcoming press conference.Preparations at the European levelAt the European level, the Bundesbank, being a member of the ESCB, is takingpart in the activities of the ECB to ensure the Year-2000-compliance of ESCB-wide systems andapplications. The necessity for the ECB and the ESCB to give EMU top priority poses anadditional challenge to their activities in connection with Y2K. However, all the new paymentand accounting systems which will be implemented next year will be Y2K-proof, so that itshould be possible to cope with the remaining challenges during 1999.In operational terms, the newly developed large-value-payment system TARGETis going to function by joining together the 15 EU central banks´ existing real-time grosssettlement (RTGS) systems, using what is known as the Interlinking System. S.W.I.F.T. is beingused as the carrier for the „Interlinking System” , S.W.I.F.T. is therefore going to assume even
- 4 -BIS Review  91/1998greater technical responsibility. That will mainly include ensuring steady and trouble-freeoperation - in particular, we are relying on S.W.I.F.T. having a firm grip on the Year 2000challenge. This will be ensured by a joint task force of several central banks under the directionof the National Bank of Belgium. As S.W.I.F.T. is the main service-provider world-wide for thefinancial industry, a smooth transition to the next millennium is of paramount importance to usall.Since our schedule today only allows me the time to make a few welcomingremarks, I don’t want to make a short story long. I hope that we will all work successfullytogether at this conference, and thereby contribute to minimising the Year 2000 risk.
BIS Review   91/1998Mr. Stals discusses the importance of credit extension for macroeconomicfinancial stability   Address by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr. ChrisStals, at a Breakfast Meeting of the Institute of Credit Management in Johannesburg on 29/10/98.1. A “credit” economyModern economies are often described as “credit-based” economies. This is a truereflection of the functioning of modern, sophisticated economies in which money plays theimportant part as a means of exchange, as an instrument of payments and as a store of value.The availability and the use of credit facilitates the exchange of goods andservices, the production processes and the growing importance in all modern economies offinancial services. One can hardly visualize a modern economy that works without credit.The normal characteristic of credit is that one participant in the economy, be it anindividual, a corporate body or a governmental institution, denies himself the immediate use ofpurchasing power already in his possession, and makes this purchasing power on a temporarybasis available to another participant in the economy who has an immediate need for the use ofthe purchasing power. This kind of transfer of purchasing power from savers (the lenders) tousers (borrowers) will never create macroeconomic distortions in the economy. On the contrary,as already mentioned, it supports maximum economic growth and development in the country.This basic form of credit extension encouraged the development over many yearsof financial savings institutions, financial intermediaries, institutional investors, fund managers,etc. that serve as useful conduits for transferring purchasing power from savers to users, eitherfor consumption or for real or financial investment purposes. The financial authorities in allcountries have a responsibility to oversee these financial institutions, mainly with the intention ofprotecting the general public, be they lenders or borrowers, against exploitation that may lead toan unreasonably low remuneration for savers, exorbitantly high costs for borrowers and/orfinancial losses for both.Together with the development of these specialised financial intermediariesfinancial markets emerged where the transfer of savings from lenders to borrowers can take placein a more competitive environment with greater transparency and more general participation.These markets, such as the stock exchanges, bond markets, markets for derivatives andshort-term money markets play a very important part in the optimum allocation of scarceresources in modern economies. Financial authorities also have a vested interest in overseeingthese financial markets to ensure orderly conditions, the effective and efficient transfer of fundsfrom borrowers to lenders and the maintenance of orderly and stable conditions in the markets.A further development in this process of the transfer of purchasing power fromsavers to users of funds, took place with the development of cross-border or internationaltransfers of purchasing power. Savers in the more mature economies of the world where thedemand for purchasing power is relatively low, found it increasingly attractive to make loans tothe less-developed economies where they could earn much higher interest rates. Thesecross-border movement of funds introduced a new dimension in the credit extension process, inthe form of exchange rates for foreign currency transfers. The financial authorities of individualcountries now obtained more than just an overseeing function in the credit extension process.Rightly or wrongly, governments were in the past seen to be responsible for the fixing of the
- 2 -BIS Review  91/1998exchange rate, and for ensuring that convertibility of national currencies into other currencieswill at all times be possible.There is one further form of credit extension that has become of vital importancefor macroeconomic financial management, and that is the extension of bank credit thatsimultaneously also creates money. Banks are not normal financial intermediaries that acceptfunds from savers and then make loans out of these funds to borrowers. Banks can create moneyto make loans, and in the process can increase the total purchasing power in the economy.In summary, therefore, the presence of credit facilities, financed out of normalsavings, is an essential and necessary element of all modern economies. The financial authoritiesshould have no more than an overseeing function in the management, organisation and internaladministration of the whole process of credit extension. As far as both financial intermediariesand financial markets are concerned, the authorities should restrict their intervention to thecreation of a protective and transparent legal and accounting framework within which institutionsand markets can function effectively.However, the financial authorities have more than just an overseeing functionwhen it comes to international credit extension activities, and to the creation of money bybanking institutions.2. Bank credit extensionExcessive bank credit extension lay behind many of the global financial problemsof recent times. In a number of the East Asian countries, controls on banking institutions wererather lax and enabled them to increase their total credit to governments and private sectorborrowers by substantial amounts over a protracted period of time. In the process, interest rateswere kept artificially low and banks on an increasing scale relied on foreign borrowings tosupplement their liquidity base for the continuing expansion of total credit.In the end, when foreign investors became reluctant to continue to provide theliquidity base for the credit extension by the banks, the financial systems crumbled. In summary,the final collapse was forced by:• A withdrawal of foreign deposits from banks and of foreign portfolioinvestments from the capital markets of the affected countries.• Foreign credit previously extended to the East Asian countries was thereforewithdrawn.• A reduction in the amount of liquidity available within banking institutions asthey lost foreign deposits and had to fund the withdrawal of other investmentsfrom the capital markets.• Forced reductions in the amount of credit banking institutions could makeavailable to their clients, many of whom were overborrowed and could notmeet the demand for the repayment of loans.• An unavoidable depreciation of exchange rates and sharp rises in interest rateswhich forced losses on borrowers of foreign and domestic funds.Overborrowed institutions were forced into liquidation, and in the processtransferred their losses to their lenders.
- 3 -BIS Review   91/1998The consequences of this credit crunch are now well-known. In many of the EastAsian countries, negative real economic growth rates are now experienced as painfulconsolidations and reforms of banking and financial structures are taking place.The East Asian financial crisis, which quickly spread to other emerging markets,to the smaller more stable developed economies of the world and recently also to major financialcentres such as New York provided a stark reminder of how important sound credit managementis for the protection of macroeconomic financial stability in individual countries, and in theworld at large.No country can procure permanent and sustainable economic growth at a highlevel if this growth is dependent on the creation of an increasing amount of credit, extended bybanking institutions. Not only lenders (banking institutions) and borrowers (private sectorinstitutions and individuals) can be destroyed in the process, but also total financial systems andeven total economies can break down under the burden of too much credit.Central banks have the unenviable task of judging at all times what amount ofadditional bank credit will in prevailing circumstances be reconcilable with the objective ofmaintaining overall financial stability. Economies normally provide early warning signals ofexcessive credit extension, such as rising inflation or unaffordable increases in imports, or thewithdrawal of foreign funds from the country. It is important not to ignore such signals.3. Other lessons from the global financial crisisThe recent turmoil in world financial markets provided important lessons, notonly for central bankers, but also for credit managers in private sector financial institutions. Thefollowing three lessons must have come to the notice of many a private sector financialinstitution:(i) Risk management models based on past experience or on rigid computerprogrammes do not necessarily provide adequate protection against potentiallosses in the new environment of financial globalisation. Experience anddiscretion cannot be replaced by models and machines.(ii) The value of collateral against credit extension can disappear overnight (videthe Russian example).(iii) Excessive leveraging must be avoided at all times, and particularly in thepresent environment of volatile global changes (vide the example of theLong-Term Capital Management Fund).Governments, central banks, market managers, private sector institutions andprivate individuals all have learned once again from this experience that the excessive use ofcredit sooner or later leads to disaster. At this juncture, the world economy is paying a high pricein the form of depressed growth for being reminded of these basic truths.4. Credit extension and the South African economyAlthough the South African economy was also severely affected by the currentworld financial crisis, a sound banking system, well-managed financial institutions and effectivefinancial markets protected the country against the almost total collapse of the economy, ashappened in a few other countries.
- 4 -BIS Review  91/1998The Reserve Bank has some concern, nevertheless, for the increasing use of bankcredit to maintain expenditure levels. The recent financial crisis forced exorbitantly high interestrates on the South African economy and borrowers of funds could not avoid sharp rises in thecost of servicing existing debts. The world financial crisis therefore hopefully also served as agrim warning to all South African borrowers and lenders that excessive debt positions should beavoided. Neither the Reserve Bank nor the Government can guarantee low interest rates oroverall financial protection in the new environment of a worldwide integration of financialmarkets.It will also be foolish for South Africa now to try to revive the domestic economyby creating an excessive amount of additional credit extended by banking institutions in a fragileglobal financial environment. Such a policy could easily lead South Africa also on the path ofoverall economic disaster, as more than one country in the rest of the world experienced over thepast year.5. ConclusionI believe that members of this Institute of Credit Management are aware of thepotent danger of excessive debt positions, be it for countries, governments or private sectorborrowers. The discipline of controlling this dangerous element of modern, sophisticated marketeconomies, is not a responsibility only of the central bank. It is not only a problem ofmacroeconomic policy, but also one for institutions operating at the micro-level. We can allmake a contribution towards protecting our country from falling in the debt trap of excessiveborrowing by applying sound principles in the management of our debt positions.
1BIS Review 132/1999Mr Clementi comments on the systemic aspects of the Basel proposalsSpeech given by Mr David Clementi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at a FinancialServices Authority Conference, held in London on 2 December 1999.*      *      *Ladies and Gentlemen,I am delighted to be given this opportunity to address you today. I must first express my admirationfor the pro-active and thorough way that the FSA is seeking views from the industry on theseimportant proposals. I know that as well as this conference, their efforts have encompassed briefingsessions, circulars to banks, advisory group meetings, and a dedicated website. There will no doubt bea few focus groups springing up in due course! The Bank of England is in turn holding regularmeetings with the main trade bodies, while various of the Basel Committees involved in developingthe proposals have conducted surveys and received presentations from banks and others. I hope that, atthe end of the process, if differences of opinion remain between the authorities and the bankingindustry, this will be the result of rational divergence between our different perspectives, and certainlynot through any failure of communication.I intend to direct my comments to the systemic aspects of the Basel proposals. The Bank has a closeinterest in this subject and I will start by outlining the relationship between the design of the regulatorysystem and the Bank’s core purposes. In promoting the stability and efficiency of the financial system,we favour capital charges based on more sensitive risk measures. Some argue that such measures areprocyclical and add to the vulnerability of the system as a whole. I will deal with this issue beforegoing on to discuss some features of the new proposals. In particular I will consider the pros and consof more complex rules, the use of internal ratings and the measurement of operational risks. I will endby looking beyond the current proposals at potential new chapters for the Basel Accord, including theharmonisation of provisioning policies and the development of capital charges for financialconglomerates.The role of the Bank of England in financial stabilityAs many of you may know, the Bank of England has three core purposes: first, to maintain theintegrity and value of the currency, generally referred to as our monetary policy objective; second, tomaintain the stability of the financial system, both domestic and international; and third, to ensure theeffectiveness of the UK’s financial services. The Bank’s monetary policy role is well known throughthe minutes of Monetary Policy Committee meetings and the quarterly publication of the InflationReport. But a similar transparency is pursued in relation to financial stability with the publicationsemi-annually of the Financial Stability Review.Our interest in the regulatory architecture most obviously stems from this second objective. Clearlyregulation of financial market participants is not the only means of ensuring such stability: a stablemacroeconomic environment, which is what our monetary policy objective is about, is a major factorin avoiding financial system dislocations, while the robustness of the market infrastructure, such aspayment and settlement systems, is also crucial.The design of the regulatory framework also has implications for the third objective, the effectivenessof UK financial services. There is a widespread view that greater stability can only be bought at thecost of reduced competition, meaning that these two objectives have to be weighed up against eachother and trade-offs made. I would suggest an alternative point of view, which is that these twoobjectives are often fundamentally aligned. An effective financial system is one in which funds flow to
BIS Review 132/19992the most productive projects, productivity being measured on the basis of long-term rewards and afteran appropriate discount for risk. But this is also a stable financial system. Put another way, short-termstability of a sort can be bought through over-regulation or protectionism. But in the longer term, thelikely result is an unprofitable industry focused on regulatory arbitrage rather than its prime business,with little instinct or incentive for assessing risks and rewards. It is noteworthy that there are numerousexamples of financial systems in emerging markets which have exhibited both fragility andinefficiency.At the Bank of England we do still consider that the stability of the financial system depends cruciallyon the stability of the banking system. Banks are at the heart of the payments system, they are theprincipal source of funds for many businesses, and they are an important savings medium for a largepart of the population. The regulatory framework in turn affects the behaviour of banks, making itessential to get it right. It needs to create both the right incentives, and establish the right level ofbuffer - in the form of capital - to protect the system. We fully support the Basel Committee’sobjective of updating the 1988 Accord to make it more comprehensive and risk sensitive. And as amember of the Basel Committee, the Bank is working alongside the FSA to ensure that theseobjectives are delivered.Importance of risk sensitive capital chargesI am aware that some commentators have questioned the aim of making the system reflect risk in amore differentiated way. One argument is that this will make capital charges procyclical, so thateconomic downturns or external shocks are amplified by the regulatory demand for higher capital.There is a concern that the consequences could be particularly severe in the case of lending toemerging markets, where rating changes have sometimes lagged the onset of crises.This is certainly a risk, and one which we have to take seriously. Clearly there could bemacroeconomic implications, both domestically and internationally, possibly on a systemic scale. Weare not sure, however, that the answer lies in making the framework less sensitive to risk, perhaps bysmoothing over bad news in some form, for example by ignoring or delaying recognition of ratingchanges. This would involve the same dangers that I recall from the days of hidden reserves in UKbanks, when the knowledge that unwelcome events could be hidden from view led occasionally to alack of rigorous risk assessment in business decisions. In fact, part of the underlying problem ofprocyclicality is that risks are not recognised early enough, in time to allow lenders to exert a moregradual and beneficial discipline on borrowers. The capital framework - and, equally important, bankprovisioning policies - need therefore to be as forward looking and dynamic as possible. Since ratings- whether external or internal - are influential in provisioning and will in the future be influential incapital, they in turn have to be more forward looking. This is why in the sovereign context we placeparticular emphasis on the importance of countries adhering to international transparency standards.No rating can be reliable without adequate information on the economic and financial situation of thecountry. The Basel paper does of course propose that compliance with the IMF’s Special DataDissemination Standard is a pre-condition of a lower risk weight.More generally, we have concluded that making the capital requirements more risk sensitive will helpensure that borrowers are charged a more appropriate price for their debt, and limit the build up ofunsustainable volumes of debt. This seems to us a better system than the current, extremelyrisk-insensitive framework of risk weights, where in the sovereign context nothing short of arescheduling results in any change in capital requirements for exposures to OECD sovereigns, whilefor non-OECD sovereigns the charges are completely invariant. It is worth noting here that a similarkind of argument applies in the context of public disclosure by banks, which is also one of the keyplanks of the proposed new Accord. There is a risk that in some circumstances there are drawbacksassociated with this, since disclosure could make a troubled bank’s position worse at a difficultmoment. But overall, we think the likely behavioural changes induced by greater transparency offermore benefits than risks. By this I mean that the prospect of having to disclose more about positions tothe market will reduce banks’ willingness to take on highly risky positions in the first place.
3BIS Review 132/1999Benefits and drawbacks of complexityA number of other commentators have questioned the effectiveness of introducing greater complexityinto the Basel rules, on the grounds that the framework will always be inadequate to cope withinnovation and arbitrage. It is certainly clear that a minimum capital framework, howeversophisticated, cannot on its own capture the full range of risks in a banking organisation. This has beenrecognised by the Basel Committee; it is the reason why the Consultative paper introduces thesupervisory review process for individual banks under Pillar 2 of the framework, as a complement tothe minimum capital standard laid down in Pillar 1. It is equally clear that supervisors, even armedwith powers to review the individual capital adequacy of banks under Pillar 2, may under somecircumstances be less effective than the market at disciplining risk taking, which again is why theBasel Committee is emphasising the importance of enhanced public disclosure under Pillar 3 of theAccord. But to my mind there is very considerable scope for improving the risk-sensitivity of theminimum capital standard before the benefits of this begin to be outweighed by the costs of greatercomplexity. Indeed, greater risk sensitivity ought in some respects to mean more simplicity in thecapital framework, achieved by aligning capital with a common underlying concept of risk, such asinternal or external ratings. Internal ratings indeed offer a very significant opportunity to bringregulatory measures of capital more into line with the economic measures established by industry bestpractice: in the absence of this, arbitrage of the system through securitisation and other means willremain a problem. The current review also offers the opportunity to iron out some of the existing,fairly arbitrary, quirks of the current Accord. For example, by identifying the common characteristicsand residual risks underlying various types of credit risk mitigation techniques - collateral, guarantees,netting, and credit derivatives - it is hoped that a more uniform and consistent treatment can be appliedto these instruments in place of the various, somewhat ad hoc, treatments that have grown up to date.There is perhaps one caveat that should be attached to the aim of introducing greater risk sensitivity.This is that it often entails much greater reliance on the judgement and competence of the supervisors.This can be seen in the evolution of the Basel Accord to encompass banks’ internal market riskmodels, if approved by supervisors, and in the new proposals to allow some banks’ internal ratings tobe used for credit risk capital. It is also evident in the emphasis on individual supervisory judgement inPillar 2 of the consultative paper. We believe this is the right direction to follow in the case of G10banks and supervisors. It is, however, more questionable whether such a system is easily exportableoutside the G10, in particular to some emerging markets. Indeed, even amongst the G10, somesupervisors (such as the US) are actively contemplating drawing a two or more tier distinction in thecapital rules applied to banks, depending on the level of complexity of the organisation. I entirelyagree with Howard Davies that it is essential that the Basel framework, if it is to remain a globalstandard, continues to encompass a menu of options which accommodate different needs.I also do not wish to gloss over the fact that there are some very knotty areas in the proposals that haveto be tackled before the Basel Committee can deliver on its objectives of greater risk sensitivity andcomprehensiveness. The FSA is today going to tackle four of the most difficult, namely credit riskmitigation, operational risk, internal ratings, and interest rate risk in the banking book. I would like totake this opportunity to make a few observations on those areas that are of particular interest to us.Use of internal credit ratingsThe Bank has, as some of you may know, been devoting considerable thought to development of theinternal ratings based approach to setting capital for credit risk. This is in part because we have beenable to utilise the expertise we have built up in the course of our work on credit risk modelling, onwhich the Bank and the FSA held a joint conference last year. But more importantly, it is also becausewe consider this part of the Basel proposals to be of the utmost importance to achieving a balancedand stable framework. In particular, the availability of this approach is a very important safety valvefor the market pressures and distortions that could otherwise arise from the use of external ratings. Imean no disrespect to the existing well-known rating agencies - indeed quite the contrary - when I saythat the last thing the regulators would want to see is a mushrooming of untried rating agencies allclamouring for “recognition” from supervisors. We have no wish to see the supervisory net extended,
BIS Review 132/19994by way of quasi-regulation, to rating agencies; nor do we wish to substitute regulatory judgements forthe very satisfactory investor discipline that currently operates in the ratings arena.I note that the EU Commission’s consultative paper on reforming the EU framework goes further thanthe Basel Committee’s and talks of designing an internal ratings based approach that could potentiallybe used by all banks, not just large sophisticated ones. This makes some sound sense, since, to mymind, banks should seriously question what value-added they are bringing to the credit intermediationprocess if they do not have a reasonably systematic mechanism for assessing and pricing borrowerrisk. There are indeed various ways that an internal ratings based approach could be designed, withvarying degrees of sophistication depending for instance on the number of “buckets” that are used,whether maturity is incorporated as an additional dimension, and whether the bank’s own internalestimates of loss-given-default are recognised, as well as simple default probability. We do not at thisstage have a strong view as to where along this spectrum of complexity the internal ratings approachshould be pitched. Several options need to be explored, including the possibility of offering a choice ofapproaches to supervisors, or an evolutionary framework whereby the system could develop insophistication over time. In principle, we would certainly like to see a system that a reasonably largenumber of banks could sensibly aspire to. There are only two caveats that I would make. First, ofcourse, there are the implications for supervisory resources if a very large population of banks have tohave their internal ratings systems approved. And secondly, even a simple framework has to observecertain minimum requirements. This means the ability to relate an internal rating to a quantifiableconcept, such as loss-given-default or default probability; the ability to demonstrate that thisrelationship is historically valid, or - in the likely absence of long runs of data - at least plausible; andthird, as I said before, a forward-looking dimension to the rating. Whilst the Bank of England is doingits best - I hope with some success - to help the economy avoid the booms and busts of previousdecades, banking is likely to remain a cyclical industry, and to my mind it would be simply imprudentto base ratings and capital on a borrower’s position at the top of an economic cycle.Operational riskUse of internal ratings will of course raise many of the sorts of difficulties for testing and validationthat were identified for credit risk modelling. However, we are at least talking about a reasonablywell-defined type of risk and one which is quantifiable in statistical terms. We are in much moredifficult territory when it comes to operational risk. The term operational risk covers a wide range oftypes and sources of risk, and banks’ data bases of loss are generally patchy. There are numerousquestions not only about the appropriate design of the charge, but also about the appropriate level. It isclear that some types of operational risk, such as fraud, can result in huge spikes of loss, as we saw inthe case of Barings and Morgan Grenfell. Even though we are concerned with protecting the system, Ifeel it would be inappropriate to expect most banks to hold an additional cushion of capital to coverthese sorts of very rare events: it would either be grossly excessive for most of the time, oralternatively seriously inadequate if a major problem arose. So the focus here must be on systems andcontrols, and on using variable target capital ratios under Pillar 2 to encourage improvements in these.Moreover, the appropriate level of capital will depend in part on how far we think operational lossesare correlated with other types of loss which are already covered by capital. Probably there are sometypes of operational loss - processing errors, settlement delays - which do not exhibit a highcorrelation with either credit or market risk. But in practice, there is clear evidence that credit ormarket losses put pressure on the firm, which can push managers into fraud or result inoperationally-risky cost cutting. There have certainly been occasions when operational losses haveonly been revealed because of a market downturn or similar event. As I heard it graphically expressedthe other day: “It is only when the tide goes out that you discover who is not wearing a bathingcostume”!I am optimistic that, over time, operational risk will become more measurable and that, as was the casefor market risk models, a consensus on methods of quantifying it will emerge. The Basel Committee’sframework will certainly have to be flexible in the face of this evolution. However, we should also notlose sight of the fact that the Committee’s announced aim is not just coverage of operational risks, but“other” risks more generally. Episodes of market turmoil over the past couple of years have
5BIS Review 132/1999demonstrated just how wide is the range of risks that are not currently explicitly covered by regulatorycapital; I would include under this heading market liquidity risk, individual bank liquidity risk,correlation risk between credit and market risks, and legal and reputational risk. These types of riskcan certainly produce systemic disruptions. My expectation would be that, even with further advanceson measuring operational and credit risk, most banks will want to carry a chunk of fairly undefinedcapital to cover rainy day events.Future challengesFinally, before I close, I would also like to stress that many challenges will remain for the BaselCommittee even after it has completed its current review of the Capital Accord. I have referred atvarious points to bank provisioning policies. This has traditionally been an area where internationallythere has been little attempt at harmonisation (except at the level of very broad principles). But thesystematic use of internal ratings by possibly quite a large part of the banking population will armsupervisors with valuable information about expected losses, and ought to focus attention on theadequacy of provisions to cover such losses. Indeed, more generally, the whole question of theappropriate accounting valuation framework for the banking book may have to be re-examined in thelight of any recommendations that come from the Joint Working Group of accounting standard settersthat is currently looking at accounting for financial instruments.Also looking to the future, the issue of recognising full scale portfolio credit risk modelling willinevitably resurface. The resulting recognition of diversification effects could result in quite a largereduction of capital for well-diversified banks - who are also of course in many cases the largest, mostsystemically significant banks. At this point we will have to think very hard about what level of capitalwe really feel comfortable with in our systemic organisations, and in particular whether an individualfirm’s capital requirement ought to reflect the systemic externalities it poses.And finally, with the rapid growth of banking sector M&A, and conglomerisation across businesses,there is undoubtedly more work to be done on the appropriate regulatory framework for mixed-activityfirms.In short, I believe there will be many future opportunities like today’s, in which we invite theconstructive input of industry participants.
1BIS Review 120/1999Mr Chon speaks on the topic ofrestructuring and monetary policy in KoreaSpeech given by Mr Chol-Hwan Chon, Governor of the Bank of Korea, to the European UnionChamber of Commerce in Korea, in Seoul on 12 October 1999.*      *      *It is a great pleasure for me to speak on the topic of “Restructuring and Monetary Policy” to embassystaff and businessmen from the EU, who are contributing so greatly to furthering the economiccooperation between Europe and Korea.The European Union opened up a new chapter in the history of the world economy this year with itssuccessful launch of a common currency, thereby creating a true single market and becoming a singleeconomic entity. Economic exchanges between Europe and Korea will become more dynamic thanksto the integration. In particular, more and more European companies are expected to enter Korea sinceit is opening up for foreign inward investment. Such investment will serve as a basis for furtherstrengthening the relationship between Europe and Korea.Prospects for the Korean economyBefore I launch myself into the topic, I would first like to give you a brief introduction to the Koreaneconomy and its prospects.The Korean economy, which recorded negative 5.8% growth last year due to the ramifications of theforeign exchange crisis, is now recovering at a considerable speed. The GDP growth rate stood at7.3% for the first half of this year and when the continuous increase of manufacturing andconsumption related indexes are taken into consideration, the growth rate for the whole of this year isforecast to be as high as 8.8%. Imports have increased but thanks to strong exports, Korea’s currentaccount is seen to continue in surplus this year, reaching about US$21 billion . The annual average risein the CPI is expected to be around the 1% level despite destabilizing factors such as the rapid growthof the economy and the international oil price hike.As is clearly illustrated by the GDP growth numbers, the Korean economy has rediscovered itsvitality. This is due to hard efforts by all participants in the Korean economy.The foreign currency crisis erupted in part because of some fault lines in the international financialarchitecture, but in retrospect, the structural problems of the Korean economy were the major cause.Based on this recognition, the Korean government is strongly pushing for restructuring measures toovercome fundamentally the frailties of the Korean economy that have surfaced in the wake of thefinancial crisis. The topic of my speech has been selected with this in mind.The role of the central bank in the restructuring processRather than explaining in great detail about Korea’s restructuring measures or their outcomes, I wouldlike to focus on how the central bank is contributing to the process through its monetary policy.The restructuring process requires both a micro and an administrative approach since it aims to reformindividual companies and financial institutions. Therefore government ministries in a position to draftand revise legislation, or those government agencies which oversee or monitor the detailedmanagement of financial institutions, should be in charge of the process. The central bank, on theother hand, faces natural limits on the extent to which it can share actively in the restructuring process.It conducts monetary policy based on the efficient workings of the market rather than onadministrative devices or legislation. Moreover, monetary policy influences economic entities as awhole rather than acting on individual institutions or businesses.
BIS Review 120/19992Despite these limitations, a central bank can contribute to the restructuring process within themonetary policy framework. There are four ways in which it may do so.1.Create a macroeconomic environment conducive to the restructuring processFirst, the central bank creates an economic environment which helps the successful implementation ofrestructuring measures.The economy needs some degree of dynamism if restructuring measures are to be implementedsmoothly.Looking back, most restructuring was carried out when the real economy had contracted due to theripple effects of a crisis. Korea is not the only country to experience negative growth after a crisis.Several countries which suffered a crisis in the 1990s including three Scandinavian countries, Mexico,Thailand and Malaysia all went through a period of negative growth lasting for one or two years.However, a deep economic downturn is likely to act as an obstacle to successful restructuring. If acompany or a financial institution is to improve its financial structure, it should pay back its debt byrealizing profits or increasing its capital through a public offering. During a recession, such attemptsdo not yield the desired outcomes.  Moreover, since job mobility decreases significantly in a recession,bold management rationalization which inevitably entails large-scale job shedding, is difficult to carryout.Another reason why a certain degree of economic vitality is necessary for successful rescheduling isrelated with the problem of the “black sheep” of the economy. When a specific sector clearly needsemergency surgery, but it is feared that there would be a heavy toll in terms of unemployment andfinancial market disturbance, then the government will be tempted to put off the operation, especiallywhen the economy is depressed. This sector will remain the “black sheep” of the economy for as longas the economy does not pull itself out of recession, gradually turning into a time-bomb for theeconomy as a whole. For example, if the Korean economy had not recovered this year, therestructuring of the Daewoo Group (a large chaebol some of whose interlinked companies have beenplaced under a workout program) and the problems involving investment trust companies - two majorissues which have come to the fore since July - might have remained under the surface with thepotential to cause even greater trouble in the future.This all leads to the conclusion that economic recovery is vital for the smooth implementation ofrestructuring measures. Having said this, we must bear in mind that if the economy recovers tooquickly and exuberantly, causing overheating, economic units may not feel the need to restructurethemselves.Too low interest rates choke off companies’ incentives to reduce their debt. With the improved cashflow, companies are lured into expanding their business. Also, financial institutions become lessinterested in clearing bad debt from their books since the opportunity cost of holding it decreases withlower interest rates.Another problem can spring up in the choice of monetary policy stance when inflationary pressuresbegin to rise due to an over-accommodating policy. In most cases, the period of restructuringcorresponds to a deflationary phase so that the central bank can ease monetary policy withoutworrying about inflation. However, if inflation raises its head before the restructuring has proceededvery far, the central bank may be in a position where it has to choose between price stabilization andmaintaining an environment favorable to the restructuring process. This is a dilemma for the centralbank because either choice will have negative effects. If the central bank, for example, adopts amonetary-tightening stance to fight inflation, then the short-term profitability of companies andfinancial institutions will deteriorate, which may blunt the momentum for restructuring. On the otherhand, if a relaxed monetary policy stance is maintained to keep restructuring on the road, prices riseand companies may once again turn to their debt-dependent, expansionary management style, whichran riot in the past. As a result, people will come to lose faith in restructuring itself.
3BIS Review 120/1999For successful restructuring, therefore, the economy must not be allowed to overheat nor should therecovery be less than adequate. Achieving a well-balanced, unbiased economic environment forsustainable growth creates the best condition for reform measures. In other words, the central bank hasto conduct monetary policy supportive of economic recovery, but subject to the constraint thatadequate discipline is exercised over economic entities so that they have their own incentives forchange. Such a policy, by its nature, does not attract the spotlights, but it is quite important in that itmay affect the final outcome of the restructuring measures.In this regard, the Bank of Korea has been steadily lowering interest rates since the second quarter of1998. As a result, the Korean economy is showing clear signs of recovery and on the basis of thesetrends, the restructuring process is well under way. However, in May 1999, the Bank decided against afurther lowering of the overnight call rate, which is its policy rate, taking the view that the economicrecovery was proceeding at a faster pace than expected, and that asset prices had risen sharply within ashort period.Recently, even though the economic recovery has been gaining greater momentum, the Bank of Koreahas maintained call rate unchanged, which implies that it takes a neutral position. The reasons behindthis decision are that no signs of imminent inflation are visible, and that the financial markets havebeen unsettled by the restructuring of the Daewoo Group.2.Supply liquidity to ensure financial market stabilitySecond, the central bank should supply liquidity flexibly in response to the financial market turmoilwhich may arise in the course of restructuring.It is quite common for the financial market to become destabilized during the process of structuraladjustment due to high credit risks and reduced trust among market participants. As a result, a creditcrunch may occur, which brings about a prolonged economic recession because financial institutionsand corporations may not be able to raise sufficient money for their normal operation. In addition,market participants favor the short-term end of the market. The consequent large pool of short-termfunds makes the movements of interest rates and stock prices extremely volatile, while financialinstitutions may become illiquid because of the short-term nature of their liabilities and the long-termnature of their assets.Admittedly, financial market unrest is unavoidable in the process of restructuring. However, if thedegree of unrest becomes so acute as to be insupportable, it may threaten to cut short reform itself.Therefore, the central bank, which is supposed to be responsible for stabilizing financial markets, cantake an active role by providing liquidity through open market operations.At the outset of the crisis, the Bank of Korea provided funds to stabilize the financial markets inresponse to market turbulence, and it induced banks to expand lending to small and mediumenterprises in order to ease the credit crunch whose effects were concentrated on them.A central bank can play a role as a lender of last resort in order to maintain financial market stability.However, the role of the lender of last resort must be carried out following strict rules, since a centralbank’s right to issue paper money can be easily abused and invite moral hazard on the part of financialinstitutions. First, the central bank must maintain “constructive ambiguity” to prevent individualfinancial institutions from becoming too dependent on it. This phrase means that although the centralbank is able to intervene in the market to insure financial stability, it must not give any assurance of abailout to individual financial institutions, whether covertly or overtly. Second, even if support isgiven to individual financial institutions, punitive rates or at least market interest rates must be appliedin order to avoid the exploitation of the interest rates differential. Lastly, an element of conditionalityincluding a resolute self-rescue plan must be clearly imposed and its performance closely monitoredby the central bank.
BIS Review 120/199943.Mediate structural adjustmentThird, the central bank may play the role of a mediator in the process of restructuring.There have been examples of some central banks mediating in debt rescheduling negotiation amonginterested parties. The Bank of England, for instance, was actively involved in corporate sectorrestructuring from the 1970s until quite recently upon the voluntary request of creditor banks. TheFederal Reserve System of the United States has also served as a mediator when cash-strappedfinancial institutions were on the brink of failure.There are many reasons why the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve System were able tomediate in the restructuring process. One of them, I believe, is that at that time they both undertook theresponsibilities of financial supervision. If a central bank supervises banks, it can accurately analyzetheir current business conditions and status. Moreover, it can also get easy access to information onindividual companies which borrow money from them. The central bank, therefore, can be an effectivemediator. In addition, the strong credibility arising from their carefully cultivated reputation forneutrality and fairness, may well have helped in reconciling the conflicting interests of the groupsinvolved.In the case of Korea, the relationships between financial institutions and enterprises, and thosebetween individual enterprises are closely intertwined. Therefore, structural reform in Korea cannot berestricted to one or the other specific sectors: rather, it should be very broadly based. This implies thatin Korea, perhaps more than in any other country, accurate analysis of financial institutions andenterprises is badly needed for successful restructuring.  However, since the revision of the relatedlegislation in April last year, the Bank of Korea can no longer supervise banks directly. Consequently,it is not easy for it to monitor and scrutinize the business conditions of individual banks andenterprises, making it hard for the Bank to serve as a mediator.4.Foster international cooperation to improve overseas confidenceLastly, the central bank can contribute to brightening the country’s external credibility by closelycooperating with international financial circles.Restructuring entails extensive friction and conflict on the domestic front. So if the process is toproceed smoothly, it is imperative to avoid extra turbulence stemming from international investorswho have large claims on Korea. This requires that international confidence in the country bemaintained at the existing level or, if possible, improved. To be sure, international credit ratings willbe upgraded with substantial progress in the reform drive, but it is also very important to reassureforeign investors and to keep them well posted as to the domestic economic situation. Towards thisend, international cooperation is necessary, and the central bank, I believe, is well suited for this job,in particular, on financial matters.A number of cooperative groupings linking central banks like BIS (Bank for InternationalSettlements), EMEAP (Executives’ Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central Banks) and SEACEN(South East Asian Central Banks) have already been set up. They allow governors and working levelofficials of the central banks ample opportunities to discuss current issues and build upmutually-cooperative relationships. In an emergency, central bank governors are thus able to tackleissues very promptly thanks to their close contacts and cooperation. By the influence they hold overtheir domestic financial institutions, the central banks are well-placed to persuade them to prolong thematurities of overseas credits and provide fresh loans at the request of a fellow central bank, and topromote a better understanding of the economic situation of the debtor countries.Closing remarksThe Bank of Korea has supported the smooth implementation of structural reform through openmarket operations and financial market stabilization policy. In the future, the Bank intends to conducta balanced monetary policy both to ensure the success of restructuring and to support economic
5BIS Review 120/1999recovery. It is also supporting structural adjustment indirectly through the strengthening of cooperativelinks among central banks worldwide.I am fully aware that there are critics overseas who rate Korea’s structural reform as far fromsatisfactory. However, as the experience of other countries attests, it is difficult to achieve satisfactoryoutcomes in a short time because restructuring by definition entails conflict and pain. Consideringthese points, I venture to ask for your continued warm interest and support for Korea’s restructuringefforts. I hope the Korean economy will become more advanced thanks to its restructuring and alsowish that its practical cooperative relationship with the EU may continue to deepen in the future.
BIS Review   108/1998Mr McDonough discusses the role of central banks in the global financial marketsRemarks by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr William J.McDonough, before the Economic Club of New York, New York City, on 14/12/98.Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to be here tonight and to share the podiumwith my good friend Dick Grasso. Dick and I have worked together for many years now, and Ihave come to value greatly both his warm friendship and his thoughtful counsel.Dick has spoken eloquently about how equity markets have developed globally over the pastseveral years and some of the concerns he has going forward. For my part, I will focus on theglobal debt markets and the interests of central banks in the stability of these markets.The role of central banks in the fixed-income and related capital markets may not be immediatelyobvious because, one can argue, debt markets are a zero-sum game. One side of a trade gainswhat the other loses. If only it were as easy as that! In fact, trading in the global debt marketsserves an important purpose and it does not follow that central banks have no interest in thestability of these markets. Quite the contrary. Central banks are and should be deeply concernedabout the functioning of these markets, their dependability, their liquidity, and their transparency.Before explaining why I hold such a view, and therefore why we at the Federal Reserve were soconcerned when these markets faltered this past summer, I would like to stand back for a fewmoments and highlight how the global capital markets have changed over the past severaldecades.No one doubts that there has been a sea change in the global capital markets in recent years andthe ways business is transacted in these markets. These changes are, of course, rooted in theremarkable technological advances we have been witnessing. Today, the technology forprocessing information and making this information widely available has fundamentally alteredthe way the world channels saving into investment. No longer does the global economy relyprimarily on loans from commercial banks to meet its financing and investment needs. Rather,more than ever before, the global economy of today looks to funds from the fixed-income andrelated capital markets to intermediate its credit needs.Because the global capital markets have become so important in the credit intermediationprocess, the economic well-being of us all depends on the orderly flow of funds in these markets.The flow of these funds, in turn, increasingly relies on price signals generated by trading activitythat takes place daily in these markets. The reliance on secondary market trading for pricediscovery constitutes the fundamental difference between funds from securities markets andloans from banks.Let me be a bit more specific. In securities markets, investment decisions are driven by pricesthat arise from a trading process that reconciles differential information from a diverse group ofinvestors. In bank loans, investment decisions are based on the bank’s private information aboutspecific borrowers. While a bank makes its own investment decisions, securities markets rely onthe consensus of a multitude of investors.When securities markets work well, they provide efficient ways of aggregating information andallocating risks among a wide range of investors. In order to function well, however, thesemarkets require a trading infrastructure. This infrastructure may consist of an exchange, anetwork of brokers and dealers, and a clearing system. These markets also rely on a cadre ofrelatively well-informed investors, who confidently judge asset prices and take positions on the
– 2 –BIS Review   108/1998strength of their judgments. If the trading infrastructure fails or investors lose confidence, tradingwill grind to a halt.The global fixed-income markets are unlike equity markets. In equity markets, everyone knowssomething about the trading infrastructure, which is centralized in exchanges. Thus, there is noquestion as to the focal point of trading information. But the importance of fixed-incomemarkets, which are multiple-dealer, over-the-counter markets, is sometimes hard to appreciatebecause they are so decentralized.In the United States, the bond market is where companies have been raising most of their fundsin recent years. During the last ten years, for example, U.S. nonfinancial corporations borrowed anet amount of $785 billion in the form of bonds, three times the net amount they borrowed frombanks. Over this same period, these companies as a group spent $600 billion more to retire stock– through buybacks and mergers – than they raised in new offerings.Accompanying these increased levels of debt market activity has been a continuous process offinancial innovation. This innovation has served to unbundle different kinds of risk and, thereby,to enlarge the menu of risks that investors may choose to bear. For example, interest-rate swaps,futures and options help reconfigure various interest-rate risks. Total return swaps and credit-spread options are tools for reallocating the payment risks primarily of emerging market debt.Credit-default swaps and credit-linked notes are ways to redistribute default risks.In practice, this unbundling of risk means that a broad range of financial institutions todayperforms the credit intermediation process, eroding the historical comparative advantage ofbanks in bearing credit risk. At various times, some institutions will be underwriting issues,while others will be making bridge loans, providing credit enhancements, writing derivativecontracts and taking up riskier components of securities.Within the United States, the fixed-income market is today a market of some $13 trillion,roughly the same size as the total equity market. Trading activity in fixed-income instruments isconcentrated in Treasury securities. On an average day, over $150 billion in Treasury securitieschanges hands, about seven times the value of stocks traded daily on the New York StockExchange.All of this trading activity serves the very important function of price discovery. More than anyother securities market in the United States, the Treasury market responds forcefully to newinformation about macroeconomic fundamentals. The days when the most intense tradingactivity takes place are also the days when major reports are released on such indicators of U.S.economic performance as the employment report, the consumer price index or the producer priceindex. These releases allow market participants to digest important new information and toreview their expectations about where the economy is going. The interest rates on Treasurysecurities of varying maturities are the market’s most important signals about the U.S.economy’s prospects for growth and risks of inflation.In the rest of the fixed-income market, trading in corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securitiesand sovereign debt also serves the price discovery process. This trading activity acts todifferentiate, for example, a triple-A risk against a triple-B risk, the prepayment risk ofmortgages against the prepayment risk of credit card receivables, and OECD country risk againstemerging market risk.What then is the role of central banks in this new financial landscape, where institutionalinvestors and other nonbank financial institutions hold a larger share of assets and a larger share
– 3 –BIS Review   108/1998of credit risk than they ever have before – and where an increasing share of conventional creditrisk is intermediated through the capital markets? I would argue that the role of a central bank inthis new environment is very much in keeping with its traditional responsibilities. Central banksin all countries fundamentally care about the flow of credit in their economies, whether thiscredit flows from banks, nonbank financial institutions, or institutional investors.Why is this so? The answer is simple. It is because the credit intermediation process is ultimatelywhat determines how well our economies function and therefore how well our economies areable to grow and allow their citizens to prosper. When the credit intermediation process does notwork well, when there are disruptions to the supply of credit to the economy, as history hasamply shown, the costs for our businesses and our people can be enormous in terms of loweroutput and fewer jobs. A well-functioning credit intermediation process is, in short, critical to thesustainability of any economy’s success.It is for these reasons that central bankers are interested in the flows of credit from the globalsecurities markets, just as we have needed to know about the flows of credit from the bankswhose operations we are charged with overseeing. At the end of the day, the flow of credit fromsecurities markets has the same impact on our respective societies as that from banks. Therefore,central bankers have an obligation to understand the nature of these flows and the risks that theyraise. Crucial to our obligations to our citizens is the need to be certain that these credit marketswork smoothly and that credit flows efficiently from those most willing and able to bear the risksto those most able to put the funds to good use. This is as true for the United States as it is forany other country, developed or developing.Does this mean that central banks believe that capital markets should be supervised in the sameways banks are overseen? Clearly the answer to this question is no. This is not our role.In my view, central banks broadly have two main responsibilities with respect to the global debtmarkets. The first is to enhance the price discovery process by promoting transparency in theirown actions. The second is to ensure that the banks, as providers of liquidity, perform theirproper role in supporting the trading process by making sound credit decisions.In the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC has a pronounced effect onthe fixed-income market, both through its policy decisions and in the way the Federal Reserveconducts monetary policy. Indeed, an important part of the price discovery process is theanticipation of the Federal Reserve’s future actions. Because the Federal Reserve is such acritical player in the market, it is important that it not create unnecessary uncertainty. That is, theFederal Reserve has a responsibility to be as transparent as possible in the conduct of itsmonetary policy. Since February 1994, there have been direct and immediate announcementsfollowing FOMC meetings of the Committee’s policy decisions, which, in my view, have helpedremove uncertainty.In addition, in implementing monetary policy through its trading role, the Open Market Desk hasmade numerous changes in recent years to add clarity and transparency to its day-to-day marketinterventions. The thrust of these changes has been to reduce uncertainty and enhance the pricediscovery process in the Treasury market.As to the Federal Reserve’s responsibility for ensuring that banks support the trading process bymaking sound credit decisions, let’s not forget that, despite the increase in market players, banksin the United States, as elsewhere, continue to play an extremely important role in the financialmarkets. Not only do banks often underwrite bond issues and structure hedging instruments for
– 4 –BIS Review   108/1998these bonds, but they also provide much of the financing that allows market makers to takepositions. Dealers in the U.S. bond markets finance themselves through repurchase agreementswith bank counterparties. In many cases, banks are also the source of backup liquidity. It is inthese ways that bank credit supports the price discovery process.In its role as a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve has the responsibility to see to it that thiscredit support does not dry up at critical times. One of our primary tasks is to be certain thatnothing interferes with the credit intermediation process of banks. This is why bank soundness isso important to us.The events of last August illustrate what can go wrong with financial markets and why we wereso concerned when the global credit markets seemed to seize up following the announcement bythe Russian government of an effective devaluation of the ruble and a debt moratorium. Theseactions were so unexpected that they shocked investors all over the world.In the United States, the correction of stock prices in the wake of Russia’s announcements wasnot of exceptional size or concern, and had even been anticipated by some astute observers. Butthe abrupt and simultaneous widening of credit spreads globally for both corporate and emergingmarket sovereign debt was an extraordinary event beyond the expectations of investors andfinancial intermediaries. The abrupt shift in investor behavior, in fact, served to intensify pricemovements and to undermine confidence in market dynamics. It was not just the rebalancing ofportfolios that was of concern in the days and weeks following the Russian government’sannouncements, but also the rush away from risk altogether. In short, it was this seizing up of thecredit intermediation process that was of most fundamental concern to us as central bankers.What we learned as a result of this experience was, among other things, that years of historic dataon fixed-income market yields and spreads could not have anticipated the size of the movementsin credit spreads that in fact occurred in August and September. We also learned that marketsthat did not previously move together can suddenly do so, that trends that were under way forseveral years can abruptly come to an end, and that spreads that have been consistently narrowfor years can suddenly widen. In the wake of these events, we have become all too aware thatliquidity can be illusory – that individual traders may be able to exit a position when they wishbut that not all traders can exit their positions at the same time. For many, these lessons havebeen humbling.Going forward, it is important to bear in mind that there most certainly will be further instanceswhen the credit intermediation process is disrupted, when we will face other threats to the well-being of our market positions, our institutions and the global economy. These risks are in thenature of the intermediation process itself.As the global capital markets continue to grow and become ever more sophisticated – as I believethey will – what is most important for us as central bankers is to operate with a disciplined senseof priorities. It is clear that we as central banks cannot be responsible for any single bond holder,any single bank or any single financial institution. Nor can we control the functioning of theglobal debt markets or become the regulators of all financial market intermediaries.What we as central bankers can do, however, is to understand the dynamics of the global debtmarkets – how they are evolving and whether they are sufficiently liquid and transparent. We canalso ensure that banks perform their proper role in supporting the trading process through makingsound credit decisions. Furthermore, we can enhance the price discovery process by promotingtransparency in our own actions. Finally, and most importantly, we can help create conditions in
– 5 –BIS Review   108/1998our own economies that will support sustainable, non-inflationary growth. In these ways, we ascentral banks can encourage the efficient functioning of the credit intermediation process in ourcountries, and in so doing, promote the welfare of the world economy, of which we are all a part.* * *
BIS Review   107/1998Mr Meister remarks on the role of credit institutions against the background of bankingsupervisionSpeech by Mr Edgar Meister, a member of the Directorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank, to theGASC Forum on International Harmonisation in Frankfurt on 16/12/98.IIASC (the International Accounting Standards Committee) and IOSCO (the InternationalOrganization of Securities Commissions) have undertaken to develop internationally applicableaccountancy principles and to accept them worldwide as a precondition for cross-border stockexchange listing of securities. This plan has aroused considerable interest among central banksand banking supervisors. A theoretical distinction can be made between a national and aninternational perspective. In practice, however, both are interlinked. In an age of globalinterdependency of goods and financial markets, it is no longer meaningful to lay down nationalrules autonomously. The Asia crisis has once again highlighted - and has done so dramatically - that crises in one area of the world can spread like wildfire and adversely affect financialmarkets in other regions, however remote.That event has stepped up the debate on how the international financial markets can be mademore stable. Among the buzzwords we hear in this context are intensify banking supervision andenhance transparency. There is no disputing the fact that one of the major preconditions for astable financial market is an effective system of banking supervision - in addition to soundeconomic and fiscal policies. If banking supervision is to be effective, however, the preparationand publishing of accounts are of major importance. As the member of the Bundesbank Boardresponsible for banking supervision, I would like to focus my remarks on the role of the creditinstitutions.IIBanking supervisors depend on institutions fulfilling their reporting requirements and derivingthe requisite capital adequacy on the basis of reliable accounts. Accounting functions such as theprovision of internal information, documentation, ascertainment of profits and losses andinforming the market are also useful for banking supervision. It will therefore come as nosurprise if I emphasise the advantages of a prudent determination of profit in the banking fieldwith the aim of capital maintenance. That does not necessarily imply undisclosed reserves, whichimpair the informativeness of the annual accounts. However, the historical cost principle and theprinciple of the lower cost or market should be retained in the case of banks, at all events wherethe objective is to ascertain the profit eligible for distribution.Furthermore, thought must be given to the capital adequacy requirements laid down by thesupervisory authorities. As the equity capital ratio is derived from the risk assets and the marketrisks, on the one hand, and from the capital resources, on the other, both the soundness of theaccounts and their international comparability are of paramount importance. In view of theincreasing number of ever-larger takeovers, the effects of different methods of accounting can beconsiderable. For example, differences in consolidation procedures, which may result in asizeable goodwill item in one country but not in another, would give rise to unequal competitiveconditions owing to the fact that the banking supervisors are required to deduct goodwill fromthe liable capital. This means that the equity capital ratios would present a bank in too positive alight if, for example, credit risks were not adequately reflected in the accounts.
- 2 -BIS Review   107/1998IIIThere is no doubt that the informative value of the annual accounts is the main consideration inthe present IASC-IOSCO plan. The German banking supervisory authority, too, is giving theproject its explicit support. It agrees that the market players on the international financial marketsmust provide more transparency, thereby fostering the stabilisation of the financial markets. Thisstabilisation will be achieved through improving market discipline. A better flow of informationwill enable counterparties and shareholders of institutions to take more appropriate decisions oninvestment and loans and, consequently, will influence the actions of the banks. Marketdiscipline is not a substitute for but a complement to banking supervision, and should promptcredit institutions to pursue a risk-conscious and prudent business policy.The institutions themselves may also derive benefit from improved transparency. Creating amodicum of trust in the eyes of the general public through the regular flow of reliableinformation lowers the level of susceptibility to market uncertainty, enhances the accessibility ofthe capital markets and promises more favourable refunding conditions. Again, bankingsupervisors can expect compliance with prudential rules to be enhanced as well. Naturally,market discipline has the biggest role to play at the major listed institutions. It is primarilyinstitutions that are in the public eye that have to expect sanctions as a result of insufficientinformation. However, those institutions are among the major channels through which regionalcrises are spread internationally.Ladies and gentlemen, there is, of course, also scope for discretion in drawing up accounts.These discretionary powers can substantially impair the flow of information if they are deployedin different ways according to the interests of the institution concerned. In valuing assets, forexample, the institutions have, in principle, to decide on their own initiative the basis of thevaluation; despite subjective elements, however, discretionary powers should not unduly restrictthe comparability of the results because information on the quality of a loan book can be assessedto some extent independently of the valuation basis selected according to objective criteria.Admittedly, there are other ways of assessing risk, as the example of Japan has taught us. It iscustomary internationally and appropriate for different payment arrears in servicing debt to serveas a yardstick. Furthermore, the comparable, because appropriate, use of discretionary powerswhen valuing assets is encouraged by the fact that, in principle, value adjustments on loans maybe deducted from taxable profits. The banking supervisors are in favour of this. Indeed, theyregard it as an incentive to make appropriate risk provision in good time. By contrast, theabsence of such an incentive may be a destabilising element in a financial system. Japan is agood example of this, too. By the way, including value adjustments in tax assessment is alsoconsistent with the principle of taxing on the basis of performance. Having made these remarksof rather a national nature, I shall now return to international transparency.IVThe Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, which was established by the central bankgovernors of the G-10 countries as the Committee on Banking Regulations and SupervisoryPractices as far back as 1975, also issued statements on transparency and accounting as part of itsCore Principles in 1997. The Core Principles describe the preconditions for an effective bankingsupervisory system. Principle 21 requires, among other things, that “the bank publishes on aregular basis financial statements that fairly reflect its condition”. Regarding accounts, it is saidthat “market participants need access to correct and timely information in order for market forcesto work effectively, thereby fostering a stable and efficient financial system. For this reason,banks should be required to disclose to the public information regarding their activities and
- 3 -BIS Review   107/1998financial position that is comprehensive and not misleading. This information should be timelyand sufficient for market participants to assess the risk inherent in any individual bankingorganisation.”The Basle Committee has since explained and amended its Principles in various papers, the mostrecent being in October 1998. This was a consultation paper on the balance sheet treatment andvaluation of credits and on the supply of information about credit risks in lending operations. Aconstructive relationship with IASC has also been maintained for some time in order to assistthat committee in its further development of internationally recognised accounting principles. Itis therefore also in the interests of the banking supervisors for the joint project of IASC andIOSCO to reach a successful conclusion. Whether the last core standard (on financialinstruments) can actually be approved or not at the moment is not so important in my opinion.What is important is that the other partner, IOSCO, is subsequently able to fulfil its part of theagreement. As national financial markets in an open global environment can no longer beprotected by national rules alone, it is in the interest of all of us that international accountingstandards are applied worldwide, especially in the emerging countries as well. IOSCO can makea substantial contribution towards this goal by ensuring that the worldwide acceptance of IASCstandards is a precondition for stock exchange listing.The IMF and World Bank, which, incidentally, have also recommended that the Core Principlesof the Basle committee be used worldwide, are focusing during their country inspections onwhether and to what extent internationally recognised principles are being implemented andobserved in the various countries. The Basle Committee itself supports national supervisors inthe implementation of its principles.VCalls for greater transparency in the markets have also been made by the G-7 finance ministersand central bank governors for some time now. The call of October 30, 1998 to IASC to submitproposals for a complete range of accounting standards in the spring of 1999 implies astrengthening and international recognition of IASC as well as a great responsibility andcommitment on the part of this body. The international organisations responsible for supervisingsecurities trading, insurance and the banks are being called upon to put these standards to thetest. Only the international acceptance of these standards can make sense in the end. At allevents, the Basle Committee will do all it can on the banking supervisory side to contribute tothis end.VIFrom Germany’s point of view, it is particularly gratifying to see that the latest core standardwithin the IASC-IOSCO project is being approved during a German Accounting StandardsCommittee forum.A natural person as young as the GASC would not be able to talk yet.The commitment of the G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors to apply the recognisedprinciples in their respective countries will necessitate some adjustments in Germany, too, whichwill give rise to interesting discussions and make particular demands on our fledgling GASC. Iam thinking here of the introduction of current value accounting for the trading portfolios ofcredit institutions. A further point of conflict arises in the application sphere. Can theinformation function of the annual accounts be confined to the overall group results? Do theindividual accounts remain concerned with dividend assessment and thus with the traditional
- 4 -BIS Review   107/1998principle of caution? Can internationally operating institutions be subject to other accountingprinciples and disclosure requirements than nationally or merely regionally operatinginstitutions? It is difficult to imagine that institutions will comply at national level with thetraditional accounting principles but that internationally they will comprehensively conform tothe recognised international accounting standards. In the light of this, it should be quiteunderstandable if the banking supervisors wanted to see capital maintenance aspects being takeninto account as well when the IASs are being developed. At all events, the banking supervisorshave difficulties where all financial instruments are deployed, no matter how the “fair” valuationis arrived at.
BIS Review   105/1998Mr Tietmeyer looks at the euro as a stabiliser in the international economic systemSpeech by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof Hans Tietmeyer, given at theconference of the Luxembourg Institute for European and International Studies and the PierreWerner Foundation in Luxembourg on 4/12/98.IThere are just 28 days left until the start of monetary union, which is perhaps the most importantmonetary event since the end of the Bretton-Woods system.Some people may be thinking: ‘Just another 28 days, and then we’ve done it!’ before heaving asigh of relief as they relax in their armchairs.That is a very human reaction, especially when one considers the great efforts and obstacles, allthe advances but all the reverses on the way to greater monetary cooperation in Europe as well.Thirty years ago the subject of monetary union was already a topic on the agenda of the EuropeanCommunity, which in those days consisted of just six member countries. It was at that time thatthe road to monetary union was first jointly mapped out by you, Pierre Werner, and the WernerGroup named after you – in which I myself had the honour of working.Luxembourg and its political representatives were always advocates of progress towards further-going but clearly stability-oriented integration.Important insights which were gained at that time are still highly relevant today. For example, thecurrencies of the participating states can be welded together to form a permanently stablemonetary union only• if there is an adequate degree of ongoing economic convergence between the countries,• if there are common preferred structures in monetary policy and the same priorities prevail,and• if there is broad agreement on the basic political stance.The way forward proposed at that time was different to some extent than the path actuallycharted in Maastricht. It was envisaged that political integration would develop parallel toeconomic integration.However, the consultations following the submission of the Werner Plan showed clearly that thepoliticians at that time were not prepared to abandon national sovereignty on the quiteconsiderable scale demanded. So the first attempt to launch monetary union fell at this hurdle.On January 1, 1999 monetary union will therefore be launched at the second attempt. A numberof conditions have changed in the meantime:• Eleven countries will be taking part, as opposed to just six at the time of the first attempt.• These 11 countries are only part of the overall European Union. Hence there will bedifferences in the level of monetary integration within the EU.• And the political framework for integrating the single currency is a rather loose structure.The euro will have to cope with this as best it can.
– 2 –BIS Review   105/1998For the goal is not merely to ensure that the euro is stable at the beginning. The goal is to ensurethat the euro remains stable over the long term. And in the long term it is highly probable that theeuro will need a stronger political underpinning.IIIt is gratifying that the financial markets already seem to have largely accepted the euro.At any rate, the euro has passed its first test.The markets apparently have confidence in the preannounced exchange rates. So far there havebeen no marked tensions between the exchange rates of the future participating currencies.And the euro has already begun to show the first benefits. In the context of problematicaldevelopments in the financial markets which in some cases reached crisis-like proportions, theeuro has acquired the reputation of a safe haven – even before the actual launching of monetaryunion – which has led to correspondingly low capital market rates in the future euroland.None of these things should be taken for granted. They are the result of• the rigorous stability orientation of the Maastricht Treaty,• the large degree of convergence that has already been achieved in the monetary stabilitypolicies of the central banks,• the careful preparatory work, and• the determined efforts that have been made to date to achieve greater convergence in fiscalpolicy, too.The safe haven function which the euro area has performed so far clearly demonstrates that theintroduction of the new currency is undoubtedly a ‘global event’. And a lot of hopes are beingplaced on the future international role of the euro.Clearly, the enlarged financial market in euroland will result in a wider range of products and abroader choice of investment opportunities.To what extent these greater opportunities will actually be used – especially by enterprises –depends on other conditions as well.These include the legal framework laid down by the EU and by the national parliaments of thecountries concerned, the different traditions in respect of financial market structures and alsoquestions of taxation.It remains to be seen just how quickly traditional financial market structures move closertogether.And another thing which remains to be seen is the use to which enterprises will put the enlargedcapital market. For example, will there be a tendency towards greater concentration as firms seekto exploit ‘economies of scale’ in euroland?And what about the other question which central bankers are often asked in connection with theinternational role of the euro:
– 3 –BIS Review   105/1998How fast and to what extent will the euro become a major international investment and reservecurrency? Can the euro take over the D-Mark’s role as the second most important investment andreserve currency?Naturally, the euro will play a significant international role as an investment and reservecurrency. If this does not turn out to be the case, it will be an enormous – and scarcelyconceivable – surprise as well as a bitter disappointment.The fact that the euro area is already regarded as a safe haven confirms this assumption. It issimply a fact of life that major international currencies are used by investors from time to time asa safe haven.However, this can also be a problem in certain situations, especially for the exchange rate.But it is the future stability of the euro that will determine its actual role in the concert of worldcurrencies. And two key criteria for this will be• sensible monetary policy decisions by the ECB Governing Council, and• stability-oriented behaviour in those aspects of economic policy which remain a nationalresponsibility, especially fiscal and wage policies.Given such a policy mix, the euro can assume a major international role – in line with the sizeand economic importance of euroland – and also make its contribution to global stability.IIIAnd that brings me to the subject of this conference: ‘The euro as a stabiliser in the internationaleconomic system.’This title expresses great expectations of the future single currency.• In what sense – if at all – does the international economic system need a stabiliser?• And if it needs one, how can a currency help to meet such a need?Let me begin with the second question: as a general principle, currencies cannot solve structuralproblems relating to the global real economy.And as far as the first question is concerned, it must be said that, while the world economicsetting is difficult at the moment, there is certainly no cause to talk of a fundamental instability.In recent weeks the financial markets have at least calmed down a little. The world financialcrisis which many people predicted looks unlikely to occur at the moment.It is true that a number of countries are currently suffering crises entailing considerable localgrowth losses:• In the South-East Asian countries this is a direct consequence of the financial crisis. But atthe moment there are some encouraging signs of an improvement in certain countries.• Japan continues to suffer, in particular, from the structural problems which haveaccumulated in its financial sector. Happily, it has now taken steps to put its financialsector in order. These now need to be implemented resolutely.
– 4 –BIS Review   105/1998• In Russia the transformation of the centrally planned economy into a market economy hasvirtually come to a halt.• And in Latin America contagion effects manifested themselves in the wake of theuncertainty in the financial markets. Fortunately, the financial markets are showingrenewed confidence and are tending more to reward the marked structural advances madein a number of countries.Nevertheless, these regional crises have clearly left their mark on the global economic growthprocess.On the one hand, that does not mean that an overall world economic crisis is looming. The robuststate of the US and European economies clearly contradicts such gloomy views.On the other hand, it is becoming more apparent that the international setting has created someextraordinary risks and uncertainties which are beginning to retard the pace of economicexpansion in the industrial countries.There are some indications that the euro area, too, cannot fully escape the global downwardpressure.Fortunately, this comes at a time when the internal monetary conditions in Europe are ratherfavourable. The goal of price stability has largely been achieved. Moreover, there seems to be noobvious threat to maintaining price stability in the foreseeable future.That has given European monetary policy the opportunity for a further round of cuts in centralbank interest rates.As you know, for some weeks now the euro area as a whole has already experienced a period ofconsiderable decline in the average interest rate. This is the result of the so-called process ofconvergence of central bank interest rates.At the beginning of this week the Council of the European Central Bank made a comprehensiveassessment of the monetary and economic situation in the euro area. This very thorough analysison the ECB Governing Council, as well as yesterday’s discussion on the Bundesbank’s CentralBank Council, came to the same conclusion: an additional coordinated rate cut is appropriatewhich clears the horizon for a level of 3% for the start and the first stage of the euro.Therefore, this cut also has to include those currencies whose interest rate already lies at thebottom of the current range. The Bundesbank’s decision to cut the repo rate by 30 basis points isour contribution to that coordinated action.The decision is compatible with both the monetary situation and the overall economic conditions.The early announcement of the interest rate level for the launch of the euro may help stabiliseexpectations in the financial markets. But of course, the rate cut cannot solve the severestructural problems in most of the euro countries. This is particularly true of the structuralproblems on the labour markets.IVNaturally, it is not only Europe that is suffering structural problems and, therefore, facing toughchallenges.
– 5 –BIS Review   105/1998To a large extent, it was structural problems occurring in the monetary and banking sector whichplayed a major calamitous role in the outbreak and course of the regional crises.• Many of the countries affected had excessively rigid exchange rate pegs.• Many of the countries affected placed their own monetary policy too much at the service ofthese problematical exchange rate pegs.• Many of the countries affected have structural deficiencies in the area of financial marketsupervision, in particular.These structural problems in the monetary sector have to be solved first and foremost throughsuitable policy measures in these countries themselves.How else could these internal structural problems be solved than• through a confidence-building economic policy,• through a greater measure of realism in the exchange rate pegs,• through a stability-oriented central bank policy, and• through an overhaul of the financial sector and an improvement of banking supervision?Naturally, international cooperation can also help, but not so much through currencyarrangements like the euro as through strengthening the overall functioning and viability of thefinancial markets. This entails above all• improving international cooperation in the field of supervision,• involving private sector creditors in the task of overcoming crises, and• improving the transparency of the financial markets.All this will sharpen the markets’ risk awareness and strengthen their functioning and viability.But considerable structural problems exist in the industrial countries, too.In the USA the already low private saving ratio has fallen further in recent years, actuallyshowing a negative ratio of late. Despite the country’s balanced budget, the imbalances in foreigntrade have not therefore been reduced.And in most of the euro countries unemployment remains too high. The euro will not be able tosolve this problem on it own. Instead the euro requires flexibility and competitiveness in the realeconomy.It is the politicians who must tackle these internal structural problems. In the longer run this isthe best contribution that can be made towards achieving sound financial markets and aprospering world economy.VBoldly undertaking the necessary reforms in the euro area will at the same time prepare theground for sustained favourable growth and employment prospects.Given more flexible structures in the markets, a lastingly stable euro will be able to fully exploitthe undoubtedly large potential for economic benefits, and then it will also be able to fosterpolitical integration.
– 6 –BIS Review   105/1998To sum up: the euro is not the final aim of European integration. Even in 28 days’ time it willremain a future-oriented project.For it is not just a question of introducing the euro. The euro also requires ongoing monetarystability. And the euro requires a sufficient degree of political consensus on the basis ofeconomic dynamism and flexibility. Only in this way can potentially dangerous political conflictsbe avoided in the long run.We are investing great hopes and expectations in this future-oriented project associated with theeuro. All those involved are responsible for doing what is necessary to ensure that these hopesand expectations are fulfilled.
BIS Review   105/1998Mr Stark discusses the worldwide currency situation and international monetarycooperationSpeech by the Deputy Governor of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Dr Jürgen Stark, to ELEC inKronberg on 4/12/98.IAnyone comparing the global economic policy debate at the end of 1998 with the debate last yearwill notice not only a number of similarities but also some striking differences.It is true that there was already a debate under way at that time on the crises of some countries inSouth-East Asia. In fact, President Tietmeyer spoke in depth about them to ELEC pointing outpotential domino effects.A general optimism prevailed in the public debate, however, particularly in respect of futuredevelopments in the US economy. At all events, I can well recall headlines announcing the ‘endof the business cycle’ and predicting the arrival of the ‘new economics’, which probably referredto the theory of continuing progress in productivity or even the end of the economic problem ofsupply and demand itself.Quite often, it is the same commentators who only a few weeks ago were forecasting a ‘globaleconomic crisis’ with a similar supposed degree of certainty and evoking the start of a worldrecession. Two months ago – at the Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank – talk wasstill of ‘doom and gloom’. But today we can read again headlines like ‘Crisis, what crisis?’However, a return to the Garden of Eden and the decline of the old world are events that tend notto happen very often. At all events, we are still alive.The fact that people fail to strike a balance between optimism and pessimism was pointed outrecently by the US economist Paul Romer, one of those talented people in his profession who arewrongly claimed to be proponents of the ‘new economics’.One cannot escape the feeling that one-sided and exaggerated perceptions are contributing to thepresent problems of the global economy. Do they not create sentiment and expectations that tendto strengthen rather than reduce the much lamented herd behaviour of the markets?Anyway, the transparency of opinions about supposed facts stands in sharp contrast to thetransparency of the facts themselves. The media and the markets produce and processinformation incessantly. The question is whether it is the relevant information. If that were thecase, there would scarcely be an international debate on improving transparency in the financialmarkets.IICertainly, a ‘worst case scenario’ can never be completely ruled out in theory, although ascenario of that kind depends on the interaction of a large number of factors.
– 2 –BIS Review   105/1998Keyword ‘accumulation of slumping economic cycles’A number of Asian economies are indeed going through a sharp recession at present. Japan, asone of the largest economies in the world, has been suffering for quite some time from a negativebusiness trend and a crisis of confidence caused by structural problems in the financial sector.In August, the developments in Russia added to the crisis in the Asian countries. The unilateralmoratorium led to a reassessment by investors of the risks in other emerging markets, such as ofLatin America.These factors have contributed to a shift in global expectations of growth, which vary quiteconsiderably from region to region.On the other hand, the fact cannot be ignored that some countries, in particular in South-EastAsia, are showing initial successes in overcoming their internal structural problems. In a numberof cases, they have been able to stabilise their exchange rates and, in some instances, havewitnessed an appreciation of their currencies enabling some countries to reduce their interestrates again.Of the greatest importance for the region is the situation in Japan. Initial steps have been taken toeliminate the structural problems in the financial sector by adopting the Financial SystemRevitalisation bills. Now it is most important to implement those measures in a consistent andconvincing manner.What mainly argues against a ‘looming global economic crisis’ is the economic situation in theUnited States and Europe.Despite a slight drop in pace, the US economy seems to be in relatively good shape overall.Admittedly, the structural problems should not be taken too lightly there either. The savings ratioof households has shown a continuous fall over the past few months. In September, it wasnegative for the first time. That is related with the high and increasing current account deficitwhich can only be financed by extensive capital imports.In the future euro countries, economic growth up to now has been strong, although someforecasts for 1999 were revised downwards recently. A temporary slowdown is expected.But all in all, it is scarcely adequate to speak of an accumulation of slumping economic cycles.Keyword ‘deflation’Despite all the dire predictions, there are no indications worldwide of deflation either. At anyrate, there is no evidence of a cumulative decline in the general price level and an associated,self-intensifying contraction of economic activity either in the European or the global context.What we are witnessing at present in Europe is a process of disinflation. In part, this is beingfostered by international developments in the prices of commodities and crude oil – incidentally,with quite positive terms of trade effects for the oil-importing euro countries.In Germany, for example, core inflation is about 1%.
– 3 –BIS Review   105/1998‘Deflation is not on the agenda,’ Stanley Fischer, the IMF’s Deputy Managing Director, recentlyunderlined. The present price stability and the low level of interest rates in the capital marketindicate the absence of inflation expectations. That provides the opportunity for longer-terminflation-free growth.IIIIf it appears rather unlikely that the crises in parts of the world economy will spread to Americaand Europe through the real economy, is it not possible – given a loss in confidence – that thiscould happen through the channel of the financial markets?Keyword ‘credit crunch’A number of observers fear, for example, that the current uncertainties in the financial marketsmight cause financial institutions to refuse financial resources even to first class borrowers infuture – with matching implications for investment and growth.There would be various reasons for that:• First, financial institutions change their risk preferences, especially as a result ofdisappointed confidence or an expected recession. At least for a while, there may be ahigher risk aversion overall.• Second, financial institutions find themselves subjected to an erosion of their capital base.They then have to show restraint in terms of further exposures – even to top-ratedborrowers – in order to restore appropriate financial ratios. A rise in the cost of equity caneven reinforce that.• Third, the assets deposited as collateral decline in value, say, as a result of a fall in assetprices in the real property or equity markets.In some cases, however, what is worrying about a credit crunch is the idea that the normal pricemechanism balancing supply and demand is being paralysed in the credit market for specificreasons.In a ‘credit crunch’ scenario – so the theory goes – financial institutions do not respond to a risein demand for credit by raising the lending rate and extending their supply of credit.That is because they fear a disproportionate rise in the share of demanders of credit withcomparatively risky projects – the keyword is ‘adverse selection’. Moreover, after receivingcredit, the debtors would have an incentive to enter greater risks – the keyword is ‘moral hazard’.If banks have difficulty in assessing their potential borrowers’ risk and are unable to monitor thebehaviour of their debtors perfectly, they tend to refuse to grant credit, especially in a situation ofeconomic uncertainty.Furthermore, the problem of ‘asymmetric information’ cannot be solved by the provision ofcollateral. If there is a fall in asset prices – say, with the bursting of speculative bubbles – thevalue of the collateral provided will undergo a dramatic fall.How relevant are such considerations to the present global economic situation?
– 4 –BIS Review   105/1998A more in-depth view is probably needed here, too – in particular as it is difficult to identify acredit crunch in a clear-cut manner. It is not possible to identify whether a decline in lending isdue to a restraint in supply or to slack demand.Despite these problems in the diagnosis, there are some indications in Japan of a credit crunch onthe supply side. That is suggested, at all events, by the inadequate capital position of a number ofJapanese banks. Even established corporations seem to be receiving scarcely any more loans.We do not have a problem of liquidity supply worldwide, however. What we do have is aconfidence problem which is being manifested in a generally greater risk aversion.In the United States, credit terms have worsened since the summer, especially as a result of theturbulent developments in the equity markets. However, with its cuts in interest rates the FederalReserve Bank has – so far successfully – prevented a credit crunch.In the countries forming the future euro area, there has so far been no evidence of a credit crunch.There is no identifiable reduced lending, nor have the banks’ capital bases been eroded by large-scale losses.Even the argument that continental European banks are at risk as a result of their relatively largeexposure in the countries of central and eastern Europe is putting things too simply. First, thebanks have entered short-term exposures only on a minor scale. The major part of their lendinghas a medium- and longer-term maturity and is secured by Federal guarantee.Second, the off-balance-sheet positions which are not shown in the statistics are of particularimportance for assessing the degree of risk to which the financial institutions are exposed. In thatrespect, I feel that European banks bear less of a burden.Overall, the effects of the regional crises on the real economy are weaker, too, in Europe, and thefinancial system is, on the whole, more stable. That is probably due to the difference in financingarrangements.In the United States, for example, financing is mainly taken up through the market. By contrast,in Europe there is much more direct financing through individual (house) banks. Another factoris that credit risks can be intercepted better in the continental universal banking system.Given the slight fluctuations in property prices, slumps in credit resulting from dwindlingcollateral are also unlikely here.IVThe keyword ‘contagion’ undoubtedly belongs on the agenda, too.The worldwide potential for contagion has certainly increased over the past few decades,although it is always difficult to draw a clear dividing line between contagion effects andshortcomings in policy.The individual economies are becoming increasingly integrated internationally. Above all, therapid dismantling of restrictions in foreign exchange and financial transactions has brought themarkets closer together. And increasing securitisation and the marketability of assets make theindividual debt relationships anonymous.
– 5 –BIS Review   105/1998Finally completely new conditions have been created by enormous technological progress andall-pervasive computerisation in the financial markets.Institutional investors, investment funds or insurance companies can move large investmentamounts from one country to another and change them from one currency into the next within afew seconds.Certainly, there has been an enormous increase in the opportunities of investing funds in acountry. But there are also greater opportunities of withdrawing those funds with all of theadverse implications for the exchange rate and the domestic real economy.In that way, financial flows rove around the globe in search of profitable investmentopportunities.However, that is by no means as negative as it is often presented. Admittedly, this calls fordiscipline from policymakers and from the market players.Access to the international financial markets has allowed many former developing countries andemerging economies to develop quickly and has improved their living standards.But these developments naturally also harbour risks.Profit margins have fallen under rising competitive pressure. Turnover-oriented transaction-driven finance is displacing traditional buy-and-hold finance.Longer-term bilateral financial relationships between banks and enterprises, which are typical ofcontinental Europe, are being increasingly replaced by Anglo-Saxon financing through themarkets. That also means a growth in short-termism. Volatility in the markets becomes greater.Given the low level to which interest rates have fallen in the capital market during the past fewyears in industrial countries, there has probably been a rise in the general willingness to take risksin order to be able to offer domestic investors the yields on their investment that they have beenused to.Confidence in the newly developed hedging opportunities has also encouraged riskierinvestment. Until recently, some investors evidently regarded the hedge funds they used as a kindof fully comprehensive cover.The predominance of institutional investors has, at the same time, fostered a kind of herdinstinct.Large-scale investors can afford to make a solid review of their investment in regions that areprone to risk. But many smaller investors act as ‘free riders’. They save themselves the troubleand cost of their own research and gear their investment to that of the large-scale investors. Iflarge-scale investors withdraw their funds from a country, many other investors follow almostwithout any examination. Incidentally, that does not mean that the large-scale investors haveadequately identified the risks in the past.As a result, however, the fundamental differences between individual investments or thecountries concerned are obscured. There is an increased risk that the ‘herd’ of investors willbreak out in a blind stampede in times of uncertainty.
– 6 –BIS Review   105/1998As certain as it is that the possibilities of contagion are greater, it is just as impossible to identifyand isolate a clear transmission path for crises.Several factors seem to play a role, such as a similar macroeconomic situation, a high level ofgovernment debt or even similar exchange rate systems.There is no doubt that countries are susceptible to crises if political conditions there are unstableand contribute to international investors’ uncertainty.What is crucial, however, is that fundamentals in the countries concerned appear to play a muchgreater role overall than the international capital movements and the volatility in the financialmarkets which are everywhere alleged to be the cause.In South-East Asia, for example, it was mainly the lack of operationally efficient bankingsupervision which led to a rapid expansion of credit.On the banks’ assets side were longer-term assets in domestic currency, such as shares and loansfor real estate projects. On the liabilities side were what tended to be shorter-term issues andliabilities denominated in foreign currency.This meant that the banks were vulnerable in two ways: first, to asset price bubbles bursting and,second, to depreciations of the domestic currency.When confidence in the dollar pegs actually did diminish, the banks came under massivepressure. The fragile domestic financial sector collapsed like a house of cards.How then is it possible to make a further reduction in financial market instability and in thepresent risk of contagion spreading from South-East Asia to other regions?VWhat is important for that is how things develop in the expectation-biased financial markets. Atpresent, they probably still lack clear orientations, which is reflected by a level of volatilitywhich is still high.In the present situation, clear economic policy signals are therefore of paramount importance.Above all, the confidence of the markets has to be restored.Only underlying economic and political conditions that inspire confidence nationally andinternationally can lay the basis for long-term involvement by foreign investors and for stablefinancial relationships.That is of structural importance. It will also make it possible to get away globally from theoveremphasis on short-term financial flows and the associated short-termism.First of all, it is Japan that has to act. The confidence of the general public and the markets inJapan and, in the long term, in the region can be restored only if the reorganisation of the bankingsector is pursued in a determined manner.The emerging markets affected by capital outflows naturally also have to act. They, too, mustsolve their internal structural problems. Such solutions should be geared to the principles of a
– 7 –BIS Review   105/1998market economy. In the long term, sliding back into a protectionist policy does most damage tothe country which seeks to isolate itself.Payment moratoria and capital controls that are unexpectedly introduced ex post and forbidinvestors to withdraw their funds may lead to a locking-in. They are damaging for internationalconfidence and increase the risk of contagion.What deserves main attention is the establishment of efficient banking and financial marketsupervision in accordance with international standards. That includes setting up adequate safetynets for private bank deposits – perhaps in the form of a deposit guarantee fund – in order toprevent a run on the domestic banking system in a crisis.The international financial markets also need certainty about the role of the central banks.Internal stability should take precedence over defending unrealistic exchange rate pegs.Certainly, a prudent monetary policy will always leave sufficient scope for economic growth. Butthe central bank must not foster lending booms and speculative bubbles by pursuing a policy ofeasy money.It is, above all, also the IMF which bears responsibility as the leading international financialinstitution.Possibly the IMF has dulled private investors’ risk awareness and encouraged ‘moral hazard’behaviour by granting generous financial packages in past crises.As important as short-term financial assistance is for giving direct support to affected countriesthat are prepared to reform and for preventing contagion, private investors must not simply bebailed out. Those who enter greater risks in the expectation of higher yields ought also be readyto bear any consequent losses.The IMF should therefore refocus more on its role as a catalyst for preventing and overcomingcrises.For example, in the latest financial package for Brazil, amounting to US$ 41.5 billion, onlyaround US$ 5 billion comes from the IMF’s own resources. By contrast, US$ 27 billion is beingraised by what is basically bilateral funding through the facilities of the BIS and the activation ofthe New Arrangements to Borrow.The activation of the NAB must not be a model for other cases, however. The NAB are, strictlyspeaking, a ‘reserve tank’ for cases of extreme emergency. Activating them is acceptable nowonly as a ‘precautionary’ agreement because of Brazil’s special role for the stability of the globalfinancial markets.Funding through the BIS must not become standard practice either. IMF programmes should, asa matter of policy, be funded by the IMF.Rather than tying up larger financial packages with the aid of other organisations, the IMF shouldinvolve private creditors in crisis solutions to a greater extent than hitherto. The IMF should alsocall for internal structural reforms in the national financial markets.Above all, the IMF can play a major role in improving the transparency of the internationalfinancial markets and thus in dismantling the asymmetrical distribution of information.
– 8 –BIS Review   105/1998That is an aspect which should not be underrated.If a lack of transparency is among the causes of processes of contagion and herd behaviour and ifa credit crunch is ultimately due to asymmetrical information, increased transparency will make acrucial contribution to the stability of the global financial system.The operational efficiency of the markets will be strengthened; investors will be able to make anappropriate assessment of risks; and the risk of contagion will be significantly reduced.I would even go one stage further. If the markets do not create optimum transparency themselves,there is much to be said for providing transparency in some cases as a public good as well – bythe international community, such as through the IMF, through the G-10 and the supervisoryauthorities in the national financial markets.Obviously, transparency belongs on the agenda of international cooperation.Any approach to international cooperation extending beyond that must not ignore worldeconomic and political realities, however.That applies, in particular, to any attempt to force exchange rates into a more or less narrowregime.A global exchange rate system would create major problems. In my view it is neither desirablenor feasible.First, the differences in the fundamentals of the participating economies are too great. Second,the internally conducted policies are not directed towards the same aims.Flexible exchange rates are an important safety valve which can take pressure off economicdisequilibria. Regulated currency markets, on the other hand, create no more than an illusorystability. Sooner or later that situation might explode.One of the lessons of the recent crises is: the vast majority – if not all – of the countries affectedby the crises had pegged their exchange rates too rigidly.VIIn the future euro area, the exchange rate safety valve will be irrevocably shut from January 1,1999.The financial markets have already accepted the forthcoming monetary union. They regard theannounced irrevocable exchange rates of the participating countries as credible. And byyesterday’s decision of 10 European national central banks to lower interest rates, it has beendemonstrated: we are already in a de facto monetary union.The euro has undoubtedly already passed its first severe test during the financial marketturbulence of the past few months.But that success is based on many years’ efforts to achieve convergence. It is the outcome ofsetting priorities: the priority of internal monetary stability and the priority of consolidatinggovernment budgets in the participating countries.
– 9 –BIS Review   105/1998However, that stability-oriented policy mix must also be retained in future, because the real testsfor the euro are still to come.In future, there will only be a single monetary policy, on the same terms and conditions, and atthe same interest rates, in all participating countries. Adjustments to differing regional trendsmust take place regionally and in the real economy in future.Regional competitiveness and a high degree of internal flexibility will then become crucial assetsof national economic, fiscal, wage and social policies.This is the new reality to which all participating countries must adapt. The sooner, the better.Only then can the euro be a success and play its part in helping to stabilise the internationalfinancial markets.
BIS Review  104/1998Bank of Japan presents summaries of articles published in the November edition of itsQuarterly BulletinBank of Japan, Communication, 1/12/98.Profits and Balance-Sheet Developments of Japanese Banks in Fiscal 1997OverviewOperating profits of Japanese banks in fiscal 1997 amounted to ¥5.4 trillion, down by 14% fromthe previous fiscal year.1 This decrease was primarily due to the following factors: (1) thedisappearance of a temporary increase in trust fees (income) of trust banks in fiscal 1996; (2) themodest fall in net interest income on domestic operations due mainly to narrowing interestmargins; and (3) the slight decrease in gross profits on international operations as a result of theexpansion of the “Japan premium” and the downsizing of overseas branches and subsidiaries.2Transfer to the special loan-loss provisions (SLP) and loan write-offs including those in trustaccounts3 amounted to ¥13.3 trillion, which is almost the same figure as the peak recorded infiscal 1995.4 Due to a considerable amount of transfer to the SLP and loan write-offs, bothrecurring losses (¥5.2 trillion) and net losses (¥4.8 trillion) marked record highs.5Risk-based capital adequacy ratios at end-March 1998 at many banks exceeded those at end-March 1997. This improvement was due mainly to banks’ efforts to reduce their risk-adjusted1“Japanese banks” refers to All Banks, comprising the member banks of the Federation of BankersAssociations of Japan (Zenginkyo), which consists of 10 city banks, three long-term credit banks, seven trustbanks (excluding foreign-owned trust banks and trust banks that started business after October 1993), the 64member banks of the Regional Banks Association of Japan (referred to as regional banks), and the 64member banks of the Second Association of Regional Banks (excluding Hanwa Bank, which was liquidatedin January 1998; referred to as regional banks II). Figures in this report exclude data for Hokkaido TakushokuBank, Tokuyo City Bank, and Kyoto Kyoei Bank.“Operating profits” signifies earnings from core banking operations and is calculated by subtracting “transferto the allowance for possible loan losses,” “general and administrative expenses,” and “debenture issuanceexpenses” from the sum of “net interest income” (the excess of interest income on such items as loans andsecurities over interest expenses on such debts as deposits and debentures), “net fees and commissions” (netincome on fees and commissions received/paid on funds transfers and other service transactions), “net tradingrevenue” (applied to banks with trading accounts; gains/losses on transactions for trading purposes such astrading-related derivative transactions and gains/losses on year-end valuation at market or fair value), and“net other operating income” (e.g. net gains related to bond and foreign currency transactions).2The temporary increase refers to profits resulting from the write-back of the special reserve funds held bytrust banks. Special reserve funds are accumulated to provide for situations in which the value of a loan trustfalls below the amount of the principal. The ratio of required reserve funds to the amount of the principal waslowered from 3% to 0.5% by a revision of a government ordinance. Trust banks wrote off nonperformingloans in trust accounts, using part of the temporary profits in trust fees. The remainder of the profits wasaccounted as trust fees included in net fees and commissions in banking accounts.3In accordance with the Loan Trust Law and the Trust Business Law, trust banks guarantee the principals ofbanking-type trusts (loan trusts and jointly managed money trusts). Therefore, loan write-offs in trustaccounts are included in the total figures of transfer to the SLP and loan write-offs.4The amount includes loan write-offs, transfer to the SLP, losses from the sales of nonperforming loans to theCooperative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), and other renunciations of claims.5Reflecting the fact that banks began to be allowed to value listed stocks at cost, losses from stock write-downsdeclined significantly. As a result, net stock-related gains increased to ¥2.9 trillion, three times higher thanthose in the previous fiscal year. Net stock-related gains/losses are calculated by subtracting the sum of lossesfrom stock selling operations and stock write-downs from gains on stock selling operations.
– 2 –BIS Review  104/1998assets and various measures taken by the government in December 1997 to stabilize the Japanesefinancial system.Although several years have elapsed since the bursting of the economic “bubble”, transfer to theSLP and loan write-offs reached levels as high as the peak recorded in fiscal 1995. This reflectedthe emergence of large corporate bankruptcies and the introduction of a new self-assessmentsystem on banks’ asset quality to primarily determine appropriate loan-loss provisioning and loanwrite-offs under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) directives.One of the key policies for Japanese banks will be to remove nonperforming loans from theirbalance sheets by such means as selling collateral real estate, in addition to steadily disposing ofnonperforming loans and disclosing further information about their business. These efforts couldmoderate serious impacts of fluctuations in collateral real estate prices on the asset quality ofJapanese banks, and thus ensure the reliability of the information included in their balancesheets, and finally restore market confidence in their soundness. In addition, the sales ofcollateral real estate enable banks to plan flexible management strategies; and reinvestment ofthe cash inflow from the sales will improve banks’ profitability.* * *Checklist for Risk Management (Revised 1998 Edition)Objectives of the ChecklistThe Bank Supervision Department of the Bank of Japan initially compiled the Checklist for RiskManagement (hereafter: the Checklist) in December 1987. To provide examiners with guidancein reviewing the adequacy of risk management at individual banks during on-site examinations,the Bank completely revised the Checklist in May 1996, and it was distributed to financialinstitutions under the Bank’s supervision as well as to various other financial institutions in thebelief that it could serve as a reference as they undertake initiatives to check and strengthen theirrisk management systems.Over the two years since the last revision, major revisions of institutional systems have beenundertaken in Japan reflecting drastic changes in the financial and social environment, and inorder to deal with the deterioration in business performance of Japanese financial institutions.Furthermore, consensus has been reached and various reports have been released relating to riskmanagement in the international arena such as that of the Basle Committee on BankingSupervision, against the background of steady progress in financial deregulation and refinementof risk management skills.Meanwhile, as part of the review of its bank supervision functions accompanying the enactmentof the Bank of Japan Law of 1997, the Bank Supervision Department revised and expanded the1996 edition of the Checklist for Risk Management, and distributed the revised 1998 edition ofthe Checklist to financial institutions under the Bank’s supervision and various other financialinstitutions on June 19. With a view to securing transparency of bank supervision, the revised1998 edition of the Checklist has been made generally available as much of it should be useful tonondepository financial institutions not directly subject to the Checklist (securities companies,tanshi companies, etc.), depository financial institutions not under the Bank’s supervision (some
– 3 –BIS Review  104/1998shinkin banks, credit cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, labor credit associations, etc.) andnonfinancial business firms.6Major Features of the Revised 1998 EditionThe new edition of the Checklist for Risk Management has been revised and expanded to reflectdevelopments in the financial conditions and institutional reforms in Japan since the previousrevision (May 1996), as well as international discussions regarding risk management. Incompiling this edition, the Bank also considered and applied experience gained using theprevious editions of the Checklist and opinions and comments gathered from financialinstitutions under the Bank’s supervision.The overall framework in the new edition is unchanged from the 1996 edition. The Checklist iscategorized by type of operation (I. Management and Internal Controls, II. Lending Operations,III. Market Operations and Asset and Liability Management [ALM], and IV. Business Operationsand Electronic Data Processing [EDP]). The sample questions for examining the progress in riskmanagement of financial institutions under each checkpoint are organized starting from basicmatters and progressing to technical details. Like its predecessor, the revised 1998 editionincludes some items which even banks with advanced risk management skills require more timeto achieve. The Checklist is therefore not a minimum standard by which all banks must abide;rather, it is meant to be used flexibly by as many financial institutions as possible as a guidelinefor their business operations.Concretely, items related to legal compliance have been largely expanded in Section I(Management and Internal Controls) to include important points such as whether themanagement fully recognizes the importance of legal compliance and takes the lead inestablishing compliance awareness within the financial institution, and whether there is asystematic framework with concrete procedures for implementing legal compliance and whetherit functions adequately. In its revision of Section I, the Bank considered and included the aims setforth in the “Framework for the Evaluation of the Internal Control Systems” released by theBasle Committee on Banking Supervision. In Section II (Lending Operations), a new itemregarding financial institutions’ self-assessment of assets has been added in response to theintroduction of the self-assessment system. Necessary amendments have been made in Section III(Market Operations and ALM) to deal with the inclusion of the trading account, with dueconsideration given to the “Principles for the Management of Interest Rate Risk” released by theBasle Committee on Banking Supervision.Application of the Checklist in the Bank’s Examinations of Risk ManagementThe Bank’s examinations review both the strength of financial institutions and their riskmanagement ability, which prevents the emergence of losses and sustains their soundness. TheChecklist for Risk Management is used as a handbook by examiners when assessing the riskmanagement capability of financial institutions. Simultaneously, with a view to smoothlycarrying out our on-site examination of risk management and to have a sufficient exchange ofopinions with the subject financial institution, the Bank requests the institutions concerned toevaluate their abilities using the Checklist at each examination.6The full text of this article is available on the Bank of Japan website at www.boj.or.jp/en/index.htm.
– 4 –BIS Review  104/1998Needless to say, financial institutions must take the initiative in establishing their own riskmanagement system based on their own judgment, hence the actual system will differ accordingto the individual institution’s management strategy and business performance. In this sense, theBank does not intend to apply the Checklist uniformly to all financial institutions, but will utilizeit giving full consideration to the situation of each bank.* * *Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Markets Turnover Survey (April 1998)Outline of SurveyIn April 1998, the Bank of Japan conducted the Foreign Exchange and Derivatives MarketsTurnover Survey. This survey is conducted once every three years by the central banks ormonetary authorities of participating countries and regions, and is coordinated by the Bank forInternational Settlements (BIS).7The April 1998 survey was conducted by the central banks or monetary authorities of 43countries and regions, which collected the data from approximately 3,200 reporting institutionsin total.8The Bank of Japan obtained the data from 255 Japanese banks, 101 foreign banks, 3 Japanesesecurities companies, 6 foreign securities companies, and 10 FX brokers.9The BIS will aggregate and publish the data collected from participating central banks ormonetary authorities on a global basis.In this survey, the foreign exchange transactions are classified into three instrument types, andderivatives activities are classified into five instrument types.10 Transactions of each type ofinstrument are further broken down by currency or currency pairs, category of counterparties, andlocation of counterparties (local or cross-border).The daily volume of turnover is adjusted for the local double-counting of transactions between7The first survey coordinated by the BIS started in 1986 for foreign exchange activity, and the derivativessection was added to the survey in 1995.8Participating countries and regions are as follows (the 26 countries and regions that participated in theprevious survey are underlined): Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile,China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India,Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.9Foreign exchange brokers are to report only foreign exchange transactions (including cross-currencyswaps and FX options), and securities companies are to report only derivatives activities.10Classification of transactions:(1) Foreign exchange activities:Spot, outright forwards, foreign exchange swaps(2) Derivatives activities:Interest rate-related derivatives: forward rate agreements (FRAs), interest rate swaps (IR swaps),interest rate options (IR options)Foreign exchange-related derivatives: cross-currency swaps, foreign exchange options (FXoptions)
– 5 –BIS Review  104/1998two reporting institutions in Japan. Meanwhile, double-counting of cross-border transactionsbetween two reporting institutions will be adjusted by the BIS. Thus, a simple aggregation of theresults of all participating countries and regions will not be equivalent to the global statisticsreleased by the BIS.* * *Regular Derivatives Market Statistics in Japan (Yoshikuni Statistics) (end-June 1998)Outline of SurveyThe central banks of the G-10 countries11 and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) havecombined efforts to introduce new global derivatives market statistics based on the “Proposalsfor Improving Global Derivatives Market Statistics (Yoshikuni Report)” published by the BIS inJuly 1996. The data were first collected at end-June 1998. In this paper, the Bank of Japanreleases the results of this first Regular Derivatives Market Statistics pertaining to Japan.12 TheBIS will later publish the global results of outstanding derivatives positions of the reportinginstitutions.The aim of the BIS in implementing a survey on global derivatives markets is to increase markettransparency and to facilitate monitoring by central banks of these markets in regard to themacroeconomic and macroprudential concerns through two reporting frameworks, the first beingsemiannual statistics on derivatives outstanding covering only primary dealers, and the secondbeing triennial statistics on derivatives turnover and outstanding covering a wider range ofdealers. This first release of the Regular Derivatives Market Statistics corresponds to the first,while the April 1995 Central Bank Survey of Derivatives Market Statistics13 and the succeedingApril 1998 Derivatives Market Turnover Survey – whose results in Japan are also published atthe same time – correspond to the second.The survey is based on the voluntary cooperation of reporting institutions, and 18 primary dealersparticipated from Japan (out of 75 institutions globally).The survey consists of data on consolidated outstanding derivatives positions (notional amounts,gross positive and negative market values) of the reporting institutions, broken down by four riskfactors (foreign exchange, interest rate, equity, and commodity), instrument, currency,counterparty type, and maturity.The main features of the survey results for Japan are summarized in the following annex.

– 6 –BIS Review  104/1998Bank of Japan’s Final Decisions on the RevisionIntroductionThe Bank of Japan compiled the flow of funds accounts (hereafter: FFA) first in 1958, coveringdata for the years from 1954 to 1957. Since 1996, it has been conducting a study aimed at thecomprehensive revision of the FFA. Based on this study, the Bank made provisional proposals ondetails of the revision in early 1997, inviting users of the statistics to submit their views andsuggestions to the Bank.14The comments submitted were generally in favor of the revision. They also indicated that usershoped to employ the new FFA as a tool for monitoring the effects of financial system reform (theso-called Japanese “Big Bang”) and the continuing internationalization of the financial market.With regard to the details of the proposed revision, some comments supported the Bank’sapproach, while others suggested alternatives relating to such aspects as sectoral and transactionclassifications, and the methods and format used for publishing the FFA.Substantial progress has been made with regard to the detailed treatment of Japan’s nationalaccounts and the availability of data, both of which were not entirely clear when the provisionalproposals for the revision were drafted. In conducting the study on the details of the revisionsince mid-1997, the Bank has kept these developments in mind and examined whether thecomments submitted meet such criteria as (1) appropriateness of statistical treatment and data-recording methods; and (2) the usefulness of revisions based on those comments. The Bank hasalso reviewed issues that were still undecided in the provisional proposals. The Bank’s finaldecisions made through the above process are shown in tables, and this paper tries to explain thethinking behind them.15Based on these final decisions, the Bank is now in the process of compiling the new statisticswith a view to publishing them in 1999.* * *Year 2000 Readiness in the Financial Industry in JapanIntroductionWith less than one and a half years before the year 2000, various industries in Japan are currentlymaking a wide range of efforts to address the “Year 2000 problem”. The Year 2000 problemarises because many computers and application programs recognize the year by the last twodigits instead of four. On January 1, 2000, those computers and application programs willrepresent the year as “00” and may assume the year to be 1900 instead of 2000. This can lead toincorrect processing of date-sensitive calculations by computers, which may cause disruptions incomputer systems.14For details, refer to “Revision of Japan’s Flow of Funds Accounts” in the August 1997 issue of theBank of Japan Quarterly Bulletin.15In addition to the points covered in this paper, numerous minor changes were made from the provisionalproposals. This paper covers only the major points, and detailed explanations of individual sectors andtransaction classifications will be provided separately.
– 7 –BIS Review  104/1998If computer disruptions materialize, the adverse effects on financial institutions will besubstantial because financial institutions rely heavily on computers, for example, host computersfor the main accounting systems and information systems, and decentralized systems (i.e. localarea networks [LANs] and personal computers [PCs]). If a financial institution fails to achieveYear 2000 readiness, it may not be able to confirm or manage settlement dates or transactiondata, calculate interest rates or carry out accounting procedures, which can be a potential threat toits fundamental business of taking deposits, extending loans, and carrying out settlements.There is a possible systemic risk if one financial institution or one payment and settlementsystem fails to achieve Year 2000 readiness. Banks and securities companies are mutuallyconnected through various payment and settlement systems for settling transactions. If a financialinstitution fails to achieve Year 2000 readiness, the computer disruption could be passed on toother ones through their interdependence in financial transactions and settlement. If a computerfailure due to a lack of Year 2000 readiness materializes in a settlement system, not onlyfinancial institutions but also end-users or customers will be affected because they may not beable to withdraw or transfer funds through cash dispenser (CD) and automated teller machine(ATM) networks.The Year 2000 problem could seriously affect the business of individual financial institutions aswell as the stability of payment and settlement systems. The Bank of Japan, with the cooperationof market participants, is therefore promoting Year 2000 readiness of individual financialinstitutions and payment and settlement systems.This paper discusses how Japan’s financial sector is addressing key issues of the Year 2000problem and provides information on its progress in achieving Year 2000 readiness.16 After anoverview of the results of the Year 2000 problem survey of financial institutions conducted bythe Bank of Japan in June 1998, the paper presents (1) plans for external tests of payment andsettlement systems; (2) global initiatives taken by international organizations including the Bankfor International Settlements (BIS); and (3) an upcoming issue.The paper focuses exclusively on the preparations being made by financial institutions andpayment and settlement systems for the Year 2000 problem. It does not deal with preparationsmade by social infrastructures, such as telecommunications or utilities that support computersystem operations, nor does it cover Year 2000 preparations of companies supplying hostcomputers and software, although these deserve careful attention of financial institutions.* * *16This paper was originally published in the form of a brochure on August 14, 1998.

BIS Review   102/1998Mr McDonough discusses issues of credit risk management and the level playing fieldSpeech by the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,and Chairman of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, Mr William J. McDonough, at aconference on “The Challenge of Credit Risk” in Frankfurt am Main on 24/11/98.I am pleased to be here today to discuss issues of credit risk management and the level playingfield. This conference on credit risk provides a focal point for discussion at a time when thecredit risk management process is undergoing rapid change. I congratulate President Tietmeyer,the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Zeitschrift fuer das gesamte Kreditwesen on bringing ustogether for this thought-provoking program.Ensuring a level playing field was one of the two major goals of developing the Basle CapitalAccord, the other being to ensure a safe and sound banking system through adequate capital. TheBasle Committee now is engaged in a fundamental review of the Accord, and one importantaspect receiving careful consideration is the changed landscape of the playing field since 1988.The supervisors’ interest in the playing field, to be sure, is not limited to the nature of the playersand their competitive positions. Given the importance of credit and liquidity to the overalleconomy, supervisors also have a strong interest in the broader issues of how capital rules willaffect the shape and functioning of the financial markets overall.One implication is already clear -- that the capital rules need to have the broadest possibleapplicability to be effective not just to meet both goals of the Basle Accord, but also to ensure thesoundness and stability of the financial system more generally. Thus, after describing some of thechallenges in designing a 21st century capital framework for an altered playing field, I willaddress two broad risk management considerations. The first is how competition has beenreshaping the credit cycle in the recent past. I believe strongly that increased competition hasraised the ante for financial institutions and supervisors alike in their need to develop improvedtools to assess risk and to evaluate the relationship between risk and return. The second is howcompetition is redistributing credit risk in the financial system and how that affects the credit riskthat remains with financial institutions. Here, too, I believe that competition has raised the stakesfor all financial institutions, and banks in particular, in their need for a comprehensive andconsistent credit strategy across all product lines. Moreover, these changes have implications forthe supervision of capital adequacy, and not only the design of a regulatory minimum capitalstandard, an issue I will return to later.Changes in CompetitionThe competitive landscape of the credit markets has shifted dramatically in the decade since theannouncement of the Basle Accord. Three features in particular stand out. First, internationalcompetition now reaches banks in developed and emerging market countries alike, even in whatwere previously thought to be solely domestic markets. Second, large banks now compete head-to-head with nonbank financial institutions, especially securities firms, in a variety of productmarkets globally. Probably nothing has underscored the extent of this head-to-head competitionmore than the entry of investment banks into the syndicated lending business in the mid-1990sand the subsequent erosion of spreads and nonprice lending terms, while commercial banks haveentered the high-yield bond underwriting business.Third, the relationship between banks and their highest quality government and businesscustomers has changed, to varying extents in different countries. Even here in Germany, the
– 2 –BIS Review   102/1998country virtually holding the patent on the concept of Hausbank, we see change. Whether inGermany or elsewhere, customers have turned to the capital markets to obtain less costlyfinancing. The top-rated customers often provide more business to banks in foreign exchangeand over-the-counter derivatives than in traditional lending. In addition, large nonbank pools ofcapital, such as mutual funds and pension funds, have shown an increasing appetite for less thaninvestment-grade securities, at least until recently. These nonbank pools of capital themselvesrepresent one of the most important forces reshaping the playing field, since they significantlyerode the historical comparative advantage of banks in bearing credit risk.International competition and nonbank competition have clear implications for the future capitalframework if it is to meet the goal of a level playing field. We must ensure that bank supervisorsin every country have in place meaningful minimum capital requirements based on a commonnotion of bank soundness and the power to enforce those requirements. With respect to minimumcapital requirements, it seems unlikely that one size will fit all. We can, however, strive todevelop a capital framework in which banks bearing similar risks face similar levels of minimumcapital while complying with requirements that are appropriate to the bank’s activities and levelof sophistication. Analogously, a long-run goal of bank and nonbank supervisors alike should beto put their capital regimes on a more nearly common conceptual footing -- not necessarily withidentical requirements, but with a greater degree of comparability.Risk, Return and the Credit CycleIncreasing competitive pressures and the changed playing field have contributed to importantchanges in the dynamics of credit markets. A concern for supervisors is the tendency of creditmarkets to bid down spreads rather sharply in the optimistic phase of the credit cycle, often to thepoint where returns no longer seem commensurate with risk. Then, as problems emerge, lendersin the credit markets pull back and cause spreads to reverse sharply. This is by no means alwaysa simple, up and down process. I recall the bumpy landing of the high-yield bond and leveragedbuyout lending markets in the United States at the end of the 1980s. After several liquidityinterruptions resulting from failed deals in the late 1980s, the market finally settled into apronounced downturn which culminated in the failure of Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990 andsubstantial losses from bridge loans and leveraged buyout credits at many securities firms andbanks.Those events from the late 1980s illustrate market dynamics which have been repeated more thanonce in the last decade -- in Latin American investment and lending in the mid-1990s, forexample, and in Asia, Russia, and related markets in the late 1990s. Credit to highly leveragedhedge funds and similar institutions probably falls into this pattern as well. The common themeis an initial rapid expansion of credit accompanied by falling spreads, followed by a curtailmentof activity and a dramatic widening of spreads. Usually, market participants suffer substantiallosses in that second phase. Often it seems that the longer and more buoyant the optimistic phaseof the cycle, the greater the damage when the pessimistic phase sets in.After the early 1990s, when many banks experienced severe credit losses, some set aboutidentifying ways to better assess and control credit risks. That early 1990s experience appears tohave sharpened the awareness of banks of the asymmetric and cyclical nature of returns in creditmarkets. That is, credit involves a limited upside and a large potential downside, with thepotential depth of the downside becoming convincingly apparent only after the downturn hasbegun.
– 3 –BIS Review   102/1998The losses in the early 1990s prompted banks to find new methods to evaluate both the risks andthe returns in credit activities. These methods included more refined internal rating systems todescribe credit quality, analysis of historical loss rates, default probability models, portfoliocredit risk models and, more recently, stress testing. As new tools are developed, they are beingcombined with others to refine the bank’s understanding of its credit risk relative to its return.Because the returns in credit activities are asymmetric and cyclical, new approaches to measuringand analyzing credit risk easily become data-intensive and analytically complex.Can we moderate the sharp turns in the credit cycle? I believe that targeting returnscommensurate with risk over an appropriately long time horizon is probably the single mostimportant defense against the violent swings in the credit cycle experienced in the 1980s and1990s. Individual banks can protect themselves if they recognize when margins become too thinto cover risk by restraining their credit activities at those rates, and they can benefit by expandingthem when returns have risen enough to cover risk once again.To limit those market swings, however, the discipline of seeking returns commensurate withrisks has to be practiced widely and consistently throughout the financial system. While a singlebank may protect itself in the first instance from making loans that allow a borrower tooverextend itself, the borrower may still be able to borrow elsewhere, to the detriment of itscurrent lenders.Risk-return discipline is achievable with even the most basic tools. Discipline has been greatlyenhanced at some large, international banks by the simple comparison of credit spreads withhistorical loss rates on well-defined categories of credit. A useful approach to furthering risk-return analysis is the enhancement of methods to assign internal risk ratings to individual creditexposures. Ratings have long been seen as powerful summary indicators of risk, but a fresh burstof activity appears underway, in which some banks have increased the number of ratingcategories in order to sharpen distinctions within the credit portfolio. Some banks also areexploring the possibility of validating their internal ratings through the use of information fromthe equities markets.Finer risk distinctions, when they reflect the likelihood of default, deterioration and loss, offerbanks the possibility of more accurate pricing. An article in the August 1998 Federal ReserveBulletin provides some evidence of that. Based on data from some 250 U.S. banks and 29 foreignbanking organizations, the authors found that the relationship between internal ratings andpricing was very similar to the credit rating and pricing relationships that exist in the bondmarket, especially for high-grade customers.Banks which are developing credit models are doing so to deepen their understanding andanalysis of the relationship between risk and return in credit activities at the portfolio level. Thedevelopers of models believe that, when well thought out, soundly estimated, and designed tocapture the relationships between the risks of individual exposures, credit risk models producerisk measures that can reflect portfolio diversification or the lack of it. Such credit models alsooffer the ability to look at the marginal risk and the marginal return of adding a new transactionto an existing credit portfolio, or removing an old one, allowing a credit officer to understandbetter whether a loan diversifies the bank’s portfolio or increases its concentration.Taken together, these new tools are expanding the capacity to run realistic stress tests and get afuller picture of credit risk. Stress testing is the leading technique to assess the direct and indirecteffects of unusual market and economic events. It is fundamentally a qualitative and judgmentalprocess, usually superimposed on a more formal, statistical approach to risk measurement.
– 4 –BIS Review   102/1998Management’s goal is to identify scenarios, usually low-probability, high-stress events, thatcould jeopardize the health of the bank. While stress testing has gained prominence in theseturbulent times, running “what if” scenarios and following up with management actions has longbeen a hallmark of excellent financial management.Although stress testing of market risk exposures has been developing rapidly for several years,credit risk stress testing until recently has been a more difficult, manual process. The descriptionof credit exposures through internal ratings and the use of risk models helps to automate theprocess, allowing the bank to analyze a larger number of scenarios in more depth. Such stresstests begin at the level of the individual credit or obligor, where able credit officers have long hadthe ability to identify scenarios most likely to have an adverse effect on the borrower orcounterparty. Stress tests then can be taken to the portfolio level to measure the broader effects ofadverse market and economic conditions. I believe the real key to this kind of analysis is notextensive data-crunching but fully understanding the credit strategies of the bank and wherethose strategies may be vulnerable.Analyzing Risk and Return as Part of the Supervisory ProcessWhile these new methods of assessing risk and return are to a large extent works in progress,they are likely to have great value well before they are perfected -- if they ever can be perfected.The use of new methods -- initially as a complement to more traditional approaches -- is often apowerful test of their efficacy. For example, many bankers feel that their market risk modelswere not helpful enough in clearly identifying the risks that generated losses in the marketturbulence of the last 18 months and have begun an assessment of their performance. As a resultof that review, it is likely that banks will modify their models and the way they use them, mostespecially by placing more emphasis on and expanding stress testing. Moreover, many areconsidering ways to integrate the analysis of major risk categories given the links between thoserisks revealed in the recent market turmoil, such as the link between market and credit lossesassociated with the Russian default.As banks use and continue to refine new frameworks for evaluating risk and return, a naturalquestion for supervisors is what use they should make of the new approaches. Let me suggestthree reasons why we supervisors should devote attention to them in our own supervisory -- incontrast to regulatory -- activities, and sooner rather than later.First, by using new methods of relating risk and return, we come to better understand themeasures themselves, as well as how the bank understands what risks it is taking and why.Understanding the bank’s perception of its performance and comparing it with the supervisor’sperspective is a crucial first step to effective supervision and the resolution of problems.Second, if we believe that a more rigorous consideration of return relative to risk is a crucialdiscipline for banks and the financial system, we need to know whether an appropriately rigorousdecision-making process is in place and well-functioning. This requires supervisors to considernot only asset quality, that is, the risk in the portfolio, but also the bank’s pricing process. Thisbroader consideration of both risk and return may then suggest new methods to supplement ordeepen our current, well-established approaches to judging the adequacy of credit loss reservesand capital based on the review of asset quality.Supervisors traditionally have stayed away from forming judgments about the pricing of credit.In part, this stemmed from an appropriate desire to avoid interfering with the basic market forcesthat set prices for individual credits, and we must continue to avoid such interference. However,
– 5 –BIS Review   102/1998asset quality alone cannot answer the question of how well a bank manages its credit risk, since itsheds no light on whether the bank is adequately compensated for its expected losses and its risk.Third, new, more incisive measures of risk open up the possibility to increase the comparabilityacross banks. One of our greatest advantages as supervisors is our ability to look acrossinstitutions and compare them. The better we can estimate the risk in financial institutions, withthese and other measures, the more powerful our comparisons, especially cross-institutionalcomparisons of risk management, earnings, liquidity management, loan loss reserves, and, ofcourse, capital adequacy. To the extent that banks also disclose robust measures of these risks,market participants will be able to make the same kind of comparisons and exert greaterdiscipline on financial institutions.The Importance of a Comprehensive Credit Risk StrategyA bank’s choices about risk and return lie at the heart of developing a credit strategy. Choosing acredit strategy has become more challenging in light of changing competition, not only becauselarger financial institutions have become more diversified and global, but also because themarket distributes credit risk far differently than it did a decade ago. Institutional investors andother nonbank financial institutions hold a larger share of assets and a larger share of credit riskthan they did earlier. While this is notoriously difficult to measure, given the many changes inthe financial system over the last 10 years, a recent study on systemic risk by the Euro-currencyStanding Committee under the G-10 Central Bank Governors documents a shift of financialactivity away from the traditional banking sector in many countries.While an increasing share of conventional credit risk is being intermediated through the capitalmarkets, over time larger banks have increased their involvement in intermediating other risks --market, operational and settlement risks, for example. Experience is showing us that thisintermediation of other risks appears always to involve some element of credit risk. It may beexplicit credit risk-taking in the form of margin lending, or transactions in the over-the-counterderivatives business, which is basically a credit business. It may take more subtle forms, such asthe short-term credit risks in futures brokerage, where the clearing broker stands between thecustomer and the exchange, or the often underestimated but substantial credit risks in settlingforeign exchange contracts. Credit risk may derive from operational risks, buried deep in thedetails of specific operations which make use of intraday funding or other very short-lived credit.In its broadest definition, credit risk may take the form of the reputational risk that stems frominvolvement with the wrong customer in a deposit transaction.Underappreciated and unconventional credit risks have been a theme in major market eventssince the stock market break in 1987. Such surprises include losses and temporary gridlock inclearance and settlement associated with the stock market break in 1987, the failures of Drexeland Barings, and the emergence of large credit exposures in non-deliverable forwards,repurchase agreements and derivatives associated with emerging market currencies andgovernment securities over the last year.Credit risk at large banks therefore appears to be becoming less traditional and more complex innature. That in turn heightens the urgency of the need for every bank to study and update itsbroad credit strategy. Such a strategy would cover the types of customers, the acceptablerelationship between risks and returns, the role of active portfolio management and the degree ofdiversification that the bank would seek in its businesses. In the days when the predominantcredit business in the bank was lending, credit strategy could be largely a matter of the lendingarea’s business plan. Today, however, the board of directors and senior management of a
– 6 –BIS Review   102/1998financial institution need to know that their strategy covers the many activities of the bank inwhich credit exposure, wherever it is found, is a significant risk.One lesson we can take away from the events of the last 18 months is that the bank’s creditstrategy needs to take explicit account of downside scenarios and stress events. Over the last fewmonths, as markets were most unsettled, supervisors and central banks became concerned thatbanks and other financial intermediaries would not perform their crucial intermediation role. Isee it as important that credit strategy in a bank reflects an analysis of potential vulnerabilities ofmajor customers or groups of customers and consideration of reasonable actions the bank couldtake when distressed circumstances occur. When difficult times as well as good times arefactored into the credit strategy, bank management is in a stronger position to develop its plansfor capital and liquidity.Supervisors can pay more attention to the bank’s credit strategy, for the same three reasons Icited earlier: to promote sound practices, to ensure that those sound practices are in place and tostrengthen our basis for comparisons across banks. Supervisors can explore ways to increase thecoherence in the review of credit risk management across the bank, especially to ensure that bankmanagement has articulated a comprehensive credit risk strategy and is measuring itsperformance against it. Supervisors also can verify that seasoned credit judgment as well astechnical analysis is reflected in the credit-granting and monitoring process for trading activities.Many problems of the last 18 months might have been reduced or avoided by more in-depthquestioning of the business purpose or strategy of transactions.Credit Risk Management and CapitalLet me talk about one last area in which the bank’s risk-return discipline within a comprehensivecredit strategy matters. That is the assessment of capital adequacy. My comments here aredirected less at minimum capital standards than at the way supervisors form judgments about abank’s capital adequacy.For virtually all banks, credit remains the single largest risk. Credit remains a difficult risk tooffset, despite advances in credit hedging techniques, and even diversification has its limitations.As banks think through their own capital adequacy, how they factor in their credit risk profile hasa major impact on the amount of capital they will need.Capital supports the credit risk-bearing activities of the bank in many ways. Clearly, togetherwith reserves, capital should protect the bank against expected and unexpected losses in thecredit portfolio, including losses related to reasonable and plausible stress scenarios. But capitalalso protects the bank against its business risk, that is, the risk that a bank will lose groundrelative to its competitors or competing products, and fail to earn a market rate of return in abusiness. Capital also provides a cushion against the enormous costs of fast-paced technologicalchange, especially in the information systems arena. For example, consider the urgency and therising cost estimates of Year 2000 remediation, testing and contingency planning efforts.It follows that every bank needs to assess its risk profile and evaluate what capital it needs tocope with adverse outcomes in normal times and under reasonable stress scenarios. Many bankshave started to do so. At some banks, the starting point for that analysis is a set of assessments ofmarket, credit and perhaps operational risk, with some method for adding them up. Anotherapproach might be to build up capital needs business by business, using peer analysis orinformation from the equities markets. Other approaches are conceivable.
– 7 –BIS Review   102/1998Such self-assessments of capital adequacy appear to be an important step toward introducing newmethods of risk evaluation into the capital process. As bank management works through its self-assessment, I would encourage participation by its supervisors, so that management andsupervisors have the opportunity to compare perspectives on the nature and amount of the bank’srisks, the quality of its risk management, and the adequacy of its capital.I see informed supervisory review of capital adequacy self-assessments as one part of a three-partframework for capital supervision that consists of a minimum capital requirement, hands-onsupervision and enhanced market discipline. The Basle Committee’s Steering Group on theFuture of Capital, chaired by Claes Norgren of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority,plans to bring its thinking on the Capital Accord to the December meeting of the full Committee.The Committee is committed to undertaking substantial work in 1999 in order to be able topublish a consultative paper with its proposals toward the end of 1999, with the goal ofbeginning the transition to a new capital framework roughly a year later.Of course, some of the many minimum capital standard options being studied by the SteeringGroup make use of the new tools of risk-return evaluation I’ve discussed today, such as internalratings and credit models. My message today is that we can begin now to place more emphasison risk-return discipline with an appropriately long time horizon and on a comprehensive creditstrategy both in the risk management processes at banks and in our own supervisory process.And we should not allow making further progress in the risk management arena to be dependenton the outcome of discussions of an appropriate minimum capital standard.As we move forward with the review and revision of the Accord, we plan to stresscommunication with banking supervisors globally and with supervisors in other key financialindustries, such as securities and insurance. We have an especially strong interest in ensuring thatthe capital framework we develop meets the needs of banking supervisors outside the G-10countries. At the meeting of the International Conference of Banking Supervisors in Sydney lastmonth, regional associations of banking supervisors discussed the obstacles and challenges theyface in implementing the Basle Committee’s Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.That discussion underscored the importance of simplicity, clarity and continuity with existingapproaches for supervisors in many parts of the world.A parallel dialogue also is necessary with the broad financial community. We will need theirinput and participation to enable us to develop the structure and key elements of a capitalframework, understand its efficacy and incentive effects, and evaluate its robustness. Ourintention is to begin an active dialogue with the industry in the next few months, so as to havetheir involvement from the beginning. That dialogue, I hope, can be extended to rating agenciesand securities analysts, who play an important role in market discipline.  To conclude, the BasleCommittee on Banking Supervision has taken on a challenging agenda; the work on the futurecapital framework is likely to involve all of the Committee’s working groups and a large part ofits resources. We look forward to the challenge in the coming year. Our hope is to see throughthe complexity of financial activity and the variety of supervisory needs across countries andfinancial institutions in order to identify the most simple, straightforward outlines of a capitalframework. If we can identify that framework, we can differentiate it and apply it to banks at thecutting edge of financial engineering or those new to the international markets, to banks large orsmall, and to nonbank financial institutions.Ideally, I believe such a framework will include an approach to quantitative capital requirementsthat offers the possibility of translating our expectations for all types of financial institutionsacross countries; integrating the quantitative capital requirements with a set of qualitative
– 8 –BIS Review   102/1998expectations for banks in managing their risk and evaluating their capital needs; and relying asmuch as possible on market discipline, with emphasis on transparency and disclosure.We will actively seek your suggestions and reactions.
BIS Review   101/1998Mr Bäckström reports on the current situation for monetary policy in SwedenSpeech by the Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr Urban Bäckström, to the StandingCommittee on Finance in Stockholm on 13/11/98.First a word of thanks to the Committee for the invitation to discuss the current situation formonetary policy. A good deal has happened in the global economy since our previous discussionwith the Committee last March. The crisis in the emerging markets in Asia, regarded initially as aregional concern, has continued to spread, first to emerging markets in other parts of the worldand then, mainly via financial markets, to the industrialised countries. This has altered theeconomic climate.The Swedish economy in perspectiveFive years with good growth and low inflationLet us begin, however, by shifting our attention from recent events and noting that since thecrisis in the early 1990s, economic development in Sweden has been rather good. Relatively highgrowth has been combined with a rate of inflation that has remained low. Since the summer of1993, total output (GDP) has been rising at an average annual rate of almost 3%. That more orless matches the growth rate during the upswing in the 1980s (Fig. 1).Fig. 1It is markedly higher, however, than the average annual rate of 2% which was achieved in thetwo decades from 1970 and 1990; it also exceeds what can be regarded as the sustainable long-term rate. One important reason why inflation could still be kept at a low level in recent years isthat in this period the economy has had a reserve of unutilised capacity. That, in turn, is aconsequence of the deep recession that preceded the upswing, plus the fact that the growth ofcapacity has been high. Moreover, inflation expectations have gradually stabilised around the 2%inflation target (Fig. 2). Recently, however, and in certain earlier periods, transitory price012319951996199719980123CPI and Underlying Inflationyearly averageCPIUnderlying inflation Domestic underlying inflationSource: Statistics Sweden
– 2 –BIS Review   101/1998movements have brought the average annual change in the consumer price index (CPI) justoutside the inflation target’s lower tolerance interval.Fig. 2Large transitory price effectsThe nature of transitory price effects and the appropriate monetary policy response were mattersthat I discussed in detail with the Committee last March. So now I shall simply reiterate theRiksbank’s view that as long as more long-term inflation expectations are unaffected, transitoryprice movements should be a subordinate consideration in monetary policy. A contrary opinionwould necessitate drastic monetary policy measures that might have destabilising effects onoutput and employment, which is clearly undesirable. In theory, a CPI change figure that ishigher than the current 0.4% could of course be engineered simply by raising the interest rate.That would fuel CPI inflation via higher house mortgage rates. It need hardly be said that that isnot the way to conduct monetary policy. It should be borne in mind that a monetary policy targetformulated in terms of the change in the CPI has major advantages. The CPI is a broad and well-known measure of inflation. But the construction of the CPI does pose problems, not least forthis Committee, when it comes to assessing monetary policy’s past performance. This will bestill more important if the Riksbank is accorded the independent status which the Riksdag(Sweden’s parliament) will shortly be voting on. The use of a target variable, such as the CPI,which necessitates frequent reference to factors that cause temporary deviations, is not an idealsolution. There are grounds for supposing, however, that sizeable transient price movements ofthe type we have experienced recently are not commonplace. They derive predominantly fromthe marked improvement in recent years in economic policy’s credibility. There have been fewperiods in the past when, for example, house mortgage rates have dropped from about 14% to thepresent level around 5%. So the problems with targeting CPI inflation should not be exaggerated.In order to facilitate the assessment of monetary policy, the Riksbank has arranged for StatisticsSweden to supplement its CPI statistics with figures for various indicators of underlyinginflation. Another matter to bear in mind is the lag before monetary policy measures affect theeconomy.

– 3 –BIS Review   101/1998central bank is not capable of bringing inflation directly back on target in the following month.That is why the central bank needs to present an inflation forecast, which has two mainadvantages. One is that the central bank can be explicit about the time horizon at which inflationis to be returned to the target. The other is that people in general can judge for themselveswhether monetary policy can be considered to be properly balanced. If the forecast deviates fromthe inflation target at the time horizon at which monetary policy exerts its main effect – 12 to 24months – then the instrumental rate has to be adjusted.Jobless growthAlthough Sweden has experienced five years of good economic growth, there has been nocorresponding reduction of unemployment. The picture since 1993 speaks for itself: a clearupturn in the output curve, while the low level of employment is still virtually unchanged(Fig. 3). This suggests that neither low demand nor a poor growth potential are primarilyresponsible for the weak development of employment.Fig. 3Part of the problem with employment may be that much of the growth in the past five yearsseems to have occurred in sectors that are capital-intensive. More balanced growth in the futurewould presumably result in stronger demand for labour. But the weak employment trendprobably also stems from more fundamental factors. For several decades now, the generalstructure of business activities in Sweden has tended to move towards a growing input of capitalat the expense of labour. The fact that certain countries have achieved a sustained improvementin employment is often explained not so much by high growth as by a production process that hasbeen generally more labour-intensive. If an economy is characterised by the combination of high,stable growth and weak employment, this points to the existence of structural problems. It shouldbe added that Sweden shares the problem of jobless growth with other countries in Europe,though not with all.GDP and Employmentseasonally-adjusted data, index: Q3 1980=100,Source: Statistics Sweden801001201408284868890929496989095100105110115GDP (left scale)Employment (right scale)
– 4 –BIS Review   101/1998Monetary policy to dateWarning lights a year agoA year ago there were many indications that economic growth in Sweden would continue at ahigh rate. It also looked as though capacity utilisation would rise in the coming years and lead tosome increase in inflation. The crisis in Asia was expected to ease inflationary pressure to someextent but not sufficiently. As most of the warning lights were thus blinking red, the Riksbankadjusted its policy stance; in December 1997 the repo rate was raised from 4.10 to 4.35%. In mystatement to this Committee in October 1997, I described the planned policy realignment as amovement from an expansionary to a more neutral monetary stance. It amounted to keeping theeconomy moving at the rate which is structurally feasible, not to arresting its movement. Agradual monetary policy adjustment would bring the path of growth into line with the sustainablelong-term trend, thereby protecting the economy from capacity shortages and inflation. A smallinterest rate increase at an early stage was intended to prevent problems from arising later on andrequiring larger interest hikes to bring inflation back to the targeted rate. In this way, both theprice level and growth would be more stable. In the December 1997 Inflation Report, however,we included a risk scenario that pointed to lower inflation compared with the main scenario. Wenoted: “As regards inflation, however, a substantial impact from the economic crisis in Asia doespresuppose that the situation deteriorates so much that international activity is seriouslyweakened.” As things turned out, the effects of the Asian crisis did exceed our assumption forthe main scenario. During the first half of this year the main assessment was revised successivelydownwards. As a result, the monetary policy adjustment did not continue as envisaged earlier. Inview of the risks of a weaker trend, the repo rate was left unchanged during the spring. Inconnection with the June Inflation Report, the Riksbank concluded that inflation prospects hadchanged; our inflation forecast, based on an unchanged repo rate, pointed to a rate of priceincreases 12 to 24 months ahead that was below the 2% target. In accordance with theRiksbank’s procedure, at the beginning of the summer the repo rate was therefore lowered from4.35% to 4.10%.Increased financial market unrest and lower international growthIn the September Inflation Report the Riksbank noted that the real economic situation was stillrelatively bright. In our main scenario, growth was expected to remain stable while inflationslowly moved up towards the target in the coming one to two years. However, this path forinflation did start from a lower level. The risk of slower international growth on account of theAsian crisis had grown but the picture was also complicated by the marked weakening of thekrona, which could have a contrary effect on inflation. In the current exchange rate regime, theRiksbank does not target the level of the exchange rate but this is still one of the factors that hasto be weighed into the assessment of future inflation. In the context of monetary policy, the mostpertinent aspect in recent years has proved to be the extent to which the exchange rate affectsinflation via its impact on production, primarily in the export sector. The effects that a weakerexchange rate may have on import prices should be a secondary consideration, along with othertransitory price movements, as long as more long-term inflation expectations are unaffected.During September and part of October – before and immediately after the publication of theInflation Report – the monetary policy environment was turbulent and difficult to assess. Neitherwas the uncertainty confined to the international scene. It also came from the general election inSweden and the future direction of fiscal policy. All in all, this prompted the Riksbank to keepthe repo rate unchanged. The possibility of a lower rate would be considered when inflationprospects were clearer. During the autumn the financial unrest continued to grow. The RussianGovernment’s suspension of payments in mid August and the problems that emerged in late
– 5 –BIS Review   101/1998September with the U.S. hedge fund Long Term Capital Management contributed to the muchmore nervous atmosphere. Share prices dropped around the world and the financial crisis wenton spreading to other emerging markets that had previously been spared. There was a risk thatthe falling stock markets and the wider extent of the crisis would elicit effects via decreasedexport demand and more cautious behaviour among consumers and firms. At the same time, theproblems with Long Term Capital Management aroused fears of a considerably more serious riskthat had not attracted so much attention earlier – the risk of banks becoming so cautious withcredit that this, by itself, would paralyse the global economy. When the banks are bent onreducing exposures and slimming balance sheets in order to avoid loan losses, borrowers haveless access to capital. If risk aversion becomes unduly pronounced, even sound borrowers areliable to be hit, with serious effects on the total level of activity in the global economy. One signof an imminent credit squeeze was the growing spread in market interest rates between thesoundest borrowers and others. In this way it was envisaged that the financial crisis would havenegative effects on the real economy. Forecasters altered their assessments and the globalprospects for growth and inflation were revised downwards. The Riksbank likewise adjusted itsassessment of developments in the rest of the world.The current monetary stanceRepo rate cut on 3 NovemberThe assessment that growth in the rest of the world will be weaker than we counted on earlier ledthe Riksbank to conclude that with an unchanged repo rate, in the coming 12 to 24 months therate of inflation would be below the target. Resource utilisation would be lower and inflationarypressure would decrease. Signs of this were discernible in recent statistics: net exports hadweakened, stocks were accumulating and corporate borrowing was rising somewhat moreslowly. The financial unrest had also had some negative impact on household confidence, whichcould mean that consumption rises more slowly than expected earlier. The effects on inflationfrom the slowing tendencies were judged to be greater than the stimulus from the weakerexchange rate. Moreover, the financial market unrest had tended to subside. Under thesecircumstances, on 3rd November the Riksbank lowered the repo rate 25 basis points to 3.85%. Itshould be noted that the Riksbank’s downward revision of demand and inflation prospects in theSwedish economy is not dramatic. In the September Inflation Report the path for inflation wasalready below 2% for much of the forecast period. But the revision is of an order that affectsconditions for the Riksbank’s operations. In order to provide more room for manoeuvre in theformation of monetary policy, yesterday the Governing Board decided to lower the corridorsurrounding the repo rate: the deposit rate was reduced by 0.5 percentage points to 3.25% and thelending rate likewise 0.5 percentage points to 4.75%. The concern about an involuntarycontraction of credit – and the serious consequences it might have – has also prompted thecentral banks to heighten surveillance of the financial system. For the Riksbank this concernscontacts with the major banks as well as increased oversight of bank financing in cooperationwith the Financial Supervisory Authority. On the whole, the Swedish banking system appears tobe stable. This conclusion is elaborated in the year’s second Financial Market Report, which wepublished yesterday. Lending to the most problem-burdened countries is relatively low.Moreover, the banks have built up liquidity reserves as a precaution against a worsening of thesituation in the international markets. The supply of credit in the Swedish market does not appearto have suffered to date. Neither has the Riksbank seen any indications that the Swedish banksintend to curtail their lending to domestic sectors. Recently the global financial unrest seems tohave become somewhat less pronounced. It is difficult to tell whether this could be a sign of thecalm associated with being in a hurricane’s eye – whether the international financial turbulencewill return or whether the cyclone is receding. The Riksbank is therefore continuing to analyse
– 6 –BIS Review   101/1998the banking system with heightened readiness until the situation has become more stable. Thecourse of events in the international arena has warranted measures of a short-term nature in orderto safeguard the functioning of the global financial system. Interest rates have been reducedrecently in a number of countries, for example. In the longer term, work must focus on theconstruction of international rules and systems that limit the risk of – and preferably prevent –crises of this type from happening at all. What has happened reveals clear shortcomings in howthe global financial system functions. But it should also be underscored that “free trade” in thefinancial domain can very probably confer large welfare gains, just as free trade does in the caseof goods and services. The conditions for forecasting in general and for inflation-targetingmonetary policy in particular have been illustrated by what has happened in recent years. A set ofindicators has to be relied on in an endeavour to form a definite opinion about futuredevelopments. Central banks are unfortunately not in a position to wait for a complete picturebefore acting. It takes time for our actions to elicit their full effect; when all the pieces of thepuzzle are finally available, the time for action has passed. The continuous fulfilment of themonetary policy target would then probably require more drastic measures; such a near-sightedpolicy would lead to greater economic instability. The course of the Asian crisis and itscontagious effects in the industrialised countries is having a larger impact than we counted onearlier. I cannot rule out the possibility that in order to fulfil the inflation target, furtheradjustments of the monetary stance will be called for in the same direction as recently. A weakerdevelopment in the rest of the world also affects conditions in Sweden.
BIS Review   100/1998Mr Duisenberg reports on the current position and future prospects of the EuropeanSystem of Central BanksKeynote address to the President of the European Central Bank, Dr W.F. Duisenberg, at aconference organised by the Royal Institute of International Affairs on European Economic andMonetary Union Markets and Politics under the euro in London on 27/11/98.IntroductionLadies and Gentlemen, I should like to express my appreciation at being invited to deliver aspeech at this conference organised by the Royal Institute of International Affairs. It is a greatpleasure for me to be here, in London, today.The topic I am going to address relates to the current position and the future prospects of theEuropean System of Central Banks. I feel that this topic provides me with an opportunity to dealwith the objective of the ESCB and its contribution to the other policies in the Community. I willalso briefly touch upon the decision-making in the ESCB, recall the main features of ourmonetary policy strategy and talk about our regard for openness and transparency. The final partof my talk will cover the views of the ESCB on recent economic developments and the futureoutlook for price stability in the euro area.Independence, transparency and accountabilityIn the Maastricht Treaty the ESCB has been given an independent status. The reason is thatpoliticians all over the world have come round to the view that monetary policy decisions takenwith too close a political involvement tend to take too short a time horizon into consideration.The consequence is that in the longer term such decisions do not support sustainable gains inemployment and income, but only lead to higher inflation. This view is confirmed by a host ofeconomic research.Independence, however, requires a clear mandate. The ESCB has such a mandate. Its primaryobjective is to maintain price stability. Without prejudice to the objective of price stability theESCB will support the general economic policies in the Community. Price stability is not an endin itself: it creates the conditions in which other, higher-order, objectives can be reached. Inparticular, I share the deep concerns about the unacceptably high level of unemployment inEurope. The ESCB will do what it can to contribute to the solution of this problem. Bymaintaining price stability inflation expectations and interest rates can be kept at a low level.This creates a stability-oriented environment which fosters sustainable growth, a high level ofemployment, a fair society and better living standards. Moreover, in specific circumstances, ifproduction, inflation and employment all move in the same direction, monetary policy can playsome role in stabilising output and employment growth without endangering price stability.However, the contribution from monetary policy can generally be only limited. Given thestructural nature of the unemployment problems the solution is to be found, above all, instructural reforms aimed at well-functioning labour and product markets.An independent central bank does not only need a clear mandate. It has also to be an open andtransparent institution, for at least three reasons. First, transparency enhances the effectiveness ofmonetary policy by creating the correct expectations on the part of economic agents. Apredictable monetary policy contributes to achieving stable prices without significant adjustmentcosts and with the lowest interest rate possible. The second reason is that in a democratic society
– 2 –BIS Review   100/1998the central bank has to account for its policies. Finally, transparency towards the outside worldcan also structure and discipline the internal debate inside the central bank.Let me now turn to the ways and means of achieving transparency. As a first element the ESCBhas defined a quantitative objective for price stability. It reads as follows: price stability is a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below2%. Although I do not consider deflation to be likely in the current environment, I may add that asituation of falling prices would not be consistent with price stability.The Governing Council has made it clear that “price stability is to be maintained over themedium term”. The ESCB cannot be held accountable for short-run deviations from pricestability, for example due to shocks in import prices or specific fiscal measures. A monetarypolicy reaction to short-run fluctuations in the price level would provide the wrong signals to themarket and cause unnecessary interest rate volatility. In summary, the ESCB will react in anappropriate, measured and, when necessary, gradualist manner to economic disturbances thatthreaten price stability in the medium term, rather than in an abrupt way, in order to avoidunnecessary disruptions of the process of economic growth. That said, the ESCB will, whenevernecessary, openly discuss and explain the sources of possible deviations from the quantitativedefinition of price stability.In addition, let me remind you that by focusing on the HICP for the euro area, the ESCB makes itclear that it will base its decisions on monetary, economic and financial developments in the euroarea as a whole. The single monetary policy has to take a euro area-wide perspective: it will notreact to specific regional or national developments.The institutional implication is that the ESCB should develop into a strong unity, with a strongcentre and strong national central banks. It should become a truly European institution, with atruly European outlook. Of course, it may take some time to arrive where we ultimately want tobe. We have to get used to thinking in euro area-wide terms. In the ECB Governing Council weare already “practising” that approaches and are making progress. I am confident that the ESCBwill indeed act as a unity.Transparency and openness will be apparent from the way in which the ESCB communicateswith the public. The ESCB will regularly present its assessment of the monetary, economic andfinancial situation in the euro area and provide information about each specific monetary policydecision, be it a move in interest rates or an absence of change. This will notably be done by wayof press releases, press conferences, publications and speeches. Press releases are made availableimmediately after the fortnightly meetings of the Governing Council and, as you may know, theyalways include a precise list of the decisions taken together with background information.There will be a monthly press conference. Such a press conference will start with a detailedintroductory statement, as has been the case so far, and these introductory statements will also bepublished immediately, without delay. In this statement the Vice-President and I will present theGoverning Council’s view of the economic situation and the underlying arguments for itsmonetary policy decisions, followed by a question and answer session.The publications of the ESCB will include, in particular, an ECB Bulletin each month as well asan Annual Report. As from 1999, a detailed analysis of the economic situation in the euro areawill be presented in the monthly Bulletin. Thematic articles in this Bulletin will include in-depthanalyses by the ECB on matters regarding the monetary policy of the ESCB and the economy of
– 3 –BIS Review   100/1998the euro area. Further, you may also recall that, as required by its Statute, the ESCB will publishits consolidated balance sheet on a weekly basis.My colleagues on the Executive Board of the ECB and I intend to be very active in givingspeeches dealing with all issues of relevance for the conduct of monetary policy. I am convincedthat the Governors of the national central banks will also play their role in this respect.Since I am talking about the communication and external relations of the ESCB, I would like tounderline that I am prepared to accept invitations to appear before the European Parliament atleast four times a year to present the activities of the ESCB and the ECB’s Annual Report.Finally, it should be noted that the ESCB would have a regular exchange of information andviews with Ecofin. Representatives of the ECB will be invited to Ecofin meetings wheneverissues of concern to monetary policy are discussed. A similar relationship will naturally also existwith the euro-11, whose meetings will generally be attended by the President of the ECB,whenever matters relevant to the ESCB are on the agenda.Monetary policy strategy of the ESCBWe are now approaching the start of stage three of EMU. The decision-making bodies of theECB have made a certain number of important decisions since the ESCB was established. Aspart of these decisions, the monetary policy strategy of the ESCB was recently announced andexplained to the public. The selected stability-oriented strategy promotes as much continuity aspossible with the existing strategies of national central banks in the EU. At the same time, itsdesign is adapted to the unique situation of introducing a single currency in eleven countries,which may to a certain extent change economic behaviour. Therefore as much continuity aspossible and as much change as required is the thrust of our strategy.Our strategy consists of two pillars. The first is an important role for money and the second is abroad-based assessment of the outlook for price developments in the euro area. The main reasonfor assigning a prominent role to money is the empirically well-founded view that inflation, atleast in the long run, is a monetary phenomenon. This simple and obvious observation led theGoverning Council to announce a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad measureof money. This choice will create a “nominal anchor” for monetary policy and therefore helpstabilise private inflation expectations at longer horizons. The reference value will be derived ina manner that is clearly consistent with – and serves the achievement of – price stability. It willbe constructed such that, in the absence of special factors or other distortions, deviations ofmonetary growth from the reference value will signal risks to price stability.However, it has to be clear that the reference value is different from an intermediate monetarytarget, as the ESCB has not made any commitment to correct deviations of actual monetarygrowth from the reference value over the short term. In particular, it has been realisticallyrecognised that the move to a single currency and ongoing financial innovations may generatefluctuations in the selected monetary aggregate which are not necessarily associated withinflationary or deflationary pressures. For this reason, it is important to continuously monitor therelevance of temporary factors or even structural changes in order to avoid a mechanistic policyreaction to deviations of the chosen monetary aggregate from the reference value. The results ofthis analysis and its impact on the ESCB’s monetary policy decisions will be explained to thepublic.Let me turn now to the second key element of the monetary policy strategy, the broad-basedassessment of the risks to price stability. The information contained in monetary aggregates,
– 4 –BIS Review   100/1998while of the utmost importance, will by no means constitute the whole of the “information set” inthe hands of the ESCB. In parallel with the analysis of money growth, a wide range of economicand financial variables will be used to formulate an assessment of the outlook for pricedevelopments. The envisaged strategy will enable the ESCB to perform a crosscheck between theinformation coming from the evolution of monetary aggregates and those from other economicand financial indicators.Recent economic developments and prospectsLet me turn to the current economic situation. The euro area experienced a strengthening ofeconomic growth in 1997, to 2.5%, and a further acceleration has been anticipated for this year.The global environment has, of course, deteriorated in the meantime, but this has not so far hadan observable impact on growth, which has, in any event, been increasingly led by domesticdemand. Inflation has remained subdued and even fallen somewhat over the past year, partly as aresult of the impact of weaker global demand on oil and commodity prices. However, thefavourable pattern of inflation has also been supported by domestic factors, such as a verymoderate development in unit labour costs and industrial producer prices.Concerning recent price developments, HICP inflation for the euro area fell to 1.0% inSeptember, due to a strong impact from food prices, but I would not want to read too much intothis latest decline as some price components can be relatively volatile over short periods. Moresignificantly, preliminary data suggest that various broad monetary aggregates for the euro areaare increasing at between 3 and 5%, and thus do not appear to signal any strong incipientinflationary or deflationary pressures. We are in line with the consensus view that inflation in theeuro area will rise moderately in 1999, but remain below 2%. I do not consider deflation to be aserious risk for price stability at present.So far, despite the worsening of the global environment, euro area-wide activity has continued toexpand at a fairly stable rate. At around 3%, annual real GDP growth was broadly unchanged inthe first half of 1998 from the solid growth seen in the second half of 1997. Industrial productiongrowth has slowed somewhat since the spring. More recent evidence, particularly that of thearea-wide survey data, may also suggest a moderation in the pace of growth and furtherdevelopments in these indicators will continue to be monitored closely. Area-wide growthshould, however, be supported by a number of domestic factors. One factor supporting continuedgrowth, particularly in private consumption, is the gradual improvement in labour marketconditions. Moreover, the lowest short-term interest rates in the euro area currently stand at3.3%, and several countries have cut interest rates towards this level recently as part of theprocess towards interest rate convergence. The process of convergence towards this level hasbeen gradual, but should imply a reduction in the average short-term interest rate in the euro areaof about 0.5 percentage point since July. Long-term rates also stand at low levels. And there hasbeen a marked degree of exchange rate stability among countries participating in the euro. This isundoubtedly a welcome development from the standpoint of encouraging trade and investment.Thus, our assessment is similar to that of other international organisations, that – unless theinternational environment deteriorates further, which is not currently expected – growth will besomewhat weaker in 1999. Growth should, however, remain high enough to support continuedemployment creation and, assuming a recovery in the international environment, there should bea pick-up in growth in 2000. At the meetings in December the ECB Governing Council willagain assess the outlook for economic and price developments.
– 5 –BIS Review   100/1998Although the economic outlook may be less favourable than expected – let us say – half a yearago, I believe that the conditions for a successful launch of the euro are in place. You can be surethat the ESCB will do its utmost to make the euro a stable currency.
BIS Review   99/1998Mr. Duisenberg looks at the international role of the euro and the ESCB’s monetary policyStatement by the President of the European Central Bank, Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, at theFrankfurt European Banking Congress in Frankfurt am Main on 20/11/98.I very much welcome the opportunity today to share some thoughts with you on the issue of theinternational role of the euro and the monetary policy strategy of the European System of CentralBanks (ESCB). In order to remain within the tight time frame and leave room for discussion, Ishall try to be as concise as possible, and I shall therefore focus on the three questions addressedto me directly.1. Is a significant international role for the euro a desirable goal?Some observers have asserted that one of the main motives behind Economic and MonetaryUnion in Europe is the creation of a major international role for the euro, and that fostering sucha role would be an important objective for the European Central Bank (ECB). Both assertions areincorrect. The purpose of the introduction of the euro is to promote economic integration andeconomic welfare in the Member States, and the objective of the ESCB – and of the ECB as partof this system – is to maintain price stability within the euro area. The ESCB will take a neutralstance towards an international role of the euro. It will neither hinder nor deliberately encouragethe development of this role, but will rather leave this to market forces.The ESCB will, however, contribute indirectly to the international recognition of the euro byachieving its objective of maintaining price stability within the euro area. A successful monetarypolicy is a necessary condition, but not the only prerequisite for the international recognition anduse of a currency. The reason is that the latter is a complex phenomenon. While there is no singleinternational role for a currency, there are many uses for a currency in an international context.On the official side, they include the use of a currency as an anchor for exchange rate pegs, as ameans of storing foreign exchange reserves, and as a vehicle for foreign exchange interventions.On the private side, they include the use as a quotation and vehicle currency for internationaltrade, as a currency of denomination for financial assets, and as a substitute currency incirculation abroad. The significance of all these roles depends on the decisions of a large numberof economic agents – including governments, central banks, institutional and private investors,corporations, and traders – which the central bank can only influence to a limited extent.While it is difficult and not always meaningful to make predictions about the overallinternational role of the euro, it seems safe to assert that it will be significant in a number ofareas.First, there are what one might call the ‘static’ effects stemming from the changeover and theconversion of existing financial assets and liabilities into euro. That alone will already give theeuro an internationally recognised role, since the euro area currencies, in general, and theDeutsche Mark, in particular, have played a significant role as anchor, reserve, investment andvehicle currencies in the past.Second, and potentially even more important, there will be ‘dynamic’ effects stemming from newassets and liabilities acquired or issued in euro. Here, the creation of a large and liquid, integratedcapital market will be the most important element in fostering such a development. For short-term instruments, there will be a broad and liquid European money market with a commonovernight rate and very similar short-term interest rates for comparable instruments. At thelonger end of the maturity spectrum, market integration will be jump-started by the re-
- 2 -BIS Review   99/1998denomination of outstanding government debt in euro on 1 January 1999. The elimination of thecurrency fragmentation in the European bond markets will also lead to the development ofuniform market standards and the creation of a large and liquid market for portfolio investors.2. How will the euro’s international role influence the ECB’s monetary policy?Having an international currency has significant advantages for businesses and consumers. Itmay, however, sometimes complicate the conduct of monetary policy. In the ESCB’s monetarypolicy strategy, developments in monetary aggregates play a prominent role, and thesedevelopments will be analysed very carefully. If a significant part of the money stock were tocirculate outside the euro area and if its development were to deviate from that circulating insidethe euro area, this could be a source of instability in money demand.But this is only one of the challenges which the ESCB will be facing in analysing developmentsin monetary aggregates. Other challenges are related to changes in money demand as a result ofthe introduction of the euro itself. Together, these changes represent a structural break, and it isobviously difficult to predict how demand for money will evolve around such a break.The ESCB has taken these difficulties into account in its monetary policy strategy in that, firstly,it will announce only a reference value for a monetary aggregate, and not a target value. Thismeans that, although monetary developments will be used as the main indicator of potentialinflationary or disinflationary pressures, the ESCB will not react in an almost mechanical way tocorrect deviations from the reference value in the short term. Secondly, the ESCB will not focussolely on the analysis of monetary aggregates, but will complement this analysis with a broadlybased assessment of the outlook for future price developments.On the one hand, the chosen strategy will, in my view, ensure as great a degree of continuity aspossible in relation to the existing strategies of national central banks in the euro area. On theother hand, due consideration has simultaneously been given to the unique situation created bythe transition to Monetary Union, in which a possibly growing international role of the euro isbut one element.3. What are the prospects for international policy co-ordination between central banks? Are target zonesfor the key currencies conceivable, or even desirable?The ECB, acting on behalf of the ESCB, is already beginning to play a major role in internationalfora, such as those at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the OECD and in a G7 andG10 context, and I expect this role to grow considerably in significance once the ESCB isoperational. In all fora, the ECB's role will be to contribute to the international policy discussionsfrom the perspective that price stability in the euro area is its prime objective. At the same time,the ECB will seek to make the best contribution it can to stable international developments. Inparticular, the introduction of the euro will reduce the number of major currency blocs in theglobal financial system. In principle, this should simplify the exchange of views on financialissues at the global level. Each of the main partners – the United States, the euro area and Japan –will be in a position to speak for a comparatively large economic area and will be similarlyvulnerable to possible consequences of instability. They may thus have a greater incentive to takeon a share of the responsibility for helping to maintain a stable global environment.On the question of exchange rates and target zones, I would like to state clearly that, in itsmonetary strategy, the ESCB does not have an exchange rate target. Nor do the United States andJapan. An exchange rate target for an area as large and relatively closed as that of the euro areacould easily conflict with the maintenance of price stability and could, therefore, not be
- 3 -BIS Review   99/1998sustainable. According to our monetary policy strategy, the exchange rate of the euro will thus bean outcome, rather than the objective, both of the economic, monetary and other policies pursuedin the euro area, and of cyclical developments in the euro area and abroad. It will be monitored asone of the indicators of monetary policy and as a source of potential changes in the price level inthe euro area. However, the exchange rate will play a far smaller role in the euro area than it hasplayed in the Member States in the past.In line with the ESCB’s approach to the euro exchange rate, the Ministers of Finance, who areultimately responsible for the exchange rate policy of the euro, have agreed to issue so-calledexchange rate orientations only in exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of clear andpersistent misalignments of the euro. This is apparently not the case at this juncture. Nor is thereany indication that such misalignments will be unavoidable in the future. In particular, the factthat our strategy does not include any exchange rate target vis-à-vis the US dollar does not implythat the euro/dollar rate will be unstable or volatile, or that the ESCB is against reasonably stableexchange rates. The pursuit of stability-oriented monetary and budgetary policies on both sides ofthe Atlantic would put in place one of the major prerequisites for a reasonably stable euro/dollarexchange rate. At the current juncture, the policy framework in both regions seems to bode wellfor the adoption of such policies. Absolute stability is, of course, impossible to guarantee andwould not even be desirable, if the United States and the euro area were to go through businesscycles which are not fully synchronised.
BIS Review   99/1998Mr. Ciocca discusses competition and mergers in the Italian financial systemSpeech by Sig. Pierluigi Ciocca, a Deputy Director General of the Bank of Italy, at a conferenceon “La concentrazione nell’industria dei servizi finanziari:aspetti teorici ed esperienzeinternazionali” held at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan on 12/11/98.IntroductionIn the last twenty years there has been considerable consolidation in the credit field. The processbegan in the United States, where there have been more than 7,000 bank mergers since 1980. TheUnited Kingdom was the first country in Europe to see significant merger activity, but it hasspread to other countries, including Italy.The most frequently cited general cause of consolidation lies in the changes that have occurred inthe external environment: advances in electronic data processing and telecommunications,provisions aimed at attenuating the institutional separation of intermediaries, and the contractionin the role of public pension systems. Among other things, these developments have fosteredfinancial globalization, asset management services, the use of powerful IT systems, and a drasticreduction in data transmission and communication costs. The repercussions have not beenrestricted to international and wholesale markets but have also been felt in local and retailmarkets. Banks appear to have seen the larger scale of operations as offering the prospect ofcoping with these repercussions better.In Italy’s case, however, a key additional factor has been the increase in competition. The Italianbanking system had entered the eighties with the low level of competition inherited from thepast. The subsequent change was radical and the consequent narrowing of margins stimulatedrestructuring and consolidation. From the eighties onwards, the dictum of comparative statics“more concentration, less competition” has been replaced by the dynamic alternative “morecompetition, more mergers”. The premise, already tested in analyses carried out by the Bank ofItaly, was that the Italian banking system — traditionally marked by a low degree ofconcentration and banks of limited average size with multiple branches — offered not onlyplenty of niches for small banks but also considerable scope for economies of scale. Thispotential is at last being realized, in the international context I have just described, under thepressure of the “novelty”, at least for Italian banking, represented by the growth in competitionthat the Bank of Italy has been pursuing.In my remarks I shall touch on three aspects of these complex processes, the outcome of which isstill wide open:a)antitrust action can forestall the adverse effects of consolidation on competition andreinforce the beneficial effects;b)the Bank of Italy, both before and after 1990, has pursued a policy aimed at fostering theefficiency of the banking system through competition;c)more competition, consolidation and restructuring remain objectives to be pursued, eventhough they are only necessary, and not sufficient, conditions for increasing thecompetitiveness of the Italian banking system, which is still burdened by high operatingcosts.Mergers and the protection of competition
- 2 -BIS Review   99/1998A high degree of concentration and a small number of large banks that enjoy growing economiesof scale represent a situation that needs to be watched carefully. It is necessary to ensure thatmergers bring benefits for customers and not an increase in market power. The law recognizesthe threat that concentration poses for competition. Nonetheless, the traditional attitude towardsmergers has been attenuated, in view of the positive effects that they are capable of producing.In Italy, Article 6 of Law 287/1990 defines the scope of antitrust action. The ban on mergersapplies to those that would create or strengthen a dominant position that is detrimental tocompetition.Antitrust law, in turn, can supplement the monitoring of mergers with a range of alternativeinstruments. Controlling a firm’s behaviour may prevent it from exploiting its position todiscriminate against competitors. Controlling the agreements between competing firms mayprevent such understandings from distorting the play of competition.In addition, there is the action — which does not derive directly from antitrust law in the strictsense of the term and which often falls within the scope of several institutions’ authority —aimed at ensuring the contestability of markets, at making it possible for other firms to enter themarket and erode the dominant firm’s profits. Freedom to enter the market must be coupled withfreedom to leave the market by keeping down the sunk costs of withdrawing, allowing inefficientfirms to go to the wall, and making it effectively possible for entrepreneurs to sell all or part oftheir businesses.The provisions concerning the abuse of dominant positions and agreements detrimental tocompetition, together with control of the effective freedom to enter and leave the market, make itpossible to take a fairly relaxed view of most mergers and acquisitions, bearing in mind that inparticularly serious cases operations hindering competition may be prohibited at law. It shouldalso be noted in this respect that the parties can be required to dispose of assets or to adopt othermeasures like to ensure sufficiently competitive conditions. This practice is widely followed inthe banking sector: in the United States some recent mega-mergers have been waved throughsubject to the mandatory disposal of assets equivalent to between 5 and 13 per cent of thedeposits acquired.The banking industry still has several distinctive features, especially as regards the taking ofdeposits and the granting of loans. One important sunk cost is related to the information contentof the customer relationships on which lending decisions are based, an asset that is not easilymarketable. Credit relationships involve an information asymmetry between borrowers andlenders that results in their not being completely fungible. Small banks that establish particularlyclose relationships with their borrowers enjoy an information advantage. This explains why it isdifficult for banks to enter directly into geographical markets in which they were previouslyabsent; indirect growth by acquiring existing banks or branches is often the easiest way toovercome this barrier and enter a retail market characterized by information asymmetries.At the same time this peculiarity is likely to act as an exit barrier, thereby reducing the incentiveto enter the market and the potential competition. Sometimes the authorities themselvesencourage mergers in order to remove inefficient banks from the market without their having tobe put into liquidation, with all the costs the resulting termination of customer relationshipsentails. The scope for mergers is accordingly a condition for keeping down market entry and exitbarriers and thereby reducing the probability of collusion. A market for the control andownership of banks that works is a necessary condition for the efficiency of banking as a whole.Mergers also make the financial market’s assessment of banks more effective; larger credit
- 3 -BIS Review   99/1998institutions are encouraged to open up their ownership structure to third parties and the stockmarket in order to increase their ability to raise equity capital.On the liabilities side of banks’ balance sheets, the demand for deposits and accessory services isstill linked to customers’ physical closeness to branches. The evaluation of mergers musttherefore take into account not only imperfect contestability but also the evolution of localmarkets and the conditions effectively applied to customers.Lastly, credit intermediaries are multi-product enterprises and often operate in several markets.Mergers between diversified intermediaries will have a different impact on the ability to bepresent in the various markets — for loans, deposits, payment instruments, securities business,asset management, leasing, factoring, consumer credit and corporate finance, etc. Whenassessing mergers, account therefore needs to be taken not merely of the increase in the degree ofconcentration in one market, but also of how competitive conditions change in the other markets.The Bank of Italy and the promotion of competitionFrom the end of the seventies onwards the action taken by the Bank of Italy has been aimed atincreasing competition in the banking and financial system. The powers of authorizationassigned by law to the Bank as the body responsible for supervision were exercised from thetwenties onwards according to the principle of competition. In the “Branch Plan” drawn up in1978 the Bank explicitly announced the objective of fostering competition in the bankingindustry: the opening of branches was envisaged primarily in the areas where the concentrationof loans and deposits was highest, and not infrequently monopolistic.Thus the Bank of Italy placed competition at the centre of its policy aimed at increasing theefficiency and solidity of the banking and financial system well before it was granted formalantitrust powers in 1990.The precondition for the change in the Bank’s approach was the abandonment of the idea —widely held after the crisis of the thirties, not only in Italy and not only among central banks —that competition, or “excess” competition, caused banking instability and was antinomic withrespect to stability. On the contrary, and especially in the conditions of international opennesstypical of the Italian economy in normal circumstances, an inefficient banking system is bound tobe prone to systemic instability, even though oligopoly allows it to be profitable. A powerfulstimulus to achieve profitability and hence a congruous capital base through efficiency couldclearly be detected in the increase in competition in the domestic banking and financial markets.Increased competition therefore became the key intermediate objective, the fulcrum of the Bankof Italy’s monetary, exchange rate and supervisory policies. Without competition, in the long runthere cannot be efficiency; without efficiency, in the long run there cannot be stability in thebanking and financial industry. A further consideration, rooted in the economic theory uponwhich antitrust legislation is based, was that laisser faire and competition were not the samething, that the former could override the latter (especially in an industry with economies ofscale), and that deregulation was likely to be more effective if set within the framework of aneconomic and institutional policy aimed at protecting and strengthening competition andultimately imposing it on producers who might well not like it. The attribution to the Bank ofItaly of responsibility for implementing antitrust law in the banking field was thus not a break, ananomaly to be removed later. It was the natural, institutional, recognition of a state of affairs thathad already existed for tens of years. Above all it sanctioned a principle that must beconsolidated and applied more widely: not only are prudential supervision and the protection ofcompetition not in conflict, but they are rigorously complementary.
- 4 -BIS Review   99/1998The declarations of intent, the strategic decisions, the single acts with which the Bank of Italyinterpreted and applied these general criteria in practice have been many and spread over twentyyears. They cannot all be listed here, but I shall briefly indicate the most important in a series ofsummary points:• the first, absolutely fundamental, step was taken at the beginning of the eighties with thereaffirmation of the notion of banks, both publicly and privately-owned, as enterprises. Inthe wake of the transposition of the EEC’s First Banking Directive of 1985, the issue wasfinally settled in a judgement handed down by the Court of Cassation in 1989. Thetransformation of publicly-owned banks into companies limited by shares followed, asprovided for in Law 218 of 1990;• between 1985 and 1990, while the amendments to the law that would lead to the newBanking Law of 1993 were being enacted, administrative measures were adoptedattenuating or eliminating the restrictions in fields such as branching, fund-raising andlending beyond the short term, and the creation of new banks. The growth of individualbanks was increasingly related, by way of solvency and gearing ratios, to the amount ofcapital they were able to bring into play;• starting in the early eighties, the quantity, the quality and the diffusion of the informationdisclosed by banks to customers and the market were enhanced;• by the end of 1988 the shift from direct administrative instruments to indirect marketinstruments in implementing monetary policy had been completed;• in response to the need to place growing volumes of public debt with domestic investors,steps were taken to create efficient money and bond markets. The share of bank depositsin households’ financial assets fell from 53 per cent in 1979 to 34 per cent in 1990 andstands at 25 per cent today;• the removal of exchange controls was started in 1988 and completed in 1990, with theresult that, for the first time in its history, Italy had a fully convertible currency andcomplete freedom of both short and long-term capital movements.All the indicators show that the degree of competition in the Italian banking system increasedsignificantly in the eighties. Between 1979 and 1989 the average number of banks present ineach province rose from 20 to 27. The concentration of the loan market fell by 15 per centnationwide and by 20 per cent in the Centre and South. The differential between the averagebank lending rate and the pre-tax yield on Treasury bills narrowed from 5 percentage points in1980 to less than 1 point in 1989 and this happened in a period which saw the riskiness of bankcredit increase slightly. The spread between lending and deposit rates also narrowed, declininginitially from more than 9 percentage points in 1980 to less than 7 points in 1989. Inevitably,these developments resulted in the margins on credit business coming under pressure.In 1990 the law establishing the Competition Authority (Law 287/1990) made the Bank of Italyresponsible for the antitrust function in the banking sector. The choice was made in view of thespecific technical nature of banking and the complementary nature of prudential supervision andthe protection of competition. In the United States, with its century-long tradition of antitrustlegislation, the situation is similar since the Federal Reserve or the Office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency, according to the banks involved, are responsible for evaluating the anti-competitive effects of mergers. The Department of Justice cooperates with the regulatoryauthorities and in extreme cases may bring a legal action against an operation. In Europe, it is
- 5 -BIS Review   99/1998worth mentioning the case of the Netherlands, where, in establishing a Competition Authority atthe beginning of this year, the law provisionally assigned the protection of competition in thebanking and insurance industries to the respective supervisory authorities. Other antitrustauthorities are also beginning to recognize the specificity of the banking sector and, as in Canada,have issued special instructions for the evaluation of bank mergers.The growth in competition has continued in the decade that is drawing to a close. Following thedecision taken by the Bank of Italy in 1990 to liberalize banks’ branch networks by abandoningthe system of “branch plans”, the number of branches increased as never before, rising by10,000, or more than 60 per cent, to 25,600 in June of this year. At the end of 1989 there were1,173 banks in Italy, of which 83 were medium-term credit institutions or sections. By the end ofJune the number had fallen by more than 20 per cent to 937, of which 120 belonged to bankinggroups. In recent years the process of consolidation has involved large commercial banks, partlyin response to the prospect of an integrated European market with a single currency. The averagenumber of banks present in each province has risen further to 30.During the nineties the differential between the average bank lending rate and the pre-tax yieldon Treasury bills has tended to remain close to its level at the end of the eighties. But, partlyowing to the rather weak performance of the economy, this decade has seen a sharp increase inthe average riskiness of loans and a deterioration in the quality of banks’ assets. Hence, thestability of the differential between bank lending rates and the yield on government securities isfurther evidence of the increasing competition within the banking industry.The differences between the lending rates applied in the various parts of the country have alsonarrowed in the last four years after peaking in the second half of 1994. The difference betweenthe rates on short-term lira loans in the North and the South is currently around 2 percentagepoints for non-financial companies and about 1.5 points for producer households. The gap isentirely attributable to the greater average riskiness of lending in the South and the longer time ittakes to recover credits there. The ratio of bad debts to total loans disbursed to customers in theSouth is 22 per cent, as against 7 per cent for borrowers in the Centre and North. Analysescarried out at the Bank of Italy show that, after adjusting for the risks that materialized, thegeographical differential disappeared in the early nineties. The spread between lending anddeposit rates has narrowed further and now stands at 4.5 percentage points.The growth in competition has contributed to a substantial redistribution of banks’ shares of theloan market. The major changes that occurred after the ceiling on bank loans was removed werefollowed by further large shifts in the two years 1989-90 and from 1995 onwards. In the last threeyears the market shares that changed hands each year were equal to around 4 per cent of the totalloan portfolio on average, excluding the amounts directly affected by mergers. The increase incompetition has led to banks adopting more aggressive supply policies and growth strategiesmore closely attuned to demand.Mergers and acquisitions in the Italian banking systemBetween 1990 and 1997 the Bank of Italy, pursuant to the provisions of antitrust law applying tothe banking sector, examined some 300 proposed mergers and acquisitions. The banks in playgrew steadily larger. In the last four years the banks involved accounted for 7 per cent of thebanking system’s total assets on average each year. The consolidation process has had aparticularly pronounced impact on the southern banking system, partly as a result of theacquisition of the control of local banks in difficulty by banks situated in the Centre and North.
- 6 -BIS Review   99/1998In ten cases the Bank of Italy decided to examine proposed mergers in order to verify whether theoperation was likely to create or strengthen a dominant position and prejudice competition. Infour of these cases the go ahead was made conditional on measures aimed at protectingcompetition in the market in question.Another ten examinations concerned agreements suspected of being detrimental to competition.The investigation of industry-wide standard terms and of payment instruments were especiallyimportant in this respect. In its recently published findings on the rules governing the use of thePagoBANCOMAT card, the Bank of Italy identified several circumstances that were potentiallyanti-competitive and made its approval of the agreement conditional on a number of changes thatwill help to make the market more competitive.The Bank of Italy also investigated five alleged abuses of dominant positions. In four of thesecases the banks were accused of using their exclusive right to provide tax-collection services togain undue competitive advantages in neighbouring credit markets. In the fifth case the Banktook action to prevent the bank from exploiting its dominant position to expand its branchnetwork abnormally with the aim of obstructing the entry or growth of competitors in the marketin question.In addition to its normal examination activity, in 1996 the Bank of Italy investigated thepossibility that banks were coordinating their pricing policies, but found no evidence of suchpractices. In 1997, in agreement with the Competition Authority, it conducted a general fact-finding inquiry into the corporate services sector.In the nineties the consolidation of the Italian banking system has proceeded primarily by meansof mergers and amalgamations, of which there had been 265 by the end of 1997. Acquisitions ofthe control of banks that subsequently continued to operate as separate entities also played animportant role, with a total of 91 such takeovers. Even where these operations have not yetsignificantly reduced operating costs, they have allowed capital to be used more efficiently andbrought tax benefits, increases in fee income and improvements in the quality of the acquiredbank’s loan portfolio.Mergers between banks which are not present in the same markets, or with only limited overlap,increase competition. By contrast, the “market power” effect tends to prevail over the efficiencyeffect where the merging banks both have a large presence in the same market. These findingsconfirm the continued importance of the physical closeness of customers to their banks and theneed for the attention that the competition authorities pay to local markets.Mergers inevitably impact the payment system and the stability of the banking sector. Bydiminishing the number of participants in the payment system, they tend to reduce the volume oftransactions to be settled. The setting of operational and technological standards aimed atexploiting network economies may well be easier. On the other hand, larger banks are likely tocause more serious problems in the event of insolvency: the overall effect of mergers on thestability of the payments system will depend on how they affect the riskiness of the individualbanks.Competition, consolidation and costsCompetition, consolidation and reorganizations have helped to curb operating costs in relation tothe total assets of the banking system. In the three years from 1995 to 1997 this ratio averaged2.4 per cent, compared with 3 per cent in the second half of the eighties.
- 7 -BIS Review   99/1998Nonetheless, partly as a result of the rigidity of the Italian labour market, the competitive gapbetween Italian banks and their counterparts abroad, which is attributable primarily to the greaterincidence of staff costs, has not narrowed in the nineties. In 1997 bank staff costs amounted to 43per cent of gross income in Italy, compared with an average of 38 per cent in France, Germanyand Spain.The agreements between employers and the trade unions to reduce the cost of labour, promptedby the Bank of Italy and promoted by the Government, have not yet been given effect in a newwage agreement linking earnings more closely to a bank’s performance. Significant cost savings,as well as increased revenues, can be achieved by modernizing structures, reorganizingproduction processes and developing innovative distribution networks. Other banking systemshave invested a substantial volume of resources, deriving in part from savings in staff costs, intechnological innovation, thereby acquiring competitive advantages on several fronts.The increase in competition in banking markets, further intensified by foreign intermediariesaccustomed to operating on a larger scale and with smaller interest rate spreads, has sharplyreduced the profitability of Italian banks’ traditional activities. The fall in net interest income,which began several years ago and will be accentuated by the introduction of the euro, has notbeen offset by a lasting increase in revenues from innovative activities: corporate advisoryservices and finance, the administration and management of households’ savings, and business inthe international securities markets.In the first half of the eighties Italian banks’ return on equity was in excess of 14 per cent, in linewith that of the other leading European banking systems. Since then it has fallen, reaching a lowof around 1 per cent last year. Apart from the level of costs, the large loan losses incurred in thelast few years have made a major contribution to the decline in profitability. The risk-asset ratioof the Italian banking system is 13 per cent, well above the requirement of 8 per cent establishedin the Basle Capital Accord. Only a very few banks are below this limit and the total shortfall isaround 500 billion lire.The decline in profitability has nonetheless reduced the flow of internally-generated resourceswith which to finance growth and merger operations. The larger banks have suffered especiallyin this respect: at the end of last year they held less than one third of the free capital of thebanking system, as against 80 per cent of its total assets. The lack of free capital, not tied up intangible and financial fixed assets and available for acquisitions, will curtail the scope formodernizing the system and pursuing efficiency.The intermediate objective pursued over the last twenty years has been largely achieved; there ismore competition, there have been numerous mergers and a start has been made onreorganization projects that promise to improve efficiency. Competition has produced its fulleffects on the prices of banking products and services, holding them down and making themmore uniform. But other benefits have been, still are, slow in coming: lower costs, internationalcompetitiveness, profits and fresh capital generated by efficiency and the quality of services.The picture is thus chiaroscuro. Disappointment should only be felt by those who fail torecognize that competition fosters efficiency but cannot guarantee it where producers lack theability to respond — à la Leibenstein — to the competitive stimulus. It is necessary to appreciatehow much inertia has to be overcome in a complex process that is more cultural than juridical orinstitutional, in short the “passage” from oligopoly to competition of an industry that is based oninformation asymmetries, bilateral customer relationships and the reputation of producers. Thisjourney was bound to be laborious and slow, especially in Italy’s case. The Italian banking
- 8 -BIS Review   99/1998system arrived at the world economic crisis of the seventies after two postwar decades in whichits oligopolistic nature had become deeply rooted, while the economy had enjoyed anextraordinary boom. The model formulated by Donato Menichella and Raffaele Mattioli had“worked” in a certain sense; it had met, albeit with the inefficiencies that were the inevitablecorollary, the demand for credit and money of the Italian economy in that buoyant phase. Thesubsequent resistance to change cannot be entirely attributed to the reluctance of any industry toface the forces of competition or to the natural tendency to continue to do things in the same way.To give way to counterfactual criticism based on hindsight — such as, the injection ofcompetitive enzymes should have been much larger and more intense — would be not onlysterile but also debatable in theory and risky in practice. It is analytically doubtful whether itwould have been possible, given the context. It is sufficient to mention just one aspect referred toearlier: the uniform treatment of banks and enterprises and of banks in the public and privatesectors became a part of Italian law — as a result of the judgement of 1989 — ten years after thesupervisory authority had clearly stated the principle. The risk at the practical level is that at thispoint banking competition will be seen as a missed opportunity, and that this will lead to the ideaof renouncing it in the future.The position of the Bank of Italy is to proceed, if possible with greater determination, on the roadtaken twenty years ago — not only because the single market, the euro and their rules leave nooption, and not only because the law in force in Italy today mandates this course, but in the beliefthat the progress that has already been made is in the right direction, even though competition onits own, it is worth repeating, does not guarantee an optimal financial system.The Bank of Italy will devote more resources, a revised internal administrative structure focusedon banking competition, and additional analyses serving to underpin new interventions to thetask of fostering competition in the markets in which banks operate and the mergers theyautonomously plan.Two changes that are already under way will also produce their effects. Mutually reinforcing,they should, together with competition in the markets for banking products, stimulate efforts toachieve the cost reductions and quality improvements that are necessary. The first change is theprivatization of the banks that are still under public control, the second concerns the exitprocedures aimed at preventing moral hazard and the neglect of costs.The transfer of the ownership of banks to the private sector is the precondition for control to becontested in the market. In the last few years the process of privatizing public banks has gatheredpace, in parallel with the growth in mergers. Including the operations that are currently beingorganized, the share of the banking system’s assets in the hands of banks of which the state, localauthorities or foundations own the majority of the capital will shortly fall to 20 per cent, asagainst 70 per cent ten years ago. BNL is about to be privatized. The Monte dei Paschi di Sienafoundation, the only one that still owns all the capital of a major bank, has recently decided toplace some of its capital in the market and to seek a stock exchange listing.The prospect of contestability opened up by bank privatizations has been strengthened by thechanges to the legal framework introduced by the Consolidated Law on Financial Markets, whichcame into force in July of this year. The new rules serve to increase the disclosure of information,enhance the efficiency of the financial markets and the contestability of control — in the case oflisted companies partly through the revision of the provisions governing takeovers. There are 25commercial banks listed on the stock exchange; they account, directly and indirectly via listedand unlisted subsidiaries, for 50 per cent of the banking system’s total assets. In addition, there
- 9 -BIS Review   99/1998are 10 cooperative banks listed on the stock exchange, accounting for 10 per cent of total assets,and another 7 banks are listed on the ristretto market.Although the Community authorities recognize the specific features of the banking sector, theirapplication of Article 92 of the Treaty to banks tends to be rigorous. The authorization of stateaid to some large European banks has been made conditional on their disposing of assets, parts ofthe business and equity interests. The fact that bankers will be able to count less on publicsupport means they will have to adopt even more stringent criteria of autonomous, sound andprudent management.The number of banks in distress that have been consolidated (by means of mergers,amalgamations and takeovers) or placed under special administration or in liquidation hasincreased in the nineties, in both absolute and relative terms. The ratio of the number of suchbanks to the total number rose from 1.5 per cent in 1990 to an average of 4.3 per cent in 1996and 1997; the ratio of their assets to the total assets of the banking system rose from 0.2 per centto nearly 6 per cent. The increase in the number of such interventions with respect to troubledbanks has been partly due to the increased emphasis on the preventive nature of supervisoryaction. Since the action is taken when the troubled bank still has a net value, it is possible to lookfor market-based solutions and hence to reduce the burden borne by the deposit protectionsystem or the public finances. The proportion of troubled banks subjected to restructuring thatwere liquidated rose from 6 to 16 per cent between 1990 and 1997. In terms of their assets, theratio rose from just a few percentage points at the beginning of the decade to 11 per cent in 1997.The potential for the development of the financial sector, in both quantitative and qualitativeterms, that the Italian economy requires and that it can achieve is considerable, probably greaterthan in most other European countries. The Bank of Italy remains committed to ensure, with theinstruments the law provides, that this further development takes place in a competitiveenvironment and in conditions of greater efficiency.
BIS Review   98/1998Mr. Yam focuses on how Hong Kong is coping with financial turmoilText of the “Inside Asia Lecture 1998” by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority, Mr. Joseph Yam, JP, organised by The Australian, Sydney on 23/11/98.IntroductionIt is a great pleasure to be in your beautiful city once again, and an honour to have theopportunity to speak to such a distinguished audience. Sydney and Hong Kong - both vibrantinternational cities with spectacular ports - have much in common. We enjoy growing culturaland economic links and, although some 4,500 miles distant, we are both part of the same region.Less happily, our economies have both taken a hammering from the financial crisis that hasrecently rocked the region. My focus in this talk will be on how the regional crisis has affectedHong Kong, and, equally important, on the ways in which it has not affected Hong Kong.The Asian Financial CrisisThe complex causes that so suddenly turned the Asian miracle into an Asian mess will no doubtbe debated for many years to come. The devastating effects of the massive exodus of capital fromthe region have been clear enough. In the worst hit economies currencies have devalued by asmuch as 70%. Stock markets have declined to the levels of ten years ago. Asset prices havesharply deflated, economies have contracted, and unemployment has risen. The region is goingthrough its worst financial crisis since the Second World War. Optimists already see astabilization of the situation and light at the end of the tunnel, and they may well be right. Butdeepening recession in Japan, emerging problems in Latin America, and questions about thestability of the U.S. and European markets still raise serious concerns that what began as aregional crisis may swell into a crisis of global proportions.Hong Kong is located at the very heart of the East Asian region, and our economy is intricately,and increasingly, linked with the other economies in the region. It is therefore hardly surprisingthat we should have experienced some considerable stress as a result of the Asian crisis. Over thelast year we have seen a roughly 50% decline in the value of property and stocks, a rise inunemployment, and a forecast contraction of 4% in our GDP for 1998. Although the stockmarket and property prices have seen something of a rebound during the last month, the pain ofwhat has become an extensive economic adjustment continues, and is likely to continue for sometime.It is necessary to stress, however, that this is an adjustment, not a collapse, and that it has beenone of the least dramatic, and least traumatic, of all the upheavals in the region. In US dollarterms, the Hang Seng Index has, since the crisis erupted last July, seen the smallest decline ofany stock market in the region. Our banking system has remained stable and solvent. Interestrates have risen, but not as far as they have elsewhere: they are currently marginally higher thanUS dollar interest rates at the short end and at a premium of about 100 basis points for 3-monthmoney. Inflation is declining, not rising. And, where other currencies have seen substantialdevaluations, the Hong Kong dollar has remained stable. In fact, it remains the only freelyconvertible currency in Asia that has not experienced devaluation: the linked exchange rate -$7.8 Hong Kong dollars to the U.S. dollar - is as solid as ever. The tenacity and credibility of thelink is, in my view, one of the main reasons why Hong Kong has weathered the crisis better thanmost of its neighbours. We are as committed as we have ever been to preserving the link, and wehave demonstrated, throughout the turmoil of the last year, that we have the machinery - in theform of an effective currency board - to enable us to keep the link.
- 2 -BIS Review   98/1998We are also committed to maintaining our position as the world’s freest economy. Hong Konghas built its reputation on free market principles. We are proud of this reputation, and we cherishthese principles because we know how much our prosperity depends on them. Whatever usesother economies might have for them, exchange controls are out of the question for Hong Kong:the Basic Law, which sets out our basic principles of government, expressly prohibits them, and,even if it did not, we know that, at least for Hong Kong, any attempt to introduce them, and toturn inwards on ourselves, would spell the end of our prosperity.But free market principles cannot mean markets that are left defenceless against manipulation.One troubling aspect of the Asian crisis, and a sign of larger problems in the world financialsystem, has been the extreme volatility in markets created by the rapid flows of highly leveragedfunds around the world. As markets in the region became more vulnerable, these flowsincreasingly took on a predatory character and became more and more subtle in their planningand sophistication. This August, as you know, the Hong Kong financial markets became thetarget of a well planned attack by international hedge funds. We took unconventional actions tofend off that attack and to fortify our financial system against future attacks. Not unexpectedly,these actions have been the cause of extensive controversy, and of a great deal ofmisunderstanding. Let me attempt to present the issue from Hong Kong’s perspective byoutlining what happened in August and explaining why we took action.Oddly enough, Hong Kong became a target because of the transparency of its financial system:we were singled out for our efficiency and predictability rather than for any fundamental flaws.Under our rule-based currency board system, any change in the Hong Kong dollar monetary basemust be strictly matched, at the linked exchange rate, by a corresponding change in the amountof foreign reserves held by the currency board. This is an autopilot mechanism, in which we inthe HKMA have minimal discretion: the currency board simply acts passively in response tocapital flows. Under the autopilot mechanism, an expansion of the monetary base causes interestrates to fall; a contraction causes them to rise. The crucial element in the monetary baseinfluencing the rise and fall of interest rates is the aggregate balance that banks maintain in theirclearing accounts held with the currency board. Notwithstanding the enormous volume oftransactions that goes through our banks, the aggregate balance is minimal, because our financialinfrastructure is so efficient. We have a real-time interbank payment system and no reserverequirements, so that banks in Hong Kong do not need to maintain large balances in theirclearing accounts with the currency board: in August the aggregate balance was as low as HK$2billion. This meant that the aggregate balance, and hence interbank interest rates, was highlysensitive to speculative attack.We saw a series of such attacks over the past year, when various currency speculators took largeshort positions against the Hong Kong dollar with the aim of destabilizing the linked exchangerate. On all these occasions the attacks drove up the interbank interest rates to very high levels.To the extent that the speculators had to borrow in the interbank market to fund their short HongKong dollar positions, the interbank interest rates were high enough to force the currencyspeculators to abandon the attacks, unwind their short positions, and incur substantial losses. Thefinely tuned currency board system worked well, but the interest rate volatility was extreme:during one attack, on 23 October 1997, the overnight interest rate shot up to nearly 300%. Thestock market took a nosedive, and the HKMA was sharply criticized for relying on this singletool, the interest rate, to defend the Hong Kong dollar.In August the speculators adopted a more sophisticated ploy. They introduced a form of doubleplay aimed at playing off the currency board system against the stock and futures markets. First,to avoid being squeezed by high interest rates, they prefunded themselves in Hong Kong dollars
- 3 -BIS Review   98/1998in the debt market, swapping US dollars for Hong Kong dollars with multilateral institutions thathave raised Hong Kong dollars through the issue of debt. At the same time, they accumulatedlarge short positions in the stock index futures market. They then sought to engineer extremeconditions in the money market by dumping huge amounts of Hong Kong dollars. This sell-offwas intended to cause a sharp interest rate hike, which in turn would have sent the stock marketplummeting. The collapse of the stock market would have enabled them to reap a handsomeprofit from the futures contracts they had taken out.A few figures will help give some idea of the scale of this attack and the vulnerability of HongKong’s markets at the time. We estimate that the hedge funds involved had amassed in excess ofHK$30 billion in currency borrowings, at an interest cost of around HK$4 million a day. Theyalso held an estimated 80,000 short contracts, which translated into the following calculation: forevery fall of 1,000 points in the Hang Seng index they stood to make a profit of HK$4 billion. Ifthey could have engineered that fall within 1,000 days they would have broken even. If theycould have achieved it within 100 days they would have netted HK$3.6 billion. All they had todo was to wait for the best moment to dump their Hong Kong dollars, to drive up interest ratesand send a shock wave through the stock market. August was an opportune time: turnover in thestock market had shrunk to about a third of its normal level; there was bad news as thegovernment announced that first-quarter GDP growth had been negative; and rumours wereflying around predicting the devaluation of the Renminbi and the severing of the link betweenthe Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar.We acted swiftly to defeat the manipulators at their own game with a series of measures thatthrew them off their guard, drove them out of the market, and raised the defences against futureattacks. First, drawing on the official reserves, we went into the stock and futures markets. In thesecond half of August we accumulated US$15 billion worth of shares: I am happy to say they arenow worth US$19 billion, but our aim was not to make money; it was simply to determanipulation by making sure that it did not pay off. That objective was achieved. Themanipulators were forced to close out their short positions, in many cases with heavy losses. Andwe followed through with a package of technical measures to strengthen our currency boardarrangement to make our money market less susceptible to manipulation. These measures areworking well. Further reforms are being introduced in the securities and futures markets toreduce the possibility of market dislocation.Our actions served their purpose of deterring market manipulation. We could not passively sitthrough the speculative attack and see our markets overshoot to produce profits for themanipulators, and our entire financial system brought to the brink of collapse. We do not pretendthat our intervention in the markets was not a controversial act. This was not a decision that weenjoyed taking. It involved many risks, not least among them the risk of being misunderstood.Our critics, both at home and abroad, have accused us of intervening with the aim simply ofpropping up the stock market; of being too afraid to face the pain from the necessary interest ratevolatility under a strict currency board system operating in difficult conditions; even of trying tointroduce a novel form of state ownership by acquiring a substantial interest in Hong Kong’smajor corporations. The essence of these charges is that what we did in August marked the endof our long-standing and hugely successful philosophy of non-intervention in the markets.I think it is now increasingly recognized throughout the world that what we did was bothnecessary and effective. But let me emphasize this: our actions in August were not the end ofnon-interventionism, not an abandonment of our free market principles, but a measure taken toensure that those principles prevailed. Free markets cannot mean markets that can be freelymanipulated, particularly by large players operating in small markets. We did the minimum that
- 4 -BIS Review   98/1998was necessary to preserve the integrity of our linked exchange rate system and allow ourfinancial markets properly to perform the role of financial intermediation. Our responsibility wasto keep the markets free and fair for all investors. Not to have acted would, in my view, havebeen the very height of irresponsibility, and would have seriously damaged Hong Kong’scredibility as an international, and freely accessible, financial centre.We now have a substantial shares portfolio. We have put that portfolio under the management ofa separate company at arms length from the HKMA to ensure that there is no conflict of interestbetween our shareholdings and our daily operations as a regulator. Our intention is to sell offthese shares very gradually in a way that will have no impact on the markets. This may wellmean holding on to them for some time. Meanwhile, the markets have stabilized, and the HangSeng Index has, like other markets, been enjoying something of a resurgence over the last fewweeks.Hong Kong’s Economic StrengthsI believe that in the future we shall be able to look back on our actions in August and Septemberas a resounding reaffirmation of our resolve to maintain our fifteen-year record of currencystability through the linked exchange rate. The link was introduced in October 1983 at a time ofuncertainty over Hong Kong’s future and declining confidence in the Hong Kong dollar. The linkhas survived successive political and economic shocks, both global and regional. It is not onlyweathering the current crisis, the greatest test so far: it will, I believe, come out of the crisis moreresilient than ever, fortified by the technical refinements to our currency board system and, moreimportant, be strengthened by the clear message that we have given about our determination tomaintain it.The link is the lynchpin of our monetary system and a vital factor in our prosperity. It is worthexplaining why the stability of the Hong Kong dollar is so important to our economy, and why itis that we have been able to maintain this stability at a time when the fixed exchange rates of somany other freely convertible currencies in the region have collapsed.We are a predominantly externally-oriented economy, and an economy that comes the closest ofany in the world to running itself on pure free market principles. The annual value of our externaltrade is at least two and a half times that of our gross domestic product: most of it takes the formof re-exports. We import nearly all of our daily needs, including food and water. We export mostof our manufactured products, together with a large range of financial and other services. We arean international financial centre with huge capital inflows and outflows, and no exchangecontrols.In such an economic environment, volatile exchange rates would introduce instability andunpredictability without bringing any corresponding advantages, except possibly to those in theforeign exchange industry. Businessmen would face greater currency risks in their internationaltransactions and would be forced to hedge their considerable currency exposures at great cost.Sharp gyrations in the exchange rate, and the kind of overshooting that we have seen in therecent currency devaluations elsewhere would seriously undermine the stability of our financialsystem, and confidence in it. Nor is devaluation necessary to help make us more competitive,even given the fact that many of our neighbours have seen currency devaluations of between 20and 80 per cent. Currency devaluation is not the only means to achieve economic adjustment,and the argument that Hong Kong is losing out by maintaining the link makes little sense forsuch an externally oriented economy. Hong Kong is achieving its adjustment through othervariables. Asset prices and the cost of production, particularly in the form of land and rentals,
- 5 -BIS Review   98/1998have come down very sharply. Wages are easing. Manufacturers and service providers areincreasingly able to lower their costs while at the same time seeking improvements inproductivity.It is therefore quite misleading to claim, as many sceptics do, that without currency devaluationHong Kong cannot be competitive. We have chosen an alternative route towards adjustment, andwe consider ourselves fortunate that we have the capacity to make that choice. This capacitycomes from the fundamental strengths that make it possible for us to run an effective currencyboard. These fundamentals can be reduced to four basic, and some what obvious, points. Theyare so obvious, in fact, that they are too often overlooked in the narrow discussions about theprospects for the link, and it is worth setting them out.First, our ample foreign currency reserves. These are the fruits of strict fiscal discipline, whichhas produced surpluses year after year, and of prudent investment. Our reserves currently amountto US$88.4 billion, the third largest in the world, after Japan and the Mainland of China. Theyare equivalent to more than seven times the currency in circulation, one of the highest levels inthe world.Secondly, we pursue a prudent fiscal policy, with small government and no external debt. Wehave a simple tax structure, a low tax rate, and a public sector expenditure that accounts for only18% of GDP.Thirdly, our financial system is sound. The banking system is strong and solvent, and well able tocope with the interest rate movements necessary under the currency board system. Capitaladequacy ratios among locally incorporated banks average around 18%, and their problem debtratio is about 3.7%. Our standards of prudential supervision are among the highest in the world.Fourthly, Hong Kong’s economy is flexible and responsive. Because they are governed by freemarket principles, the markets respond quickly to interest rate changes and other variables,making the economy resilient in absorbing external shocks and capable of adjusting efficiently tovalidate the linked exchange rate.These are Hong Kong’s economic strengths. Not all economies have them, or would necessarilywish to have them, but they have enabled us to maintain a monetary system appropriate to HongKong’s unique needs and capable of withstanding the storms that any open and externallyoriented economy must necessarily expose itself to.One of our greatest underlying economic strengths is our relationship with the Mainland ofChina, a relationship which helped fuel rapid growth in both economies over the last twodecades. Our two economies maintain extensive and highly productive economic links yet at thesame time operate entirely separate economic systems under the one country, two systemsformula. Not much more than a year ago, just before the Asian financial crisis erupted and on theeve of the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, pessimists were depicting this relationship asa weakness rather than a strength: they were predicting extensive meddling by the CentralGovernment, and consequently a loss of autonomy and dynamism in Hong Kong. They havebeen very wrong on this. The track record so far has been impressive, and all the more so giventhe succession of crises over the last year.As far as Hong Kong’s monetary system is concerned, the transfer of sovereignty has meantmore, not less, autonomy for Hong Kong. Whereas before the handover monetary policy oftenrequired close consultations with the Secretary of State in London, the Central Government in
- 6 -BIS Review   98/1998Beijing has left such matters entirely in the hands of the HKSAR Government. Furthermore, ithas strongly and clearly reiterated its support for what we are doing, its confidence in our abilityto manage things on our own and its preparedness to help in the unlikely event that help isneeded. Our fundamental policies are enshrined in the Basic Law: among these are fiscalindependence; maintenance of Hong Kong as an international financial centre; and a financialsystem governed and protected by locally enacted laws. Most important, the Basic Lawprescribes a separate currency for Hong Kong - the Hong Kong dollar - which is to continue to befreely exchangeable and fully backed by reserves. These points are worth stressing, because therehas been much misunderstanding about Hong Kong’s position.The challenges aheadI believe we should also look to the future, and not just dwell on current anxieties or deal withthe political fall-out from our recent measures against market manipulation. As I see it, there aretwo main challenges ahead. One is the challenge before every economy in the region, includingHong Kong, to pull ourselves out of the economic difficulties that now face us. The other is achallenge to the global financial community as a whole.For Hong Kong, the challenge is to see through the economic adjustment that is now in train, tocontinue to promote our competitiveness, and to plan for economic recovery. There is no denialthat this is a painful process. Nor can there be any pretence that the current downturn will be overquickly, whatever the positive signs in the markets over the past few weeks. In the financialmarkets we need to be vigilant against future attacks and to introduce further safeguards in ourfinancial system. These safeguards will include improvements to cross-market surveillance inHong Kong, and an in-depth exploration of possibilities for further strengthening the resilienceof the currency board system - an exercise which is now making good progress. More widely, weneed to continue to develop Hong Kong’s position as a premier international financial centre.Practical measures recently announced by the Chief Executive of the HKSAR will help in this:they include schemes ranging from the upgrading of the security and efficiency of our entirefinancial infrastructure to the expansion of research facilities in the form of a monetary instituteaffiliated to the HKMA.The emphasis in all of this is not on intervention, but on facilitation. As a government, we do notdirect the form that economic growth should take: we simply strive to provide the bestenvironment that we can to enable growth to take place. In the financial sphere that means astable currency, a credible and secure banking system, and markets that sustain, rather thanundermine, economic development. There is much that we can do - and have done - locally toachieve these aims. But increasingly, the solutions have to be global solutions, because, as theevents of the last year have amply demonstrated, some of the most intractable problems facingour financial systems straddle borders and thrive in the cracks and holes between jurisdictions.Globalization - the breaking down of economic barriers - has brought many benefits, particularlyto our own region. But it has also brought risks and instabilities that can only be tackled throughco-operation between governments.Over the last two months an international consensus has emerged about the dangers ofunmonitored, highly leveraged cross-border capital flows. In August we talked about the dangersto small or medium markets, such as Hong Kong. Since the LTCM debacle in September, thefocus has been on the damage that huge international hedge funds, which are subject to virtuallyno regulation, are capable of inflicting even on the larger markets. We now have a situation inwhich the global financial market is outgrowing its infrastructure, or, to quote Charles Goodhartof the London School of Economics, ‘Finance is rapidly becoming global; but laws and
- 7 -BIS Review   98/1998regulations are national.’ The world financial community has now awoken to the dangers, andseems to be unanimous on the point that action is needed. The G7 communique in late Octobercalling for strong global action to promote greater transparency in highly leveraged fund flows isa step in the right direction. This has been reiterated at the APEC Summit last week in KualaLumpur. The challenge will be in translating these calls into an effective system to ensure thatthe kind of turmoil that has ravaged economies throughout our region does not repeat itself. Andthe larger aim of this co-operation should be not just to draw up defensive measures, but to createpositive opportunities for building a new global financial order appropriate to the needs of thetwenty-first century.
BIS Review   97/1998Mr. Schieber considers the impact of EMU on the banking structure in EuropeSpeech delivered by Mr. Helmut Schieber, a member of the Directorate of the DeutscheBundesbank, at the symposium organised jointly by the Greco-German Chamber of Industry andCommerce and the Bank of Greece, as part of the “Money Show” in Athens on 14-15/11/98.IMoney and wealth, as the Stoics knew long ago, are not bad in themselves. They can be used forgood or ill. When applied to stage three of European economic and monetary union, which begins inonly seven weeks, this means that the quality of the euro will depend on decision-makers within theESCB consistently gearing their monetary policy to achieving and maintaining stability. If the euro isto be a success, its future price stability will be of paramount importance. The new currency will be asuccess story in the international financial markets only if we can build up confidence in it.The changeover to stage three of European economic and monetary union will have implications foreveryone in business, in politics and, naturally in a very special way, in banking. EMU is creating anew set of conditions under which the credit institutions are to conduct their business and to whichthey must adjust. For example, the transition to a single monetary policy in Europe will bring about adirect change in the refinancing structures of credit institutions.The single currency and the integration of the European capital markets represent an enormouschallenge for the European banking sector. Firstly, the credit institutions not only have to absorb theadditional cost burden of the conversion to the euro but must also sustain losses of revenue resultingfrom the disappearance of profitable lines of business and the simultaneous intensification ofcompetition within the entire financial services industry. Secondly, monetary union providescompetitive institutions with new opportunities for earning money by repositioning themselvesoperationally and regionally, in their products and in the sales channels.I shall therefore start by examining how the new set of monetary policy instruments will change therefinancing structures and money market conditions in Europe before turning to the futureinternational role of the euro and its impact on Europe’s banking landscape. I shall conclude bysetting out the criteria for the euro to succeed.IIThe General Documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures, whose finalversion the ECB published only last month, form the basic foundations for the integration of theEuropean money market.When choosing its monetary policy instruments, the ESCB was guided by the principle that access torefinancing funds should be widely available and that institutions within the euro area should betreated equally. When devising the instruments, account was taken of the market principles laiddown in the Maastricht Treaty.Two standing facilities are available to business partners within the ESCB. The interest rates for themarginal lending facility and for the deposit facility mark the ceiling and the floor, respectively, forthe day-to-day money market rate.Open market operations, which are the crux of the regular interest rate and liquidity policymanagement of the money market, are carried out within this interest rate corridor. This means thatthe present monetary policy practice in most of the participating countries is being continued. The
- 2 -BIS Review   97/1998main weekly auction with a 14-day maturity forms the key element of regular money marketmanagement. It is used to provide liquidity to the banking system from week to week and toillustrate or revise the basic monetary policy stance of the ESCB. The longer-term refinancingoperations represent what for Germany, too, is an innovation. Carried out at monthly intervals andwith a maturity period of three months, it serves as the basic means of supplying the banking systemwith central bank money in order to help stabilise refinancing and the security of operations of thebanks, especially the smaller ones.However, the set of monetary policy instruments does not come into play only in the provision ofcentral bank money. It is only the minimum reserve instrument - which is also deployed in Greece - that creates a sufficiently stable demand for central bank money on a permanent basis. At the sametime, the minimum reserve has a stabilising effect on interest rate trends in the money market byproviding the institutions with the possibility of cushioning the effects of temporary fluctuations inliquidity. The result is that the central bank has to intervene only to a comparatively small extent; thedecentralised structure of the ESCB is underpinned. A major innovation - at all events, fromGermany’s point of view - is the market-related remuneration of minimum reserve balances. In thisway the banks’ refinancing costs incurred as a result of holding minimum reserves are fully offset.That is an important factor with respect to the acceptability and competitive neutrality of theminimum reserve system.Not only the single monetary policy but also a uniform technical infrastructure is essential for thecreation of a single money market in Europe. The effective implementation of monetary policymeasures and the distribution of central bank money through the future European money marketpresupposes that there is a correspondingly competitive and efficient large-value payment system forthe euro. TARGET has been conceived as a decentralised system which is based on the nationalreal-time gross systems which are connected to each other through an Interlinking system. Thisenables the national systems to settle payments both nationally and internationally. This creates asatisfactory market depth for the European money market and strengthens the position of Euribor inrelation to the British Euro-Libor in competing for recognition as the reference interest rate forEuropean financial trading.IIIHow the euro fares internationally as a transaction, investment and reserve currency will be ofenormous importance for the future business opportunities of the credit institutions in the euro area. Ithink credit institutions in the member countries will have an excellent opportunity to expand theirbusiness operations if we are successful in making the euro one of the internationally used currencieswhich might assume a more important role in the global currency system than the currencies of the11 countries initially participating in EMU taken together.In the short term, however, the introduction of the single currency will mean a loss of profitableareas of business for the credit institutions. This applies first and foremost to foreign exchangetrading. It is estimated that, as a result of EMU, there will be a 10 % to 15 % reduction inintra-European foreign exchange trading. This decline will be spread unevenly over the financialcentres. On the European foreign exchanges outside London and Frankfurt the foreign exchangetrading of the respective local currencies against the D-Mark accounts for up to 50 % of total tradingin foreign currency. In the EU, foreign exchange dealing in non-European currencies amounts to nomore than just under 30 % of the total. The banks will therefore lose a major area of business,especially as it is likely that future euro-dollar and euro-yen trading will be concentrated on a smallnumber of dealers. They will have to focus their trading operations on other segments, such astrading in central and east European currencies.
- 3 -BIS Review   97/1998Over the longer term, however, the single currency in Europe is likely to provide a positive stimulusto the credit institutions’ business operations. With the disappearance of currency barriers the capitalmarkets will gain in breadth and depth; prices will become more transparent and will tend to fall.Financial markets with a large range of products, a broad range of maturities, a high level of liquidityand low transaction costs will attract an enormous amount of international custom and will attractboth international investors and borrowers.Whether or not the euro will succeed in competing with the US dollar as a vehicle currency will beof paramount importance for the international use of the euro and therefore for the credit institutions’business opportunities in the euro area. Vehicle currencies always emerge when currencies can beexchanged indirectly via this vehicle currency more cheaply than would be the case if they wereexchanged directly. The inertia that favours the US dollar as a vehicle and reserve currency,however, may represent a certain barrier to the development of the euro in this field. Theconcentration of transactions on a currency will be fostered by economies of scale. The greater theshare of a currency in the world’s monetary reserves, in private assets and in global turnover, thelower are the transaction costs associated with trading in it. Besides, a certain degree of inertiaimpedes a change of the existing vehicle and reserve currency. Although that doesn’t mean that achange in a currency’s functions is impossible, the elasticity of substitution between the US dollarand the euro is likely to be relatively small, at least initially, for the reasons mentioned.Nevertheless, the euro’s functions as a transaction and investment currency will give the creditinstitutions in Europe an excellent opportunity here to gain a foothold in the new business areas andthus to open up new sources of revenue for themselves.IVThe strong and rapid structural change in the financial sectors of the past few years will continuewith the introduction of the single currency in European monetary union. For the financial servicessuppliers, this will result in a significant intensification of competition; EMU will act as a catalystand encourage other trends such as disintermediation, internationalisation, technological change anda transformation of customer behaviour. For the banking sector this development will generateunprecedented pressure for radical restructuring and consolidation.EMU is hitting the European banks at a time when they are already suffering from a deterioration intheir profitability. Considerable investment in information and communications technology inconnection with EMU are now leading to additional costs while profitable business areas are beinglost at the same time. This means initially that there will be further pressure on the already narrowmargins of banks in continental Europe. This will inevitably force them to re-examine theircommercial strategy, with the primary objective of lowering costs.The effect of monetary union on the profitability of the banks will depend on each bank’s specificbusiness structure. Institutions which are already geared to operating internationally and tend tooperate to a greater extent in wholesale banking will find that the introduction of the single currencyin Europe exposes them to even stiffer competition than it does smaller banks, which operate mainlyin retail banking. The latter will retain their local or regional significance or will define themselvesas “niche suppliers” of specialised products.The necessary reduction in overcapacity as a result of greater competition will be seen as the mainchallenge for the entire financial sector. However, the special role of the banking industry in theeconomy calls for a more varied assessment of this more intense competition. The main reason forthis is the key position that the banking industry has in payments and in lending. It must also be
- 4 -BIS Review   97/1998remembered that credit institutions operate with a lower capital ratio than other types of enterpriseand are therefore more prone to risk. This means that it is essential that the process of consolidationin banking occurs in an orderly fashion; in other words, without endangering the stability of theentire system.Only a stable financial system provides a reliable base for the real economic development of aneconomy. Consequently, efforts to achieve a degree of concentration in the banking sector must notreach a stage where they encourage the development of a too-big-to-fail mentality, which mightexcessively heighten the banking industry’s willingness to take risks. Another point is that theconcentration of credit risks on a few large institutions tends to increase the danger of banking criseswith undesirable implications for the economy as a whole.The structure of the banking system is also very important for monetary policy. Credit institutionshave an extremely important part to play in the monetary transmission process. The comprehensiverange of business activities provided by the universal banks and the large number of creditinstitutions in Europe guarantee a broad “interface” for the transmission of monetary policyobjectives. Competition among the banks also plays an important role for the effectiveness ofmonetary policy because changes in interest rates can be passed on as quickly as possible to theeconomic agents only if there is a sufficient level of competition. The transmission channel will bekept relatively short as a result, and monetary policy stimuli will have an early impact on thespending of the economic players. At the same time the banking system must be stable andsufficiently profitable to make it possible, where applicable, to sustain the consequences of strongmonetary policy stimuli as well.VThe market’s confidence in the stability of the new currency is absolutely essential if the euro is to beused intensively internationally. The success of the euro will be measured in terms of future pricestability, and the expectations of market participants regarding that success will be of paramountimportance.The starting conditions are favourable for ensuring a stable euro. The average inflation rate in the 11countries participating in EMU has never been as low as it is now. The increase in prices was 1.0 %in September 1998 compared with the same period a year earlier; this compares with an annualaverage of 1.6 % in 1997 and 2.2 % in 1996. In this respect European monetary union can claim tohave achieved a respectable and notable degree of success in convergence.A crucial factor for the stability of the euro stems from the fact that the single currency andsupranational monetary policy will continue to be accompanied by national fiscal, structural, wageand social policies.The abolition of exchange rates and of national interest rate policies will reduce the scope for actionof all of the participating states. In future, the only possibility of coping with differences in theeconomic cycle and different response patterns to asymmetrical developments in the EMU countrieswill be by means of the economic policy instruments which remain within the sphere of nationalresponsibility.Satisfactorily functioning markets for goods, services and labour, with flexible costs and prices willplay a key role in overcoming future asymmetrical shocks in Europe. Responsive fiscal, social andstructural policies will likewise grow in importance as instruments of economic policy adjustment.Recognition of this fact was also a motive for introducing the Stability and Growth Pact. Only thosecountries which are in a healthy condition economically and have a budget which is balanced or in
- 5 -BIS Review   97/1998surplus will be able to enjoy a certain leeway in a recession and pursue an expansionary fiscal policywithout risking structural deficits.How do things look in reality? Most countries are quite some way from achieving a balanced budget.Many countries reached the convergence mark of 3 % for the current deficit only after makingconsiderable efforts. In some cases they did so only by resorting to one-off measures, the costs ofwhich were simply shifted to future budgets. Particularly countries with a high level of debt wereable to meet the deficit criterion only through all-time low market interest rates. What is more, thesecountries’ large debt, which is frequently incurred at the short end of the market or at variable ratesof interest, harbours a considerable measure of potential conflict for monetary policy makers. Anyrestrictive monetary policy measures by the ECB would have a direct impact on these countries’interest payments and place a burden on their current budgets.Among the serious problem areas in Europe is unemployment, which persists at an intolerably highlevel. It is true that a few countries such as the Netherlands, or Denmark and the United Kingdom(which are not yet participating in monetary union), point to a possible way out of the crisis inEurope. However, the situation in the large countries of Germany and France indicatessimultaneously the inability of the labour markets to react flexibly to the problem of permanentlyrising unemployment.VIDuring the past few weeks there has been a tendency in some quarters to try to exert a politicalinfluence on the consistent stability-oriented monetary policy in Europe. However, the priority givento the objective of stability and the independence of the ESCB as the essential elements of theMaastrict Treaty must not be called into question. Monetary stability is a precondition for - and notan alternative let alone an impediment to - achieving an appropriate measure of economic growthand for solving Europe’s employment problem. No monetary policy can solve structural problemswhich have their origins in national trends in fiscal, economic, wage and social policies.
BIS Review   96/1998Mr. Grenville focuses on international capital flows and crisesTalk by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. Stephen Grenville, to CreditSuisse First Boston Australia Conference entitled, “The Global Financial System – The Risks ofClosure” in Sydney on 13/11/98 (excluding bibliography).There are many things that went wrong for the countries caught up in the Asian crisis of 1997, butout of the myriad causes, two clear central problems can be identified: the fatal combination of largeand volatile international capital flows, interacting with fragile domestic financial sectors. Today, Iwant to focus on the first of these issues: international capital flows.International flows are now centre-stage in the international economic policy debate. This iscertainly a higher profile than capital flows usually have. Traditionally, the focus has been on thereal sector counterparts of these: the savings/investment balance and the current account surplusesand deficits. Both theory and practical policymaking often assume that these are the “movers” of theaction, with capital flows largely a passive, accommodating residual. But the Asian crisis suggeststhat the action may, instead, be in the capital flows themselves. The capital flows were certainlyexcessive in the sense that they were greater than could be absorbed (i.e. the capital flows weresubstantially larger than the current account deficits; see graph). The capital inflows into Indonesia,Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand in the five years 1990–94 were twice as large as the currentaccount deficits (Calvo and Goldstein. 1996, p. 125). Capital inflows into Thailand in 1996, forexample, were equal to 13% of GDP. The “excess” flows went to increase the foreign exchangereserves of the recipient country (in effect, being recycled back to the capital-exporting countries).But in the process they made the normal cycle in the recipient country much worse: providing thefunding to make the expansion phase of the cycle go more strongly and last longer, driving updomestic demand and asset prices. While there were both “push” and “pull” factors for the capitalflows, it is clear that the capital flows were not simply a passive accommodating force responding tothe fundamental economic factors occurring in the capital-importing countries.Graph 1Capital Inflows and Current Account Deficits percentage of GDP-1012345678910012345678910111213Private Capital InflowArgentina,1979-82Argentina, 1992-93BrazilChile,1978-81Chile,1989-94ColombiaIndonesiaMalaysia,1980-86Malaysia,1989-94Mexico,1979-81Mexico,1989-94Philippines,1978-83Philippines,1989-94Thailand,1978-84Thailand,1988-94Venezuela,1975-80Venezuela,1992-93Source: World Bank 1997, p. 243

First, the extraordinary increase in the flows startingin 1990, with this increase being truly phenomenal in Asia. By the mid-1990s, developing countrieswere taking 40% of global foreign direct investment (compared with 15% in 1990) and accountedfor 30% of global portfolio equity flows (compared with 2% at the start of the decade) (World Bank1997, p. 9). The second aspect to observe is just how volatile the flows could be, even in thesemulti-year averages.1 Following the Latin American debt crisis of 1982, inflows to that regionturned into outflows nearly as large, and these outflows were sustained until the end of the decade.Just as the law begins with a presumption of innocence, economics begins with a presumption thatmarket outcomes will be beneficial: there is an a priori case that international capital flows are aGood Thing. Financial flows supplement domestic saving, allowing more investment to be done inthose countries where returns are highest; they buffer the variations over time between exports andimports; foreign direct investment brings the advantages of technological transfer; there are gainsfor savers from diversification; and, to complete the case for free capital flows, we should record theargument that even speculative capital flows can serve a beneficial purpose.Perhaps the classic model for the beneficial operation of capital flows is illustrated by Singapore inthe 1970s and 1980s. The flows were very large, amounting on average to around 10% of GDP andin some years 15%. They were used to substantially increase the rate of investment (i.e. not forconsumption), and there was a substantial technological transfer that went with the foreign directinvestment which dominated the flows. Following the “stages of development” academic literature,we can see these flows being used to partially fund the catch-up as Singapore moved towards thetechnological frontier and its living standards rose to equal those of the industrialised Westerncountries. This sustained increase in living standards is confirmation that the combination ofapplication of capital and education produced very large and sustainable increases in production per                                                     1The sort of volatility that concerns us here is not the day-by-day or week-by-week “noise”, but the bigdisruptive swings.
- 3 -BIS Review   96/1998head.2 In a mutually reinforcing process, the profit opportunities fostered the development of theinstitutional channels which, at the same time, facilitated the capital flows.3This experience might give us some clues to analysing why these flows occurred more generally,why there was a huge increase in the 1990s, and the role capital flows played in the subsequentAsian crisis. There are two broad groupings of factors involved:• the presence of abnormal profit opportunities as these countries moved towards thetechnological frontier;• an institutional structure which facilitates the flows of capital.Profit differentialsThe countries of Asia, with their high rates of growth, provided high profit levels and manyopportunities for profitable investment. Expected returns on equity in emerging markets wereconsistently higher than those in mature markets, and their volatility was slightly below that of themature markets, indicating high risk-adjusted returns (IMF 1998, p. 32). Equity and stock priceswere also performing strongly (IMF 1998, p. 38).Growth and foreign investment certainly went hand in hand, although it might be noted that therewas a stronger relationship in the 1980s than during the 1990s.4 Of course, on top of these potentialreturns, there was also a question of exchange rate expectations, and we will return to this issuewhen we look at reasons for the volatility of flows. For the moment, it is enough to record that therewere ex post large excess returns on investment in the emerging Asian markets, taken as a whole.While it might seem, at first sight, that the main action in terms of profit differentials would comefrom the great opportunities available in the capital-receiving countries, it seems that quite a bit ofthe action – at least in the variability of the flows – came from changes in interest rates andexchange rates in the capital-supplying countries: “push” factors rather than “pull” factors. Apowerful force encouraging greater flows was the lower interest rates in most developed countries inthe early 1990s (US interest rates fell by 200 basis points between 1991 and 1993). The low ratesmade some investors search out higher returns overseas, and in seeking higher returns, they wereready to accept greater risks. Such was this new attitude that spreads on Brady bonds were bid downsharply in the early 1990s.                                                     2This is not to take sides in the Krugman debate on Singapore productivity: whether this came from morecapital or total factor productivity, the result – in terms of higher living standards – is not in dispute.3Foreign direct investment has been the key form of capital inflow for Singapore in its rapid development fromthe 1970s onwards. Foreign direct investment accounted for around 50% of net capital inflows in the 1970sand were the bulk of capital inflows in the 1980s, largely in manufacturing, trade and financial and businessservices. Direct investment flows surged from 1987 onwards, spurred by Japanese and European investment,particularly in financial and business services and, to a much lesser extent, in electronics manufacturing,reflecting the changes in Singapore’s industrial structure and comparative advantage. Foreign directinvestment as a proportion of investment accelerated during the late 1980s. (This was also the period of thegreat surge in Singapore’s share accumulation index, which captures capital and income gains from shares.)Excluding cyclical effects, the incremental capital/output ratio for Singapore steadily fell from the 1970s tothe 1990s – which suggests that the marginal efficiency of capital was still rising and investment opportunitieswere there to be exploited. Moreover, real interest rates were relatively high in this period. During the 1990s,however, real interest rates have come down, and, in recent years at least, Singapore’s incrementalcapital/output ratio seems to have started to rise. At the same time, portfolio flows also rose substantially, inboth an absolute and relative sense.4See, for example, BIS (June) 1998, p. 36.
- 4 -BIS Review   96/1998As the decade progressed, an important source of capital flow was Japan. Not only was itintrinsically a large saver, but the drawn-out recession meant that interest rates were extremely low(reaching half a percentage point) during most of the 1990s. Much of this capital flow went initiallyto the United States, but with the size of the US current account deficit set by thesavings/investment balance, these extra inflows were recycled and, in effect, funded the outflows toemerging countries. The interest differential between the major industrial countries and theemerging countries was greatest for Japan – hence the rise of the “yen-carry” trade – borrowing atlow interest rates in yen, and onlending at high returns in other currencies, particularly in Asia.When local currency borrowing rates were around 20% (which was the case, for example, inIndonesia), yen-based interest rates seemed extraordinarily attractive.5There was another important structural change in Japan which began in the late 1980s butaccelerated in the first half of the 1990s. With the very rapid and sustained appreciation of the yen,Japanese manufacturers recognised that they needed to transfer a large proportion of Japan’smanufacturing production (particularly at the low end of the technology spectrum) to the lowerlabour cost countries of Asia. This was a fundamental factor in driving the increase in foreign directinvestment to the region.6Was “push” or “pull” more important? In a structural sense, the high-profit “pull” of the capital-receiving countries was clearly fundamental. But short-term variation (surges and reversals) wasoften triggered by events in world markets. A number of researchers have found a close relationshipbetween interest rate movements in the capital-exporting countries and capital flows.7 The rise inUS interest rates in early 1994 was an important trigger in the Mexican problems, and thestrengthening of the yen in May/June 1997 was a factor in calling into question the continuingprofitability of the “yen carry”.Institutional structureWe noted earlier that profit opportunities in the emerging countries were probably greater in the1980s than in the 1990s, yet the surge of capital did not come until 1990. This would suggest that,while relative profit prospects were important, other factors were also involved. In this section, weexplore the importance of the institutional channels of transmission – did the institutions exist tofacilitate, in a fairly frictionless way, flows which were attracted by the high profit opportunities?This is, of course, a chicken-and-egg issue: as the capital flowed, it encouraged the furtherdevelopment of financial infrastructure. In the ten years between 1985 and 1994, for example, thecombined market capitalisation of the eighteen major developing countries in the IFC EmergingMarkets Index increased by a factor of thirteen. This process was spurred by greater knowledge                                                     5In thirteen of the twenty quarters to mid 1997, the “yen-carry” trade for yen/baht was profitable (i.e. exchangerate changes did not outweigh the interest differential), and for the equivalent yen/US dollar transaction, itproved profitable in eighteen of the twenty quarters (IMF 1998, p. 44).6Foreign direct investment from Japan tripled in the decade to 1997, rising from US$ 22.3 billion in 1986 toUS$ 66.2 billion in 1997. While the United States and Europe remain important destinations for Japan’sforeign direct investment, the Asian share noted the largest rise, increasing from around 10% of the total in1986 to 25% in 1997. The rise is most spectacular in foreign direct investment into China, with its sharejumping from 1 to almost 9% over this period. Indonesia was another important beneficiary. These flowswere very important to the countries concerned; Japanese total foreign direct investment to Korea, Malaysia,the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand accounted for around 46% of total net foreign direct investment tothese countries between 1990 and 1995.7See World Bank 1997, pp. 81–83.
- 5 -BIS Review   96/1998about these countries. One measure of this was the increase in formal credit ratings given by majoragencies: eleven countries had ratings in 1989; by 1997 this had risen to over fifty.8Part of the increase in the 1990s reflects the conclusion of the Latin American debt crisis of the1980s, marked by the issue of Brady bonds in 1989. With these, previous debt was settled in a waythat could give new investors confidence that their debts would be honoured. Not only did the Bradybonds settle the longstanding debt problems from the 1982 crisis, but they also signalled that theauthorities in the capital-exporting countries (particularly the United States) might help to sort outproblems when they arrived. This would have given institutional investors some comfort.One reason often cited to explain the increase in capital flows in the 1990s was the reduction invarious forms of capital controls in the emerging countries. This must certainly have been a factor.9But a number of these countries had an accommodating attitude to many forms of capital flows wellbefore the 1990s (Indonesia, for example, had essentially open capital markets since 1970).While all of these factors played a part, the dominant new factor of the 1990s, not present in earlierepisodes, was the greatly increased importance of institutional funds managers.Table 2: Assets of Institutional Investors198198199199199199199199Total (US$ billion)2,457,4612,3413,8414,616,8018,220,64Total (per cent of GDP)Canada35.252.260.366.972.681.285.689.2Germany20.337.139.537.437.542.544.948.9Japan23.150.377.975.679.184.185.287.0United Kingdom64.1118.3117.5129.7143.3175.2156.1176.0United States59.388.1118.7128.3132.8141.4141.7158.6Source: IMF 1995, p. 166, IMF 1998, p. 184.Figures from 1990 onwards include other forms of institutional saving outlined in IMF 1998 and include figures forFrance and Italy.See also BIS (June) 1998, p. 84.With around US$ 1 to 2 trillion increase in the portfolios of the institutional investors each yearduring the 1990s, there was clearly great potential to fund flows to emerging markets, whenattention turned to them. And turn to them it did. Not only were there big increases in these funds,but during the 1990s they became more focused on the need for portfolio diversification and shiftedfrom having almost no exposure to emerging countries to having significant exposure (although stillsubstantially less than most rules of thumb for portfolio diversification would suggest10). At thegeneral level, we can see the increase in international integration from measures of cross-bordertransactions in bonds and equities. For the United States, these were equal to less than 10% of GDPin 1980, around 100% by 1989, and 200% by 1997.11 Another general measure: nonresidentholdings of US public debt were around 15% of total in the 1980s, but 40% by 1997.12                                                     8See IMF 1997, p. 244.9For example, the index of capital controls calculated by the IMF fell significantly in 1992–94 (see IMF 1997,p. 242).10The usual rule is that diversification should match the capitalisation of equity markets. French and Poterba(1991) point out that at the end of the 1980s, US investors held 94% of their equity wealth in US securities,and for Japanese, the figure was 98%. It was higher still for French, Germans and Canadians.11See IMF 1998, p. 187.12The details of diversification, see World Bank 1997, p. 75; BIS (June) 1998, p. 89; IMF 1998, p. 185.
- 6 -BIS Review   96/1998In addition to these institutional investors, banks have become more internationalised, readier tolend to emerging countries. The high profile of the mutual funds (and, in particular, the hedgefunds) may distract attention from the central role of the banks. We will see, in a moment, that thebank flows were not just large, but were very volatile.Table 3: International Bank and Bond Finance for Five Asian Countries*(US$ billion)1990–91995 Q1996 Q1996 Q41997 Q1997 Q1998 Qat annual ratesat actual ratesNet interbank lending144311–31–31Bank lending to nonbanks21511–1–4Net bond issuance317321–2Total197554–31–37* Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.Source: BIS (August) 1998, BIS (June) 1998.VariabilityWhile the general case in favour of capital flows is a powerful one, the practical problem is theirvariability: the surges and reversals. There has always been variation in capital flows, as relativeinterest rates changed over the cycle, as profit opportunities opened up and were competed away,and in response to general factors of confidence and exchange rate expectations. However, for themost part, the variability is not enormous. Picking an example close to home, even wheninternational financial markets lost confidence in the Australian dollar in the mid 1980s (the“Banana Republic” episode), the exchange rate reacted significantly, but capital continued to flowto Australia – in fact, enough to fund a larger current account deficit as the crisis proceeded.The recent experience in Asia has been very different, with strong surges and major reversals of theflows.13Worth noting is the difference of behaviour between banks and institutional investors, on the onehand, and foreign direct investment, on the other. In this episode at least, foreign direct investmenthas proven to be the most resilient inflow and bank inflows the most flighty (World Bank 1997,p. 31). This accords with the presumption that direct investment is harder to reverse and is morefocused on the “fundamentals”.                                                     13For the experience elsewhere, see IMF Occasional Paper 108 and World Bank 1997, p. 28.

Not only did these institutional developments mean that the volume of flowsincreased, but, with the greatly increased importance of portfolio and banking flows, its nature (andparticularly its volatility) changed.In this section, I will argue that the volatility of flows was a product of:                                                     14See BIS (June) 1998, p. 122.
- 8 -BIS Review   96/1998• the tiny size of financial markets in the emerging countries, relative to the capital-exportingcountries. Size – or relative size – does matter. Minor portfolio adjustments for fund managerswere large changes for the recipient countries;• there was a lack of information and understanding about the emerging markets, which meantthat opinion was fickle and not well anchored by the fundamentals;• risk premia do not seem to follow a monotonic process, increasing steadily as risk increases.Rather, risk seems to be more like a binary (“on or off”) process;• finally, the emerging economies were in such a state of transition or flux that it is not sensibleto think of this as an equilibrium process, with profit expectations continuously equilibratedacross international markets. This disequilibrium manifests itself most clearly in the exchangerate (what Obstfeld (1998, p. 6) calls “an open economy’s most important price”). This centrallinking price which is at the heart of cross-border profit calculations is uncertain andunanchored – it could shift sharply, and there were no strong forces at work bringing it backtowards its starting point. As exchange rate expectations changed, capital flows respondedstrongly.(a) Relative sizeThese recipients of the capital inflows were small relative to the size of the flows. While net capitalinflows into the United States were over US$ 180 billion,15 this figure was only a little over twicethe size of the flows going into Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Comparethis to the size of these economies, credit systems and share markets, where the United Statesdwarfs these countries by a ratio of around ten to one.The problem has been described by the BIS this way: “This asymmetry, coupled with the ebbs andflows that have historically characterised portfolio investment in emerging countries, highlights thepotential for instability as a marginal portfolio adjustment by the investor can easily amount to afirst-order event for the recipient” (BIS (June) 1998, p. 90). “The sums involved were relativelysmall from the perspective of individual investors, even if of dangerous size from the perspective ofthe recipients” (BIS (June) 1998, p. 169).Graph 40255075100125150175Net PrivateCapital InflowGDPCreditStock Market01000200030004000500060007000Output, Credit and Equity Capitalisation, 1996USAAsian affected 5US$ BilUS$ Bil                                                     15Measured as the sum of foreign direct investment, portfolio flows and other.
- 9 -BIS Review   96/1998(b)InformationSome of the explanation for the reversals can be found in the paucity of information, amonginvestors, about the emerging markets. For the most part, their knowledge was so superficial that itcould be (and was) overwhelmed by the arrival of relatively small amounts of new information.More importantly, investors without their own knowledge base simply followed the herd. In such aworld, it is rational for any individual player to shift with the herd when new perceptions arrive.Whatever the fundamentals, when the herd is running, you run with it. In its usual understated way,the BIS observed that: “highly correlated strategies across different players may have contributed toan aggravation of asset price movements” (BIS (June) 1998, p. 95).The informational problems were compounded by the biased and ill-founded nature of much of theinformation and commentary. Looking back on it, it might seem surprising that there were not morepundits, highlighting the excessive nature of the flows and the domestic policymaking deficienciesof the recipient countries. But who would these pundits be? Among the policy officials in therecipient countries, the flows (and the development of sophisticated financial sectors) were a sign ofprogress and modernity: who would want to express doubts about that? In academic circles, thedominant paradigm was “efficient markets” – who would be bold enough to question the outcomeof the market? Any unexplained differential was passed off as a “risk premium” – the academic“fifth ace” that could square any circle and explain any regression result, no matter how differentfrom the “priors”. In the financial markets themselves, who was going to bite the hand that fedthem?16 Some of the subsequent commentary suggests naivety on the part of the investors (they“received repeated assurances that the financial sector was well supervised… and that there wouldbe no changes in exchange rate policy” (IMF 1998, p. 41)). In hindsight, the degree of ignorance isso great as to border on the comic. Business Week (22 September 1998) reports a fund manager’sresponse to the Russians’ halting of trade in their domestic debt market in this way: “Nobody in thehistory of the world has ever done anything this foolish”. Some sense of history!At the same time, it should be noted that information that was available was not used. The BISbanking data provided a comprehensive view on what turned out to be the most volatile element ofthe flows, but the existence of these data was either unknown or ignored.17 As far as the outcome isconcerned, however, unused information was as irrelevant as unavailable information.(c)The behaviour of risk premiaThe process of assessing and reassessing risk is captured, to some extent, in the pricing of emergingmarket debt.                                                     16See Fortune article (11 May 1998).17For an exception, see Radelet (1995).

As Sachs (1997) observed: “euphoria turnedto panic without missing a beat”. One of the characteristics of capital flows in the crisis was theirreversal – it was not simply a matter of the capital-receiving countries being forced to paysomewhat more for the capital, because of a changing perception of risk. New flows dried up andexisting capital fled, and could not be lured back at any price. Considerations of risk seem to be abinary (on/off) process, rather than a monotonic function. In part, this was a rational response bylenders. Even well-run enterprises had their profit (and repayment) prospects radically altered by thenew environment of high interest rates, massive falls in exchange rates and shattered growthprospects. Once interest rates rose sharply, a different calculus became relevant – the credit riskoverwhelmed any risk-premium calculation. Credit lines were cut. This is in keeping with thetheoretical work of Stiglitz and Weiss (1981), who show that when interest rates go up sharply,lenders recognise that the only borrowers who are willing to pay these high rates are those who donot intend to pay back.This process was not helped by the behaviour of credit rating agencies, who went along with thegeneral pre-crisis euphoria, and exacerbated the turnaround of opinion by substantial downgradingsafter the crisis had occurred. As these downgrades shifted some financial instruments belowinvestment grade, institutions with portfolio constraints on asset quality were forced to sell – at anyprice. The fact that many of these portfolios were judged month-by-month or even day-by-day led tostrong short-termism.

Systems were in flux, andproduction functions were changing continuously. This general notion manifested itself in variousways, but three examples will illustrate the issue.The first example of apparent disequilibrium in capital flows was identified nearly two decadesago – the Feldstein/Horioka paradox (1980) – there seemed to be too much correlation betweendomestic saving and investment rates in individual countries, with the implication that capital flowsbetween countries were smaller than would occur in a well integrated world. So here, perhaps, isanother clue to the puzzle. It is not so much that capital flows rose suddenly to achieve abnormallyhigh levels, but that they were – for some reason – less than optimal earlier, and so the big increasewas a move towards a more normal or equilibrium situation.18 These are asset or stock equilibria.When these ill-defined and easily changeable temporary equilibria are displaced by a shift ofconfidence, the flow requirements to shift from the old to the new stock equilibrium may be verylarge (and very disruptive).Second, profits (or even expected profits) were not equilibrated across countries. For a sustainedperiod (through the 1980s), excess profits had been earned, illustrated by equity returns and highdomestic real interest rates in Indonesia, Korea and Thailand.                                                     18Indeed, the constant revisiting of the Feldstein/Horioka result has found less correlation between domesticsaving and investment rates over time, implying increasing international capital integration (Fujiki andKitamura 1995; Ghosh 1995).

There was a widespread belief (based on actual experience, pre-crisis) that whateverfactory or office building was constructed would prove profitable, because of the tremendousgrowth of these economies. No matter how much capital flowed, the marginal investor did not feelthat his actions had used up the last abnormal profit opportunity, and that a “normal profit”equilibrium had been reached. Investors could not tell if what they were seeing were temporaryabnormal profits (in which they should try to get themselves a share of the action), or high returnbecause of high risk. Too many assumed it was the former. To the extent that markets acted toequilibrate returns, they did so by bidding up asset prices (thus reducing the profit return of theinvestor who paid the higher price). But this was a knife-edge equilibration: as asset prices rose,investors extrapolated the rise, so that even if the profit flow on the asset was normal, investorsexpected to benefit from continuing asset price increases. So investment continued until obviousexcess capacity emerged, and the bubble burst.                                                     19They were not, as is sometimes claimed, high to support exchange rates; exchange rates were under upwardpressure for most of the period.
- 13 -BIS Review   96/1998The third manifestation of disequilibrium was in the exchange rate. What is the “right” exchangerate for a country receiving large capital inflows and likely to go on receiving them for a protractedperiod – perhaps a decade or more – before investment returns are reduced to “normal”? This relatesto the old issue of the “transfer problem” – how to bring about the current account deficit that is thereal resources counterpart of the financial capital inflow. For this, the exchange rate probably has toappreciate from its underlying value. But how far? Portfolio equilibrium would suggest that theappreciation must be enough to create the expectation of a subsequent depreciation, at a rate tobalance the higher expected returns on domestic, compared with foreign, assets, i.e. to balance thedifferential between the domestic interest rate and the foreign rate. If this view-of-the-worldcaptured reality, we would see a once-off appreciation followed by a long drawn-out steadydepreciation, at a rate equal to the difference between domestic and foreign interest rates. It hardlyneeds saying that this – with its implication of a continuous, enduring, finely balanced calculus –did not fit reality, even remotely. True, exchange rates in these countries were under continualupward pressure in the first half of the 1990s. But this was, by and large, resisted (and did nothappen much in real terms, covertly, via faster domestic inflation). Then, more or less once-off andsuddenly, exchange rates experienced massive falls.So what story fits the facts better? Capital flows involve, for one or other of the parties, a foreignexchange risk.20 For the period of inflow during the first half of the 1990s, the authorities in thesecountries were holding more or less fixed exchange rates in order to stop an over-appreciationwhich would have cut into their international competitiveness and the dynamism which thetradeables sector was providing to the economy (and, incidentally, made them vulnerable to changesof confidence when markets became concerned about overvaluation). Investors knew this (as didborrowers in these countries), so they were prepared to take the risk of having a foreign exchangeexposure without covering it (c.f. the “yen carry”), on the view that these exchange rates were morelikely to appreciate than depreciate.21 Herd behaviour was important in the capital surge, as well asin the withdrawals of capital. The smart money went to these countries in response to the profitopportunities, and lots of dumb money followed along for the ride, financing dubious investmentprojects. Once there was a turning-point in confidence, there was a rush for the exits. The herdcharged in the reverse direction. As well, the elements of leverage which had built up during thecapital inflow stage made it imperative that positions be unwound quickly when the reversal came –leveraged investors cannot wait for the market to return to its senses: they sell or they are sold. Tomake matters worse, these forced sales took place in markets which had become illiquid – when noone wants to take on these risks, the price falls a long way. In textbook markets, price falls bring outbargain hunters: in these markets, price falls just confirmed the worst fears.The problem is that asset prices (whether real estate or the exchange rate) are quite random in theshort run, and the short run is the investment horizon relevant to fund managers – they are judged ontheir quarter-by-quarter (or month-by-month) performance. In a market dominated by suchinvestors, there are no Friedmanite stabilising speculators to buy when the price falls. Even rationalinvestors join the herd.                                                     20Even hedging simply shifts this to another party.21Some have described this process of fixed exchange rates as “guarantees”, but this misunderstands the natureof the problem: certainly, investors did not expect the exchange rate to depreciate much, but they knew thatdepreciations had occurred in the past, and those who had exposures in currencies other than the US dollar(by far the majority – see Goldstein and Hawkins (1998)) had been continually experiencing changes in therelevant exchange rate. But few of them saw any reason, in a world in which capital flows were puttingupward pressure on exchange rates, to take out expensive cover against the possibility of the exchange ratefalling sharply.
- 14 -BIS Review   96/1998While we might be amazed at the extent of the movements in exchange rates (the rupiah falling toless than a fifth of its initial value, which no one at the time thought was significantly overvalued),we should not be surprised by the failure of the portfolio model of exchange rate behaviour (or anyother exchange rate model, for that matter). The most basic and central idea in any view relying onthe efficient markets hypothesis is uncovered interest rate parity – that interest rate differentials arethe best predictor of subsequent exchange rate movements. Despite the most diligent, strenuousefforts on the part of those who have built models and academic reputations on the efficient marketshypothesis, the data inconveniently but consistently refute it.22 So is it any surprise that, once fixedexchange rates were dislodged (by a combination of large adverse terms-of-trade shifts, somemodest over-appreciation through inflation, and adverse international commentary), the unanchoredrates could swing to absurd values: there were no accepted views on fundamentals. Investors hadseen how much the yen/US dollar rate moved during the 1990s (in well understood, deep markets):it is hardly surprising that they would not stand in the way of huge swings in Asian currencies. Bythe time extrapolative expectations took hold, demand curves for foreign exchange sloped thewrong way: as the price became cheaper, people bought less.Once this was teamed with large open exposures, the fragile financial sectors of these countriescollapsed, under the weight of their own open foreign exchange positions in some cases, but moreoften under the collapsing creditworthiness of their commercial sector borrowers (who did havelarge uncovered foreign exchange exposure). This collapse of the financial system interacted withthe real economy: even good investment projects (and there were plenty of bad ones) turned sour inthe face of credit withdrawal and deep economic recession. The rest, as they say, is history.ConclusionMore than a century ago, Bagehot observed: “the same instruments which diffused capital through anation are gradually diffusing it among nations.” He went on to warn that while “the effect of thiswill be in the end much to simplify the problems of international trade… for the present, as iscommonly the case with incipient causes whose effect is incomplete, it complicates all it touches”(Bagehot 1880, p. 71).23 This encapsulates a key insight: as countries integrate their financialmarkets with international markets – itself an eminently desirable process – there is a longish periodof transition, during which an economy is extremely vulnerable to changes of confidence.There had been plenty of hand-wringing about this issue beforehand. Before the 1997 crisis, theWorld Bank summarised the situation this way: “The world’s financial markets are rapidlyintegrating into a single global marketplace, and ready or not, developing countries, starting fromdifferent points and moving at various speeds, are being drawn into this process. If they haveadequate institutions and sound policies, developing countries may proceed smoothly along the roadto financial integration and gain the considerable benefits that integration can bring. Most of them,however, lack the prerequisites for a smooth journey, and some may be so ill-prepared that they losemore than they gain from financial integration.” (World Bank 1997, p. 1).Substantial capital inflows to the emerging countries were not irrational, unnatural or undesirable.While all sensible observers point to the benefits of capital flows, the variability is clearly harmful,but hard to correct: “boom and bust cycles are hardly a sideshow or a minor blemish oninternational capital flows: they are the main story” (Rodrik 1998, p. 56). As Bhagwati (1998) notes:“the ‘panics, manias and crashes’ that characterise capital flows have no counterpart in trade flows”.The issue is: what to do?                                                     22The staunchest supporters of interest rate parity must have had their faith sorely tested by the extraordinarymovements of the yen in the 1990s, in a climate of interest rate stability.23Quoted by World Bank (1997).
- 15 -BIS Review   96/1998Any policy that attempts to isolate an economy from international capital markets would be costly,in terms of forgone growth. The need, now, is to devise an institutional structure which can reap thebenefits of capital flows while diminishing the risks to those countries whose financialinfrastructure is not yet resilient enough to cope. What needs to change?One early response was to try to identify some technical deficiency whereby the real world did notmimic the efficient markets of the textbooks, and assume that correcting this will fix the problem.We noted that information deficiencies were one reason why opinions, confidence and critical prices(such as the exchange rate) were unanchored and subject to violent change. After the Mexican crisisof 1994/95, there was a line of argument that came very close to saying that if Mexico had revealedits foreign exchange reserve levels more explicitly during 1994, somehow the crisis would havebeen averted. A variant of this emerged in the early days of the Thai crisis: if only Thailand hadrevealed its forward foreign exchange position, markets would have operated smoothly to avoidcrisis. This seems to be naïve, but we have to be careful in pointing this out: to question the benefitsof greater transparency is like arguing against peace, freedom and motherhood. So let me be quickto say that more transparency would help. But it is another thing again, in a world of complexcausality, to see this as a fundamental solution. After all, it is hard to explain the extraordinarymovements in asset prices in sophisticated markets (US equities in 1987; the yen in 1995–98). Howmuch more information is needed to prevent swings of this sort?A similar “fix-it” has been suggested, in the form of elimination of “guarantees” and “moralhazard”. We have already noted that many of the so-called guarantees were, more accurately,misassessments by optimistic market players – they were guarantees only in the eyes of theinvestors. Moral hazard is a more believable market deficiency, at least in some specific cases. Forexample, financial markets were confident, based on experience, that countries do not devalue orrenege on foreign debts while they are under the tutelage of an IMF program, and this gave investorsin Russia earlier this year a false sense of security. The answer, on the surface, seems simple: makesure investors lose money from time to time. This, like many solutions, is supported in general butdifficult to apply in specific cases. As George Soros (1998) has noted: “Financial markets… resentany kind of government interference, but they hold a belief that, if conditions get rough, theauthorities will step in.” Once governments have helped, moral hazard is part of investmentdecisions from then on. So let us, by all means, try to reduce it by requiring “burden sharing” on thepart of private sector investors (see below). But let us not fool ourselves into thinking that it can beentirely eliminated.A further variant on the fix-the-market approach suggested that markets were not sufficiently open.In the early days of the Asian crisis, a common argument held that the problem was simpledeficiencies in domestic policymaking and open capital accounts are the best discipline on errantpolicymakers. There is truth in this argument – countries which do not make policy mistakescertainly stand a better chance of weathering the international storms (c.f. Stiglitz’s rowboats). Butit is not realistic to hope for continuously perfect policies. We need a framework that can cope withthe inevitable imperfections of the policy process. As well, with the crisis much further developed,we can now see that even countries with good policies, sound infrastructure and high openness cancome under enormous pressure (c.f. Hong Kong). So, even if policymakers (working as they do inimperfect, politically driven worlds) were able to produce consistently good policies (a big ask), thisis no assurance against volatility in capital flow.We have to accept that markets, even under as favourable conditions as are likely to be found in thereal world, have not – and will not – consistently act as a smooth, well informed, far-sightedWalrasian auction process to maximise benefits and minimise the costs of capital flows. “Given thetroubling way in which economic, political and social factors interact, it is simply not prudent to
- 16 -BIS Review   96/1998assume that everything will turn out for the best.” (BIS (June) 1998, p. 170). So, while we strive forgood policymaking, and urge more information disclosure (including on the private sector players ininternational markets), we need to explore other possibilities.Part of the problem in coming to grips with these issues has been the insistent voices of anaccidental coalition of academics, and vested interests who used the efficient markets paradigm asan intellectual battering ram to open new commercial opportunities. The intellectual climate is nowundergoing a shift. When the doyen of the hedge funds, George Soros, describes capital flows as “awrecker’s ball”, you know the debate has changed.What specific measures might be explored? Among the spectrum of possibilities, let us start withthe least controversial. Much of the focus should be on improving prudential measures – the “rulesof the game” governing the financial sector, and banks in particular. Much hard work is needed tomake existing rules work properly – limiting connected and government-directed lending; gettingasset valuations (and hence provisioning) right; and enforcing foreign currency open-position limits.As well, the rules need to be reinforced. Banks have to be made to take account of their borrowers’overall balance sheet position, so that the bank is not brought down, at one remove, by the foreignexchange exposure of its borrowers. Poor credit appraisal was clearly a central factor in the Asiancrisis, which now has to be addressed. None of this can be done effectively without a goodaccounting and legal (including bankruptcy) framework, and, realistically, none of it will be put inplace quickly. Here is the rub. It is difficult – perhaps impossible – to put in place fully effectivesupervision before financial development occurs: the markets will be pushing ahead faster thansupervisors. The deregulation process itself is a difficult environment in which to get this right: atthe same time that one set of regulations is dismantled, another set (the prudential rules) has to beput in place. Hence the debate about sequencing has an academic ring to it. Let’s work hard on theprudential framework. It will be important. But it may not be enough.24When things go wrong (as they will from time to time, in even the best managed system), there mustbe clear methods of rapid resolution. This should include a readiness to institute stand-fast andworkout arrangements for private debt. Just as bankruptcy arrangements should not be too easilyavailable for resolution of domestic debts, such international stand-fast and workout arrangementsshould only be instigated by some internationally endorsed process (say, as part of an IMF standbyarrangement). But we need to be ready to do this promptly when circumstances warrant. Again,textbook ideas have been unhelpful in practice – the idea that private sector borrowers and lenders(“consenting adults”) will work things out satisfactorily has proved naïve: the collateral damage istoo great. Private sector debt was (and remains) a festering sore which inhibits the return to healthof some Asian economies. This is not to argue that the private sector should have been bailed out.Rather, that it should have been quickly and decisively “bailed in”, to bear its full share of the costsof crisis resolution, through stand-fast and workout arrangements.Many of these measures will remind lenders of the risks involved, and this will raise the cost ofborrowing in good times: but that would be no bad thing. In the same vein, the existence of well-                                                     24What of the hedge funds – the butt of both strong attack and spirited defence? It might have been possible,once, to argue that these funds were playing a useful role as stabilising speculators, buying cheap and sellingdear, to help markets find equilibrium values and smooth the flows. This position is no longer tenable, at leastas a generalisation. There are enough examples, now, of them shorting already undervalued currencies, in thehope (assisted by vigorous self-serving market commentary) that the undervaluation could be pushed further.While they may not be big players in the immediate future, this may be the moment to emphasise thatwhatever arguments there are for disclosure of official market positions (reserves and forward positions),these apply with equal force for large private players. If fully informed markets work better, then let us aim toensure that markets are fully informed about the hedge funds.
- 17 -BIS Review   96/1998defined international stand-fast and workout arrangements (and “collective action” clauses in bondswhich make the possibility of workouts explicit) may cause lenders to focus on the possibility ofloss, but wouldn’t that help the moral hazard problems? If more carefully designed and rigorouslyenforced prudential controls inhibit some short-term flows, would there be any great loss in that?Clearly, part of the capital surge of the 1990s could, with benefit, have been done without. Is theproblem – like advertising – that you do not know which part to stop? No. We can see elements –short-term rootless flows – which had minimum benefits and greatest costs. A case can be made thatit would have been no great loss if the Asian countries had received only the foreign directinvestment flow. While it is technically true that “speed doesn’t kill – it’s the stopping”, we shouldrecall that the problems come from excessive inflows, so if the net result of more rigorous “rules ofthe game” is smaller inflows in the boom times, then that will be a plus. If something has to giveway in the “open economy trilemma” (Obstfeld and Taylor 1997), then some limits on the varianceof capital flow seem a good place to start.The third – and most controversial – set of possibilities are those which smack of capital controls.Even here, the debate has shifted. Now, Chilean-type controls seem to be acceptable to internationalopinion. What distinguishes these? They are market-based, upfront and ex ante, and are on inflowsrather than outflows. This is all still a lively topic of debate. The consensus view is changing, butslowly. While now acknowledging that temporary controls may be required in certaincircumstances, the international consensus has a rather disparaging tone. Just as “real men don’t eatquiche”, real countries don’t resort to capital controls. If such short-term capital controls are alegitimate instrument of policy, we need to define more clearly the circumstances, and be readier toendorse their use in these conditions.The alternative to implementing these ideas is inaction – either in the hope that these problems willgo away or because of some ideological position based on the preservation of market purity. Thisrisks losing the very real benefits of capital flows, if it leads to ill-designed measures by emergingcountries to isolate themselves from these problems. At the same time, the crisis tarnishes thecomplex international trading structure, and adds to the growing voices damning “globalisation”.Krugman (1998) has reminded us that Keynes saw his interventionist active fiscal proposals asnecessary to save the market system. Now, changes are needed in international financial markets tosafeguard the continuance of international capital flows, with all the benefits they bring.
BIS Review   95/1998Mr. Stals comments on the need for greater financial flexibility in a volatileglobal financial environment   Address by the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank,Dr. Chris Stals, at the Annual Dinner of the Institute of Bankers in Cape Town on 5/11/98.1. Increasing volatility in financial marketsDevelopments in the global financial markets over the past year focused theattention on the ability of countries to adapt to rapidly changing conditions in an extremelyvolatile global environment. With a strong trend towards globalisation and the worldwideintegration of financial markets that swept through the world economy over the past decade,most countries of the world, big and small, have now become more exposed to volatile capitalinflows and outflows. The cross-border (and therefore cross-currency) transfers of huge amountsof investment funds disrupt domestic and foreign currency markets in many countries almost ona regular basis.From the experience of the past year, it is clear that many of the smaller countrieswith rapidly expanding domestic economies and emerging financial markets find it increasinglymore difficult to maintain domestic financial stability and remain within the unstableenvironment of an integrated global financial market. The amounts involved in volatile capitaltransfers are too large for the smaller economies to absorb. Countries find it difficult to adaptinternal situations to sudden and unpredictable turnarounds in the flow of funds that may takeplace from time to time.A second major problem that surfaced during this year of financial turmoil centredaround the diverse economic needs of many countries that find themselves at different stages ofeconomic development, different phases of the business cycle, and pursuing different objectiveswith their overall economic strategies. The integrated global financial markets set high standards,based on the needs and norms of the more developed economies, being the main source of thesupply of funds. Ambitious fund managers, seeking to maximise the yield on investmentsmanaged on behalf of demanding clients, have little loyalty to the needs or the circumstances ofthe countries where they make their investments. There is, indeed, little diversification in theirthinking or in their computer programs when they invest in the global markets -- all emergingmarkets are, for example, treated as just one group of countries.Given the environment of volatile capital movements, a third deficiency of thepresent system has been identified, and that is the lack of a global “lender of last resort” or“discount window facility” that can serve to provide temporary assistance in times of suddenoutflows of capital from a country. The resources of the International Monetary Fund turned outto be completely inadequate in the present volatile environment. Even after the completion of thecurrent round of increases in the quotas of the Fund, the IMF will not be in a position to supplythe needs of its member countries in times of serious global financial crises. Many recipientsover the past year of IMF assistance are also of the opinion that the conditionalities attached toIMF loans are no longer appropriate for the present world environment. Disruptions ininternational financial markets are no longer created by structural or temporary imbalances ininternational trade, but rather by volatile international capital inflows and outflows. The IMF’sconditionalities are still directed, however, to the restoration of equilibrium in the currentaccount of the balance of payments.A fourth conclusion from the developments of the past year is that the presentinternational financial system of floating exchange rates and free capital movements provides
- 2 -BIS Review   95/1998increasing incentives for speculators and short-term profit explorers to exploit weaknesses ofindividual countries, often at the cost of the impoverished and the poor people of the world.2. A Hobson’s choice for the emerging marketsSmaller countries such as South Africa can do little to change the world financialsystem, but may still be able to isolate themselves from the volatility of the world environment.This will, however, require comprehensive restrictive exchange controls on both residents andnon-residents in respect of all international capital transactions. In the process, a country thatmoves in this direction will most probably be excluded from the ongoing process of financialglobalisation, and will be barred from access to international capital markets.A few countries recently nevertheless opted for this alternative and ratherpreferred the route of isolation to the continued exposure of their economies to fickle foreignfund managers and international currency speculators. In the case of Malaysia, it was judged thatthe country’s high domestic savings rate will generate sufficient funds to provide for its needs forfuture economic development. In the case of Russia, the government had no other choice but toclose its financial markets after a major collapse in the public and private sector financialsystems.South Africa, with its low level of domestic saving and massive needs for futureeconomic development, has no choice. Unless this country can rely on some regular substantialinflow of capital from the rest of the world, its economic growth rate will not create sufficientjobs for the already large number of unemployed and the annual addition to the labour force, orprovide the resources needed for the social upliftment of the population. South Africa musttherefore remain part of the global financial markets, and must pursue macroeconomic policiesand introduce structural adjustments regarded as necessary to make the country attractive forforeign investors.It is not precluded that some important changes may be introduced to the worldfinancial system over the next few years. South Africa will, to the extent that it participates inthis debate in various international fora, press for the introduction of measures that will reducethe volatility of the markets. We know from experience, however, that proposals for change tothe global financial architecture can take a long time to find consensus, and changes will mostprobably only be introduced gradually.In the meantime, South Africa will be exposed from time to time to volatilecapital movements, and the domestic economy will remain vulnerable to external disturbancesthat may in the short term force macroeconomic policies inconsistent with domestic economicobjectives. The question remains, what can, or should, South Africa do to make sure that thedomestic economy will, over the medium and longer term, be better protected against thedisadvantages of international financial market volatility and still gain maximum advantage frominternational capital inflows?
- 3 -BIS Review   95/19983. The need for financial flexibilityGlobalisation is about markets. It is markets that are being integrated in aworldwide system of unrestricted capital movements, and markets that are being opened up forparticipation by investors from all around the world. Acceptance of any country in the globalfinancial markets therefore requires a recognition of the principles of the market economy, andan adherence to the rules of the game.One of the basic rules of the game in a market economy is that governments mustallow market forces of demand and supply to determine prices. Intervention by governments inthe markets for whatever purpose, if necessary, must always work through the markets, withoutsuspending or restricting the forces of demand and supply. The price mechanism indeed providesthe core discipline of the market economy, and through price changes, markets signal messagesand activate automatic adjustment processes intended to hold demand and supply in equilibrium.In the context of international capital flows, the exchange rate is, of course, themost important price. It is important for the smaller countries therefore to ensure flexibleadjustment processes for exchange rate changes in the environment of a volatile global financialenvironment. It is almost impossible to maintain a fixed exchange rate for any currency oncelarge amounts of capital start flowing out of or into a country. Efforts to maintain a fixed andunrealistic exchange rate in such circumstances will only entice speculative transactions that willeventually exacerbate the problem.This does not mean, however, that the authorities may never intervene in theforeign exchange market, for example to maintain orderly conditions, to smooth out short-termfluctuations, or to provide liquidity to the market. Such interventions, which must preferablyalways be conducted through the market system, are often confused with a policy of fixing theexchange rate through more direct means of control.In South Africa, there is a misguided perception that the Reserve Bank mustintervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent any appreciation of the rand, but must refrainfrom intervention whenever the rand comes under pressure for depreciation. Such a policy will,of course, create a one-way bet for speculators and will encourage short-term investors to takepositions against the rand and then force the exchange rate down to generate capital profits forthemselves. The Reserve Bank prefers to intervene in the market on a discretionary basis, towork discreetly through the market forces of demand and supply, and to keep speculatorsguessing on what the Bank’s next step will be.South Africa adheres to a policy of a floating exchange rate system. As long as westill maintain exchange control restrictions on the foreign assets that South African residents mayhold, the Reserve Bank will have to continue to intervene in the foreign exchange market fromtime to time, both as a buyer and as a seller of foreign exchange. As in the past, the Bank willexercise cautious discretion, will respect the underlying forces of demand and supply, and willaccept the need at times for a depreciation and, in different circumstances, also for anappreciation of the rand. In other words, we believe the present South African exchange ratepolicy has sufficient flexibility built into the system to accommodate the vicissitudes of aglobalised financial market system.Another very important price that must be flexible and adjustable in this newworld financial environment is the interest rate. Interest rates are prices: the prices of loanable
- 4 -BIS Review   95/1998funds with different maturities and different risk exposures. As is the case with all other prices ina market economy, interest rates are determined by forces of demand and supply. If theauthorities do not want to accept interest rates as determined by market forces, they shouldpreferably work through the markets to either reduce the demand for funds (for example byreducing government expenditure), or increase the supply of funds (by creating more moneythrough the central bank). This latter course may reduce interest rates in the short term, but holdsthe danger of higher inflation, and therefore also higher interest rates, in the longer term.In March this year, the Reserve Bank moved away from the conventional fixedBank rate for its loans to banking institutions and introduced the more flexible daily tendersystem for repurchase transactions, where the effective lending rate of the Reserve Bank isdetermined on a day-to-day basis through a process of the interaction of demand and supply. Therepo rate is now more closely linked to movements in short-term market interest rates asdetermined by overall demand and supply conditions in the money market. Short-term interestrates can adjust very quickly to changes in underlying conditions. The repo rate can be influencedby the Reserve Bank by changing the amount of central bank funds supplied to the market. In theprocess, the basic principle of the market mechanism is adhered to.Here once again there is a misguided perception in South Africa that the ReserveBank should intervene more actively in the markets to prevent interest rates from rising, evenwhen there is a fundamental shortage of funds, but should not prevent interest rates fromdeclining in times of increases in the supply of funds. Such an asymmetrical approach will,unfortunately, not be tolerated by the disciplines of the global market economy. In the recentturmoil in the international financial markets, a number of smaller countries experienced thevengeance of the international market forces when they tried to keep exchange rates or interestrates fixed at artificial levels not associated with the underlying market fundamentals.A third area where greater flexibility in the price-fixing process has become ofmore importance in the situation of global financial integration is in the determination of theprices of financial assets such as share and bond prices. A decision by the Hong Kong MonetaryAuthority recently to buy shares in the stock exchange when sales by non-residents pushed pricesdown was exploited by speculators, but nevertheless contributed to some stabilisation as theauthorities operated mainly through the market mechanism of demand and supply. As with allother interventions by the authorities in the financial markets, buying or selling of paper in thefinancial markets should be done with discretion, and should not prevent normal market forcesfrom continuing to function effectively. For a country such as South Africa, it is thereforeimportant to encourage well-functioning, efficient and flexible financial markets where pricescan adjust quickly to changes in the underlying demand and supply conditions.Many other examples of a need for greater flexibility in the process of pricedetermination can be conjectured, for example, prices of commodities, of financial services, andof labour. Without flexible prices in all markets, smaller countries will find it increasinglydifficult to survive in an integrated worldwide economy.
- 5 -BIS Review   95/19984. South Africa’s experience with global financial volatilityOver the past six months, South Africa has experienced the full force of theuncontrollable volatility of the international financial markets. A few statistics will illustrate theimpact these forces had on the South African economy:• During the first four months of 1998, non-residents increased their holdings ofSouth African bonds by R16.3 billion. During the next five months, that isfrom May to September, non-residents reduced their holdings of South Africanbonds by R22.4 billion.• The exchange rate of the rand, which was relatively stable throughout 1997 andthe first four months of 1998, depreciated by 21.4 per cent from 22 May 1998to 31 August 1998. Since then, the rand has appreciated slightly but is still, atthis stage, on average about 16 per cent down from the beginning of the year.• The yield on long-term government bonds rose from below 13 per cent in April1998 to 20.09 per cent on 28 August 1998, and then declined again to below 16per cent at this stage.• The prime overdraft rate of banking institutions was raised from 18.25 per centat the end of April 1998 to 25.5 per cent on 28 August 1998. During the pastfew weeks, the major banks have reduced their prime overdraft rates again to23.5 per cent.• The average prices of all shares listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchangeincreased by 32.3 per cent from December 1997 to an all-time high in May1998, but then declined by 38.7 per cent to the end of September 1998. Sincethe end of September, the all-shares price index of the Johannesburg StockExchange has increased again by about 19 per cent.These erratic movements in major financial aggregates created many problems forthe authorities, financial institutions, businesses, private individuals, and indeed for the totaleconomy. And yet, nobody can be blamed for it. It is part of the globalisation of financialmarkets, and of South Africa’s participation in this process. South Africa went through a similarexperience in 1996. On both occasions, that is in 1996 and so far in 1998, we succeeded inrestoring financial stability in a relatively short period of time, but not without painful adjustmentand a high social cost in terms of low economic growth.There is no guarantee that somewhere down the road our economy will not betested again by the increasing volatility of an integrated world financial market system. It istherefore important that we shall all learn from the two experiences of the past three years, andshall prepare our economy to prosper even within the environment of volatile internationalcapital movements.We have learnt that sound macroeconomic policies at all times make it easier toabsorb the fluctuations in the financial markets. Countries that do not apply soundmacroeconomic policies are punished more severely during times of international currencyturmoil.
- 6 -BIS Review   95/1998We have learnt that flexibility in domestic financial and other markets makes iteasier to absorb the shocks of the periodic global financial market disturbances. In particular, wehave learnt that prices as determined by market forces must be allowed to respond quickly anddecisively to changes in underlying market conditions.We have learnt that government policies are important, but that governmentactions alone cannot solve the problem once it has infiltrated into our markets. The disciplines ofthe market economy must be allowed to function in a flexible way.We have learnt above all that sound, well-managed, and healthy bankinginstitutions can form a major bastion against total economic collapse in a situation of largecapital outflows. In a number of East Asian countries, the economies collapsed completelybecause weak banking systems could not survive in the adverse climate of sudden large outflowsof capital.South Africa must be grateful for the strength of our banking system, and mustprotect it to make sure that we shall also be able to withstand the future storms of a volatileglobal financial market environment. Weak banking systems lead to weak economies.
BIS Review   93/1998Mr. Duisenberg’s opening statement at the press conference covering thelatest meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank   Introductorystatement by the President of the European Central Bank, Dr. W.F. Duisenberg, at the pressconference held in Frankfurt on 3/11/98.Ladies and gentlemen, as in previous months, the Vice-President and I are heretoday to report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council of the EuropeanCentral Bank. The number of items considered by the Governing Council required a full-daymeeting. Most of the items on the agenda were of a rather technical nature or were related to thelegal implementation of decisions already taken at previous Governing Council meetings. Part ofthe meeting was attended by Mr. Edlinger, President of the EU Council, and by Commissionersde Silguy and Monti.Let me first turn to the Governing Council’s in-depth discussion on recenteconomic, monetary and financial developments.Starting with the global macroeconomic environment, it was felt that the spiral ofbad news has not continued over the most recent weeks. Also, when looking at marketdevelopments, we have observed a strengthening of the US dollar vis-à-vis euro area currenciessince its trough in mid-October. We have seen a recovery in global stock markets and we havealso witnessed some upward correction of long-term bond yields after they had fallen sharply asa result of a “flight to quality”. However, markets displayed considerable volatility duringOctober, reflecting the uncertainty prevailing in the world economy.Whether or not we can now expect a process towards more normal conditionsremains to be seen. Given the underlying causes of the adverse conditions in Asia, Russia andother parts of the world, a quick resolution is in any case not very likely. Moreover, it is by nowquite clear that the world economy will suffer from these developments in 1999 and that the euroarea will also be affected to some extent.However, the crucial and widely debated issue is the degree to which such effectson the euro area will materialise and how long they may last.As matters stand, there appears to be consensus that euro area economic growthwill slow down to some extent in 1999, driven largely by a weakening in net exports. In its latestforecast, published on 21 October 1998, the Commission has revised downwards aggregate euroarea real GDP growth to 2.6% in 1999, compared with 3.2% projected earlier this year.According to the same source, the slowdown is expected to be only temporary and real GDPgrowth is anticipated to strengthen again in 2000, with the contribution of net trade improving.At the same time, the outlook for inflation in the near term remains generally favourable,assuming continued wage moderation and subdued developments in import prices.In today’s discussion, the Governing Council agreed to examine further the broadoutlook for the euro area at its two meetings in December. In this context, we will thoroughlydiscuss the downside risks for output growth resulting from the evolution of world trade andfrom international financial tensions and the possibility of still more subdued pricedevelopments. However, one should also mention the fact that a relaxation of fiscal policies andhigher wage increases could lead to a reversal of current developments in consumer prices andundermine confidence. Any uncertainties arising in these two fields would of course
- 2 -BIS Review   93/1998considerably complicate our assessment, given the high degree of uncertainty already associatedwith the developments in the global economy.With respect to today’s review of the monetary, financial and macroeconomicsituation in the euro area, the following aspects were discussed.First, with reference to monetary growth, let me recall that when looking atvarious definitions of broad money, our preliminary data show broadly similar and stable annualgrowth rates of between 3 and 5% in 1997 and the first half of 1998. According to our initialanalysis these monetary trends do not appear to signal inflationary pressures at this juncture.However, a further assessment will be made in December on the basis of more up-to-dateinformation.Second, with respect to price developments, euro area HICP inflation fell from1.2% in August to 1.0% in September 1998. The generally low level of HICP increases mainlyreflects a decline in energy prices, which were almost 4% lower in September than a year earlier,and in other commodity prices; in addition, price pressure as indicated by industrial output pricesand unit labour costs has remained modest. With respect to the decline in HICP inflation inSeptember, this is closely related to a relatively strong fall in food prices (from 1.8% in Augustto 1.4% in September 1998), which account for almost one-quarter of the total HICP. Suchmonthly changes are certainly very difficult to interpret. However, I may point out that foodprices display a larger degree of volatility owing to their seasonal pattern.Third, taking into account distorting factors such as calendar effects, underlyingdevelopments in euro area-wide real GDP have remained fairly stable. Economic expansion wasbroadly unchanged in the first half of 1998 from the solid growth seen in the second half of1997. Also, at this juncture, data partly available for the summer months point to the possibilitythat recent rates of output growth may be broadly sustained beyond the first half of this year.While the trends appear in some cases weaker, particularly when also looking at some nationaldata, the latest euro area-wide survey data on confidence, order books and capacity utilisationgenerally remain well above their long-run averages. However, further developments in thesedata will have to be monitored closely. Concerning the assessment of the monetary policy stancein the euro area, the Governing Council - having carefully reviewed all factors and developments- confirmed the view taken at its previous meeting. It considered further interest rate convergencetowards the lower end of the current range prevailing in the euro area as being appropriate.Measured by key central bank rates, the lowest rates in the euro area currently stand at 3.3%.Market interest rates have also reached very low levels. In terms of three-month interest rates, theeuro area average rate has fallen to 3.75%, following the reduction of interest rates by a numberof euro area central banks. With the announcement today of further interest rate reductions by theBanco de España and the Banco de Portugal, both effective tomorrow, the euro area average willcontinue its downward trend. Nominal and real long-term interest rates for the euro area are athistorically low levels. It confirms the high degree of confidence that the euro has gained in thejudgement of the general public and of global investors. This confidence is a major asset in theconsolidation of a financial environment conducive to growth.As has been proven in many instances in the past, monetary policy cannot solvestructural problems. Indeed, monetary policies in the euro area countries have increasinglyconverged over the past few years and resulted in low levels of interest rates. Several countrieshave followed virtually a “common monetary policy stance” over a longer period, butperformances - for example in labour markets - within the euro area differ considerably from
- 3 -BIS Review   93/1998country to country. The degree of success in this area seems to be closely related to structuralreforms implemented in earlier years.I am confident that we can cope both with current problems and with futurechallenges. This requires a forward-looking, medium-term-oriented monetary policy, whichkeeps inflationary expectations low. This is the decisive contribution of monetary policy to thefostering of growth and employment. Dealing with structural problems is the task of policiesother than monetary policy.Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President to report on various aspects of thepreparatory work for Stage Three.(a)  Preparations for the “changeover weekend”With less than 60 days to go before the start of Stage Three, we are obviously attachingparticular importance to the provision of a framework allowing for a smooth changeover tothe euro. We began our preparations a long time ago and I am confident that the ESCB willbe in a position to deliver its entire complex infrastructure to the markets by the morning of4 January 1999. I expect the banking and financial community in the euro area to be fullyaware both of the logistical challenge that the changeover weekend represents and of theneed for careful preparation. Given the concentration of migration operations to the euro tobe conducted by a multitude of financial agents (i.e. payment systems, securities settlementsystems, custodians, individual banks, exchanges and financial information providers) inthe period from 31 December 1998 to 4 January 1999, the ESCB is preparing to worktogether with other public authorities to orchestrate the necessary policy responses to anyunexpected events. To this end, the Governing Council has set up an ad hoc “ChangeoverWeekend Committee” which will organise the monitoring of developments vis-à-vis thefinal migration to the euro within the ECB and the national central banks and in thebanking and financial industry, both prior to and during the changeover weekend.Additional details on the preparation of the changeover weekend are provided in a separatepress release which is to be issued to you this evening.(b)  Payment systems issuesWith regard to euro payment and settlement systems, I should like to draw your attentionto recent developments which suggest that many market participants consider the euro aspecial currency to which the traditional rules applied elsewhere in the developed worldwould not necessarily be applicable. Initiatives were taken, or allowed to develop, thathave no precedent in the arrangements concerning other currencies. This relates inparticular to the granting of payment finality and intraday credit in a currency other than acountry’s own. Therefore, the Governing Council considered it appropriate to issue apolicy statement clearly spelling out the fact that the rules which apply to all of the othercurrencies in the world will also apply to the euro, and that the ECB bears the sameresponsibilities as all the other central banks in the world.This policy statement on euro payment and settlement systems located outside the euroarea is to be issued to you this evening.The Governing Council also agreed on the main features of the legal framework withinwhich the TARGET system will operate. These main features are set out in greater detail in
- 4 -BIS Review   93/1998the “Third progress report on the TARGET project”, which the Governing Councilendorsed today. In common with previous progress reports, the current one will bepublished in the near future and will provide further technical details of interest to marketparticipants.(c)  Exchange of national banknotesIn the absence of euro banknotes at the start of Stage Three, the Governing Council todayagreed on arrangements according to which the participating national central banks willexchange legal tender banknotes of other participating Member States for nationalbanknotes and coins at the official conversion rate as from 1 January 1999. To ensuresubstitutability between the national currency units, the Governing Council decided thateach participating national central bank will arrange for such an exchange at one location atleast. The national central banks may, however, limit the number and/or the total volume ofbanknotes they are prepared to accept for any given transaction or on any one day.Further details on that matter are provided in a separate press release which is to be issuedto you this evening.(d)  Allocation of monetary incomeAs regards the income arising from the issuance of national banknotes from theparticipating Member States, the Governing Council today decided that such income willnot be redistributed prior to the introduction of the euro banknotes. The Governing Councilalso confirmed, with respect to the allocation of monetary income of the national centralbanks of the participating Member States for the financial years 1999 to 2001, that themonetary income for the said period will be calculated by employing the so-called indirectmethod, by multiplying a defined liability base by a specified reference rate of interest. Thesum of the monetary income of each national central bank will be allocated to theparticipating national central banks in proportion to their paid-up share in the ECB’scapital. Owing to the temporary character of the current decision, the question of monetaryincome allocation will need to be revisited before the introduction of euro banknotes in2002.(e)  Transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECBToday the Governing Council also adopted an ECB Guideline establishing the legal formatas well as the modalities of the initial transfer of foreign reserves from the national centralbanks to the ECB. In this connection and as a measure for covering possible foreignexchange risks for the ECB, the Governing Council endorsed, in line with the Statute ofthe ESCB, an ECB Recommendation for a Council Regulation which would authorise theECB to increase its capital from the current level of 5 billion euros to up to twice thatamount.
- 5 -BIS Review   93/1998(f)         Monetary and foreign exchange policyFurther decisions have also been taken with regard to preparing the monetary and foreignexchange policy of the euro area. On previous occasions I have mentioned to you that legalacts are under preparation which specify general principles to be followed by the nationalcentral banks when carrying out operations in domestic assets and liabilities and in foreignexchange reserve assets remaining with the national central banks. Such instruments,which are based on provisions of the Statute of the ESCB, aim from a legal point of viewat ensuring the singleness of the ECB’s monetary policy and the consistency of suchtransactions with the Community’s exchange rate and monetary policies. Against thisbackground, the Governing Council today adopted an ECB Guideline which establishescertain reporting obligations for the national central banks’ domestic asset and liabilitymanagement operations and subjects such transactions to the prior approval of the ECBwhenever they exceed a certain amount. A similar ECB Guideline was adopted whichsubjects all operations in foreign reserve assets – including gold – which exceed a certainamount to the approval of the ECB. In addition, the Governing Council adopted an ECBGuideline according to which any participating Member State’s transactions whose foreignexchange working balances which exceed a certain amount must be notified to the ECB inadvance. A similar arrangement is envisaged between the ECB and the Commission of theEuropean Communities for all foreign exchange transactions carried out in the context ofimplementing the Commission’s budget.In the context of the statutory function of the ESCB to contribute to the smoothconduct of policies of competent authorities in the field of banking supervision and financialstability, the Governing Council discussed the main driving forces that are likely to affect theEU banking systems in the medium and long term, including the establishment of EMU. TheCouncil members hold the view that the establishment of EMU is expected to reinforce thestructural tendencies that are already under way in the EU banking systems. These tendenciesinclude the reduction of excess capacity, pressure on profitability, enhanced competition,increased internationalisation and geographical diversification. One important aspect is the factthat EU banks seem to have significantly increased their awareness of the strategic implicationsof the introduction of the euro over the past few months. They are devising specific responsesaccordingly, which include: (i) improvements in services and procedures; (ii) changes in therange of products supplied to customers; and (iii) mergers, strategic alliances and cooperationagreements. We intend to make the outcome of this examination public in due course.Finally, the Governing Council adopted an ECB Decision concerning publicaccess to the documentation and archives of the ECB. This Decision will be published in theOfficial Journal of the European Communities.
BIS Review   93/1998Mr. Meister reports on the Year 2000 problem from the perspective ofGerman banking supervisors   Luncheon speech by Mr. Edgar Meister, a member of theDirectorate of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Year 2000 meeting of European central banksand financial regulators organised by the Joint Year 2000 Council and the Deutsche Bundesbankin Frankfurt/Main on 30/10/98.II am pleased to contribute to this conference on the Year 2000 and how themillennium date change poses a very significant risk for financial institutions and markets.The media have now been reporting regularly, and sometimes with flashyheadlines, on the many problems which the Y2K problem or “millennium bug” can pose to theeconomy and public administration. One has visions of planes crashing, assembly lines comingto a standstill, pensioners being asked to register for school, babies receiving old age pensions,contracts becoming null and void, or deliveries being interrupted.We are all well aware that the Year 2000 problem impacts on the whole economyand the public administration. Therefore, joint action must be taken now if we are to avoidpotentially serious problems down the road.Acting in my role as a central banker and as chairman of the Banking SupervisionCommittee of the European Central Bank, my primary concern is on the role financialinstitutions play in this context. That is why I want to take this opportunity to give you a shortoverview on the implications of the problem on the financial sector and a brief summary of themeasures taken by German banking supervisors to promote and intensify the necessary Year2000 preparations.IIIn the banking and insurance sectors, the impact of systems being insufficientlyYear 2000 compliant can be particularly drastic. Some vivid examples are the possibility ofinterest and redemption payments on loans being calculated inaccurately, statements of accountsand insurance periods being updated incorrectly, cheques and credit cards being rejected byATMs (automated teller machines), and futures contracts being cancelled.However, the more pressing risks are to be found in the danger that paymentsystems might collapse, liquidity bottlenecks might occur, and the number of credit defaultsmight increase, owing to Year 2000 problems on the part of banks’ customers. For this reason,banking supervisors have alerted the banking industry to the possibility of significant changes incustomers’ behaviour occurring at the end of 1999 as far as their demand for cash goes. A lack ofpublic confidence in the ability of the financial sector to solve the Year 2000 problem couldtrigger increased withdrawals of deposits and demand for cash.The particularly close technical and financial interdependency within the bankingsector, as well as with all sectors of the economy (owing to the banks’ corporate customers),makes it necessary to take particularly comprehensive action. Not only must the banks’ ownsystems be reassessed but also the Year 2000 preparations being made by their business partners.There is a further factor that compounds the situation: Germany and the othermember states of the forthcoming European Monetary Union must deal with the dual challengeof preparing their computer programs for the changeover to the single European currency and at
- 2 -BIS Review   93/1998the same time take the necessary preparations for the century date change. Numerous parallelsshow up here, and what we nowadays call “synergy effects” are the result. They will surely belimited, yet they do clearly exist, such as in cashless payments.For one thing, there is a heightened awareness of how to handle such cross-country and cross-system conversion processes, for which there is hardly any historicalprecedent. For another, completely new procedures such as the cross-border TARGET systemhave been developed. In these systems, it was possible to take timely account of the changeoverto the Year 2000, which will take place in 427 days. The absolute necessity of preparing thesesystems anew for the euro has allowed the Bundesbank and the credit institutions tosimultaneously make virtually countless EDP systems in the accounting sections and “backoffices” Year 2000 compliant.The practical experience which must almost inevitably be gained during theweekend of the changeover to the euro from 1998 to 1999 will also provide welcome knowledgethat can be used for the century date change. It will probably once again become clear to all thoseinvolved that the interplay of different systems can be different in real life than in a test scenario,however realistic it may be. The Year 2000 changeover has a different type of complexity thanthe introduction of the euro, since there is an interaction between different EDP applications,system components and external software components, as well as processor-driven systems.Substituting the euro for the DM will involve the organisation of workflows and operatingprocedures; in computer-related terms, that means new software must be installed. However, inthe changeover from December 31, 1999 to January 1, 2000, the hardware components of theEDP systems, i.e. the nearly innumerable number of chips, must be transformed.The Bundesbank and the credit institutions, which were already required to play apioneering role when the euro was introduced, are again forced to play a key role in getting thefinancial sector ready for the millennium date change. Responsibility for the overall coordinationof the exchange of information and ideas on this problem among the various sectors of industry,though, is in the hands the Federal Government. (To this end, the Federal Ministry of Economicshas set up, among other things, a Year 2000 expert group in its ministry, in which representativesof the most important sectors of industry and administration affected by the problem are activelyparticipating.)IIIWhat measures are German banking supervisors taking to help the financial sectorachieve a successful crossover to the new millennium?German banking supervisors do not and cannot even dare to guarantee that bankswill be fully compliant; rather the emphasis is on ensuring that• banks’ senior management have focused on the scale of the problems facingtheir institution,• they are taking responsibility for solving them,• the banks systematically plan the relevant projects and implement them in atimely manner, and• they have contingency plans in place to rectify any slippage or systemfailure.Since the beginning of their Year 2000 activities in 1994-95, and particularly since1997, the Bundesbank and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office have been leaning on the
- 3 -BIS Review   93/1998banking industry to press ahead with its Year 2000 preparations with great intensity. Thereforethe state of the banking industry’s preparations for the Year 2000 is also a major focal point ofongoing banking supervision.On-site validation procedures through independent auditors during audits of thebanks’ annual accounts for as early as the year 1997 constitute one important point. Another veryimportant action is a Year 2000 survey conducted in June 1998. The Federal BankingSupervisory Office and the Bundesbank asked all the approximately 3,600 credit institutionsunder supervision and 200 stockbrokers in Germany about their Year 2000 preparations. Theanalysis of the preparations is supplemented by personal discussions of banking supervisors withindividual credit institutions, particularly those having branches and subsidiaries abroad.Immediate actions are taken where the existence of the institution is in jeopardy owing toinsufficient preparations for the Year 2000.With regard to the timetable, German banking supervisors have not set any officialtarget dates, yet they have made it perfectly clear in discussions and surveys that the externaltesting of these systems should be completed by mid-1999. This target date will also be used forthe final prudential assessment of the state of preparations of individual credit institutions.Although legal problems, particularly liability issues, are being given increasedattention in connection with the Year 2000 problem, no legislative changes are currently beingenvisaged, because the legal system is flexible enough to cope with these problems.Ladies and gentlemen, the turning of the clock at midnight on December 31, 1999cannot be postponed - as you all know. Time is a scarce asset with regard to the necessarypreparations. As all credit institutions are depending on each other to be sufficiently prepared, theissue is hardly a factor of competition. On the contrary, an exchange of experience andinformation is crucial in order to enhance the efficiency of the changeover work. Therefore, theFederal Banking Supervisory Office and the Deutsche Bundesbank have been playing a proactiverole in coordinating the efforts across the financial institutions: at their instigation, the CentralCredit Committee (ZKA) established a forum comprising several banking associations forexchanging experience on the Year 2000 problem at the expert level. The Federal BankingSupervisory Office and the Deutsche Bundesbank are involved in the forum’s work.Supporting the banking industry in its efforts to solve the Y2K problem is anongoing process that will continue until the crossover takes place. Nevertheless, I must reiteratethat the ultimate responsibility lies with the management of the individual institutionsthemselves. This is why handling the Year 2000 problem responsibly is a criterion for theFederal Banking Supervisory Office when assessing whether or not banking business is beingconducted properly.IVI could go on and on about the supervisory aspects of the Y2K problem. However,a luncheon speech does not seem to be the appropriate setting to go into too much detail.Furthermore, when I look at the impressive programme of this conference, itseems to me that all the important elements of this topic will be covered by this morning’s andafternoon’s panels.
- 4 -BIS Review   93/1998However, looking at a lunch as a social event, one aspect of the Y2K problemcomes to my mind that is not covered by today’s programme and that might be worth bringing toyour attention - if nothing else, at least as a potential problem in the course of the century datechange that deserves thought. Let me call it the social aspect of the Y2K problem.New Year’s Eve 1999/2000 will be a social event of major proportions, accordingto some people even an event of biblical significance. Millions of people will drive either to oneof many organised New Year’s parties or to pay a visit to relatives or friends in order to celebratethe new millennium. Are you aware of the fact that there are about 30 different data-dependentembedded chips in a modern-day automobile?Getting to the parties before midnight should not be a big problem. However,imagine what will happen to the mood of the parties if cars stop working after the millenniumdate changes, which would mean the parties would have to continue, but the second and thirdglasses of champagne would only be lukewarm at best because all the refrigerators are out oforder?VHowever, looking at some  humorous side effects of the problem does not make itany less serious for society in general. Looking at the international banking system as a whole, Ibelieve that we have already made considerable headway in limiting the possibility that Y2Kdisruptions will have systemic consequences for our markets. However, we must all continue towork hard in the time remaining to ensure that the existing threat can be averted to the greatestpossible extent.In that spirit, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude my remarks andcommend the Joint Year 2000 Council for organising such regional conferences. They takeaccount of the fact that in a globalised economy, a worldwide effort is necessary to successfullyface the challenges of the Year 2000 computer problem.
BIS Review   91/1998Mr. Kelley gives an economic assessment of the countdown to Y2K   Remarksby Mr. Edward W. Kelley, Jr., a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at the Annual Economic Symposium at Houston Baptist University on 29/10/98.I am pleased to be back with you today to participate in this annual economicsymposium hosted by the Houston Baptist University and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.These are challenging times for economic policymakers, and there are many issues currentlyfacing our nation’s central bank. One of them is the Year 2000 computer problem, and that is oursubject for today. Much has been written on this topic, and I am sure that everyone here isfamiliar with the basic issue - specifically, that information generated by computers may beinaccurate, or that computers and other electronic systems may malfunction because they cannotcorrectly process Year 2000 dates. I will dwell no further on the nature of the problem itself, butrather attempt to focus on the likely economic impact of this problem. The economic stakes arevery large, and the spectrum of possible outcomes very broad, ranging from minimal toextremely serious. For the truth of the matter is that this episode is unique: We really have had noprevious experience with a challenge of this sort to give us reliable guideposts.Although the lack of a precedent may be unnerving, that certainly does not free usfrom the obligation to attempt to analyze how the millennium bug is affecting and will affect theeconomy. This economic puzzle has many complex pieces - some of them quite inscrutablebefore the event - and my task this morning is to assemble for you the tidbits of information thatwe do have into a coherent picture of where the Y2K problem appears likely to take us. Let meturn first to the reasons why the Year 2000 problem is so difficult to manage. Then I shall discussthe actions that are being taken by government and businesses to deal with the millennium bugand the effects these measures are having on economic activity at the present time. Finally, I shallturn - not without some trepidation, I might add - to the spectrum of plausible outcomes for theYear 2000, as I see it. As you shall shortly hear, I believe the Y2K pessimists have not fullyrecognized the attention that is being given to this problem and the significant progress that hasalready been made. Given what we know today, I am cautiously optimistic that the millenniumbug will not cause major economic disruptions when it bites.The Difficulty of Managing the Y2K ProblemWhy has it been so difficult for people to come to terms with the Year 2000problem? At the most basic level of any organization - be it public or private, large or small - theY2K problem was all too easy to ignore. It is a hidden threat, cloaked in the arcane language ofcomputer programs and in embedded microchips. As such, it was difficult at first for seniormanagement in the corporate world and the public sector to recognize the serious nature of theproblem. This was compounded by the fact that the costs and benefits of the situation for anindividual operation are not easily quantified nor are they attractive. But after an initial period ofdenial, the majority of US business leaders now have recognized the problem and are takingaction to correct it. Nonetheless, given the pervasiveness of the problems involved, I suspect thateven the most thoroughly prepared organizations are worried that something important might bemissed. Indeed, many organizations are developing elaborate workarounds and other contingencyplans as insurance against Y2K disruptions. Thus, uncertainty about the ultimate effectiveness ofY2K remediation programs already is affecting corporate investment and production plans andobviously will be with us until at least January 2000.The second feature of the millennium bug that makes it so difficult to analyze isthe interrelated character of many computer systems. An individual company may be satisfied
- 2 -BIS Review  91/1998that it has done all it can to fix its own systems, but it still may feel very vulnerable to the actionstaken by its suppliers and customers. In an environment where just-in-time inventory systemsand electronic data interchanges (EDI) have linked economic activities very closely together, onefirm’s failure has the potential to ripple through significant segments of the chain of production,services, and distribution. Thus, greater coordination of Y2K remediation activities would havebenefits for everyone.But it is clearly impossible to coordinate the Y2K activities of millions ofindividual establishments. To help fill this void, numerous organizations have emerged asclearinghouses of information, and I have high hopes for efforts such as “National Y2K ActionWeek”, which was just sponsored by the Small Business Administration (for the President’sCouncil on the Year 2000), together with a number of private groups. Other institutions arefunctioning as vehicles for system testing. Witness this past summer’s inception of FederalReserve payment system testing with its depository institution customers, and similar work bythe Securities Industry Association. Bank supervisors, including the Federal Reserve, are holdingtheir banks accountable for the effectiveness of their Y2K efforts, and I can assure you that therewill be consequences for banks that do not fulfill their obligations. But many organizations areon their own to test their critical systems with their key suppliers and customers.Because this situation is both complex and fragmented, it is a very difficult task toquantify the aggregate costs of Y2K remediation. Similarly and perhaps more importantly, wealso have no national scorecard on how effective our economy is being in our remediationefforts. Under these circumstances, it is not hard to understand why the millennium bug isviewed as such an unpredictable phenomenon, and why it has attracted so much gloom and doomcommentary.What is Being Done?So, what is being done? The short answer is a lot is being done. Let me reviewwith you our understanding of the status of efforts by the private sector, government entities, andthe world community to deal with the Year 2000 problem. As far as the private sector isconcerned, efforts to deal with the millennium bug have been intensifying. In my testimonybefore Congress in April, I suggested that the private sector might spend approximately $50billion over the next two years to tackle the Y2K problem. This figure was based on a reading ofthe available corporate filings with the SEC as well as our own guestimates for firms that eitherare private, did not discuss Y2K expenditures in their 10-K reports, or stated that their Y2Kprograms were not having a “material” influence on their bottom line. We have updated ourresearch using the latest quarterly reports, and we were pleased to find a larger percentage offirms discussing the costs of their Year 2000 strategies, and I am confident these funds are beingused effectively. While our estimate of the “$50 billion bug” seems still to be reasonable, I fullyexpect to see this figure move upward over time.I also perceive that the tools available to companies to address Y2K issues haveincreased substantially. Over the past six months, most major computer hardware and softwarecompanies have released documentation of the Y2K readiness of their products on their websites. Similarly, most of the major computer publications now have elaborate “how to” guides ontheir web pages that will aid consumers and small businesses in their efforts to make theirsystems Year 2000 compliant. Commercial software producers also have been busy, and newsoftware products are becoming available to aid programmers in repairing code. I hope andbelieve people are availing themselves of these new resources. To paraphrase an old adage, “wehave brought the Y2K horse to water, and he appears to be drinking!”
- 3 -BIS Review   91/1998As far as financial institutions are concerned, I am encouraged by the progress thathas been made over the past year, and there is every reason to be confident that our financialsystem will be ready. Based on a review of all depository institutions completed by federalbanking regulatory agencies, the vast majority are making satisfactory progress in their Year2000 planning and readiness efforts. About four percent were rated “needs improvement” andfewer than one percent were rated “unsatisfactory”. In these cases, the agencies have initiatedintensive supervisory follow up, including restrictions on expansionary activities by Year 2000deficient organizations. While we can be confident institutions are addressing the problem, it isimportant to recognize that regulators cannot be responsible for ensuring or guaranteeing theYear 2000 readiness and viability of the banking organizations that we supervise. Rather, theboards of directors and senior management of banks and other financial institutions must beresponsible for ensuring the institutions they manage are able to provide high quality andcontinuous service in January 2000.The Federal Reserve System has itself made significant progress on Y2K issues,meeting all of the goals that we have set for ourselves. In addition to completing an initial reviewof the Y2K readiness of all banks subject to our supervisory authority, we have renovated ourown mission-critical applications, nearly completed work on all others, and are close tocompletion of our internal testing. As mentioned, we have opened our mission-critical systems tocustomers for testing with us and have progressed significantly in our contingency planningefforts. This has required much hard work on the part of many people, but it is paying off invisible ways.As in the private sector, activity to fix computer systems maintained by the federalgovernment is intensifying. Progress has been made in many areas, but the President’s Councilon the Year 2000 agrees that much work still needs to be done. Reviews of federal Y2Kprograms have highlighted needed areas of improvement, and the Congress has budgeted about$5½ billion for Y2K fixes. Legislation also has been enacted that would facilitate the sharing ofY2K information among businesses and clarify the legal liability of reporting Y2K readinessinformation. All of these are positive developments.With the notable exception of the recent dress rehearsal in Lubbock, I must admitthat far less is known about the effectiveness of the Y2K preparations by state and localgovernments. Attention often is focused on high-profile systems such as the nation’s air trafficcontrol computers or the electric power grid, but there are many smaller, yet quite critical,electronic systems maintained by states and municipalities that also are very vulnerable. Forexample, innumerable vitally important computer-controlled utility systems are operated by localgovernment units. And, as any Washington commuter will tell you, one or two malfunctioningtraffic signals can cause serious congestion, confusion, and delay, and the complete breakdownof traffic management systems likely would cause near total gridlock. To try to get a handle onY2K remediation activity at the state level, we surveyed the web pages of all fifty states and theDistrict of Columbia and Puerto Rico. As best we can tell, the states that reported Y2K programsare budgeting $1 to $2 billion for this purpose. However, five states had no reference to Y2Kpreparedness and 23 states did not cite the cost estimates for their programs. Thus, based on thisand other anecdotal evidence I have seen, I suspect that much work still needs to be done in thisarea as well.On the international level, there is both good news and bad. The governments ofvarious industrialized nations have stepped up their own internal Y2K awareness and
- 4 -BIS Review  91/1998remediation programs over the past six months, and international cooperation is intensifyingthrough efforts such as the Joint Year 2000 Council, chaired by my colleague Federal ReserveGovernor Roger Ferguson. Most large multinational corporations report they are well along intheir preparations worldwide. However, the conversion to the euro and world financial troublesobviously are deflecting all too much attention away from Year 2000 issues, and I worry thattime will simply run out for some countries - particularly in the developing world. As a result,risks exit for some level of disruption to international trade and capital flows.How are Year 2000 Preparations Affecting the Economy?Corporate efforts to deal with the Y2K problem are affecting economic activity ina variety of ways. On the positive side, an important element in some Y2K programs is theaccelerated replacement of aging computer systems with modern, state-of-the-art hardware andsoftware. Such capital expenditures should raise the level of productivity in those enterprises,and, in general, the need to address the Y2K problem has increased the awareness on the part ofsenior executives of the complexity and importance of managing corporate informationtechnology resources. The increased replacement demand also has contributed to the spectacularrecent growth in this country’s computer hardware and software industries. But, ultimately, weare largely shifting the timing of these investment expenditures: Today’s added growth is likely“borrowed” from spending at some time in the future. And, while accelerating some systemsinvestments, many institutions will “freeze” their systems in the middle of 1999 - effectivelyforgoing the installation of major new hardware and software systems as we approach themillennium. This certainly will also influence spending on technology - shifting some of it out of1999 and into 2000.While a shift in the timing of investment spending may help to solve the Year2000 problem for some firms, it certainly will not be sufficient. Most organizations do not havethe option of simply scrapping their existing computer systems and replacing them with shinynew “turn-key” hardware and software. To one degree or another, we all rely on elaborateproprietary software systems that have been developed over many years, and these programsmust be debugged by a skilled programmer. This obviously is a very labor-intensive andtime-consuming process, and organizations have had to boost their IT staffs to carry out thiswork. The good news is that many got an early start on this problem and are now well along ontheir repair and testing programs. The bad news is that there is no corresponding increase in thefirm’s marketable output, and this lowers the overall level of productivity in the enterprise,boosts its costs, and reduces its profitability.One area in which uncertainty about Y2K readiness is likely to have noticeableeffects on economic activity in 1999 is in the management of inventories. As the millenniumapproaches, I expect businesses will want to hold larger inventories of goods as insurance againstY2K-related supply disruptions. Such a shift from “just-in-time” inventory management to a“just-in-case” posture is likely to prompt an increase in orders and production during 1999.These stocks subsequently would be run off in the first half of 2000. We at the Fed, for example,will do precisely that in our management of the production of new currency.While Year 2000 preparation efforts may give a temporary boost to economicactivity in some sectors, the net effect on the aggregate economy probably is negative. Other thanthe obviously very valuable ability to maintain its operations across the millennium, fewquantifiable benefits accrue to the firm - and overall productivity gains are reduced by the extrahours devoted to reprogramming and testing. Conservative estimates suggest that the net effect of
- 5 -BIS Review   91/1998Y2K remediation efforts might shave a tenth or two a year off the growth of our nation’s overalllabor productivity, and a more substantial effect is possible if some of the larger estimates ofY2K costs turn out to be accurate. The effects on real gross domestic product are likely to besomewhat smaller than this but could still total a tenth of a percentage point or so a year over thenext two years.What is the Spectrum of Plausible Outcomes for Economic Activity in 2000?As we have discussed, a great deal of work either is planned or is under way todeal with the Year 2000 problem. But what if something slips through the cracks, and weexperience the failure of “mission critical” systems? How will a computer failure in one area ofthe economy affect the ability of others to continue to operate smoothly? How severe could bethe consequences of Y2K problems emanating from abroad? The number of possible scenarios ofthis type is endless, and today no one can say with confidence how severe any Y2K disruptionscould be or how a failure in one sector would influence activity in others. That said, let me nowturn to a discussion of the spectrum of plausible outcomes for economic activity in the Year2000.What will happen as the millennium rolls over? A few economists already aresuggesting that Y2K-related disruptions will induce a deep recession in 2000. That probably is astretch, but I do not think we will escape unaffected. I anticipate that there will be isolatedproduction problems and disruptions to commerce, and perhaps some public services, that willreduce the rate of GDP growth early in 2000. Certainly a mild inventory cycle seems very likelyto develop. But, just like the shocks to our nation’s physical infrastructure that occurperiodically, I would expect the Y2K shock to our information and electronic controlinfrastructure is most likely to be short-lived and fully reversed.We have many examples of how economic activity has been affected bydisruptions to the physical infrastructure of this country. Although the Y2K problem clearly isunique, some of these disruptions to our physical infrastructure may be useful in organizing ourthinking about the consequences of short-lived interruptions in our information infrastructure. Inearly 1996, a major winter storm paralyzed large portions of the country. Commerce ground to ahalt for up to a week in some areas but activity bounced back rapidly once the roads were clearedagain. Although individual firms and households were adversely affected by these disruptions, inthe aggregate, the economy quickly recovered most of the output lost due to the storm. In thisinstance, the shock to our physical infrastructure was transitory in nature, and, critically, therecovery process was under way before any adverse “feedback” effects were produced. Lastyear’s strike by workers at the United Parcel Service is a second example. UPS is a major playerin the package delivery industry in this country, and the strike disrupted the shipping patterns ofmany businesses. Some sales were lost, but in most instances alternative shipping services werefound for high-priority packages. Some businesses were hurt by the strike, but its effect oneconomic activity was small in the aggregate.Obviously an important element in any forecast for the Year 2000 is the degree towhich the failure of the computer system at one institution causes ripple effects on the systems ofothers. If the disruptions that occur are not isolated events, as I have assumed, but spread acrosskey sectors of the economy by interacting with each other, then an outright decline in real GDPin the first quarter of 2000 could be a plausible outcome.
- 6 -BIS Review  91/1998The more dire of the Y2K scenarios would involve, among other things, aperpetuation and intensification of these feedback effects. In such an event, productiondisruptions could turn out to be a national or international phenomenon and could spread fromone industry to another. Under these circumstances, the decline in economic activity would proveto be longer lasting, and a recession - typically defined as a decline in real gross domestic productin two consecutive quarters - could ensue. But let me quickly stress that I do not think thisrecession scenario has a very high probability. It is possible, but a lot of things have to go wrongfor it to occur, and much is being done to prevent its occurrence.What can Monetary Policy Do About the Millenium Bug?What can monetary policy do to offset any Y2K disruptions? The truthful answeris “not much”. Just as we were not able to plow the streets in 1996 or deliver packages in 1997,the central bank will be unable to reprogram the nation’s computers for the year 2000. The Y2Kproblem is primarily an issue affecting the aggregate “supply” side of the economy, whereas theFederal Reserve’s monetary policy works mainly on aggregate “demand”. We all understand howcreating more money and lowering the level of short-term interest rates gives a boost to interest-sensitive sectors (such as homebuilding), but these tools are unlikely to be very effective ingenerating more Y2K remediation efforts or accelerating the recovery process if someoneexperiences some type of Year 2000 disruption. We will, of course, be ready if people want tohold more cash on New Year’s Eve 1999, and we will be prepared to lend whatever sums may beneeded to financial institutions through the discount window under appropriate circumstances orto provide needed reserves to the banking system. And, if a serious Y2K disruption should havesignificant feedback effects on aggregate demand - as I outlined in the recession scenario - thereobviously would be a role for the Federal Reserve to play in countering the downturn. But thereis nothing monetary policy can do to offset the direct effects of a Y2K disruption.ConclusionIn summary, as I stated at the outset of my remarks, I am cautiously optimistic thatthe United States will weather the Year 2000 storm without major disruptions to economicactivity. Some of the more frightening scenarios are not without a certain plausibility, if thischallenge were being ignored. But it is not being ignored - as this symposium today clearlyillustrates. An enormous amount of work is being done in anticipation of the rollover of themillennium. As the world’s largest economy, the heaviest burden of preparation falls on theUnited States. But it is truly a worldwide issue, and to the extent some are not adequatelyprepared and experience breakdowns of unforeseeable dimension, we shall all be affectedaccordingly. We at the Federal Reserve intend to do our utmost, and we hope and trust otherswill do likewise.
BIS Review   90/1998Mr. Ferguson speaks on the future of the financial services sector   Remarksby Mr. Roger W. Ferguson, Jr., a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal ReserveSystem, at the College of Management of the University of Massachusetts in Boston,Massachusetts on 27/10/98.Some Observations on the Future of the Financial Services Sector and RelatedPublic Policy IssuesLet me first thank you for your invitation to speak today at this very topicalconference. The future of the financial services sector holds great interest for industryparticipants as well as bank regulators, given the remarkable changes affecting the industry.Developments in this sector will affect all of us.We are all acutely aware of the trend toward the blurring of lines that haveseparated the various parts of the financial sector, particularly commercial banking, investmentbanking, and insurance. Most recently, we are faced with the prospect of the formation of hugefinancial conglomerates, composed of amalgams of firms that have previously operated withinthe roughly defined boundaries of their respective industries. In addition, we have witnessed asubstantial degree of consolidation through mergers in the commercial banking and otherindustries.I will begin my remarks today by discussing historical experience withconglomeration in the US, and the underlying conditions necessary for conglomeration to be asuccessful business strategy. I will then offer some thoughts regarding what the financial servicessector may look like in the future. Finally, I will address some of the issues that the FederalReserve as a supervisor and regulator will need to consider.There are several conclusions that I would like to highlight. The first is that themovement to financial conglomerate may prove to be transitory. Second, basic financial and riskmanagement skills will likely remain the most important determinant of a company’s viabilityand success. Third, even in a world of financial conglomerates there will be room for smaller,and more nimble, participants. Finally, the supervisory and regulatory structure will need toevolve to meet these new challenges, but regulatory authorities should remain vigilant to carryout our duties, particularly in enforcing the antitrust laws.II. Will Financial Service Conglomerates be Successful?The Historical Context of ConglomerationThe concept of the financial conglomerate is receiving a great deal of attention atthis time because of the diminishing distinctions across financial industries. However, thesuccess of such conglomerates is certainly not guaranteed, based on historical experience. For anillustration, one need only look back to the conglomerate merger movement in the industrialsector during the 1960s. Large conglomerate firms such as LTV, Gulf and Western, Textron, andLitton Industries became conglomerates through numerous mergers, heralded with great fanfarefrom the business press. By the 1970s, such proclamations sounded hollow, as manyconglomerate firms’ equities were pummeled as their corporate structure proved unsuccessful.This period was followed by a decade of spin-offs as the conglomerates sought to streamlinetheir operations and return to their original areas of expertise - and this reversal of strategy wasgreeted with considerable enthusiasm by the business press.
- 2 -BIS Review   90/1998Much closer to home, we should also recall that the retail financial sector wentthrough a phase of conglomeration about 15 years ago, in the movement toward the “financialsupermarket”. The acquisitions of Coldwell Banker and Dean Witter by Sears, Shearson byAmerican Express, Schwab by Bank of America, and Bache by Prudential come to mind. Despitethe enthusiasm for the financial supermarket in the early 1980s, by the end of the decade theconcept had stagnated, and the press instead reported the benefits of specialization and theprovision of niche services.I believe this past experience with business conglomerates in the US shouldtemper our views of the inevitability of today’s financial conglomerates. There are clearlychallenges to managing much larger, more diversified firms, as well as benefits. This businessstrategy is surely not for all financial services firms.Business Conditions Necessary for Financial Conglomerates to SucceedThe difficulties associated with operating a financial conglomerate are suggestedby the business conditions that are necessary for such a conglomerate to succeed. We have heard,of course, of the potential economies of scale and scope in managing information that may allowlarge firms to reduce the unit costs of doing business. We are also aware of the potential for crossmarketing, where economies of scope on the supply side allow firms to sell multiple products totheir customers, and on the demand side allow consumers to conveniently purchase bundles ofservices. Since a number of conglomerates of the past have been unable to improve uponseparate delivery of services - including financial services - it is unclear whether technological orother changes have altered the nature of financial products or managerial capabilities sufficientlyto result in significantly improved exploitation of scope economies.The potential benefits of reducing risk through sectoral and geographicdiversification are another motivation for conglomeration. I have little doubt that in many casesthe potential for diversification gains exists. However, we have heard very little about theexpertise needed to merge the risk management practices of previously separate financial firms.While merging risk management practices may be straightforward for firms consolidating withinan industry, such a readjustment is likely far more complex for firms originating in differentindustries.Furthermore, the challenges of managing a merger of diverse firms and theoperation of the resulting conglomerate are substantial. The operation of a financialconglomerate requires the ability to integrate the financial activities, research and developmentinvestments, pricing decisions, compensation practices, cost containment activities, and culturesof an extremely large and diverse organization. Before any steps toward conglomeration aretaken, each potential participant in such a merger must judge whether this extraordinary set ofskills is to be found in any managerial team.However, having raised the cautionary flags about the prospects for financialconglomerates, I should add that various considerations suggest that the financial conglomerateformat in the future may be successful for at least some firms. From the managementperspective, technological developments should help provide more detailed information formonitoring the various activities of the firm and allow the application of more sophisticated riskmanagement models. Past experience with conglomeration may also provide new insights formanaging product integration more effectively. On the demand side, retail customers may
BIS Review   90/1998become more receptive to one-stop shopping as the range of services increases and as newopportunities for accessing these services become available.III. How Might the Financial Services Sector Evolve?The extraordinary changes occurring in the financial sector make projectionsabout how the sector will evolve quite speculative. Nevertheless, it is useful to consider how thefuture might look as both industry participants and regulators plan to meet that future. I wouldlike to offer some prognostications based both on systematic projections using historicalexperience and on analogies and informal observations of current trends.Systematic Projections on ConsolidationThe commercial banking industry, which is the largest single component of thefinancial sector, has experienced massive consolidation since 1980. For example, the number ofbanking organizations in the US fell from around 12,300 in 1980 to just under 7,200 by the endof 1997. Not surprisingly, the percentage of banking assets held by the top 10 bankingorganizations rose from about 20 percent in 1980 to nearly 35 percent in 1997, while the shareheld by the top 25 increased from about 33 to 53 percent. Despite the large amount ofconsolidation and increase in banking concentration at the national level, banking concentrationwithin local market areas (MSAs and non-MSA counties) has, on average, hardly changed overthe past decade. For example, the average Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) in MSAsdecreased from 1990 to 1949 between 1985 and 1997, while in non-MSA counties it decreasedfrom 4357 to 4114 (thrifts excluded). The stability of average local market concentration isnoteworthy because research suggests that competition for retail customers takes placesubstantially at the local market level, and concentration is a determinant of competition.Based on these trends and the fact that tremendous new opportunities for bankmergers have been created by the removal of restrictions on interstate banking under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, I would expect moreconsolidation to occur in banking. Based on historical experience, some Fed economists haveprojected that in a decade or so about 3,000-to-4,000 banking organizations will remain.Importantly, most of these firms would be smaller organizations.In addition to commercial banking, other financial service sectors have alsoexperienced movements toward consolidation. Insurance companies and securities firms have allexperienced merger waves in recent years, though not to the extent of commercial banking. Thismore moderate pace of consolidation in nonbank financial industries is likely due to the absenceof preexisting restrictions on geographic expansion. Like banking, insurance underwriting ischaracterized by a broad size distribution of firms, from several large national insurers to muchsmaller local or technically specialized firms. Investment banking is more heavily concentrated,due to the greater geographic expanse of the markets for their services, and due to theconsiderable benefits of portfolio diversification. Extending current patterns into the future, wecan only expect a continuation of the trend towards consolidation.
- 4 -BIS Review   90/1998Informal Projections on ConglomerationAs I noted earlier, in addition to a continuing consolidation in banking andelsewhere in the financial sector, there is also a tendency toward increased conglomeration.Given the prospects for legislation expanding the product lines available to banks, I would not besurprised at a wave of cross-industry mergers within the financial sector, particularly among thelargest firms, that results in the formation of financial conglomerates.In order to consider the form of the financial sector in the future, I believe it isvery important to distinguish between retail financial services (i.e., those for households andsmall businesses) and wholesale or large-scale corporate financial services. The customer basesof these two sectors differ dramatically, as do many of the products used.Despite their differences, both the retail and wholesale sectors have moved toexpand their product offerings. In retail financial services, the desire by banks to expand theirproduct offerings is both a response to new products developed by other industries (for example,the emergence of annuities in the insurance industry), as well as a response to customers’substitution of other products (such as mutual funds) for traditional bank products (such astraditional savings accounts).At wholesale firms, we have witnessed the push into securities underwriting andthe establishment of offices throughout the world in an effort to respond to the financial needs oflarge corporate customers. Because of the very large scale required to serve a wholesale marketconsisting of a relatively small number of sizable customers, relatively few very large firms willlikely remain active in the wholesale portion of the financial sector. Of course, the largewholesale institutions may operate in the retail portion as well, although the latter activity doesnot necessitate the extraordinary size of these firms. In addition, there are clearly boutique firmsthat achieve enviable results by serving just one need, say M&A advice, for large businesses.The existence of both retail and wholesale institutions will have a direct bearingon the future of financial services. In contrast to wholesale institutions, retail financialinstitutions are able to operate profitably on a small scale. Given the continuing strong preferenceof many retail customers to deal with local offices, especially for many services of depositoryinstitutions, small retail financial institutions will likely be able to serve the needs of individualsand small businesses in local markets.Such niche players would play an important role in a retail financial sectorcomposed of perhaps several thousand relatively small retail financial institutions, and a muchsmaller number of large financial firms that offer wholesale products, or both wholesale andretail products. The large firms that offer retail services would likely operate offices throughoutthe country. This scenario would not be unlike that which we observe quite frequently in thenonfinancial retail sector. Restaurants, department stores, convenience stores and supermarketsare examples of locally based markets with a strong presence of large national or regional firmsoperating alongside a large number of small local sellers.IV. What Do Conglomeration and Consolidation Mean for the Federal Reserve?Now I would like to consider some of the issues that are raised by the evolution ofthe financial services sector for the Federal Reserve. Clearly the Federal Reserve must adaptalong with the industry it supervises and regulates.
BIS Review   90/1998Reducing Moral Hazard through Increased Market DisciplineA key concern, which is a challenge internationally as well as in domesticsupervision, is the well-known “moral-hazard” problem. Moral hazard occurs when a firm takeson greater risk than is prudent, because it does not bear the full cost of adopting that riskposition. Instead, the cost of this risk is borne by the financial safety net, which in the USbanking system consists of access to federal deposit insurance, the Fed’s discount window, andFederal Reserve payments system guarantees. While this safety net in my judgment will surelyremain firmly in place, incentive-compatible policies should be developed and applied that shiftmore of the cost of risk-bearing onto the firms themselves. Such policies would seek to increaseand improve the role of “market discipline” in constraining bank risk taking.One widely discussed idea for increasing market discipline is to require a bank toissue a minimum amount of subordinated debt to non-related parties. The basic idea is to create aset of uninsured bank liability holders who will have risk preferences similar to those of banksupervisors, and who would thus discipline bank risk taking to a similar degree. In addition,changes in the price of a bank’s subordinated debt might prove to be a useful signal of themarket’s evaluation of a bank’s financial condition. Such signals could perhaps be used bysupervisors as an aid in identifying problem banks. While a policy of “mandatory subordinateddebt” is not without its problems and implementation difficulties, it is certainly worthy of seriousdiscussion.A second way that market discipline could be encouraged is through financialreporting and transparency guidelines, which provide the market with the information necessaryto make informed transactions. This improved information is essential for market discipline tofunction. Greater transparency by itself will not alleviate the moral hazard problem inherent toinsured deposits, since fully informed investors may be willing to make deposits in a bank withan overly risky portfolio, as long as their deposits are insured. However, transparency can reducethe need for some types of direct regulation in uninsured financial activities. If the holdings offinancial institutions are apparent to the market, the institutions will adjust their risk positionsoptimally to maintain the ability to attract capital. Improved disclosure by domestic as well asinternational institutions would increase the information that allows investors to assess the riskthey bear.Communicating with Other RegulatorsIf the financial services sector moves further in the direction of conglomeration,the Federal Reserve will experience an ever greater need for communication with regulators ofdifferent financial industries. Regulators of the banking industry will need to coordinate withagencies governing the securities and insurance industries. Communication with insuranceregulators will present a particular challenge, since in the US insurance is regulated exclusivelyat the state level. Furthermore, international communication among central banks and otherfinancial regulators is already essential. This need can only become greater as markets for manyfinancial services continue to extend across national borders. Indeed, the need for crisisintervention could be reduced through preventive measures that include ongoing communicationand coordinated improvements in supervisory methods.Ensuring Competition
- 6 -BIS Review   90/1998Also important is the role of encouraging competition through implementation ofthe Federal Reserve’s bank merger policy. This role is particularly important at a time whenbanking and the financial sector in general are experiencing an unprecedented merger movementthat is radically restructuring these industries. Before discussing newer analyses that we might becalled upon to perform, let me emphasize that I think that we must continue to be extremelyvigilant to protect local market competition. Applicants should remember that we measureimpacts on local market structure considering both HHI and concentration ratios. Transactionssatisfying one of those measures may not satisfy the other measure. Small increases in marketshare as measured by HHI may mask the high market share of the dominant competitor. In thosecases, I would expect that mitigating factors, even for small increases in market share, must beextremely strong to gain approval.The task of enforcing bank merger policy will become potentially morechallenging if financial conglomeration occurs, since the analysis of competition relies on thecorrect definition of the relevant geographic and product markets. Thus, increasing numbers offinancial conglomerates that sell traditional retail banking services along with insurance andsecurities will make the analysis of competitive effects of mergers more difficult. In addition, itwill remain important to distinguish between markets for large-scale wholesale products andmarkets for household- and small-business-oriented retail banking products. We will also need toconsider the effects that networks, such as ATM and point-of-sale networks, and other forms ofelectronic banking have on competition for financial services. Finally, as financial relationshipsbecome increasingly complex, we must work to reduce market inertia that could lessencompetition by restricting customers’ ability to choose freely among providers of financialservices. Domestic competition is particularly important not only because it increases the welfareof our fellow citizens, but also because other reforms, such as those based on market discipline,probably work best in a competitive market. Also, domestic competition is one of the mostpowerful forces that gives rise to international competitiveness.Reducing Systemic Risk through Improved SupervisionFinally, the Federal Reserve must continually improve the bank supervisoryprocess in order to help manage risk that could be introduced into the financial system by thechanges occurring in the financial sector. The effects of consolidation and conglomeration onsystemic risk cannot be ignored. If risk is not managed properly within the consolidated firm, therepercussions could extend beyond a single institution and well into the financial sector. Even ifthe moral hazard problem could be largely solved, so that financial firms bear the individualcosts of the risks they adopt, these firms may fail to internalize the costs borne by the entirefinancial system when their portfolio decisions result in bad financial outcomes. The risk of suchdamage can be held in check only by sound supervisory practices.I do not have time to do more than quickly mention some of the important effortsthat the Federal Reserve is pursuing in order to improve bank supervision. Much of our effort,along with that of other bank supervisors, is focused on improving our ability to monitor andsupervise the risk management practices of banks and banking organizations. Closely relatedwork is aimed at devising capital standards that more accurately reflect the realities of today’sbanking world. Through it all, I would emphasize that old-fashioned supervision, the core ofwhich is the on-site examination, remains central to our supervisory strategy. Improved marketdiscipline, increased communication with other supervisors, and enhanced stability throughgreater diversification are necessary. But improved supervision is also critical, and sometimesthere is simply no substitute for a well-trained and highly motivated examiner “on the ground.”
BIS Review   90/1998V. ConclusionIn closing, I would like to reemphasize the importance of the basic skills thatremain centrally important in the financial services sector. Regardless of the extent and thenature of conglomeration, technological development, and new financial instruments, goodfundamental business practices will remain essential: credit underwriting and risk managementskills, cost control, and appropriate pricing practices. While technological improvements are anaid in nearly all these areas, only sound management practices will allow industry participants totake advantage of any advances in technology. At the same time, fundamental principles ofsupervision and regulation must be applied, including sound credit standards and on-siteexaminations, to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial sector. Finally, regulatorsshould implement antitrust policy in a manner that will ensure competitive prices and services asthe financial sector evolves and consolidates. Despite the importance of vigorous supervision andregulation, I and my colleagues on the Board are quite sensitive to the fact that it is not our roleto judge the wisdom of management decisions and business strategies beyond ensuring thatpublic policy standards regarding supervision and regulation are met. I look forward to observingand participating in this sector’s evolution into the next century. I thank you once again for theopportunity to discuss these issues with you today.
