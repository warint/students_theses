 bi central bankers’ speech 1 maja kadievska-vojnovik: recent development central bank governance, accountability transparency core driver effective financial supervision importance board effectiveness bank central bank speak note m maja kadievska-vojnovik, vice-governor national bank republic macedonia, conference “central bank supervisory governance”, organize netherlands bank, amsterdam, 12 february 2016. * * * at begin 2016, global economy look set enter another challenge year ahead. the risk policymakers remain multifaceted global transition continue adjustment happen multiple fronts. first source vulnerability china transit early main engine global economic growth new phase growth rebalancing, almost certain result major slowdown internally adverse spillover externally trade linkage price commodities. a second, protract period low commodity price strain growth prospect commodity exporters, include major emerge market like brazil, russia south africa. third front europe along debt crisis, face another challenge struggle effectively manage migrant crisis bring test eu’s absorption capacity political system. fourth, u feed launch normalization monetary policy lead policy divergence advance economy build fear potentially tight finance condition decline capital flow may adversely affect emerge market economies. the international community response crisis middle east risk potential brexit additional factor add geopolitical risks. global growth prospect remain cloudy again, imf (weo, january 2016) expect gradual pick global growth estimate 3.1% 2015 3.4% 2016 3.6% 2017 (as compare 3.6% 2016 3.8% 2017 october 2015, weo). risk continue weigh downside particularly prominent emerge develop economy give high vulnerability sudden switch global confidence, reversal capital flow financial market volatility. the challenge world translate challenge environment monetary policy making. continuous vigilance multiple fronts, successfully juggle difficult trade-off decision make become new art central bank nowadays. the main challenge monetary authorities, today, year back, deliver appropriate policy mix support demand activity, safeguard macro-financial risks. recent crisis bring financial stability fore acknowledge importance central bank financial stability, task historically performed, though vary degrees. accord bi study (2009) central banks’ arrangement financial stability stand crisis differ widely across countries, normal crisis times. bank supervision always task central bank, many central bank lack clear mandate macro prudential policies. a come advance economies, common practice crisis generally characterize separation responsibility respect monetary policy bank supervision, delegate function different regulator. look eu, integrate model supervision predominate across member states, capture form unify financial bank oversight one single national authority, generally, central bank. the situation quite different emerge country central bank tend main micro prudential supervisor banks. in response crisis, visible convergence both, advance emerge economies, towards integrate supervision common roof central bank, usually use “new” formula 2 bi central bankers’ speech macro-supervision. the role sound supervision endorse absolutely vital promotion maintenance healthy financial system, central bank get recognize lead protagonist area prevention, management resolution financial crises. thus, 2010, u pass dodd-frank act redesign role feed financial supervision, eu ongoing process towards bank union assign bank supervision ecb together national supervisory authority participate member states. the benefit integrate supervision rest synergy bank supervision monetary policy give bank play crucial role monetary policy transmission mechanism. in context, supervisory information regard individual banks’ health highly beneficial central bank enhance monetary policy effectiveness. on hand, expand central bank’s mandate additional task may pose challenge respect central bank governance. a note georgsson et al. (2015) broad mandate central bank has, often force find balance different objectives, task tools. study implication financial stability task central bank governance, bi (2009) underline need effective governance arrangement design deliver sustainable conduct monetary policy function combination additional mandate contribute financial stability. further, report stress importance clarity respect financial stability responsibilities, policy transparency promote accountability, full autonomy safeguard political pressure undue influence business industry close collaboration regulator country. another important aspect central bank balance sheet sound enough strengthen risk-bearing capacity enable successful implementation monetary policy support financial stability case emergency. go back bank supervision, besides institutional setup, another important question raise crisis relate role transparency accountability promote effective bank supervision. accord literature, supervision consider effective able effectively develop, implement, monitor enforce supervisory policy normal stress economic conditions. bi (2012) define several precondition effective supervision practice: 1) sound sustainable macroeconomic policy core precondition stable financial system; 2) well establish framework financial stability policy formulation i.e. clear framework macro prudential surveillance financial stability policy formulation; 3) proper regulatory environment; 4) clear framework crisis management, recovery resolution; 5) appropriate level systemic protection (or public safety net) system deposit insurance contribute public confidence system thus limit contagion bank distress 6) effective market discipline. transparency another factor gain grow importance recent years. thus, order restore confidence rebuild financial stability strong push towards supervisor increase transparency market public. one support argument trend role transparency prerequisite accountability. high transparency enhance legitimacy supervisor, also safeguard independence. when transparent, supervisory action become predictable thus help shape expectation foster linkage across institution markets. finally, transparency set grind careful consistent decision-making, reduce scope arbitrary decisions. empirical research (arnone et al., 2007), find positive correlation transparency supervisor effectiveness bank supervision. they also report high transparency bank supervision (based adherence imf code) industrial country emerge economies. another, recent research (liendrop al., 2011) suggest overall level transparency supervisor industrial country similar transparency supervisor emerge economy indicate positive movement emerge market area recent years. indeed, supervisor seem endorse transparency. in 2006 basel committee bank supervision, basel core principle effective bank supervision, first mention supervisor follow transparent processes. this mean supervisor disclose objective bi central bankers’ speech 3 framework hold accountable perform duty line objective framework. the capital requirement directive iv (crd iv) stipulate supervisor need publish relevant information laws, regulations, administrative rule guidance, information option discretions, general criterion methodology use supervisory review evaluation process, aggregate statistical data implementation prudential framework, include number nature supervisory measure take administrative penalty imposed.the european bank authority (eba) acknowledge need supervisory transparency set guideline supervisory transparency (cebs, 2010) intend increase transparency supervisory practice enhance comparability national practices. furthermore, eba publish relevant information eu country supervisory law regulation statistical data national bank sectors, risk indicator supervisory actions. while benefit great transparency supervision broadly recognized, level disclosure remain challenge issue. this relate specific supervision obtain sensitive information respect state individual bank publicly disclose may affect competitive position. give this, one could expect supervisor continue increase transparency come authority disclose information supervisory model methodology use evaluate risk profile individual banks, retain “secrecy” come sensitive information concern individual banks. this enable market good understand supervisory actions, enhance accountability supervisor front general public protect market-sensitive information. tackle issue board effectiveness, grow consensus nowadays well-designed committee make important prerequisite qualitative decision-making central banks. the role committee sound policy make probably best note warsh (2015) observation “monetary policy make neither rule discretion. it make committee”. the literature show institutional setup board indeed matter monetary policy (morgan, 2005; maier, 2010; sibert, 2006) suggest guideline optimal committee design. thus, accord maier (2010) optimal committee clear objective independence; large size (up five members) measure avoid free-riding discourage polarization group think. when come practice, number decision-makers, decision-making protocol, principal attendance diverge markedly among lead central banks, suggest committee dynamic appropriately adjust conditional institutional set-up specific central bank. bi central bankers’ speech 1 hiroshi nakaso: challenge toward financial stability policy frontier – unconventional monetary policy, macroprudence, financial institutions’ low profitability speech mr hiroshi nakaso, deputy governor bank japan, iva (the royal swedish academy engineer sciences) – jsps (the japan society promotion science) seminar, stockholm, 21 march 2016. * * * accompany chart find end speech. introduction good evening, lady gentlemen. it great honor pleasure able speak esteem institution today. before i get substance speech, let first thank person make event possible: mr. robert stenram. mr. stenram tokyo representative swedbank 1990s, acute financial crisis japan. while post tokyo, instrumental liaise closely japanese bank industry. i benefit deep insight thoughtful advice base experience professional banker. it indeed turbulent times, also become friends, i long enjoy friendship since then. i deeply regret long us, wish pay tribute great work accomplish link sweden japan world finance. robert, i forget much owe you. may soul, join beloved wife siv, rest peace. over years, sweden japan confront difficult issue term monetary policy financial stability. in late 1980s, saw financial bubble develop burst. from 2008 2009, tackle recent global financial crisis together, today two country fight deflationary headwinds. a know, riksbank bank japan adopt negative interest rate policy achieve respective price stability targets. in order discharge responsibility maintain price financial stability, central bank must prepare meet new challenge appear. reflect experiences, i front line central banker japan’s financial crisis 1990s 2000s, bank’s long battle deflation nearly two decades. not year could i forget importance financial stability. with background, i describe today importance financial stability policy implication newly emerge challenge three perspectives: unconventional monetary policy, macroprudence, low profitability financial institutions. financial crisis growth inflection to begin with, let go back 1990s explain experience burst bubble economy japan. a i touch beginning, sweden japan experience financial bubbles. nevertheless, subsequent path two country quite different (chart 1). in sweden crisis early 1990s, capital quickly inject bank system stability financial system restored. in addition, swedish krona floated, riksbank able ease monetary policy. with tailwind depreciate krona contributing, swedish economy begin recover early 1993. furthermore, follow sweden’s accession european union 1995, factor growth it industry benefit increase inbound investment contribute 2 bi central bankers’ speech productivity growth. in fact, sweden’s potential growth actually increase burst bubble. in contrast, japan manage inject capital financial institution meaningful scale “dark november” 1997, experience series failure large financial institutions.1 that nearly eight year bubble burst. during years, financial institutions’ behavior, evergreening loan practically fail business extend additional loans, result buildup impair assets, make difficult cleanse financial institutions’ balance sheet problem loans, distort allocation resources. the layer multiple factor push japanese economy deflation, concurrently, productivity growth declined.2 furthermore, period overlap rapid change demography, result decline working-age population backdrop low birth rate aging. the confluence two current – financial sector problem demographic change – significantly pull japan’s potential growth rate (chart 2). that turn exacerbate over-leveraging corporate sector discourage corporate investment. from macroeconomic perspective, low investment depress productivity growth, negatively impact potential growth. there vicious cycle: over-leveraging corporate sector lead decline potential growth rate, turn exacerbate difficulty resolve non-performing loan bank sector over-leveraging corporate sector. admit one wise event, retrospect, forbearance policy early stage burst asset bubble underestimation systemic nature go financial sector allow problem bank sector develop full-blown financial crisis.3 this shorthand account extend stagnation deflation follow burst bubble: so-called “lost two decades” japan. from painful episode, learn two things. one financial stability foundation sustain growth economy, another change potential growth amplify financial cycle consequently impact financial stability. the widespread recognition international policy forum need take account macroprudential perspective may consequence recent global financial crisis, japan’s predicament precede seem amply underscore importance perspective. to me, formative experience central banker. i attach importance macroprudence ever since. stability consequence qqe negative interest rate next agenda today implementation monetary policy bank japan relationship macroprudential policy. after burst bubble, low potential growth bring large decline natural rate interest, guidepost monetary policy formulation (chart 3). a know, monetary ease use bring real interest rate natural rate interest. mindful prevail view zero low bind nominal interest rates, quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) introduce bank japan april 2013 breakthrough follow sense: bank make strong commitment achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time, encourage expect 1 during month, many four financial institutions, include internationally active ones, fail succession: sanyo securities, hokkaido takushoku bank, yamaichi securities, tokuyo city bank. 2 caballero, ricardo j., takeo hoshi, anil k. kashyap. 2008. “zombie lend depress restructure japan.” american economic review, 98(5): 1943–77. 3 nakaso, hiroshi. “the financial crisis japan 1990s: bank japan respond lesson learnt,” bi paper no 6, october 2001. bi central bankers’ speech 3 inflation rise. concurrently, bank, recognize limit room short-term interest rate decline, exert downward pressure nominal interest rate across entire yield curve purchase large amount long-term government bonds, together high inflation expectations, real interest rate would bring down. the qqe negative interest rate framework introduce bank japan january aim reinforce exist qqe support activity firm households, thereby ensure early attainment 2 percent inflation target. the policy work channels, bring real interest rates. a i noted, conventional wisdom zero low bind nominal interest rates, demonstration european central banks, include riksbank, limitation could overcome degree lead bank japan adopt new policy framework. in fact, introduction negative policy rate, financial environment relaxed, yield curve shift significantly low financial institution low lend rate (chart 4). in addition, rebalancing portfolio financial institution also start take place, increase interest invest foreign currency denominate bonds, although trend somewhat mask effect recent market turmoil. against backdrop positive development financial intermediation, macroprudential perspective, effect financial stability must carefully monitored. i believe need mindful two angles. one “overheating” risk, extremely relax financial environment could destabilize financial system excessive risk taking. the “contraction” risk, low revenue stream result low interest rate could erode risk appetite and/or undermine soundness financial institutions. for time being, believe generally need overly concern regard overheat risk. there evidence increase real estate transactions, price apartment tokyo area top previous peak bubble years, leverage real estate sector still excessive. our general view financial sector robust capital base relative risk take resilience face stress sufficient, thus could undertake positive risk take portfolio rebalancing qqe negative interest rate framework. at time, believe contraction risk present also small. the extend period monetary ease tend pressure interest rate margin financial institutions, negatively impact revenue stream (chart 5). this something unique set unconventional monetary policy, economic environment exceptional policy need adopted, tend le room deposit rate fall – words, interest rate margin tight ever – additional ease policy could result non-linear compression margins.4 have say that, japanese financial institution able remain sound reduction margin thus far offset revenue improvement backdrop improve economic condition monetary easing, increase lend volume, low credit costs, high investment incomes. the policy framework qqe negative interest rate maintain monetary ease term quantity quality boost strongly negative policy rate. a such, strongly influence financial system. accordingly, bank japan must thoroughly monitor analyze state financial system macroprudential perspective. to end, bank japan publish financial system report twice year. in report, ass stability japan’s financial system various angles, include 4 borio, claudio, leonardo gambacorta, boris hofmann. 2015. “the influence monetary policy bank profitability.” bi work paper no.514. 4 bi central bankers’ speech balance amount risk bear financial institution financial bases, macro stress testing, macro risk indicator (i.e., “heat map”). i believe independent examination development financial perspective enhance credibility qqe negative interest rate. macroprudential policy monetary policy even risk contain juncture, if, future, overheat risk become apparent? there two contrast view relationship monetary macroprudential policies: separation principle lean wind. the former say render unto monetary policy thing concern price stability, render unto macroprudential policy thing concern financial stability. on hand, latter hold that, amplification financial imbalance expect threaten price stability long run, central bank resort monetary policy order dampen financial cycle, notwithstanding temporary deviation inflation target. let offer views, influence experience japanese bubble. up 1980s, bank japan require bank comply guidance set loan growth level individually assign bank. this arrangement, call “window guidance” regard tool monetary policy, current taxonomy, would regard time-varying macroprudential policy tool, akin regulation loan-to-value (ltv) debt-to-income (dti). there two school think regard effectiveness tool: “independent tool theory,” hold window guidance effective itself, “complementary tool theory,” hold window guidance use alongside mainstream monetary policy official discount rate adjustment effective. the subject actively discuss academia, support independent tool theory argue tighten window guidance could dampen financial cycle, even official discount rate hold steady.5 the bank japan, meantime, basically adopt complementary tool theory explain window guidance tool support general policy instruments, change official discount rate, rather independent policy instrument. notwithstanding official position, last half 1980s, call international policy coordination necessitate maintenance low interest rate environment view expand domestic demand, bank japan attempt respond sign financial excess tighten window guidance. a result, growth bank lend slow gradually, large corporates still able raise fund outside bank sector issuance bond (chart 6). the period coincide gradual relaxation underwrite guideline corporate bonds, buoyant stock market, partly reflection monetary easing, reduce cost equity financing, convertible bond bond embed warrants. the result increase capital market finance sustain relax financial environment, corporate balance sheet keep expanding. the bank japan could effectively deal sign overheating. another notable feature japanese bubble late 1980s potential growth natural rate interest fairly high time (charts 2 3). the degree monetary ease one particular level policy rate depend whether natural rate interest high low. when natural rate interest expect growth high, likely strong incentive financial institution corporates circumvent restriction impose window guidance. 5 fukumoto, tomoyuki, masato higashi, yasunari inamura, takeshi kimura. “effectiveness window guidance financial environment,” bank japan review series, 10-e-4, august 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 5 in light japanese experiences, i fully subscribe view narrowly confine imbalance counter macroprudential policy first line defense, effectiveness policy uncertain, consider change financial market structure due deregulation level natural rate interest. accordingly, i cannot fully uphold separation principle, reflect view time-varying macroprudential policy measure effective. i believe leave open possibility respond widen financial imbalance fiscal policy, include tax policy, monetary policy. such think reflect bank japan conduct monetary policy, bank examine economic monetary condition two-pillar approach: deliberation likely outcome first pillar, deliberation risk factor relevant conduct monetary policy, financial imbalance particular, second pillar. low profitability financial institution let turn risk: contraction risk. what risk become apparent? more specifically, make low profitability financial institution macroprudential perspective? this question seem attract attention europe well. in order properly think issue, important distinguish low profitability due acute problem due chronic issues. when profit financial institution severely decline acute stresses, necessary sufficient capital order maintain financial stability. look current developments, international bank system significantly raise capital ratio, reflect strengthen capital rule follow recent financial crisis. such capital strength also important effective transmission monetary policy. give monetary ease pressure interest margin financial institution short run, weakly capitalize institution able increase lending, undercut positive effect easing. a i note earlier, fact japanese financial institution able increase lend bank japan implement unconventional monetary policy margin compress demonstrate well capitalize institution are. in short, even economy suffer acute stress profit financial institution negatively impacted, cushion provide sufficient capital prevent instability financial system, stimulus monetary ease provide shoot arm would turn around economy thence profit financial institutions. such outcome, however, assure financial system confront chronic stresses, even current level capital adequate. this persistence environment financial institution cannot get sufficient net return capital would eventually erode capital financial institutions. one example chronic stress foot-dragging financial institution recognition non-performing loan flip side: over-leveraging corporates. another inflection potential growth rate, would low firms’ expectation growth depress investment. in fact, many develop economies, excess save observe corporate sector (chart 7). with stagnation investment come decline productivity growth, would negatively impact potential growth rate. a process unfolds, financial institution would face downward pressure lend rates. financial institution face result compression interest rate margin would pursue volume increase revenue flows. such increase competitive pressure would depress lend rate revenue well. excessive competition financial institution lend would thus make easy low-productivity firm survive, hind efficient allocation resource economy so-called “creative destruction,” consequently would prevent lift potential growth rate. if low level profit financial institution depress potential growth rate tie together excessive lend competition financial institutions, risk profit become “too low 6 bi central bankers’ speech recover” could gradually increase, unless financial institution succeed change business models. the quest innovation financial intermediation joseph alois schumpeter, seminal the theory economic development, stress important role play “banker,” well “entrepreneur”6 the banker profit ability identify entrepreneur develop truly innovative undertake high-quality startups, generate information lead improve corporate performance. schumpeter expect profit motif banker back exceptional ability pick winner would bring efficient reallocation risk macroeconomy lead endogenous rise economic growth rate.7 this role banker – promote creative destruction financial intermediation – change since time schumpeter. however, economy mature, nature investment support innovation entrepreneur change gradually investment tangible asset intangible assets, research development, information technology, human organizational capital. accordingly, investment intangible asset identify important element new source growth develop economies.8 if i may point find one recent research study, investment intangible asset sensitive availability internal fund (or cashflow) compare investment tangible assets.9 if financial market perfect markets, source fund – is, internal finance external finance include bank finance – would completely substitutable, corporate investment would affect availability internal funds. nevertheless, fact investment intangible sensitive availability internal fund suggest firm could face financial constraint due information asymmetries. one could say asymmetry result difficulty assess collateral value intangible asset compare tangible assets. consequently, opportunity banker profit overcome information asymmetries. in japan, ratio investment intangible asset nominal gdp low unite state major peer (chart 8). if financial institution able tease corporate demand investment intangible assets, would enhance productivity whole economy also would contribute solve structural problem low profitability financial institutions. the future path japanese economy would influence behavior financial institution whether financial institution would continue war attrition exist business model would expand business frontier unearth new finance needs. just human beings, chronic syndrome demand fundamental change lifestyles, financial institution must prepare fundamentally change business model order extricate structural lack profitability. 6 schumpeter, joseph alois. 1926. theorie d wirtschaftlichen entwicklung: eine untersuchung über unternehmergewinn, kapital, kredit, zins und den konjunkturzyklus, 2nd

bank japan implement measure would encourage financial institution implement essential reforms. one adjust way bank inject liquidity financial system – example, fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth, purchase etf compose stock issue firm proactively invest physical human capital. these measure expect play catalytic role enhance financial intermediation function financial institution capital markets, would foster productivity increase ultimately lead improvement potential rate growth. another set measure design enhance function financial institution efficiently allocate resources. the bank japan actively provide financial institution information know-how seminars, etc., enhance value financial intermediation through, example, support startup businesses, business matching, rejuvenate businesses, utilize information technology. these undertake bank japan somewhat different find conventional macroprudential toolkit, i believe perform important function promote financial stability. unconventional policy beyond before conclude remark today, i would like emphasize that, change potential growth rate would influence effectiveness monetary macroprudential policies, ultimately affect price financial stability, would naturally affect central banks’ think policy formulation. a matter fact, area monetary policy, effectiveness policy constrain japan concurrent decline expect inflation persistent deflation potential growth rate. in regard, current pursuit bank japan 2 percent inflation target qqe negative interest rate contribute lift potential growth purge deflationary mindset encourage capital formation. at time, area macroprudential policy, current focus strengthen regulation solve structural problem low profitability financial institutions. with regard problem, global policy fora, jury still out, speak, regard expand policy frontier. central bank perhaps need little flexible design macroprudential policy serve end. of course, structural problem cannot solely solve central bank actions. economic policy government undertake firm financial institution aim encourage innovation also essential. the bank japan work actor order tackle new challenge term financial stability. thank attention. 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 bi central bankers’ speech 1 yves mersch: shape future europe’s financial market infrastructure open remark mr yves mersch, member executive board european central bank, information session consultative report rtgs services, frankfurt main, 22 march 2016. * * * introduction in open remark i want address three issues. first, i set main driver change shape europe’s financial market infrastructure general rtgs system particular. second, i address consequence driver change eurosystem tackle role operator, overseer catalyst. and third, i present eurosystem’s concept evolve market infrastructure beyond 2020. 1. key driver change europe’s financial market infrastructure change europe’s financial market infrastructure landscape drive two big objectives: integration increase efficiency. with advent euro common currency, integration heart eurosystem’s strategy build rtgs system correspondent central bank model (ccbm) 1990s. the elimination difference national cross-border retail payment euro key ambition behind creation single euro payment area (sepa). last least, t2s, single pan-european platform security settlement central bank money, consolidate fundamental part security value chain: settlement. we see market consolidation trade clear well. in parallel effort move towards integrate market infrastructure, eurosystem take step increase efficiency market infrastructure. this facilitate technological progress innovation. at time, take account digitalisation social diffusion real-time information communication fundamentally change end user expectations. access use financial service anytime, anywhere, via multiple devices/access channel take grant now. this consequence service layer, also underlie clear settlement layers. a impact certain functionality within market infrastructure may expect distribute ledger technology (dlts). we commit analyse whether technology could lead low cost resilient market infrastructure. but also consider may affect financial intermediation general, role bank market participants, well rule procedure regulators. 2. consequence central bank three role operator, overseer catalyst the eurosystem fulfil statutory task promote smooth operation payment settlement system three distinct roles: operator, overseer catalyst. these three role go change. what change need role. a operator, eurosystem commit assess opportunity present new technology enhance different service provide financial service community. the current exercise consolidate two infrastructure operate u excellent start point this. with exercise, aim bring benefit target2 end user offer state-of-the-art feature available t2s. we convince 2 bi central bankers’ speech increase efficiency market infrastructure ultimately support efficiency financial service community. a overseer, eurosystem need arrive common understand development could potentially affect oversee entities. the digitalisation financial industry mean security requirement oversee instrument infrastructure need adapt enhance accordingly. furthermore, emergence new service provider require reflection issue ensure level play field newcomer long-established players, well appropriate level protection users. service provider outside europe offer global solution present challenge tackled. last least, effect digitalisation new technology also need study context cyber resilience, operator overseer functions. the objective continue resilient infrastructure smoothly function payment system guarantee proper transmission monetary policy. a catalyst, overarch goal still fulfil task lay treaty support creation truly single european market payment securities. we strongly believe single market bring improvement efficiency contribute economic growth. hence, main focus ensure technological innovation lead disruption re-fragmentation market. 3. the eurosystem’s vision evolve financial market infrastructure service to address need europe’s financial market infrastructure continuously evolve keep pace market development technological progress, eurosystem develop three key action point work run 2020 beyond. the first, discus today, explore synergy target2 t2s, goal achieve consolidate market infrastructure large-value payment security settlement. the second action point prepare enhancement target2 service instant retail payments, least settlement layer. currently, business requirement settlement instant payment credit risk management across payment system gather market participants. we also need ass whether interoperability arrangement automate clear house ensure full pan-european reachability instant payment scheme participant eu extent risk mitigation measure harmonise across automate clear house facilitate interoperability. third, plan review harmonisation eurosystem arrangement procedure collateralisation. further progress need area business case common eurosystem collateral management system reconsidered. conclusion europe’s financial market infrastructure build basis collective approach, drive jointly public private sector. in three action point market infrastructure beyond 2020, eurosystem continue work closely market order benefit knowledge experience well ensure europe’s future financial market infrastructure fully meet need users. please say – whether today information session, exist users’ forum write procedure. your input needed. let u jointly write script future euroystem’s rtgs services. with this, i hand chair meeting. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mugur isărescu: recent development central bank governance panel presentation mr mugur isărescu, governor national bank romania, "central bank supervisory governance" conference, organize national bank netherlands, amsterdam, 12 february 2016. * * * lady gentlemen, it great honour address audience high-level conference subject special interest us, recent development central bank governance lead heat debate every time bring fore. mr. he do wonderful job structure challenge nowadays’ central bank outline importance effective governance arrangement order meet challenge – presentation testimony imf’s unique ability draw upon vast set worldwide institutional experiences. i, turn, draw mainly upon narrower, hopefully le relevant, set institutional experiences, gather tenure governor national bank romania. in address today i intend deal issue recent development central bank governance look at: 1. the central bank objective start point design governance framework; 2. how nbr deal financial stability objective, institutional point view; integrate separate monetary policy supervision; 3. a short history institutional development within nbr ensure financial stability; 4. the internal control layer nbr; 5. pro con different institutional alternatives: bank supervision macroprudential authority – inside outside central bank; 6. a historical perspective experience become modern central bank, process undergo nbr. 1. define objective – start point design central bank governance it go without say grind zero build central bank governance framework clarify objective pursue. for quite long time, least europe, “price stability” enjoy position override objective, since outbreak crisis become obvious “inflation first” approach may turn counterproductive environment financial instability. therefore, financial stability concern make way central bankers’ agenda. be really novelty? a representative emerge economy central bank never luxury concern exclusively price stability, i dare say not. actually, central bank always preservation of, quote charles goodhart, “the three aspect stability”, namely price stability, (external) currency stability financial stability. moreover, fact aspect stability condition discover aftermath crisis – central bankers, maybe even emerging-market central bankers, long keenly aware failure ensure one kind stability bind jeopardise achievement others. what crisis indeed challenge widespread conviction meet one particular stability criterion, necessary order achieve others, also sufficient condition 2 bi central bankers’ speech – all, maintain price stability, valuable itself, prove insufficient ward major financial macroeconomic instability. a matter fact, andrew crocket claim ever since 2003 “peace dividend” yield successful war inflation live expectation therefore battlefront financial instability overlooked. regardless battlefront approached, essence make sure task entrust central bank feasible. otherwise, monetary authority overburden possibly conflict goals, major risk render inefficient unable deliver single one objectives. this reason issue central bank governance intricate delicate: one need reconcile objective that, certain circumstances, might even prove incompatible. 2. integrate separate price financial guardianship give conference focus central bank supervisory governance, allow touch issue integrate price guardianship financial guardianship within central bank. a probably remember, idea two task completely separate gain grind 1990s. the rationale behind view free monetary policy conduct conflict objective thus render policymakers’ mission life easier. it advocate bank sector supervision long assign central bank, rather independent agency (which might also ensure consolidate supervision financial markets). i, myself, find idea rather interest end 1990s, collapse several romanian bank influence decision-making process national bank romania. i realise moment costly term reputation central bank charge supervision prudential regulation – mention separation appear quite fashionable newly-established financial service authority become operational unite kingdom. at time, i vividly remember conflict price stability financial stability, i mediate divergent position take board meet deputy governor coordinate two functions, virtue personal affiliations, due nature specific task entrust with. i wondering, light board disputes, whether separate monetary policy supervision function preferable. at hindsight, i believe romania make right choice preserve bank supervision prerogative central bank, sort dispute roof. come current nbr governance framework, i would like start point ensure complete separation regard coordination relevant departments: governor charge monetary policy area, first deputy governor coordinate supervision department; one deputy governor take care financial stability other, bank resolution. the nine-strong board director run central bank, process prepare decision area monetary policy prudential supervision take place two distinct structures: monetary policy committee supervisory committee, respectively, comprise member executive management expert relevant areas. a separation thing complete isolation, i add committee chair governor... pursuant nbr statute, board task act first appellate forum sanction credit institutions. in order avoid conflict interest may appear, follow institutional arrangement place: separate board meetings, certain degree autonomy supervision department recusal proceed first deputy governor, capacity coordinator supervision department. bi central bankers’ speech 3 i would like add special remark regard new role nbr resolution authority, arise provision bank recovery resolution directive. we configure activity report line order ensure full operational independence avoid conflict interest supervision resolution functions. of course, take place without prejudice exchange information cooperation obligations. to specific, supervisory decision pose constrain resolution-related ones. moreover, staff involve perform resolution function structurally separate nbr functions. 3. romania: short history institutional change ensure financial stability the global crisis make obvious u price stability financial stability much intertwine use think. i believe development farther-reaching consequence come future central banking. a i point november last year world policy conference organise montreux, i cannot imagine future explicit concern financial stability macroprudential policy central bank fixtures. in romania, concern ensure strengthen financial stability visible several significant change institutional framework, operate already outbreak global economic financial crisis. specifically, nbr’s financial stability department create early 2004, first edition annual financial stability report – report publish half-yearly basis start year – release 2006. of course, matter much responsibly central bank would get involve safeguard financial stability, public good deliver cooperation coordination institution task financial market supervision regulation. relevant respect romania national committee financial stability establish early 2007. the governor national bank romania, minister public finance, president financial supervisory authority chairman bank deposit guarantee fund member committee, whose key objective ensure exchange relevant information, well prevent, appraise manage issue potentially systemic impact. effort currently underway turn entity set base agreement among member institution national committee macroprudential oversight, whose composition, task area competence shall set forth law. this inter-institutional structure act macroprudential authority, within mean esrb recommendation 2011/3. 4. nbr: internal control layer i imagine agree improve governance structure essential central bank i strongly believe share view experience make possible reunion one attend extremely beneficial process. a far nbr concerned, enhance governance steady concern course time, ultimate goal alignment best practices, often imf support. let point nbr shift internal auditors’ commission audit financial statement external auditor early 2001, follow year saw establishment audit committee substructure nbr board (at time even ecb committee place!). in addition audit committee, nbr’s internal control system include several control layers. in fact, three line defence factor might jeopardise fulfilment nbr objectives. 4 bi central bankers’ speech first all, national bank romania take functional approach risk management, mean organisational unit primary responsibility identifying, assess manage risk associate activity operations. the risk management process integral part nbr’s internal control system represent bank’s first line defence. each organisational unit implement operational control procedure within area responsibility, accordance level risk tolerance set advance executive management. furthermore, nbr apply approach know “chinese wall”, separate department charge monetary policy formulation implementation, one hand, department entrust statutory tasks, other. the second line defence functional certain business segment high-risk financial exposure, e.g. international reserve management. this line defence monitor compliance risk limit approve bank’s executive management report breach. a major role line defence play decision-making/advisory committee within central bank. apart two committee dedicate monetary policy supervision i already mentioned, particularly significant foreign reserve management committee. in addition risk monitor operational structures, nbr’s internal audit

supervision rest country central bank, whereas others lie distinct authority. both option valid one-size-fits-all solution probably reached, give country-specific financial condition institutional arrangements. however, necessarily exclude look argument either alternative. a i already said, i believe good supervision integrate central bank. first all, ongoing complex challenge financial economic stability call identifying, use corroborate ton information order articulate adequate policies. the central bank rely database expertise, prerequisite manage challenge environment. beyond major advantage, also benefit institutional arrangement. independence political influence essential effective supervision. and central bank institution enjoy high level independence newly-established government agency would able gain, least short run. besides, clearly acknowledge link price stability financial stability mean need take account formulate monetary policy. moreover, benoît cœuré point out, data collect analysis conduct part bank supervision provide valuable information financial sector may fee assessment state economy, useful monetary policy decision-making process. of course, literature identify disadvantage integrate supervision central bank. the risk arrangement result loose monetary policy, due conflict objectives, i already refer to, important drawback. however, beck gros stress article 2012, rise macro-prudential regulation additional tool, clear whether price financial stability still conflict other. bi central bankers’ speech 5 another disadvantage reputation and/or independence central bank might undermined: decision action area supervision resolution perceive wrong suboptimal, may negatively affect credibility monetary policy, conduct institution. moreover, temptation politician capture central bank may rise, much power case mission deliver price stability. the various arrangement assign bank supervision also bear design national macroprudential authority. depend mainly conduct supervision banks, different institutional solution adequate authority: may represent committee board comprise representative relevant institutions, central bank another authority task financial market supervision. board place envisage 13 eu countries, central bank – project – national macroprudential authority 13 eu countries, whereas two opt – consider – entrust role national supervisory authority. opt central bank national macroprudential authority warrant experience accumulate field, especially case dominant position bank sector, possibility quick implementation adopt measure (since institution responsible identify systemic risk and, time, available macroprudential tool put practice measure consider adequate). some disadvantage supervision integrate central bank manifest case well, backfire potential error area (be real merely perceive public) monetary policy credibility keen interest politically capture institution result substantial rise central bank powers. a klaas knot show once, key argument favour create board enable pool expertise financial market supervisor government; drawback would diffuse accountability risk delay implementation recommendations, give involvement several institutions. a prominent role central bank board (either chair number member assigned) might mitigate risk inaction. in case romania, supervision bank non-bank financial institution task nbr, financial supervisory authority (fsa) oversee financial markets, solution emerge adequate one identify draft law promote government: national committee macroprudential oversight. the decision-making body committee make nine members: governor, first-deputy governor, two deputy governor chief economist national bank romania; president first-vice president financial supervisory authority, well two government representative appoint prime minister. addressee national committee recommendation – nbr fsa, sectoral financial supervisory authorities, government – act unless inaction adequately justify (“act explain” mechanism). 6. reform central bank governance fall communism i always opinion one cannot truly understand present glimpse future without know past learn lessons. these lesson begin transition monetary authority command economy modern central bank operate market economy, experience is, sure, familiar many u present – i believe half central bank constituency, include romania’s, “new kid block”. of course, different stage development term institutional framework. some central bank presently undergo process shape consolidate 6 bi central bankers’ speech governance, endeavor intend transform modern monetary authorities. and, believe me, i know experience complicate process be! in early nineties, i take governor national bank romania, tremendous effort need put practice transition monobank-type system two-tier system. it mean simple task reform institution operate context centralise

monetary policy. and proper dosage essence cases. bi central bankers’ speech 1 glenn stevens: “how withstand shocks?” remark mr glenn stevens, governor reserve bank australia, asic (australian security investment commission) annual forum 2016, sydney, 22 march 2016. * * * i thank emily perry assistance compile remarks. i'm please take part asic's annual forum. the list topic session ‘can withstand major global shock?’ i'm go take liberty title re-frame ‘how withstand shocks?’ for inevitable ‘shocks’ come along 1 one way another human condition characterise thing happen well predict sometimes le prepare might, hindsight, wish be. so question event occur, when. there business cycle, always be. there cycle fear greed financial markets; ever thus. thing rarely move straight line even do, start assume continue, set dynamic ensure won't. unfortunately, good forecast events. in fact forecasts, almost definition, assume ‘shocks’ occur. about best forecast sketch likely effect shock know already occurred. what mean need resilient system – system robust thing go wrong. we need flexible, adaptable economies. we need financial market price risk sensibly oppose habitually ‘pricing perfection’. we need provider finance, banks, so-called ‘shadow banks’ capital markets, ample capacity bear loss thing go wrong – sooner late thing will. with framing, two question ask are: • what shock grapple present? • how ass capacity cope those, worse? recent development there development attract attention potential implication global local economies. first, commodity price fall considerably. in australia, course, part everyday narrative. our term trade peak four half year ago fall 35 per cent since then. this number important effect cause considerable adjustment economy. 1 to clear mean term, shock event development, typically un-forecasted (and sometimes dimly perceive even occurs) significance economy financial system require adjustment various kind period time. they adverse – consider sudden reduction risk appetite dry liquidity international financial market 2008. shock also positive – consider way entry china global economy development efficient east-asian manufacture production chain 1990s low cost consumer good world. or way australia's term trade have, past decade, way historical average. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the effect term trade fall public discussion typically focus impact federal government's fiscal position. since outlook nominal gdp critical projection tax revenues, linkage commodity price revenue forecast become key part economic story. that reasonable far goes, though sequence downward revision term trade assumptions, important, really serve expose deeper, profound, fact budget structurally deficit, reason largely unrelated commodity price decline. that still something that, time, need address. but effect term trade fall effect budget. it large change relative price real incomes. it result different pace economic performance industry region. other thing adjust, include exchange rate allocation labour capital resources. it's complex overall, judgement, australian economy adjust quite well circumstance – certainly far good episode commodity price fluctuation see history. that said, adjustment still work progress. out broad world, price capture attention crude oil, fall two-thirds past two years. this genuine shock: well predicted. but sort shock it? it matter great deal whether price fall demand oil slump – say due major slowdown global economic growth – whether reflect large increase supply oil. the evidence thus far demand slow little, supply increase rapidly recent year expect remain high level year. this matter because, usually, supply something cheap price good news, bad. to sure, low oil price require adjustment part producer – corporate sovereign. but always increase availability energy cheap price generally, past, see plus overall global growth – positive ‘shock’. this response consumer oil decline price consume – oil good service well, use high real income afford low oil prices. it think outweigh negative effect spend cutback oil-producing countries. it seem people le confident time fall oil price expansionary. why so? the fact unite state become large oil producer (and significant producer short-run ‘marginal barrel’) clearly relevant. so possibility consumer europe may, particular reasons, incline save windfall low oil price use be. these factor may, time, work traditional positive effect. in addition, price oil high enough, long enough, many investment spend decision take around world look, perhaps, quite sound hindsight. hence, producer country budget strains; sovereign wealth fund liquidate financial assets; spread debt instrument issue energy company widen sharply; exploration new investment curtail rapidly. it seem though sheer strength longevity precede period high oil price prompt behaviour make player vulnerable price decline. that, course, unknown history commodity markets. have say that, people might little pessimistic effect fall oil prices. it still equivalent reduction tax large number consumer around world disposable income spend repay debt. the shareholder state owner produce assets, gain high prices, wear cost low price, along provide capital market debt funding. at stage, though, appear effect low oil price bi central bankers’ speech 3 greatly magnify significant adverse effect bank system – though course remain careful watch. the second development outlook global growth assess weakened, forecaster expect le growth global economy year next year six month ago. the point much growth weak: forecast high relatively mild global slowdown early 2000s, example, nothing like weak 2009. it number year below-average performance effect cumulating. many country find ‘strong, sustainable balance growth’ talk g20 process rather elusive. the emerge world, lead growth crisis 2008-09, account much slow performance late, focus china particular.2 there doubt china's growth trajectory today, foreseeable future, slow one saw 2011. the chinese authority tell u year occur. the real question successful land transition sustainable still strong growth model, one le reliant investment, drive domestic consumption associate le build leverage. they also manage debt legacy previous period expansion. the truth can't know turn out. no one do transition scale before. a third feature observer investor grapple complex policy environment. the federal reserve's interest rate decision december well telegraph understood. so it, per se, really count ‘shock’. it result expect sort effect – like turnaround early international capital flow emerge markets. some actually begin ahead event itself. at time, though, low rate inflation still gradual pace economic growth lead central bank seek ease monetary policy. balance sheet measure step several european jurisdiction apply negative interest rate part banks' reserve hold central bank. the happen japan. at point, people still try ass implication changes. meanwhile, various reason renew focus asset quality part european bank system europe's resolution arrangements. change china's exchange rate mechanism attract much attention. so, summary, recent month somewhat policy uncertainty. this, turn, reflect difficulty policymakers secure growth. perhaps altogether surprising, then, see period elevate volatility financial market recent months. finance condition emerge market become difficult year ago; generally continued. major advance economy sovereign bond yields, hand, remain low even fallen. the bank international settlement calculate us$6½ trillion sovereign bonds, one-quarter jpmorgan government bond index accord one report, trade negative yield global capital markets. the japanese government – far indebted government develop world – borrow 10 year negative interest rate. but spread less rat sovereign private debt widened, case quite significantly. equity price choppy generally weaker. exchange rate become volatile particularly sensitive shift perception central bank actions. 2 incidentally, i see evidence weak chinese demand oil big factor oil prices. if anything, slow demand oil seem occur elsewhere world. 4 bi central bankers’ speech uncertainty future direction renminbi factor exchange markets, must say yen euro. how evaluate period volatility reduction risk appetite? be reflect information embody soft global growth forecasts? or tell u significant shock see data? if persists, could shock lead bad global outcome – lead tighten credit conditions, loss wealth confidence therefore crimp demand? alternatively, might trend past couple weeks, market seem regain degree composure, continue? if does, might look back recent period turbulence bout market nervousness carry little last importance? these question policymakers grapple yet know answers. resilience but material change global outlook happen – and, let clear, i say is, – resilient we? and resilient? there couple thing say global level. the first global bank system good capitalise liquid, hence resilient, today eight year ago. this part financial sector good deal le likely amplifier shock then. of course strengthen need continue; way go yet full implementation various reforms. but progress made. it noteworthy much increase finance recent year flow capital markets. it acknowledge bond market le liquid use be. this partly major international bank commit size balance sheet market-making activity – stems, part, regulation. this, doubt, part story market volatile recently, though probably whole story. large investor cop accept take long move parcel securities. but worry liquidity may much significantly reduce moment stress, mean may require much big price change market clear. a is, world's deep important market have, occasion past year, see large price movement – thankfully fairly short periods. more generally, search yield see investors, include sovereign funds, insurers, mutual fund hold retail investors, move asset inherently le liquid. this leaf us, unavoidably, degree uncertainty market might cope large shocks, large price change asset price market may fee back economy. not surprisingly, liquidity management asset manager question liquidity condition market general key theme financial stability board present. but that, seem generally good thing (1) credit risk bear entity form finance generally le characterise leverage; (2) entity leverage (i.e. bank main) le leverage use to. such development lessen system's tendency towards crisis; resilience greater. that said, still work progress progress required. on domestic front, information receive recently suggest australian economy grow respectable pace second half last year. the national account data release month show economy expand 3 per cent 2015, bite good estimate time recent statement monetary policy february. this outcome seem fit together piece information bi central bankers’ speech 5 business survey labour market data, improve noticeably course 2015. so turn year australian economy seem pick up. that's good start point. in case business surveys, good condition seem generally continue early part 2016, though labour market data ambiguous. the fact australia sound credible macroeconomic policy framework, could, needed, respond appropriate significant negative event also good start point. even interest rate already low levels, public debt high was, would, event serious economic downturn, room ease monetary fiscal policy many, indeed most, countries. leave aside potential macroeconomic policy responses, economy's inherent ability adjust display phase mine boom. of course always look way improve flexibility, i think say business workforce much flexible use case. turn financial resilience, australian banks' asset quality generally improve past couple years. like counterpart abroad, post-crisis period bank lift capital resources, strengthen liquidity reduce use short-term wholesale funding. so ability handle either fund market shock economic downturn improve compare situation 2008. at stage see material problem australian financial non-financial entity access capital markets. if anything, net bond issuance australian bank strong recent months, extent bank able take advantage availability extend term wholesale liabilities, improve resilience fund disturbance may eventuate. wholesale fund little expensive was, though marginal fund cost still high average cost fund replaced. on topic loan quality, strengthen lend standard house result action apra asic timely. so often years, tight standard tend come late reinforce downturn begun. these measure occur ahead, far one tell, point cycle measure asset quality start deteriorate. some moderation house price location rise rapidly, direct objective supervisory measures, also, judgement, helpful. in business space, bank system fairly modest direct exposure fall oil commodity prices, lend business involve mine energy account around 2 per cent banks' total lending. more generally, competition lend business increase past couple year business credit growth pick appreciably. overall, expect welcome development time miss element economic growth story capital spend outside mine sector, appear remain weak. one notable trend aggressive expansion foreign bank active australian market. here note caution. if take opportunity leave table local player (or early foreign players) simply conservative, well good. but one duty-bound observe history foreign player expand aggressively upswing retreat quickly difficult time come. it worth remember cycle. conclusion it seem part economic zeitgeist people continually look ‘downside’ risks. it always - i recall lengthy period mindset always see inflation pressure around every corner. that people seem find easy 6 bi central bankers’ speech imagine downside today mark length shadow cast financial crisis, seven year on. for financial regulator policymakers, is, course, duty look possible problems. at present, think several, which, way, downside. some may come pass; probably won't. but virtually impossible say one which. so, repeat, key thing try build resilience economy financial structure that, shock occur, damage contain rather amplified. in respect good bank place world stronger, though process need completed. the big role finance play capital market also, balance, probably good thing, even though yet able ass market perform stress conditions. the local economy improve financial system overall gain resilience, albeit pocket watch. give reasonable track record adapt shocks, grind confidence capacity negotiate whatever lie ahead. bi central bankers’ speech 1 vítor constâncio: capital market union european monetary financial framework keynote speech mr vítor constâncio, vice-president european central bank, chatham house, london, 21 march 2016. * * * lady

finance day paris-dauphine university, paris, 14 march 2016. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure participate first edition house finance day paris-dauphine university. in order “[imagine] finance tomorrow” – quote theme event – essential understand facets, particular able decipher prevail environment. through three main tasks, banque de france play key role as, firstly, implement monetary strategy, member eurosystem alongside european central bank frankfurt; secondly, ensure financial stability, supervise banks, insurance firm and, generally, financial system; and, lastly, provide economic service household smes/vses. today i focus monetary policy conduct framework eurosystem. monetary policy long consider technical even austere subject. but, since 2008, far widely discussed: central bank different country play major role, role largely hail positive, exit crisis. today, however, action address persistence low inflation subject debate. i would first like talk objective, instrument effectiveness. first, question objectives. this question, really cover two questions, generate much think debate. indeed, central bank examine actions, lot modesty often credited: 1. what objective, “mandate”, central bank? 2. what are, regard objective, current challenges? 1) let u start mandate. a) in unite states, federal reserve dual mandate price stability full employment. in euro area, maastricht treaty – approve democratically country, france referendum september 1992– objective clearly set hierarchical order: eurosystem dedicate price stability, primary objective; ensure high level employment sustainable growth secondary price stability objective. this difference often discussed; hindsight, seem important. when ecb fight low inflation, also contribute support activity. and among indicator monitor, output gap- difference actual output economy potential output, still negative france euro area – key element. b) in concrete terms, primary objective – maintain price stability – mean achieve inflation rate below, close to, 2% medium term. most central bank advance economy share medium-term 2% objective, include unite state japan. this ecb’s objective since 2003, propose german former chief economist, otmar issing. it may appear paradoxical price stability zero, good reason this. first, “boskin effect”, name u commission show 1996 price index use measure inflation 2 bi central bankers’ speech tend overstate inflation, underestimate substitution towards product whose price increase le quickly, product innovation. therefore, inflation objective never strictly observe since necessary keep enough leeway ensure economy doesn’t sink deflation event negative shocks. also, low inflation facilitate structural adjustment economy downward nominal rigidity certain prices, particular wages. c) in euro area, however, like advance economies, inflation remain low, despite historically low interest rates: harmonise index consumer price (hicp) indeed return negative territory, stand -0.2% february 2016, underlie inflation, i.e. exclude energy food, 0.7%. doe mean eurosystem long achieve price stability mandate, change objective? i don’t think so. current challenge call question mandate, change way fulfil it. for credibility monetary policy, objective must maintained: 2% target medium-term “anchor”, time much volatility short-termism affect economy. 2) what are, regard objective, challenge central bank facing? today, eurosystem face two main challenges: deflationary pressure one hand, risk unanchoring expectations, other. a) first, certain number factor currently contribute low inflation. primarily, euro area face deflationary pressure associate series economic shocks: firstly, fall oil prices, eur 80 per barrel mid-2014 eur 34 early march 2016, 2.5 time lower, well decline commodity prices; secondly, slowdown growth emerge economy chiefly china; and, lastly, inadequate growth euro area persistently high unemployment, curb wage rise weaken demand price growth. moreover, structural factors, age population, likely exert downward pressure “natural” interest rate, term coin swedish economist knut wicksell century ago. this rate define interest rate consistent full employment factor production. in case, order achieve right balance save investment, market rate must come too. in normal times, central bank cut key rates, pass yield curve. however, order deal financial crisis, ecb like central bank bring key interest rate low levels, around zero. this mean traditional monetary policy tool supplement instruments, know non-standard instruments, order reach price stability objective. i return point later. b) the second challenge, stem first, risk unanchoring expectations, would make hard u achieve 2% target again. indeed, inflation stay low long, economic agent may revise downwards inflation expectations, would create second round effects. low inflation expectation influence economic agents’ price- wage-setting behaviour, turn keep inflation low. it even raise risk deflation, define cumulative process fall prices, include assets, even wage production, world economy experience 1930s japan partially undergo 1990s. such deflationary dynamic play today; inflation target symmetrical. we consider low inflation costly high inflation. and, therefore, risky central bank act late early. since start year, observe market-based measure inflation expectation fallen. nevertheless, late forecast provide ecb last thursday continue point gradual rise inflation come years: 0.1% 2016, 1.3% 2017 1.6% 2018. bi central bankers’ speech 3 ii. this bring second point: effective non-standard measures? 1) since summer 2014, implement series monetary policy measures, dub “non-standard”, complement cut key interest rates, stand 0.00% main refinance operation and-0.40% deposit facility. these measure include: 2) target longer-term refinance operations, conditional provision bank lend real economy. the new series tltros decide launch 10 march - tltro 2 - allow bank borrow highly favourable rates, depend amount new credit provide; 3) purchase private public sector securities, ease monetary financial condition euro area. the eurosystem buy asset-backed securities, cover bond investment grade bond issue euro area sovereigns, agency institutions. on 10 march decide expand programme include corporate bond among eligible assets, increase amount monthly purchase eur 80 billion eur 60 billion previously; 4) indication future path key interest rate – “forward guidance” – order influence agents’ expectations. on 10 march, give follow indications: “key ecb interest rate [will] remain present low level extend period time, well past horizon net asset purchases”, mean extend well beyond march 2017. turn comprehensive package introduced, send two clear messages: a) our decision guide mandate bring inflation back towards target 2% medium term. we firmly set objective, broad range instrument achieve it. in addition negative interest rates, naturally limits, also act bank lend – via credit ease new tltro – market finance - via extend qe asset purchase programme – guarantee shall continue long necessary - via forward guidance. b) our priority promote finance real economy. the goal tltro 2 not, claimed, offset impact negative rate banks. it encourage bank lend corporations, smes household alike; similarly, extend asset purchase programme corporate bond particular benefit large french corporations. in words, secure provision credit business households, protect tension link market volatility. 2) these non-standard measure effective. they translate substantial ease borrow condition euro area companies. since june 2014, cost borrow business fall 80 basis points. without non-standard measures, estimate would low key rate around 100 basis point june 2014 achieve similar effect bank interest rates. this also help stimulate lend real economy: euro area, outstanding loan business go contraction -2.5% june 2014 growth 0.6% january 2016. the impact even mark france, outstanding business lend grow 4.8% year-on-year first month 2016 - high pace growth euro area and, what’s more, low rate interest. convergent estimate ecb eurosystem indicate that, thing equal, measure introduce since june 2014 add 1 percentage point inflation period 2015-2017, similar impact growth. in france, help boost 2015 growth 0.3 percentage point, estimate insee even put 4 bi central bankers’ speech impact slightly high +0.4 pp. that represent 80,000 additional job economy - although structural reform generate last gain country’s growth employment. to conclude estimate effectiveness, imf – regard objective judge relevance economic policy – unequivocal assessment last g20 meet shanghai end february, saying, “the ecb’s asset purchase programme support recovery improve confidence financial condition [and] monetary policy remain accommodative”. 3) what risks? i talk early risk nothing: need take action order bring inflation back towards 2%. that said, also need keep close eye possible negative side-effects monetary policy, notably financial stability. we actively monitor financial cycle, include france task fall haut conseil de stabilité financière (high council financial stability), set 2013: i take part 8th meet finance ministry tomorrow. for time being, sign bubble form main finance markets: whole, development equity market appear line corporate profit forecasts, evolution bond yield also seem consistent outlook inflation growth. nor sign excessive credit growth financial system. nevertheless, remain vigilant aspect current macroeconomic financial environment. in last hcsf communiqué december 2015, example, indicated, subject property market, “the price adjustment residential market since 2012 appear appropriate, whereas commercial real estate price remain high”. we ready, needed, take action macroprudential measures, prevent mitigate systemic risk might arise. monetary policy thus great deal counter weak inflation support economic activity – duty continue steadfast resolve: consistent objective, ready act right instruments, alert possible risks. however, i would also like stress “monetary policy cannot game town”. other economic policy also role play. this precisely member g20 reiterate shanghai 27 february: “monetary policy continue support economic activity ensure price stability, consistent central banks’ mandates, monetary policy alone cannot lead balance growth”. where sufficient margin so, fiscal policy must support demand – currently case france, country europe. moreover, structural reform remain absolutely vital france, encourage creation job business thus bring economy back full potential. our country can’t wait longer; unemployed, young people – – can’t wait longer. at european level, need move finally towards true economic union, addition monetary union embody eurosystem. only optimise governance euro area optimise growth. the current extremely accommodative monetary policy stance create ideal condition carry much-needed reforms. it use instead excuse put off: europe france urgently need make opportunity, right now. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 alberto g musalem: international spillover policy remark mr alberto g musalem, executive vice president integrate policy analysis group federal reserve bank new york, people’s bank china-federal reserve bank new york joint symposium, hangzhou, zhejiang, china, 15 mach 2016. * * * good morning. thank opportunity speak hangzhou important theme international spillovers. by exchange perspective experience forge relationship share understand lead good economic outcomes. i focus mostly interaction international spillover policy framework within across countries. i vantage point domestic economy experience foreign spillovers. i briefly turn consideration u.s. perspective. a always, remark reflect view necessarily federal reserve bank new york, federal open market committee (fomc), federal reserve system.1 international spillover encompass broad topic respect source channels. before narrowly focus monetary source associate channels, seem appropriate first take broad view various sources. foreign spillover emanate monetary, fiscal, regulatory, currency trade policies. spillover also arise endogenous productivity changes, financial stability developments, global financial cycle.2 the mundell-fleming logic remain relevant think policy option open economies. it provide lesson channel transmission, basic tradeoff across objectives, effectiveness policy responses.3 the channel macroeconomic financial transmission among open interdependent economy occur current account balance payments, capital account, both. from vantage point domestic economy, three main channel transmission: exchange rate; external demand; interest rate risk-premia channel. the last broadly define financial condition channel. the intensity transmission spillover depend monetary policy, currency policy real financial openness economy affect external developments. other relevant characteristic include flexibility labor product markets; depth, safety soundness financial system; economy’s position international creditor debtor. the mundell-fleming framework suggest country high degree capital mobility flexible currency favorable position use monetary policy attain internal growth inflation objectives. when foreign interest rate increase financial condition tighten, change relative price bring currency fluctuation help absorb external shocks. the positive expenditure switch effect currency depreciation improve trade balance support demand. it sufficiently large negative investment demand effect high interest rates, internal balance attain monetary policy able pursue domestic inflation growth objectives.4 1 linda goldberg, paolo pesenti, joseph tracy matthew higgins contribute remarks. 2 a global financial cycle refer global co-movement credit bank capital markets, asset prices, term premia, risk premia. 3 fleming (1962) mundell (1963). 4 krugman (1999). the balance sheet effect impart large international debtor position may work achievement improve external balance attainment internal balance. 2 bi central bankers’ speech different policy option available country high degree capital mobility preference currency stability. a country may prefer currency stability effective nominal anchor, concern broad uncertainty associate currency volatility. regardless reason exchange rate available absorb external shocks, country unfavorable position achieve domestic macroeconomic objective use monetary policy. instead, monetary policy aim external adjustment. tight foreign monetary policy financial condition need validate tight domestic monetary policy maintain currency stability. with domestic monetary condition effectively import abroad, may sometimes conflict domestic growth inflation objectives. simply put, currency stability prioritized. these policy consideration summarize well-known international policy trilemma. it say country cannot simultaneously maintain independent monetary policy focus domestic objectives, high degree capital mobility, currency stability. any two regime characteristic chosen, three. while trilemma suggest sharp tradeoffs, additional policy tool soften tradeoffs. fiscal policy one tool serf purpose. when foreign credit condition tighten, expansionary fiscal policy allow country high degree capital mobility, policy preference currency stability, effectively manage towards domestic macroeconomic objective internal balance. in fact, fiscal policy also use rebalance composition demand towards desire mix investment consumption. soft tradeoff imply trilemma suggest empirical evidence interest rate co-movements. for example, ample evidence domestic short-term interest rate become progressively le correlate short-term interest rate large foreign countries, monetary policy autonomous, country move high capital mobility low capital mobility, rigid currency flexible currencies.5 use foreign exchange reserve support currency stability unlikely effective enable country attain domestic growth inflation objectives. if loss foreign reserve sterilized, effect similar domestic monetary tightening, already discussed, might work domestic growth inflation objectives. if reserve loss sterilize underlie cause capital outflow addressed, reserve loss persistent. macroprudential policy provide additional tool add degree freedom help soften tradeoff trilemma. macroprudential policy potentially temper spillover modulate type buildup financial imbalance contribute asian crisis 1997, countless emerge market crisis, global financial crisis 2008 subsequent euro area crisis 2011. progress continue make design macroprudential policy frameworks, definition objectives, develop appropriate instruments, calibration communication. capital flow management view part macroprudential toolkit operate across borders. over last five years, capital flow management receive increase attention, first manage inflow and, recently, manage outflows.6 a consensus emerge capital flow management useful part broad set policy tools. in fact, effectiveness capital flow management may limit appropriately support monetary, fiscal, exchange rate prudential policies, 5 obstfeld, shambaugh taylor (2005), goldberg (2013), klein shambaugh (2015) obstfeld (2015). 6 g20 (2010), imf (2012), farhi werning (2014) imf (2015). bi central bankers’ speech 3 warrant macroeconomic adjustment. also, capital flow management practice transparent, temporary, target seem work best. spillover foreign country confine conventional monetary policies, u.s. sole source transmission. there also evidence unconventional monetary policy ecb boj spill onto u.s. yield curve broad financial conditions.7 this interest three monetary area share characteristic flexible currency capital mobility. i conclude relate comment u.s. perspective. the fed’s statutory mandate, like central banks, domestic. the federal reserve act state feed “promote effectively goal maximum employment, stable prices, moderate long-term interest rates”. within mandate, good reason consider international effect monetary regulatory policies. the u.s. economy economy rest world important feedback effect other, adverse international spillover harm u.s. prosperity. like central banks, federal reserve help promote global prosperity stability, promote growth stability home. the fomc take number step recent year increase transparency improve communications, effectively convey policy intention market participant policymakers. the feed also make considerable progress strengthen safety soundness u.s. financial system, improve regulation supervision bank broad group systemically important institutions. a strong u.s. bank system good

(financial markets) reserve bank australia, fx week australia conference, sydney, 17 march 2016. * * * today, i talk global code conduct foreign exchange market. i reiterate motivation work doing, update process outline way forward. why work go on? a i state previous occasions, foreign exchange (fx) industry suffer lack trust functioning. this lack trust evident participant market, least importantly, public market. the market need move toward favourable desirable location, allow participant much great confidence market function appropriately. a well-functioning foreign exchange market much interest market participants. this clearly include central banks, role market participant also exchange rate important channel monetary policy transmission. in globalise world, foreign exchange market one vital part financial plumbing. the global code aim set global principle good practice foreign exchange market provide common set guidance market, include area degree uncertainty sort practice acceptable, not. this help address lack trust well promote effective function wholesale fx market. to end, one guide principle underpin work code promote robust, fair, liquid, open, transparent market. a diverse set buyer sellers, support resilient infrastructure, able confidently effectively transact competitive price reflect available market information manner conform acceptable standard behaviour. the work develop global code commence may last year, bank international settlement (bis) governor commission work group market committee bi facilitate establishment single global code conduct wholesale fx market come mechanism promote great adherence code.1 there two important point worth highlighting: first, single code whole industry second, global code. it's intend cover wholesale fx industry. this code conduct sell side. it sell side, buy side, non-bank participant platforms; breadth across globe across whole structure industry. the code intend apply aspect wholesale foreign exchange market. in code itself, spell actually mean wholesale fx market. the one noteworthy part fx industry code generally apply retail market, generally govern retail-specific regulation relevant jurisdiction. i chair work, simon potter federal reserve bank new york lead work develop code chris salmon bank england lead adherence work. our work group comprise representative central bank 1 http://www.bis.org/press/p150511.htm. 2 bi central bankers’ speech major fx centres, draw membership market committee comprise head market operation area 15 major currency areas.2 give roles, much interest effective function fx market. again, much global effort reflect global nature foreign exchange market. this work also much public sector-private sector partnership. in regard, ably vigorously support work group market participants, chair david puth, ceo cls. the group contain people around world, include australia, buy side, include corporates asset managers, sell side, along trade platforms, ecns non-bank participants, draw various foreign exchange committee (fxcs) beyond. hence part market involve draft code make sure perspective hear appropriately reflected. at outset decide split topic intend cover code two parts. the first phase material intend put two months' time may. it cover area ethics, information sharing, execution (including mark-up) confirmation settlement. the second phase cover topic governance, risk management compliance, well aspect execution include e-trading platform (including last look), prime brokerage, unique feature fx swap, forward, option transactions. one factor influence choice topic cover first phase assessment issue market look clarity sooner rather later. one example around information sharing, many market participant highlight unsure information convey counterparties market participants. while clear (or least be) disclose detail client's order book counterparty acceptable, market participant note much le clarity around level aggregation, say, necessary order convey market colour appropriately. a result, appear market participant conservative share information, implication effective function market. this notwithstanding guidance provide area global preamble put global foreign exchange committees, include australian foreign exchange committee (afxc), march last year.3 the global code take material global preamble flesh bite more, include example is, appropriate communication, why. similarly, diverse opinion around appropriate behaviour term order handling. while public instance inappropriate behaviour around order handle come light recent years, areas, market seek great guidance principle followed, include different standard may apply depend whether intermediary function principal agent.4 this one area adequately cover pre-existing code conduct various fxcs endorse fx market. it area aim provide sought-after guidance. but write procedure manual order-handling. rather articulate principle need take account. individual firm may take principle reflect procedure manual. our aim 2 http://www.bis.org/about/factmktc/fxwg.htm. 3 available http://www.rba.gov.au/afxc/about-us/pdf/global-preamble.pdf. 4 i use term legal sense sometimes case particular jurisdictions, rather term common market parlance. bi central bankers’ speech 3 articulate principle provide market participant framework think handle stop-loss orders. the emphasis much word ‘think’. the global code provide answer questions, help ask right questions. in similar vein, i repeat point i make number time past. one central aim draft code principles-based rather rules-based. there number reason so, me, important reason prescriptive code is, easy get around. rule easy arbitrage principles. if expressly prohibit explicitly discouraged, must okay seem historical experience. moreover, prescriptive precise code is, le people think doing. if principles-based le prescriptive then, i said, market participant think whether action consistent principle code. so process? last week circulate comment second draft phase one code via various fxcs include australian fxc (and central bank country work group without fxc). this second draft incorporate comment first draft code circulate begin february. the first draft attract 1,400 comments. the comment almost universally constructive supportive whole endeavour. i would like thank take time provide them. in write second draft, market participant group take full account comments. those provide rest assure take heed them. but say that, may see comment directly embody redrafting. this part, reflect diversity view issue code. that said, seek incorporate overall feedback manner best reflect objective code i set above, namely code promote robust, fair, liquid, open, transparent market. the comment second draft gather next week so. we take account produce revise draft early april. there one final round ‘fatal flaw’ comment seek endorsement various fxcs document take global foreign exchange committee meet new york 25 may. for example, australia, look afxc endorsement code next meet early may. follow meet global foreign exchange committee, first phase global code publically released. we already start work draft material phase two code. we continue next year, number round comment market participant fxc process. our intention complete code release follow global foreign exchange committee meet london may 2017. at end process, code effective achieve want achieve, need accept endorse fxcs market participant generally. that said, process really end, foreign exchange market continue evolve, code need evolve it. i say ongoing evolution code might occur due course. adherence code at time draft code, also devote considerable time effort develop adherence mechanism promote incentivise widespread adoption global code market participants. clearly, issue 4 bi central bankers’ speech various exist industry code place number market many years. it evident often ignored, wilfully otherwise. for industry code value affirm appropriate norm behaviour, become effectively adopt marketplace. while adherence single, consistent code good practice widely regard interest market, global code voluntary. a i say earlier, work industry produce voluntary, principles-based code conduct rather set prescriptive regulatory standards. it impose legal regulatory obligation market participants, supplant exist regulatory standard expectations. there already substantial body law regulation apply fx activity many market participants, vary significantly across jurisdictions. this variation, couple diverse nature fx market globally, mean ‘one size fit all’ approach adherence would appropriate. the final framework adherence need strike right balance respect exist diversity across different markets, maintain consistency regard global initiative. in regard, articulate three principle underpin overall approach adherence. • universal: the global code apply wholesale fx market participants, base activity undertake subject compliance applicable regulations. we work hard incorporate perspective type wholesale fx market participant draft code, want widely applicable across market. • proportionate: how wholesale fx market participant adhere, demonstrate adherence, global code proportionate appropriate type participant context local financial markets. • transparent: mode adherence transparent, enable monitor market discipline. it worth stress “proportionate” principle design low bar – design reflect difference type volume market activity certain market participant variation fx market worldwide. the concrete detail adherence mechanism remain work process. we say new york may. at stage, think unlikely single adherence mechanism rather suite mechanisms. conclusion that, i trust, give reasonable overview state play global code. a lot work do get u point. there still lot work done. the work date reflect constructive cooperative effort central bank market participants. all u recognise need restore public's faith foreign exchange market value global code assist process also help improve market function confidence market functions. i expect cooperative relationship continue see process conclusion may next year. bi central bankers’ speech 1 joshua rosenberg: operational risk management federal reserve bank new york remark mr joshua rosenberg , executive vice president chief risk officer federal reserve bank new york, 18th annual oprisk north america 2016 conference, new york city, 15 march 2016. * * * good morning. i would like thank organizer invite speak year’s oprisk north america conference. today, i share perspective operational risk base experience federal reserve bank new york include current role bank’s chief risk officer. before i begin, i want state view i express mine necessarily reflect federal reserve bank new york federal reserve system. a know, operational risk define risk loss result inadequate fail internal processes, people systems, external events. the new york feed face operational risk because, like public private institutions, rely people, processes, system execute objectives, and, way, bank subject external event impact effectiveness people, processes, systems. to give good sense new york feed operational entity, i want touch briefly broad range bank’s operations. most familiar likely bank’s execution market operation implement monetary policy directive federal open market committee financial supervisory activities. a significant bank’s operational profile financial service bank provide u.s. government, financial institution businesses, foreign central bank international

include auction treasury securities, provide correspondent bank custody service foreign central bank international institutions.1 the bank’s risk framework operation imply operational risk, bank approach operational risk management? let back moment, since useful start point answer question begin describe bank’s overall approach manage risk within bank’s risk framework. in particular, risk framework design enable bank understand communicate risk profile key stakeholders, ass risk may change response plan activity change environment, take action ensure risk remain acceptable levels, recover quickly effectively risk events, continuously improve effectiveness efficiency risk management. a part risk framework, bank define risk management role responsibility use three line defense

assignment risk management role clear comprehensive order prevent gaps, 1 https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoints.html. 2 iia position paper: the three line defense effective risk management control, january 2013. 2 bi central bankers’ speech ambiguities, overlap responsibility. more specifically, business area first line defense, independent risk management unit second line defense, internal audit third line defense. in bank, first line defense comprise business area execute support execution bank’s mission. these first line unit responsible operational activity result risk well control result risks. the first line “owns” risk sense accountable positive negative outcome empower manage distribution outcomes. at core, three line model recognize strong incentive effective risk management create align accountability responsibility. in words, perspective first line, “skin game,” risk management view someone else’s problem. in addition, put first line charge risk management

34) lose 5 percent household income real terms. that course substantial big impact personal plan many young people. but magnitude different loss suffer generations, although course young asset save fall back tough economic times. even worry sharp increase youth unemployment europe. be worry position young adult europe increasingly urgent issue? youth unemployment tragedy prevent people play full meaningful part society. if every second young person work – still case country europe – seriously harm economy, people will work cannot work skill developed. and threaten social harmony. unemployment lead long run increase social problem ill-health. be worry future consumption level young adults, group – especially “scarred” global recession – move middle life? consumption within society determine partly wealth distribution, even important young generation participate labour market fair way. in many country labour market set protect old “insiders” – people permanent, high pay contract shield strong labour laws. the side effect young people stick lower-paid, temporary contract get fire first crisis times. that also mean employer reluctant invest young people, income generation stay low lifetime. what might force work – demographic / change workplace / fiscal-monetary policy – mean young adult appear receive little reward two half decade average economic growth? nobody stay young forever. the crucial question whether person participate fully economy life-time – get good education, find job, buy home family. income wealth follow. what make worry increase inequality might prevent people that. this issue society need look carefully. the ecb’s role maintain price stability, prevent unfair redistribution. for example, research show euro area low inflation result redistribution younger, indebted household old household typically net creditors. current retiree wealthy ever. what opportunity bring europe? in age society, fact retiree get wealthy isn’t necessarily abnormal – old people need accumulate wealth finance live longer. a spend wealth retirement, pass back young generations. so wealth creation isn’t zero sum game. what matter young people, move life, opportunity build wealth, too. do think young adult today good standard live pensioner today come retire? 2 bi central bankers’ speech that’s common choice. our standard live depend strength economy. we need open, flexible, innovative business-friendly society. much focus put central bank raise growth, contribute price stability stable financial system. but long run real growth drive economy produce. that much ideas, technology, flexibility, motivation, skills. it elect government set growth-friendly environment. you often talk need “structural reform” employment. what mean this? there lot form take. just give one example, kurzarbeit scheme germany allow employer adjust work time crisis without fire people. but there’s one-size-fits-all model. every society challenge preferences. the idea generally create fair flexible labour market company fear take staff need specific group people structurally disadvantage time employer need cut wage bills. what central banks/governments ease/resolve issues? everyone vital interest prosper economy. so bring high level youth unemployment priority everyone. a i said, best contribution central bank make live mandates. we encourage elect government take necessary step create job make society fairer. over longer-term, far important thing young people invest education skills. skill person’s passport life, fast-changing digital economy, premium pay skill likely rise. equip people tomorrow’s world best way raise income reduce inequality. bi central bankers’ speech 1 andrew bailey: bank capital – debate speech mr andrew bailey, deputy governor prudential regulation chief executive officer prudential regulation authority bank england, barclays’ 2016 financial conference, london, 9 march 2016. * * * bank capital news recently, least part news – thing go on. there probably two reason “news”: first, enter another phase highly uncertain condition financial markets, strong impact market value banks; second, authority push implement post-crisis reform capital standards, reach point important build block put place. today, i go reflect draw conclusion i would call big picture, namely sort bank system seek create, doing, not. i draw detail, shortage that, talk detail bank capital, find plenty places. another objective tackle urban myth today. let start important one, so-called “liquidity narrative1” set order knock down, attribute regulators, view financial crisis (indeed crisis generally) cause lack liquidity rather solvency bank system, blind people, notably regulators, real cause problem, namely solvency capital. whatever happen past, certainly true today. loss liquidity much symptom cause crises, symptom observed, action take minimise effects, i doubt cause usually either actual solvency problem critically rise expectation problem future. if spend time pra, would quickly learn capital front centre supervisors. why so? bank different financial firm provide deposit contract customers. a deposit particular form debt contract. for u essential feature deposit contract simple – put money (our asset) deposit bank, expect back, whatever rate return agreed, expect access line term contract. let’s contrast non-deposit debt (bonds) equity contracts. if invest either these, promise investment back, though course expect make positive return. such investor ordinarily expect full return investment, assured. investment debt equity course manage collective basis, asset management. you may remember woody allen quote stockbroker someone “who invest money it’s gone”. cruel i know, illustrate difference deposits, form debt equity. a distinguish feature bank provide deposit contracts, far liability take form value certain contracts. this alone make capital solvency critical banks. in contrast, asset managers, contract promise value certainty. two particular condition need meet view make asset management effective robust wide economic conditions. first, lack clarity nature asset hold management. second, illusion give investor 1 anat admati martin hellwig: “the banker new clothes: what’s wrong bank it”. p38–40 2 bi central bankers’ speech liquidity assets. it follow therefore capital solvency matter much bank supervision, market liquidity condition matter asset management supervision. so bank capital matter lot. the next question, rather obviously, much bank liability balance sheet? this subject lively recent comment. most comment focus core issue much capital overall loss absorbency bank part balance sheet liability protect value certainty deposits. this reasonable debate monopoly wisdom subject. i however discount heavily commentator seamlessly switch attack grind supervisor choke lend require much capital (the so-called time “capital taliban” argument) argue fall set standard low. the main argument late whether recent proposal capital buff large bank operate uk market diverge previous post-crisis commitment level capital bank maintain go concern, overall level loss absorbency available amongst liability bank enable resolution occur needed. to put context, capital standard develop base last quarter century bank performance – include financial crisis – probability bank failure period would extremely low. in aggregate term diverged, anything recent proposal put level little high suggested, instance, independent commission banking, enough make big point it. it true within aggregate introduce new element form incentive protect stability financial system. we follow wherever possible principle large complex bank high capital buff pose great risk stability financial system. consistent principle, create tiered system increase capital requirement leave topmost tier unpopulated. this empty tier product craven fear put bank there, rather create disincentive complexity. so, don’t see element design contradict goal. we could argue merit small change capital standard, view worthwhile exercise. what notable divide view strengthen banks’ loss absorbency alternative view answer lie radical restructure bank system require bank loss absorbency would substantial part (say 20% 30%) total balance sheet2. it wrong view conflate argument small difference capital buff one different financial system. i want spend minute alternative view, would mean, advocated. to clear, i comment supporter, rather try cast light big issue. the essence argument i see assert supporter of, let’s call “big equity” school, cannot value large bank adequately complex opaque, cannot supervise effectively cannot resolve them, must resort approach require sizeable shift balance fund away value certain deposit contract towards loss absorb equity type contracts. this basis large buff absorb loss flow inadequate valuation supervision, without recourse resolution. for me, beg question appeal proposition state public: “will please provide equity fund something can’t value properly oversee”. put like that, idea seem appealing. i cannot see would desire provide equity fund bank term rather invest company either directly collective asset 2 to clear, 20–30% total balance sheet 20–30% risk weight assets, latter considerably small number. bi central bankers’ speech 3 scheme. i recognise propose equity fund build retain dividends, accumulate say 20% bank’s balance sheet mean require i think implausibly long transition period. in fact, base current position major uk banks, include average dividend payment rate, transition period 20% equity would around 90 years. that’s little bite long 17 year transition period solvency ii. i therefore see “big equity” sustainable solution sort proposal practical. a logical alternative today’s approach narrow bank model3. again, clear, i don’t support approach, great logic “big” equity approach create deposit fund bank hold highly liquid low risk government bonds. loan would make financial intermediaries. i think ring fence propose independent commission bank good way achieve sensible safe separation function within bank cause great disruption overall financial system. interestingly, argument narrow bank “big” equity school narrow bank export risk financial system so-called shadow banks, thereby make danger system4. again, amount argument unmanageable risk keep bank must therefore attract substantial equity funding. it’s winner i’m afraid. this bring right back argument today, namely strengthen loss absorbency, risk management, governance, supervision resolvability bank have. i accept proposition abandon hope understand risk banks. likewise, i agree large bank unsupervisable ungovernable. and, i concur view large bank never resolved, thus leave big fail always us, answer either require lot equity fund hope shadow bank system cause risk threaten whole system. let finish focus resolution supervision. we go crisis without properly function bank resolution regime many country include uk, consequence response combination use public money improvisation create resolution possible. but well way properly function resolution regime place. so, argument ineffective? this crucial piece story, fundamental principle big equity school think reject resolution usable solution. the argument seem often come doubt authority enact resolution5. true, past much hard enact resolution absence mean it, future. it also true resolution necessarily involve change property right investor big thing. will authority nerve? my view must, alternative much worse. we make huge stride resolution technical matter. last year’s agreement tlac g20 landmark. but alongside vast amount work get grip take resolve major bank. if involve work, i am, see lack commitment progress. the remain challenge whether authority nerve follow carry resolution. this charge come opponents, namely “bottled”. i don’t see likely issue, resolution credible route take, be, would authority want put cost somewhere else? 3 john kay “should ‘narrow banking’?” the future finance, lse report, 2010 4 anat admati martin hellwig: “the banker new clothes: what’s wrong bank it”. p271 5 anat admati martin hellwig: “the banker new clothes: what’s wrong bank it”. p74–78 4 bi central bankers’ speech now supervision whether function effectively. make mistake, many country supervision fail badly run-up crisis. prudential supervision bank understand risk firm take, effectiveness control risk management, use framework rule regulation create right incentive control risk appropriately, necessary intervene directly require action take would otherwise lead firm potentially unsafe unusual position. there nothing easy activity, lesson pre-crisis crisis period demonstrate danger encourage broad attitude act discourage work supervision favour light touch approach risk system build praise contributor stability prosperity, crash comes. supervision continuous activity need benefit constant public attitude towards it, turn supervisor need accountable explain do. we make big stride forward front recent years. when talk banks, solvency capital heart effective prudential supervision. the capital regime put place strong term quantity quality capital fund banks, also incentive embed regime. to end, i don’t believe ignore risk banks, consequence crystallises. this help explain exercise judgement important part supervision banks. therefore create system rules, supervise bank scope freedom apply rule way create right incentive bank maintain safety soundness, guard time something go wrong must confident resolution regime work. i simply believe alternative approach sufficiently credible. bi central bankers’ speech 1 turalay kenç: the turkish economic outlook monetary policy – challenge policy response remark mr turalay kenç, deputy governor central bank republic turkey, eu ambassador meeting, ankara, 28 january 2016. * * * i would like start thank his excellency ambassador cornelis van rij opportunity share distinguish audience view turkish economy, challenge stem volatile external environment, policy approach implement cope challenges. the turkish economy show relatively robust performance face major external internal shocks. gdp growth estimate around 4 percent 2015 expect gradual strengthen economic activity 2016 2017. the rise gdp growth rate observe 2015 mostly attribute strong private consumption. private investment record moderate recovery. the challenge external condition especially geopolitical event region adversely affect exports. however, economic recovery eu member state enable turkey largely compensate loss export market turkey increase export eu country 10 percent euro term 2015. this outcome also highlight turkish exporters’ resiliency adopt adverse economic conditions. of course, probably significant development last year sharp decline oil prices. turkey, energy import country benefit low oil price many dimensions. the current account deficit fell $52 billion june 2014 $35 billion november 2015 12 month roll terms. this sharp improvement current account balance also greatly help prudent macro-economic police include monetary, macro-prudential fiscal policies. tight monetary policy, well-targeted macro-prudential measure strong fiscal balance contribute low level domestic demand stabilize loan growth reduce risk take behavior. go forward, current level oil price depress producer price part world due weak economic activity expect lead improvement external balances. therefore, highly likely turkey record current account deficit 4 percent gross domestic product 2016, represent major achievement satisfy norm european union’s macroeconomic imbalance procedure. unlike positive development economy, inflation increase outlook worsen 2015 reflect pass-through tl depreciation, elevate food inflation, markedly increase minimum wages. these factor together deterioration inflation expectation lead mpc revise inflation forecast 2016 2017 7.5 percent 6 percent respectively postpone project realization year 5% target 2018. go ahead, see three potential development would improve inflation outlook great deal. first, late improvement external balance together already strong fiscal balance likely boost effectiveness monetary policy. the ongoing tight monetary policy stance likely lead low inflation otherwise. second, come year implementation structural reform identify 10th development plan aim address structural cause inflation hence expect support disinflation process. finally, food committee (the food agricultural product market monitor evaluation committee) found december 2014 objective identify policy alleviate contribution structural cyclical factor elevate food inflation. of course, credibility monetary policy key achieve price stability. therefore, let devote final part talk explain policy strategy cope current challenges. 2 bi central bankers’ speech like emerge market economy (emes) turkey also face tighten external financial condition since may 2013. the normalization u monetary policy, diverge monetary policy advance economies, uncertainty commodity price risk china’s economic hard-landing create volatile global financial market widen spread emes. the central bank turkey introduce several mutually complementary policy announce “road map” document back august 2015 outline monetary policy, foreign currency liquidity financial stability relate measures. the aim cbrt’s road map improve resiliency economy external shock (i) maturity lengthen – encourage bank shift non-core liability short-term long-term; (ii) provide incentive bank borrow lend directly central bank time foreign player reluctant engage bank turkey due heighten volatility global markets; (iii) bolster safety-nets – make sure bank sector access adequate foreign exchange liquidity time market stress; (iv) support financial stability – provide incentive bank improve loan deposit ratios; (v) simplify monetary policy framework improve communication monetary policy stance. all interest rate corridor simplification step roadmap already take focus firmly fine-tune parameters. overall, measure ease policy tradeoff pose excessive volatility cross border flows, enable interest rate policy concentrate primary objective price stability. so far financial market performance turkey suggest measure undertake since august 2015 help turkey outperform many peer em countries. of course, way, turkey also enjoy benefit low oil price relatively many emes reduce political uncertainty general election result november 2015. the bank sector maintain strong sound position bank turkey well-capitalized high quality highly liquid asset continue offer solid rate return capital. a result bank sector still provide reasonable loan growth economy despite heighten uncertainty global markets. to conclude give ongoing challenge external condition essential continue implement tight flexible monetary policy order low inflation volatile environment. meanwhile, take liquidity stabilize measure foreign currency market ensure stability financial system key alleviate policy tradeoffs. last, least, maintain fiscal discipline; adhere strictly announce structural reform agenda order lift potential growth accordance country’s need remain key stability. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: ecb press conference – introductory

euro area real gdp growth confirm 0.3%, quarter quarter, fourth quarter 2015, support domestic demand, dampen negative contribution net exports. the recent survey data point weak expect growth momentum begin year. look ahead, expect economic recovery proceed moderate pace. domestic demand support monetary policy measure favourable impact financial conditions, well continue employment gain benefit past structural reforms. moreover, low price oil provide additional support households’ real disposable income private consumption, well corporate profitability investment. in addition, fiscal stance euro area slightly expansionary, partly reflect measure support refugees. however, economic recovery euro area continue dampen subdue growth prospect emerge markets, volatile financial markets, necessary balance sheet adjustment number sector sluggish pace implementation structural reforms. this outlook broadly reflect march 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projection euro area, foresee annual real gdp increase 1.4% 2016, 1.7% 2017 1.8% 2018. compare december 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, outlook real gdp growth revise slightly down, mainly reflect weaken growth prospect global economy. the risk euro area growth outlook remain tilt downside. they relate particular heighten uncertainty regard development global economy, well broad geopolitical risks. accord eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual hicp inflation –0.2% february 2016, compare 0.3% january. all main hicp component contribute decline. look ahead, basis current future price energy, inflation rate expect remain negative level come month pick late 2016. thereafter, support monetary policy measure expect economic recovery, inflation rate recover further. the govern council closely monitor price-setting behaviour wage development euro area, pay particular attention ensure current low inflation environment become entrench second-round effect wage price-setting. this broad pattern also reflect march 2016 ecb staff macroeconomic projection euro area, foresee annual hicp inflation 0.1% 2016, 1.3% 2017 1.6% 2018. in comparison december 2015 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections,

potential weaknesses. place foreground importance kopaonik business forum mission, gather u leverage wish contribute adoption best solutions, i believe right occasion compare year ago stand today. first, i would like highlight important sustainable growth, also point mr vlahović – fact switch different growth model. and maybe i could finish speech illustration change. a 2013 export grow much

also reduction serbia’s risk premium. this clear way recovery lend activity expect growth economic activity. we aware cannot change external circumstances. geopolitical tensions, volatile movement global commodity financial markets, unpredictable capital flows, weak prospect global recovery illustrate existence uncertainties. our joint strategic response must come determination steadfastly complete easy reform undertaken. this undoubtedly accelerate economic growth reduce serbia’s exposure external challenges. serbia’s improve growth prospect confirm world-known rat agencies, international financial institutions, important, behaviour domestic foreign investors. in last year, investment give strong positive contribution achieve economic recovery. in financial terms, inflow fdis give additional contribution, besides high disposable income make available low cost borrow low price energy products. what i would like underscore rise newly approve investment loans. in 2015, net fdi inflow serbia rise 45.6% 2014 come eur 1.8 bln, high level last four years. consequently, 2015 serbia manage use net fdi inflow fully cover current account deficit equal eur 1.6 billion. all

emerge market policy volatile global environment – case turkey remark mr turalay kenç, deputy governor central bank republic turkey, national asset-liability management europe symposium, london, 3 march 2016. * * * accompany chart find end speech. good morning, lady gentlemen. i would like thank central bank publication honor invite deliver keynote address european meet national asset-liability management. i delight back. the first time i back 2011 istanbul. in remark today, i focus policy emerge market central bank volatile global environment particular focus turkey. i begin overview

finish talk central bank turkey’s roadmap policy action global monetary policy normalization. heighten global financial market volatility the volatile global environment mostly likely stem gradually worsen global economic financial problem increasingly interconnect world production, finance communication technology channels. the former essentially relate growth, stock balance policy uncertainty problems. the latter underscore high degree external shocks’ transmission across globe. after almost decade since global financial crisis (gfc) erupted, long await strong global economic recovery realize spite unprecedented accommodative monetary policy large part world (figure 1). in fact, growth slow many emes modest recovery advance economy (aes) recent low price depress commodity exporters. after strong performance great recession emes face synchronous protract deceleration growth rate owe weaken external domestic factors. some commodity export emes even suffer economic recession. china grapple appropriate policy action uncertainty associate ongoing transformation export – investment lead growth model domestic consumption – service sector drive economy.1 furthermore, potential growth across world decline due global slowdown productivity growth, persistently weak investment, age population weaken global trade (figures 2–3).2 rise inequality, hand, exacerbate recovery long-term growth problems. to end, global policy coordination way forward. the g20’s framework strong, sustainable, balance inclusive growth strong commitment structural reform well aggregate

the policy uncertainty associate question appropriate mix demand supply side policies, extent type suitable monetary policy effectiveness macro-prudential policy source policy uncertainty. likewise, china acute policy uncertainty problem mention above. reason behind heighten policy uncertainty policy paralysis unconventional policy monetary quantitative ease policy negative nominal policy rate

wave trigger sudden stop capital inflows. the em bank intermediate flows, result, cause severe financial crisis several emes mexico turkey 1994, east asian country mid-1997 russia 1998. the insufficient volume external safety net well underdevelop nature financial market emes make financial crisis unavoidable. in addition, inability implement countercyclical policy make emes suffer large damage effect financial crisis real economy otherwise. it noteworthy despite lack capacity avoid financial crises, emes mostly manage recover swiftly acute past financial crisis succeed severe economic recessions. likewise, emes survive – century event – gfc 2008 spite profound impact financial system aes subsequent “balance sheet recessions”. emes largely escape great recession though brief economic recessions. with lesson learn previous episode improvement year emes are, average, good position withstand financial turbulences, near future, past. first all, embark extensive structural reform aim overhaul financial regulatory supervisory systems, strengthen public finance fiscal discipline, grant central bank independence, adopt flexible exchange rate systems. these reform enable implement prudent countercyclical policy well. emes solidify post crisis reform accumulate adequate foreign exchange reserve alternative imf provide financing, carry strong conditionality, well deepen broaden domestic financial markets. a result, stock flow balances, policy frameworks, level economic confidence market development emes strengthen substantially radically. stock ad flow balance since emes mostly suffer sovereign debt crises, fiscal discipline cornerstone first generation structural reforms. prudent fiscal policy play key role maintain low budget deficit hence low debt level extent budget deliver primary surplus (figure 4). low interest rate imply diminish finance requirement government sector reinforce fiscal positions. a consequence, share government bond emerge debt market decline create room private sector debt market grow. private debt level emerge market also stay moderate level average (figure 4). decline public debt also imply low base external debt. in addition development, em government consciously borrow le foreign currency wake early financial crises. combine effect have, average, reduce government own external debt gdp

macroeconomic financial policy improve macroeconomic policy framework key factor behind much low inflation outcome. among grant independence many em central bank significant progress improve institutional quality em institutions. their success low inflation year result desirable gain monetary policy credibility. the adoption inflation target framework provide beneficial nominal anchor enhance policy credibility. to extent prudent policy framework succeed achieve target key dominances, especially fiscal area, ease thereby effectiveness monetary policy increase significantly. one chief cause gfc existence global external imbalances. the g20 lead policy coordination reduce imbalance certain degree. in process, emes suffer decline surplus level others succeed improvements. how resilient emes global financial conditions? in section i ass emes’ resilience external shock discuss way extent external shock transmit domestic economy emerge markets. the first transmission way external shock trade channel. in recent decade emes increase share global export record strong growth inter-regional intra-regional trade among emerge markets. a result, emes currently make around one-fifth world’s total trade. in addition, diversify production exports. although increase trade openness emes magnify potential impact external shock economies, also positive development strengthen product regional diversity provide degree mitigation. similar argument make second transmission channel, namely fund channel: increase external liability well diversify source together significantly lengthen maturities. but negative development worth mention capital flow mostly drive unconventional 7 hausmann, ricardo ugo panizza (2013), on determinant original sin: an empirical investigation,

improvement emes likely constrain deterioration business consumer expectations. this also crucial development lesson learn past financial turmoil crisis reveal distinguish feature emerge market economy significant adverse effect real economy expectation channel. among many advance emes, rich policy framework play important role improve economic agents’ confidence emes. in addition, emes ability policy conduct accumulate policy space make significant contribution solidify gain confidence. it worth note addition conventional macroeconomic policy emes also extensively use macro- micro-prudential policies, serve buff shock (figure 8). since em financial crisis emes continue use number macro-prudential measure conventional policies, rate hike manage aggregate demand, realize ineffective and/or insufficient. such macro-prudential tool maintain low level leverage also accumulate buff serve policy space case economic downturn. additionally, macro-prudential policy help monetary authority implement monetary policy exclusively achieve price stability. finally, emes learn macro-prudential policy appropriate limit repair maturity currency mismatch problems. in addition macro-prudential policy, emes implement rigorously micro-prudential policy rigorously order make financial firms, especially banks, resilient safe financial stresses. the macro micro prudential policy emes previous decade succeed low level leverage, financial sectors, also nonfinancial household sectors. this, turn, low level maturity currency mismatches. this give rise high capital adequacy ratio low non-performing loan ration bank sector many emes. moreover, relative term fiscal position emes strengthen aes worsen aftermath gfc due sizeable fiscal stimulus policies. keep systemically important sector free solvency risk help emes gain business confidence (figure 9). low deficit debt level imply ample policy space emes case economic downturn. creditworthiness together policy space em fiscal front contain upward pressure interest rate keep effectiveness policy intact. it fair say look strong enough render adverse effect external financial shock manageable.8 policy action emes however, current unconventional monetary policy aes form low even negative nominal policy rate well quantitative ease unintended consequence financial sector reform across world pose new challenge emes. until recently, good growth prospect low level leveraging, emes attract capital inflow nonfinancial corporates lion shares. the normalization global monetary policy reverse course capital flow lead sizable depreciation em currency dollar. this create inflationary pressure due pass-through impact impair balance sheet due tighten global financial condition worsen growth prospects. furthermore, sharp fall oil price exacerbate deterioration economic outlook commodity export countries. go forward, normalization u monetary policy, diverge monetary policy aes, uncertainty commodity price 8 kenç, turalay, fatma pınar erdem i̇brahim ünalmış (2016), resilience emerge market economy global financial conditions, central bank review, forthcoming. 6 bi central bankers’ speech risk china’s economic hard-landing likely contribute volatile global financial market widen spread emes. large asset purchase program major central bank depress global bond market decrease long-term yield well short-term yield negative nominal policy rate destabilize bond market general financial markets. heighten volatility global financial market (figures 10–11) associate presence low even negative rate rather underlie macroeconomic external imbalances. in circumstances, change interest rate differential across country likely create great impact otherwise. if interest rate change take place large significant economy world, impact expectedly magnify further. the fed’s normalization interest rate demonstrate impact global economy financial market indeed large, give rise significant capital outflow emes, large adjustment volatility exchange rate well widen em spread interest rates. the adverse effect fed’s interest rate normalization average large occur previous two financial turmoil episode namely eurozone sovereign debt crisis u taper tantrum. moreover, disparity effect country large too. the plummet commodity price well factor lead outcome commodity importer suffer low commodity revenue tighten global financial conditions. financial market also differentiate emes policy framework prudent policies. those rich good policy framework prudent policy withstand recent global financial turmoil good others. commodity-exporting commodity-importing emes different monetary policy options. while commodity exporter limit monetary policy space, commodity importer room counteract. in former group, inflation increase balance sheet weaken due currency depreciation. in latter group, countries, inflation decrease central bank cut policy rate thank low oil prices. however, several oil import countries, inflation near target bands. for central bank countries, tighten monetary policy may priority credibility central bank. in oil export country growth weaken inflation go currency depreciation, bank high foreign currency vulnerability heavy reliance short-term debt need close monitor tight prudential requirements. moreover, due different internal (growth inflation) external condition (balance payment strength), monetary policy position also diverged. economy current account deficit face difficulty balance internal pressure above-target inflation slowdown growth reduce global capital inflows. these country come term limitation countercyclical monetary policy support adversely affect domestic demand tighten global financial conditions. on hand interest rate country emerge eastern european country rate historically low level order avoid disinflation import eurozone. emes high gdp growth, strong external current account positions, low inflation, liquid financial market manage mitigate market volatility. likewise, country resilient financial sector limit adverse effect volatility. a result, 19 emes, 9 em central bank decrease policy rate since taper tantrum, 8 increase 2 change. overall, policy rate increase 1070 bps. along ease cycle aes central bank ample global liquidity, capital flow emes increase encourage public private leverage fuel credit growth countries. in response impact increase liquidity, emes implement macro-prudential policies. macro prudential policy emes even important due divergent monetary policy aes. bi central bankers’ speech 7 the central bank turkey’s roadmap policy action global monetary policy normalization the turkish economy show relatively robust performance face major external internal shocks. gdp growth estimate around 4 percent 2015 expect gradual strengthen economic activity 2016 2017 (figure 12). the rise gdp growth rate observe 2015 mostly attribute strong private consumption. private investment record moderate recovery. the challenge external condition especially geopolitical event region adversely affect exports. however, economic recovery eu member state enable turkey largely compensate loss export market turkey increase export eu country 10 percent euro term 2015. this outcome also highlight turkish exporters’ resiliency adopt adverse economic conditions. of course, probably significant development last year sharp decline oil prices. turkey, energy import country, benefit low oil price many dimensions. the current account deficit fell $52 billion june 2014 $35 billion november 2015 12 month cumulative terms. this sharp improvement current account balance also greatly help prudent macro-economic police include monetary, macro-prudential fiscal policies. tight monetary policy (figure 13), well-targeted macro-prudential measure (figure 14) strong fiscal balance contribute low level domestic demand stabilize loan growth reduce risk take behavior. go forward, current low level oil price depress producer price part world due weak economic activity expect lead improvement external balances. therefore, highly likely turkey record current account deficit 4 percent gross domestic product 2016, represent major achievement satisfy norm european union’s macroeconomic imbalance procedure (figure 15). unlike positive development economy, inflation increase outlook worsen 2015 reflect pass-through tl depreciation, elevate food inflation, markedly increase minimum wages. these factor together deterioration inflation expectation lead mpc revise inflation forecast 2016 2017 7.5 percent 6 percent respectively postpone project realization year 5 percent target 2018 (figure 16). go ahead, i see three potential developments, would improve inflation outlook great deal. first, late improvement external balance together already strong fiscal balance likely boost effectiveness monetary policy. the ongoing tight monetary policy stance likely lead low inflation otherwise. second, come year implementation structural reform identify 10th development plan aim address structural cause inflation hence expect support disinflation process. finally, food committee (the food agricultural product market monitor evaluation committee) found december 2014 objective identify policy alleviate contribution structural cyclical factor elevate food inflation. of course, credibility monetary policy key achieve price stability. therefore, let devote final part talk explain policy strategy cope current challenges. like emes turkey also face tighten external financial condition since may 2013 accordingly introduce several mutually complementary policy announce “road map” document back august 2015 outline monetary policy, foreign currency liquidity financial stability relate measures. the aim cbrt’s road map improve resiliency economy external shock (i) maturity lengthen – encourage bank shift non-core liability short-term long-term (figure 17); (ii) provide incentive bank borrow lend 8 bi central bankers’ speech directly central bank time foreign player reluctant engage bank turkey due heighten volatility global markets; (iii) bolster safety-nets – make sure bank sector access adequate foreign exchange liquidity time market stress; (iv) support financial stability – provide incentive bank improve loan deposit ratios; (v) simplify monetary policy framework improve communication monetary policy stance. all interest rate corridor simplification step roadmap already take focus firmly fine-tune parameters. overall, measure ease policy tradeoff pose excessive volatility cross border flows, enable interest rate policy concentrate primary objective price stability. so far financial market performance turkey suggest measure undertake since august 2015 help turkey outperform many peer emes. of course, way, turkey also enjoy benefit low oil price relatively many emes reduce political uncertainty general election result november 2015. the bank sector maintain strong sound position bank turkey well-capitalized high quality highly liquid asset continue offer solid rate return capital. a result bank sector still provide reasonable loan growth economy despite heighten uncertainty global markets. to conclude give ongoing challenge external condition essential continue implement tight flexible monetary policy order low inflation volatile environment. meanwhile, take liquidity stabilize measure foreign currency market ensure stability financial system key alleviate policy tradeoffs. last, least, maintain fiscal discipline; adhere strictly announce structural reform agenda order lift potential growth accordance country’s need remain key stability. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 9 figure 1: ongoing weak

zimbabwe, i happily marry 50 years. but story i tell today. rather, i want talk field, macroeconomics, lesson learn course last 55 year – i say 55 years, 1961, end school years, advice friend, i read keynes’s general theory first time. do i understand it? certainly not. wa i captivate it? certainly, though “captured” appropriate word “captivated.” doe remain relevant? certainly. just week ago i take bookshelf read part chapter 23, “notes mercantilism, usury laws, stamp money theory under-consumption.” today chapter would head “protectionism, zero low bound, secular stagnation,” importance usury law diminish since 1936. there old joke field – one one-handed economist, one “assume opener,” one ends, “if i you, i wouldn’t start here.” rather it’s one ph.d. economist return university class’s 50th reunion. he ask see recent ph.d. general exam. after bring him. he read carefully, look perplexed, says, “but exactly exam i write 50 year ago.” “ah yes,” say professor. “it same, answer different.” be really case? not really, though true extent realm policy. to discus question whether answer question deal macroeconomic policy problem change markedly past half-century so, i start briefly sketch structure basic macro model. the build block model similar use many macro models, include frb/us, feed staff’s large-scale model, variety dsge (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model use feed central bank academic researchers. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the structure model start standard textbook equation aggregate demand domestically produce goods, namely:1 1. ; 2. next wage-price block, base wage price phillips curve. okun’s law include make transition output employment; 3. monetary policy describe money supply interest rate rule; 4. the credit market financial intermediation build link policy interest rate rate return on, and/or demand supply function for, assets; 5. the balance payment exchange rate enter balance payment identity, namely current account surplus must equal capital account deficit, correct official intervention; 6. dynamic stocks: there dynamic equation capital stock, stock government debt, external debt. when i undergraduate london school economics (lse) 1962 1965, learn is-lm model, combine aggregate demand equation (1) money market equilibrium condition set (3). that basic understand keynesian model crystallize john hicks, franco modigliani, others, easy add detail demand function private-sector consumption, c; investment, i; government spending, g; net exports. the keynesian emphasis aggregate demand determinant one basic innovation keynesian revolution, one make far easy understand explain factor determine output employment. continue list, price wage dynamics, phillips curve flatten somewhat since 1950s 1960s.2 further, role expectation inflation phillips curve develop far beyond understand a.w. phillips – new zealander, lse faculty member, statistician former engineer – discover late become phillips curve. the difference short- long-run phillips curves, staple textbooks, develop milton friedman edmund phelps, effect make expectation rational model consistent emphasize robert lucas, whose island model provide imperfect information reason nonvertical short-run phillips curve. in okun’s law, okun coefficient – coefficient specify much change unemployment rate affect output – appear decline time. so trend rate productivity growth, critical determinant future level per caput income. in (3), monetary equilibrium condition, monetary policy decision typically represent money stock lse perhaps also massachusetts institute technology (mit) keynesian revolution (after all, “l” represent liquidity preference function “m” supply money); money supply rule replace interest-rate set rule, instance reaction function form, calculate “optimal” policy base loss function. the development flexible inflation-targeting approach monetary policy one major achievement modern macroeconomics. flexible inflation target allow flexibility speed monetary authority plan return target inflation rate, thereby close dual mandate law assign fed. 1 a full description equation contain appendix. 2 see blanchard (2016). bi central bankers’ speech 3 a great deal progress make develop credit financial intermediation block. a early 1960s, jam tobin, milton friedman, karl brunner alan meltzer write model fully explicate financial sectors, base demand function asset money. late demand function often replace price equation derive capital asset price model. researcher feed bold enough add estimate term risk premium determination return assets.3 they concluded, inter alia, argument use make easy would measure expect inflation government would introduce inflation-indexed bond fail take account return bond affect liquidity risk premiums. this mean one major benefit expect introduction inflation-indexed bond (treasury inflation-protected securities, generally call tips), namely would provide quick reliable measure inflation expectations, bear out, still struggle get reasonable estimate expect inflation. a students, include nx, net exports, aggregate demand equation, generally solve exchange rate, possibly exchange rate typically fixed. later, 1976, rudi dornbusch inaugurate modern international macroeconomics – i’m quote speech ken rogoff – famous overshoot model.4 a globalization good asset market intensify next 40 years, international aspect trade good asset occupy increasingly important role economy virtually countries, least unite states, macroeconomics. at lse, take course british economy frank paish, whose lecture consist series charts, accompany narrative professor. he make strong impression lecture 1963, said, “you see, (the balance payment deficit) go go down, clear move toward balance payment crisis 1964.” i wait i watched, crisis appear schedule, predicted. but paish also warn u forecast difficult, give u advice “never look back forecast – may lose nerve.” i pas wisdom need it. i remember also excitement tell friend senior class existence econometric model entire economy. it wonderful moment. i understand economic policy would easy: all necessary fee data model work level set policy parameters. unfortunately, hasn’t work way. on use econometric models, i think often something paul samuelson said: “i’d rather bob solow’s view prediction model. but i’d rather solow model without one.” we learn lot lse. but wonderful london, meet people world first time, able travel europe even soviet union student group, ski first time life austria, gradually become clear center academic economics profession london oxford cambridge, unite states. there delicate business apply graduate school. there strong chicago tendency among many lecturer lse, i want go mit. when ask why, i give simple answer: “samuelson solow.” fortunately, i get mit opportunity get know samuelson solow great professors. and i also meet many outstanding student time, among robert merton. i take course samuelson solow mit stars, i write thesis 3 see d’amico, kim, wei (2014). 4 see dornbusch (1976) rogoff (2001). 4 bi central bankers’ speech guidance paul samuelson frank fisher. from there, first job university chicago – i understand i lucky able learn great economist mit chicago. among many thing i learn chicago milton friedman saying: “man may rational, he’s great rationalizer,” quote often come mind listen stock market analysts. after four year chicago, i return mit department economics, think i would never leave – even mit succeed persuade rudi dornbusch, i meet student chicago, move mit – thus give benefit learn economics chicago mit, give mit pleasure benefit add superb economist human collection people already present. mit still heavily involve develop growth theory time i ph.d. student there, 1966 1969. we student make aware kaldor’s stylize fact process growth, present 1957 article “a model economic growth.” they were: 1. the share national income receive labor capital roughly constant long period time. 2. the rate growth capital stock per worker roughly constant long period time. 3. the rate growth output per worker roughly constant long period time. 4. the capital/output ratio roughly constant long period time. 5. the rate return investment roughly constant long period time. 6. the real wage grow time. well, then, many problem face economy relate change stylize fact behavior economy: every one kaldor’s stylize fact long true, unfortunately change mostly direction complicate formulation economic policy.5 while basic approach outline far remain valid, use address many macroeconomic policy issues, i would like briefly take several topic detail. some issue remain central macroeconomic agenda past 50 years, regret fall agenda, others new agenda. 1. inflation unemployment: estimate phillips curve appear flat estimate many year ago – term textbooks, phillips curve appear close use call keynesian case (flat phillips curve) classical case (vertical phillips curve). since u.s. economy 2 percent inflation target, since unemployment vicinity full employment, sometimes argue link unemployment inflation must broken. i don’t believe that. rather link never strong, exists, may well present see first stir increase inflation rate – something would like happen. 2. productivity growth: the rate productivity growth unite state much world fall dramatically past 20 years. the table show calculate rate annual productivity growth unite state three periods: 1952 1973; 1974 2007; recent period, 2008 2015. after 3 percent 2.1 percent first two periods, annual rate productivity 5 see jones romer (2010). bi central bankers’ speech 5 growth fall 1.2 percent period since start global financial crisis. the right guide think case give famous herbert stein line: “the difference growth rate 1 percent 2 percent 100 percent.” why? productivity growth major determinant long-term growth. at 1 percent growth rate, take income 70 year double. at 2 percent growth rate, take 35 year double. that say, growth rate 1 percent per capita, take two generation per caput income double; 2 percent per caput growth rate, take one generation per caput income double. that massive difference, one would likely severe consequence national mood, possibly economic policy. that say, issue important future economy, every country, rate productivity growth. at stage, simply know happen productivity growth. robert gordon northwestern university publish extremely interest pessimistic book argue accept fact productivity grow future anything like rate period 1973. others look around see impressive change technology cannot believe productivity growth move back close high level yesteryear.6 a great deal work take place evaluate data, far little evidence data difficulty account significant part decline productivity growth calculate bureau labor statistics.7 3. the zlb effectiveness monetary policy: from december 2008 december 2015, federal fund rate target set feed range 0 ¼ percent, range rate describe zlb (zero low bound).8 between december 2008 december 2014, feed engage qe – quantitative ease – variety programs. empirical work do feed elsewhere suggest qe work sense reduce interest rate federal fund rate, particularly seem succeed drive longer-term rates, rate relevant spend decisions. critic argue qe gradually become le effective years, long used. it extremely difficult appraise effectiveness program whose parameter announce begin program. but i regard significant respect effectiveness qe taper tantrum 2013, apparently cause belief feed go wind purchase sooner expected, major effect interest rates. more recently, critic argue qe, together negative interest rates, long effective either japan euro zone. that case yet empirically established, i believe central bank still capacity qe measure run expansionary monetary policies, even zero low bound. 4. the monetary-fiscal policy mix: there great deal work optimal monetary-fiscal policy mix. the topic interest analysis persuasive. nonetheless subject seem disappear public dialogue; perhaps ascendance notion – except extremis, 2009 – activist fiscal policy 6 see, instance, mokyr, vickers, ziebarth (2015). 7 see byrne, fernald, reinsdorf (forthcoming). 8 inside fed, range 0 1/4 percent generally call elb, effective low bound. 6 bi central bankers’ speech use all. certainly, easy central bank change policy treasury finance ministry so, remain pity fiscal lever seem disabled. 5. the financial sector: carmen reinhart ken rogoff’s book, this time be different, must write largely start great financial crisis. i find evidence recession accompany financial crisis likely much serious ordinary recession persuasive, point remain contentious. even case great recession, possible u.s. recession get second wind euro-zone crisis worsen 2011. but one forget immensity financial crisis u.s. economy world go follow bankruptcy lehman brother – one forget thing could happen again. the subsequent tighten financial regulatory system dodd-frank act essential, complaint excessive regulation excessive demand bank hold capital betray best short memory. we, official sector particularly regulatory authorities, obligation try minimize regulatory burden place private sector official sector – le important obligation try prevent another financial crisis. and also remember shadow bank system play important role propagation financial crisis, endeavor reduce riskiness system. 6. the economy price oil: for time, least since unite state become oil importer, believe low price oil good economy. so price oil begin descent $100 barrel, keep look oil-price-cut dividend. but dividend hard discern macroeconomic data. part reason result rapid expansion production oil shale, total u.s. oil production rise rapidly, large part economy adversely affect decline price oil. another part investment equipment structure need shale oil production become important component aggregate u.s. investment, component begin rapid decline. for reasons, although unite state remain oil importer, decrease world price oil mix effect u.s. gross domestic product. there reason believe price oil stabilizes, u.s. shale oil production reach new equilibrium, overall effect decline price oil see positive effect aggregate demand unite states, since low energy price provide noticeable boost real income households. 7. secular stagnation: during world war ii unite states, many economist fear end war, economy would return high pre-war level unemployment – end war, demobilization, massive reduction would take place defense budget, would enough demand maintain full employment. thus bear renew concept secular stagnation – view economy could find permanently situation low demand, le full employment, low growth.9 that happen world war ii, 9 i distinguish section secular stagnation cause deficiency aggregate demand another view, output growth slow future productivity growth low. the view future productivity growth low already discussed, conclusion good basis prediction future level, simply know whether future productivity growth extremely low high recently. there shortage view bi central bankers’ speech 7 think secular stagnation correspondingly lay aside, part grow confidence intelligent economic policy – fiscal monetary – could rely help keep economy full employment reasonable growth rate. recently, larry summer forcefully restate secular stagnation hypothesis, argue account current slowness economic growth unite state rest industrialize world. the theoretical case secular stagnation sense shortage demand tie question level interest rate would need generate situation full employment. if equilibrium interest rate negative, small, economy likely find grow slowly, frequently encounter zero low bind interest rate. research show decline trend estimate equilibrium interest rate. that find become firmly establish since start great recession global financial crisis.10 moreover, level equilibrium interest rate seem likely rise gradually longer-run level would still quite low historical standards. what factor determine equilibrium interest rate? fundamentally, balance save investment demands. several trend cite possible factor contribute decline long-run equilibrium real rate. one likely factor persistent weakness aggregate demand. among many reason that, larry summer noted, amount physical capital revolutionary information technology firm high stock market valuation need remarkably small. the slowdown productivity growth, already mention prominent deeply concern feature past six years, another important factor.11 others point demographic trend result large share population age cohort high save rates.12 some also point high save rate many emerge market countries, couple lack suitable domestic investment opportunity countries, put downward pressure rate advance economy – global save glut hypothesis advance ben bernanke others feed decade ago.13 whatever cause, thing equal, low level long-run equilibrium real rate suggest frequency duration future episode monetary policy constrain zlb high past. prior crisis, research suggest episode likely relatively infrequent generally short lived.14 the past several year certainly require u issue among economists, view extent appear depend whether economist make prediction optimist pessimist. 10 this research include recent work johannsen mertens (2015) kiley (2015) us extension original laubach williams (2003) framework. an international perspective medium-to-long-run real interest rate provide u.s. executive office president (2015). reinhart rogoff (2009) hall (2014) discus long-lived effect financial crisis economic performance. see also hamilton others (2015). i have, addition, draw fischer (forthcoming). 11 it also major factor explain phenomenon economy’s impressive performance job front period historically slow growth. 12 see, instance, gordon (2014, 2016). 13 see bernanke (2005). see also recent work caballero, farhi, gourinchas (2008); mendoza, quadrini, rios-rull (2009). 14 see, instance, reifschneider williams (2000), blanchard simon (2001), stock watson (2003). 8 bi central bankers’ speech reconsider basic assumption. moreover, recent experience unite state country teach u conduct monetary policy effective low bind challenging.15 and unconventional policy tool forward guidance asset purchase extremely helpful effective, central bank would prefer situation positive interest rates, restore ability use traditional interest rate tool monetary policy.16 the answer question “will equilibrium interest rate remain today’s low level permanently?” also know. many factor determine equilibrium interest rate, particularly productivity growth, extremely difficult forecast. at present, look likely equilibrium interest rate remain low policy-relevant future, past long swing short-term change think equilibrium real rates. eventually, history give u answer. but critical emphasize history’s answer depend also future policies, monetary other, notably include fiscal policy. conclude remark well, answer different 50 year ago? no. the basic framework learn half-century ago remain extremely useful. but also yes: some answer different previous exam problem deal evident fifty year ago. so advice potential policymakers simple: learn much can, come useful stage career; never forget identify happen economy essential ability job, need keep eyes, ears, mind open, regard mouth – use caution. many thank award opportunity speak you. reference bernanke, ben s.

regime: open issues, implication business models, effect institutional financial communication * * * keynote address mr salvatore rossi, senior deputy governor bank italy president iva (istituto per la vigilanza sulle assicurazioni), iva conference 2016, rome, 3 march 2016. lady gentlemen, i delight welcome conference launch solvency ii. i want thank victoria saporta, chair international association insurance supervisor (iais), gabriel bernardino, chair european insurance occupational pension authority (eiopa), frank grund bafin panelists, kindly accept invitation. i also want thank all, audience, numerous. this proof topic discuss today – namely solvency ii implementation challenge face two month entry force new regime – great relevance, regulator industry. indeed, first conference solvency ii last. actually lot conference seminar already take place since project started. but still need discussion, deep wide comprehension implication multifaceted issue. we start keynote speech gabriel bernardino. two panel discussion follow. the first one relevant controversial aspect solvency ii implementation. the second one devote specific crucial feature new framework: information disclosure. the panelist distinguish well know representative supervisory community industry. the moderator ferdinando giugliano, former editorial writer financial times, italian newspaper la repubblica, fausto parente ivass. alberto corinti, member board iva management board eiopa, offer conclude remarks. i sure gain important insight today’s debate, also base everybody’s concrete experience past week new regime. now introductory word part. solvency ii bear 1st january 2016 pregnancy last 10 years. we remember last thrill moment directive omnibus ii, essential advance project, seem hard agree upon. a failure would put childbirth deadly risk. but make it. eiopa fundamental role delicate process. it impress decisive push adopt interim measure preparation solvency ii 2013. that move energize whole insurance sector (both supervisor industry), keep attention high view final goal new regime. notwithstanding long complex preparatory works, every detail fully fix yet, nor, i would add, fully understood. that organize conference. of course, go solve doubt today. in ordinary work continuously bump new implementation problems, ask practically deal aspect solvency ii. to extent physiological, always happen one move theory practice. i confident end day able exploit benefit new regime, minimize implementation costs. 2 bi central bankers’ speech let briefly touch upon – understand – key point need tackle now. first all, need stimulate accommodate thorough cultural change insurance sector. the transition solvency i static/historical approach solvency ii forward-looking one revolutionary. it rhetoric: bank sector revolution – back remote past – require year digest stakeholders. in risk dominate environment, supervisor expect systematically challenge undertake risk profile/appetite ability pursue it; instance, supervisor periodically discus board company risk profile long-term strategies. iva already take step direction. one example: immediately on-site inspection convene dedicate meet board company, discus outcome possible corrective measures. in experience board member always will able sustain constructive dialogue supervisors, especially small undertakings. but essential new regulatory framework. it cultural gap. we work together it. all cultural change require time, effort perhaps even pain. what important keep move ahead – step step constantly – towards main goal: forward-looking approach assess risk vulnerabilities. both camp adapt way reasoning: supervisor analyse data come undertakings, latter when, example, perform own risk solvency assessment (orsa). a second key point i consider top priority supervisory community eu: harmonization convergence supervisory practices. we cannot consistently manage common regulatory framework accept long play field level, arbitrage among national supervisors, discrimination protection policyholder along national borders. this often case solvency i, many national difference permit eu directives. solvency ii allow much limit number national specificities. we easily work harmonize supervisory practices, point really common approach. this mean identify best practice ready, us, adopt national sphere even come experience. it easy. day-to-day supervision remain national supervisory authorities’ responsibility, different story long year experience. spread best practices, irrespective developed, would sometimes require forgo national pride order embrace cause rationality efficiency. i believe eiopa lot field. not “enhancing convergence” mandate, also best position collect compare different approaches, identify recommend best ones, promote common adoption, acknowledge difference aspect actually merit treat differently. to accomplish task tool already there. let mention finalization eiopa’s supervisory handbook, believe “the” essential tool. hence, iva much support actively work it. another important tool order select share best practice “peer review work”. even case, need time. from side, i assure seriously commit collective effort. a third key point public disclosure. solvency ii fantastic opportunity good understand risk profile business model company, stakeholders: supervisor first, also market analysts, board member managers, journalists, politicians, public opinion. the market disclosure rule foresee new legislative framework really allow everybody interest access financial bi central bankers’ speech 3 position insurer unprecedented level detail. the inherent sophistication complexity solvency ii, however, raise issue need addressed. it essential informative treasure high quality, could easily understand used. a possible complication stems, least country, coexistence solvency ii informative approach financial statement base account standard match former. it may source confusion misunderstandings, possibly endanger reputation supervisor companies. it interest exchange view today. let conclude, lady gentlemen, word caution. solvency ii regulatory framework. it design urban map, impose one-way street speed limits, deploy traffic light traffic officers. all infrastructure changed, today go discus ease transition towards new regime. but traffic itself, thousand car driver modern city, well, market. and insurance market, world, face big challenge one pose change rule game, though radical. the challenge twofold. a structural one: technological innovation. the one apparently conjunctural nature, actually persist almost like structural feature: environment low volatile financial return live year now. i say low, i could say negative, short-term segment financial markets. how fast new technology disrupt traditional way conduct insurance business? how long monetary policy keep interest rate present unprecedented levels, even lower? nobody knows, every opinion legitimate. but whole business rock developments. understand trend challenge behind current state affair insurance market common endeavor regulators/supervisors industry. for time being, work together order make implementation solvency ii smooth effective possible, also purpose strengthen insurance sector make capable resist present headwind catch opportunity tomorrow. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: from challenge opportunity – reboot european financial sector speech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, sz (süddeutsche zeitung) finance day 2016, frankfurt main, 2 march 2016. * * * lady gentlemen, for work financial sector, job depend ability ass manage risk. what allow fact many risk tangible – identify analysis, measure model hedge use financial instruments. risk per se obstacle decision-making; simply frame parameter decisions. the situation different, however, risk morph uncertainty1. uncertainty, definition, cannot predict quantified. it therefore much impediment decision-making. and bring economic costs: firm postpone investment, household postpone consumption increase savings. in european economy today face several source uncertainty. we face uncertainty outlook global economy. we face uncertainty direction europe resilience new shock – uk referendum, next wave migration. and germane conference, face uncertainty way forward european financial sector. a significant amount uncertainty stem fact that, eight year crisis, still transition phase. financial institution considerably strong 2008 still adjust business model post-crisis world. we new regulatory regime, whose contour yet fully defined. and new regime overlay financial sector that, cases, still substantial legacy issue address. that create unavoidable frictions. but uncertainty also self-imposed, policy decision play role that. in still fragile environment face today, essential policy work reduce uncertainty – become source uncertainty itself. at time, policy cannot excuse financial firm put revise business model update technologies. to build confidence european financial sector, actor need play part. the post-crisis environment challenge, also opportunity: financial sector become profitable, efficient stable. what i would like remark today look closely source uncertainty face today, policymakers private player address them. there three area particular i would like focus on: business environment, regulatory environment, technological environment. business environment the business environment confront european financial sector today evidently challenging. 1 see f. knight (1921). risk, uncertainty profit, boston: hart, schaffner marx. 2 bi central bankers’ speech earn among euro area bank continue weak, average return equity – although markedly improve since crisis2 – remain cost equity. cost cut rationalisation ongoing since 2008, make cost save hard achieve. low profitability constrain capacity bank generate capital internally. and new challenge arise face uncertain economic outlook, especially give weakness emerge market commodity-producing sectors. so way policymakers reduce uncertainty? one topical issue is, course, whether monetary policy contribute weak profitability. in particular, concern build that, central bank low interest rate negative territory, impact monetary policy bank become increasingly adverse. that bank lend rate fall linearly fund cost non-linear – interest rate retail deposit sticky – put squeeze net interest margins. let underline well aware issue. we monitor regular basis study carefully scheme use jurisdiction mitigate possible adverse consequence bank lend channel. but i also think need qualify narrative banks’ challenge flow largely monetary policy. so far, many bank able offset decline interest revenue high lend volumes, low interest expenses, low risk provision capital gains. last year, example, euro area banks’ aggregate net interest income increased, especially crisis-hit bank refinance expire high-yield liabilities. and negative interest rate complementary asset purchase programme, clearly positive effect asset prices, credit risk intermediation volumes. this set direct cost measure net interest margins. moreover, environment rise global uncertainty, would cost financial sector monetary policy responded? we see recent sharp fall bank equity price sector highly sensitive weaker-than-expected economic outlook. in context, commitment price stability mandate vital anchor expectation nominal growth. those call le accommodative monetary policy ask would impact banks’ lend volume loan-loss provision output stagnant price falling. more generally, market jitter particularly focus bank perceive residual weakness – particular high stock non-performing loan (npl) perceive lack sustainable business models. these challenge little central bank. reduce uncertainty source require policymakers private player act. two priority stand out. the first move decisively deal legacy assets. progress npl resolution still slow compare volume problem loans. in country affect crisis3, ratio non-performing exposure tangible equity loan loss provision – so-called “texas ratio” – currently stand around 100% many banks. that undermine confidence ability absorb losses, create volatility event economic bad news, well hamper loan growth real economy. all precondition accelerate npl resolution: npl level provision review supervisory arm ecb part asset quality review. 2 for euro area bank sector, annualised return equity first three quarter 2015 5.7% 2015 compare 3.4% 2010. 3 see ecb financial stability review, november 2015. the analysis base publicly available data sample 60 significant bank groups. country affect crisis include cyprus, greece, ireland, italy, portugal, slovenia spain. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the challenge speed process write and/or disposal. there various policy measure facilitate process. one improve insolvency regimes, help separate viable non-viable borrower enable valuation asset sell off. another increase efficiency judicial systems, allow fast foreclosure collateral underlie npl portfolios. and view also merit facilitate carve-out substantial portion bank balance sheets. but assumes, course, workable solution exist transfer legacy asset sensible price investor able will manage them. it also assume decisive action kick-start market loan jurisdiction npl ratio high – is, cyprus greece. second, bank perceive business model risk need mitigate uncertainty reshape business mix operational models. asset carve-outs could catalytic well: streamline balance sheet dispose asset allow bank concentrate develop new business, oppose manage legacy asset – words, save “zombification”. beyond that, bank weak profitability need find way increase non-interest income and, possible, reduce operate costs. there appear scope too.4 on earn side, example, already observe trend among bank compensate low interest income increase fee commissions. there evidence bank offer fee-based product client substitute interest-based products. on cost side save challenge give extensive rationalisation effort recent years, still one obvious “low hang fruit” picked: consolidation within sector. indicator market concentration suggest over-capacity european bank sector, especially country fragment bank systems. for example, herfindahl-hirschman index euro area, though rise recent years, still stand 750. a general rule, figure 1000 signal low concentration.5 cost-income ratio bank sector also remain high. that imply would efficiency gain consolidation without exacerbate “too-big-to-fail” problems. the fact european supervisory resolution regime present ideal condition bank capitalise new cross-border m&a opportunities. what economy need european bank operate european market: large enough operate across border diversify risks, small enough resolve resource single resolution fund. this would reap full benefit bank union improve term trade-off financial stability economic efficiency.6 for happen, however, need remove remnant regulatory framework implicitly support home bias. for example, much national discretion allow implement rules; fungible liquidity capital across borders; regulation affect choice subsidiary versus branch – issue crucially shape incentive bank become european. and get right, risk consolidation ultimately happen painful route resolution. 4 see d. nouy (2016), “risks resilience – european bank sector 2016”, speech deutsche bank – bank capital forum, london, 23 february 2016. 5 see ecb report financial structures, october 2015. the herfindahl-hirschman index (hhi) define sum square market share firm within industry, market share express fractions. a general rule, hhi 1,000 signal low concentration, index 1,800 signal high concentration. for value 1,000 1,800, industry consider moderately concentrated. the range index lie 0 10 000. 6 see b. cœuré (2014), “on optimal size financial sector”, speech ecb conference optimal size financial sector, frankfurt, 2 september. 4 bi central bankers’ speech regulatory environment this bring second part remarks: regulatory environment. clearly, european financial sector face profoundly change regulatory environment crisis. that apply quantity quality capital, leverage, fund profiles, bail-in-able debt, risk management practices. derivative market market infrastructure also subject comprehensive reform agenda. be regulation source uncertainty? take longer-term view, i find difficult believe so. thank regulatory initiatives, capital ratio euro area bank rise around 8% 2008 close 14% today. leverage ratio improve countries. and fund become stable: median loan-to-deposit ratio fall 140% 2008 around 110% now. force over-the-counter (otc) derivative onto central clear also net counterparty risk reduce uncertainty own crisis. all contribute robust financial sector good able absorb shocks. and though always cost regulation, study suggest that, steady state, macroeconomic benefit outweigh them. for example, commission simulation find new regulatory framework deliver macroeconomic benefit around 0.6–1.1% eu gdp per year, compare long-term cost 0.3% eu gdp per year.7 where regulation create uncertainty, however, two areas. the first lack visibility future regulatory regime look like. and second uncertainty new regulation applied. the volume new regulation come create uncertainty financial sector recent years. but i think contour new regime clear before. the key unfinished part basel iii agenda, leverage ratio, reduction variability risk-weighted assets, total loss absorb capacity (tlac) fundamental review trade book, look set finalise europe end year. that help provide clarity post-crisis steady state. a confirm g20 finance minister governor meet shanghai, aim focus make basel iii effective without increase regulatory capital requirements.8 but still area where, i think, visibility would beneficial. one timeline directive market financial instruments, recently postponed. regulator doubt face difficult trade-off urgency reform need fundamental change regulation meet technical logistical reality. but also important process lose momentum, least legislation backbone future capital market union. another area resilience, recovery resolution clear houses, commission make proposal late year global framework clarified. the cpmi, iosco fsb make good progress area deliver guidance ahead g20 hangzhou summit.9 7 see european commission (2014), economic review financial regulation agenda, may. 8 see communiqué g20 finance minister central bank governor meeting, shanghai, february 27, 2016. 9 still another area pension fund impact move towards central clear otc derivatives. central counterparties generally accept cash margin, pension fund typically hold liquid assets. that why, june last year, commission agree two year exemption pension fund find technical solution issue. until resolved, however, may uncertainty among investor pension fund able meet clear requirement without shed profitable assets. bi central bankers’ speech 5 in term application regulation, also see – perhaps inevitably – degree uncertainty new regime bed in. for example, recent volatility saw bank share seem coincide uncertainty around pillar 2 capital requirement would applied. but recent clarification european bank authority (eba)10 additional communication single supervisory mechanism (ssm)11 now, i think, go long way towards allay concerns. all thing equal, supervisory requirement also increase further. what perhaps remain clarify exactly new resolution framework work. the resolution case portugal italy last year spark concern equal treatment, important underline application bail-in tool bank recovery resolution directive, rather eu state aid rules. what key creditor certainty stand new resolution hierarchy. that would enhanced, view, ensure mrel (the minimum requirement fund eligible liabilities)

particular difference subordination treatment additional capital buffers. the ongoing mrel review, also implement tlac, need address remain inconsistency uncertainties, bank need clarity start issue bail-in-able debt make new resolution regime fully effective. i trust many issue address finalise course 2016. technological environment finally, let say word third view important area potential uncertainty financial sector: evolve technological environment. what i refer emergence disruptive new technology – so-called “fintech” – look set profoundly reshape structure financial intermediation. fintech spread across financial market segment along value chain. it present, albeit still early stage, payments, credit provision, investment financial advice, insurance. it run front office back office. and fintech innovation increasingly cascade new areas. for example, development instant payment infrastructure help develop new market mobile p2p, e-commerce point-of-sale payment solutions, may become new standard payment areas. on face it, i doubt positive development financial sector. it lead great efficiency, good product low price consumers. it also potential support financial inclusion. in short, fintech part answer fundamental question face economies: lack productivity rise inequalities. that regulation generally support open market access introduce legal certainty previously unregulated services. for example, revise payment service directive expand list activity payment service provider carry include initiation payment account information services. where uncertainty come in, however, affect incumbents. 10 see opinion european bank authority interaction pillar 1, pillar 2 combine buff requirement restriction distributions. 11 see ssm srep methodology booklet. 12 see ecb (2015). opinion european central bank 2 september 2015 bank resolution (con/2015/31). 6 bi central bankers’ speech fintech present opportunity new start-ups compete establish financial institution specific financial services, without cost legacy it system compliance-oriented business culture. fintech also open market “bigtech” firm apple, google amazon, in-built advantage digital technology. this threaten take business away bank traditionally offer package services, potentially weaken business models. what more, longer-term technological innovations, distribute ledger technology (dlts), could profound impact financial intermediation. dlts potential substantially reduce reconciliation cost market participants, disintermediate incumbent financial value chain, allow efficient use collateral. through decentralise update validation records, may even challenge basic business model intermediary central market infrastructures. so policymakers concern this? generally speaking, market incumbent rise challenge. in particular, bank face question business model see new wave innovation opportunity – reach new customers, increase efficiency, revamp business models. after all, still retain economy scale unavailable small start-ups intellectual capital unavailable outsiders. fintech may exactly shock sector need restructure crisis. but policymakers also need monitor development closely. a firm enter market important ensure level play field entity provide similar financial services. moreover, market fragmentation might create challenge single european market, market innovator tendency build closed-loop solution “silos”, challenge exist approach towards contain systemic risk. for example, emergence popular retail payment platform one country could undermine market integration already achieve context sepa. we see market evolve assess whether regulation provide steer one direction another, whether new approach provide full legal certainty market participants, whether regulatory space provide let innovation develop without hind financial stability. but start move along steep learn curve. for example, cpmi launch work partnership iosco standard-setting body impact distribute ledger technology relate digital innovation payment market infrastructures. conclusion let conclude. the euro area still recover once-in-a-generation economic financial crisis leave deep scar economy. it urgently need high growth bring high unemployment, deleverage economy raise inflation back price stability objective. uncertainty financial sector block path. to reduce uncertainty, policymakers financial institution need play part. they need ensure financial system fit purpose able finance recovery. and need today, tomorrow. but keep mind challenge face financial sector also present opportunity. a tough business environment push bank efficient. a new, stable regulatory environment make financial system safer. and disruptive technological environment lead new business model good financial services. it interest rise challenge. bi central bankers’ speech 1 theodore mitrakos: distress loan greek bank system – restructure portfolios, revive enterprise address mr theodore mitrakos, deputy governor bank greece, workshop co-organised bank greece ebrd “distressed loan greek bank system – restructure portfolios, revive enterprises”, athens, 10 march 2016. * * * lady gentlemen, dear guests, it great pleasure welcome bank greece mr. nick tesseyman, manage director financial institution european bank reconstruction development (ebrd), distinguish speaker participant today’s workshop, focus management non-performing exposure (npes). let take opportunity welcome activity ebrd greece. the ebrd governors, follow request greek authorities, vote february 2015 overwhelm majority bank invest greece end 2020. the bank’s investments, back technical assistance policy dialogue, intend strengthen progress reform greece’s economy contribute recovery. in vein, probably know, ebrd representative office athens recently established. greece benefit greatly expertise finance ebrd bring project design contribute sustainable growth encourage trade. the ebrd already participate recapitalisation four significant greek bank late 2015, show confidence prospect entire greek bank sector, invest overall around €300 million greece. moreover, early march ebrd support expansion international trade facility national bank greece ebrd’s trade facilitation programme (tfp). through programme, ebrd provide guarantee international confirm bank short-term loan select bank factor company on-lending local exporters, importer distributors. the facility help national bank greece scale trade finance activities, despite financial market conditions, reaffirm prime trade partner, support trade activity exporters, importer distributor import good greece. it anticipate similar agreement sign greek bank near future. more generally, ebrd’s commitment country send strong signal private sector investor greece serious reform rebalancing economy. i would like therefore thank ms. sabina dziurman, ebrd director greece cyprus, contribution far, well put forward idea hold joint workshop non-performing exposures. lady gentlemen, the bank greece, know, take series initiative promote rigorous efficient management non-performing exposures. it also underpin government effort towards shape implement national npl strategy. in regard, let briefly mention bank greece initiatives: • the issuance executive committee act 42/2014 supervisory framework regard npe management commercial cooperative banks. • the activation code conduct, provide guideline regard interaction credit financial institution borrower arrears. • the conduct several on-site inspection monitor banks’ progress implement supervisory framework. • the conduct, support external consultant, study npl segmentation preparedness capacity bank deal npl segment rigorous manner. 2 bi central bankers’ speech • the issuance executive committee act 82/2016 (under publication) regard framework license operation npl service acquire firms. last least, bank greece, cooperation ecb bank supervision commercial cooperative banks, process agree set operational target npes. meanwhile, bank greece set coordination office support monitor implementation national npl strategy. • against background, today’s workshop opportunity extensively discus three main topics: • solution borrower exposure multiple banks. the bulk distress large corporate borrower exposure multiple bank render necessary coordinate approach among creditor agree comprehensive sustainable solution reasonable timeframe. the hellenic financial stability fund (hfsf) recently launch study regard pertinent issue “common borrowers”. • development secondary market npl service sales. the recent law 4354/2015 lay framework development secondary market npl service sales. there two panel cover essential aspect process set local infrastructure npl service sale respectively. • the banks’ internal workout: manage distress smes. smes backbone greek economy. the shift bank towards long-term forbearance measure couple restructure viable business appropriate change structure, business model and, necessary, corporate governance would help stimulate uptick economic activity assist rebalancing greek economy towards export-oriented sectors. lady gentlemen, the successful completion recapitalization greek bank late 2015 decisive first step towards safeguard financial stability restore intermediation role banks. the capital adequacy ratio greek bank sector stand (pro forma) around 18% compare favorably average european union banks. the next milestone greek bank sector relate return profitability, return deposit restoration depositors’ confidence and, importantly, supply credit work capital investment. undoubtedly, goal closely link politically socially sensitive issue tackle non-performing exposures, pose real challenge u all. a september 2015, non-performing exposure stand €107 billion, represent 43.6% total exposures. hence, effective management non-performing exposures, avoid pitfall regulatory forbearance over-enforcement alike, bring multiple benefit banks, households, business society large. in process, unlock fund real economy, bolster investment employment. this turn enable greek bank sector protect strengthen productive fabric country, concurrently enhance social role. i confident today’s workshop show significant progress already make regard development appropriate institutional supervisory framework effective npe management. moreover, help identify appropriate tool approach end. i look forward excite discussion fruitful exchange views. the overwhelm interest market participants, greece abroad, join workshop is, i think, key ingredient success. thank today. bi central bankers’ speech 1 henry ohlsson: decision today, consequence far future speech mr henry ohlsson, deputy governor sverige riksbank, breakfast event, organise swedbank, stockholm, 18 march 2016. * * * i would like thank bo enegren, hanna köhler, gustaf norrefeldt, cecilia roos-isaksson, marianne stern ulf söderström help speech. accompany figure table find end speech. some decision make significance now. others may consequence many decade come, case rest lives. our choice education purchase home example decision considerable significance long period time. for person put debt decision long-term consequences, course important high interest rate debt are. and concern interest rate pay medium term, also interest rate several decade ahead. in recent years, interest rate low level modern times. several central bank do riksbank cut policy rate zero, government bond yield long maturity historically low levels. this partly due prolong recession follow financial crisis. however, really long term, structural factor long-term growth, propensity save technological progress crucial movement interest rate rather short-term fluctuations. let u begin definition help u bring structure discussion understand challenge facing. the interest rate normally see nominal, measure much pay term money borrow much receive save. but price usually rise time, value money also declines. to take account, one look real interest rate, is, nominal interest rate minus expect rate inflation. the real interest rate measure much pay loan real terms, is, term purchase power. in long turn, real interest rate determine structural factors, save investment. and small, open economy like sweden’s, factor primarily determine international developments. monetary policy, hand, mark effect real interest rate long run. however, monetary policy influence rate inflation inflation expectations. if monetary policy base inflation target perceive credible, long-term inflation expectation coincide inflation target. in words, say long-term nominal interest rate determine two factors: • long-term real interest rate, turn determine structural factor global, • inflation target, monetary policy make credible. i shall discus two factor today speculate may develop really long term. firstly, i intend take fact real interest rate show fall trend long period time global level. what factor lie behind this? will trend prevail and, so, consequence monetary policy? and mean household companies? 2 bi central bankers’ speech secondly, i discus inflation target. here sweden target 2 per cent since introduce mid-1990s. most country inflation target also target around 2 per cent. what experience target level? should level low higher? interest rate thus low long time now, reasonable expect long run 3–4 time high now. this must take account; otherwise decision take today major consequence much ahead. it thus important remember condition apply today apply decade future. low real interest rate trend since 1980s a process financial economic integration global economy increased, common factor global growth global save play increasingly large role regard interest rates.1 real interest rate fall around world justify call global real interest rate. the fall order 4–5 percentage point since 1980s.2 a sweden small, open economy, long-term global real interest rate regard anchor swedish real interest rate. during brief periods, real interest rate sweden may deviate global real interest rate, long period time swedish real interest rate determine global factors. figure 1 show long-term real interest rate develop sweden unite kingdom since mid-1980s. more specifically, figure show 10-year yield swedish british real government bonds. from mid-1980s ten year onwards, real interest rate vary around almost 4 per cent unite kingdom, sweden much volatile high level. this follow trend decline continue today. at present, swedish real interest rate around –0–5 per cent, british one around –1 per cent. it also appear country low real interest rate main reason fall nominal interest rate period. during 1990s, number central bank introduce inflation targets, low inflation expectation also contribute fall nominal interest rates. secular stagnation debt adjustment? an international discussion go year regard cause fall global real interest rate. in simple terms, one say two main explanation put forward debate.3 accord one explanation, fall primarily due factor determine long-term trend investment savings, demographic developments. this partly connect discussion secular stagnation initiate lawrence summers, amongst others.4 in view, long-term trend save investment pull interest rate level compatible full employment. the fall great interest-rate level zero. 1 see imf (2014). 2 see king low (2014). 3 see armelius et al. (2014). 4 see summer (2014). bi central bankers’ speech 3 representative explanation, instance kenneth rogoff,5 put great emphasis short-term factor directly link financial crisis, high indebtedness increase uncertainty, hold back investment get household save more. regardless significance one attribute financial crisis, clear downward trend interest rate begin much earlier. back period prior financial crisis, federal reserve governor time, alan greenspan, describe low long-term u interest rate mystery. growth, save technology determine real interest rate regardless explanation one concur with, people consider long-run global real interest rate primarily govern expectation potential growth, propensity save technological advances. i therefore first describe various factor influence real interest rate. i discus possible explanation growth, propensity save technology may change. low potential global growth give low global real interest rate accord economic theory, expect growth play important role development real interest rate; low growth, low real interest rate. international organisation imf oecd make downward adjustment assessment global growth trend recent years. this could lead low real interest rate. at time, one note global growth stable relatively high 15–20 year prior financial crisis. it thus possible explain long-term fall interest rate prior financial crisis due low global growth. one possible explanation could instead global population increase fall long period time, expect continue fall come period. this could contribute low potential growth labour force increase slow pace. at time, effect counteract labour productivity rises. slow population growth fact work age population shrink indicate growth remain low pre-crisis decades. the prospect labour productivity much difficult assess. the rate increase labour productivity decline connection economic downturn follow financial crisis uncertain last effect be. demography affect propensity save thus real interest rate demographic development also affect propensity save. life expectancy increase birth-rate fall recent decades. this mean population age part world. it apply especially develop country also country china several emerge markets. merely fact people average live long mean need save money old age, unless retirement age raise pace increase life expectancy. development also entail percentage increase old work age population (40–65 year old) – normally high level save – recent decades. there thus good reason assume demographical development contribute increase propensity save world thus low real interest rate. 5 see rogoff (2015). 4 bi central bankers’ speech the demographic effect save china worth mention particular. the single-child policy contribute severe decline birth-rate. at time, life expectancy increased. the combination weak social safety net few child provide elderly probably important explanation increase save chinese economy. a china become increasingly integrate global economy, save china also increasingly channel part world investment. increase propensity save many emerge market many emerge market also increase savings, partly reason change demographics. experience asian crisis 1998 contribute many emerge market countries’ central bank build currency reserve able withstand future currency outflows. the increase demand country low-risk assets, government bonds, lead yield push end 1990s year prior financial crisis. the rise demand safe asset also contribute increase differential risk-free rate rate high risk investments. more pensioner long run lead low save thereby high real interest rate on hand, save may decline gradually increasingly large percentage world population attain age retirement. however speed strength impact demographic save uncertain. it depend partly extent old people choose remain work long extent work save retirement life expectancy rises. great income disparity also affect propensity save another factor explain propensity save increase increase income spread. in develop countries, income spread increase since 1980s. high-income earner normally high propensity save low-income earners. the increase income spread could therefore mean save increased. at time, say even income disparity increase within number countries, decline global level emerge market catch develop economies. it therefore difficult say global save affected. wage share add value decline the great income spread also visible ways. the trend towards increase save extensive wealth rise substantially industrial nations. wealth also rise fast national income.6 these increase wealth transfer transform capital use production. in cases, do via financial markets. the global real interest rate turn adapt desire capital stock match available wealth. in recent decades, upturn wealth capital relation national income prove relatively great downturn real interest rate. this mean capital share add value (the ratio real interest rate multiply capital national income) rise despite real interest rate declining. the capital share wage share always add one. consequently, wage share add value 6 see piketty & zucman (2014). waldenström (2015) provide account wealth/national income ratio sweden. bi central bankers’ speech 5 decline many countries.7 another way express large real interest rate cut need capital absorb increase wealth. and turn due production technology used. follow discussion determine development real interest rate long run, i shall go discus inflation target, factor significance nominal interest rate long run. inflation long run most sweden’s important trade partner inflation target one form another. usually, target inflation rate around 2 per cent year, see table 1. more common interest rate limit low bind when long-term level global real interest rate low, increase risk nominal interest rate reach low bind future economic downturns. many therefore argue various context favour raise inflation target.8 this increase distance nominal interest rate’s low bind make easy stimulate economy recession. at present, instance, bank canada review country’s inflation target, include analysis potential consequence raise inflation target.9 if nominal interest rate remain zero, real interest rate cut short term low level –2 per cent, inflation target 2 per cent. if inflation target inflation expectation instead 4 per cent, real interest rate could cut short term –4 per cent. even though interest rate fall zero sweden number countries, correlation high inflation target short-term possibility attain low real interest rate remains. advantage disadvantage high inflation target the obvious advantage raise inflation target to, say, 3 4 per cent would increase possibility stimulate economy future deep recession bring demand inflation. the experience financial crisis show risk deep prolong recession previously underestimated. prior financial crisis risk deep economic crisis assess basis experience post-war period, cyclical fluctuation small thus easy underestimate risks. if one study economic data extend much back time, one see large downturn much common. at time, several factor make raise inflation target problematic, least actual transition new inflation target would implemented. for instance, credibility new target would weaken announce situation inflation far old target. it could also problematic introduce new, high inflation target sweden isolation, important central bank around world stand firm target 2 per cent. swedish competitiveness could weakened, instance, inflation wage increase sweden high abroad. in theory, swedish krona weaken situation, competitiveness would restored. but many factor affect 7 see karabarbounis & neiman (2014) bengtsson & waldenström (2015). 8 see, example, ball (2014). 9 see kryvtsov mend (2015). 6 bi central bankers’ speech exchange rate adjustment could take long time. and time swedish competitiveness could deteriorate. there also risk inflation could vary high target. this could mean become difficult economic agent distinguish upturn general price level relative price change thus difficult make good financial decisions. i thus describe two factor determine nominal interest rate long term. it time put together. the nominal interest rate long run low interest rate long time... the fall global real interest rate naturally consequence monetary policy. many central bank cut policy rate historically low level stimulate demand get inflation rise. in sweden, riksbank emphasis nominal interest rate low long time come. the riksbank’s forecast extend two three year ahead. figure 2 show repo-rate path executive board riksbank decide monetary policy meet february. the riksbank’s forecast repo rate remain current level –0.5 per cent time around end june/beginning july 2017. at end 2018/beginning 2019 forecast repo rate rise 0.5 per cent. the riksbank ass expansionary monetary policy necessary get inflation rise stabilise around 2 per cent 2017. the low interest rate mean save borrow consumption investment receive pay low interest rate period. but also financial decision much reach consequences. ...but then? be possible say nominal interest rate 10, 15 20 years’ time? it would presumptuous attempt precise forecasts. but possible reason scenario possible normal state affair base know today factor i discuss today. in “normal state affairs” necessary debt adjustment wake financial crisis would complete. through high global growth, could expect high global real interest rates. growth principle come employment labour productivity begin increase fast pace. if low global saving, expect high global real interest rates. save decline percentage elderly rise retirement age falls. if income spread decline, also lead low global saving. when save declines, put upward pressure global real interest rates, competition save expect increase among want invest new production technology. this significance development real interest rate. finally, question monetary policy. will conduct inflation target? and, so, level target have? nominal interest rate become high future the demographical change see ahead indicate global save decline. this would imply high global real interest rates. the future condition growth bi central bankers’ speech 7 uncertain, labour productivity begin increase fast today, would upward pressure global real interest rates. let u therefore say future global real interest rate order 1.5–2.5 per cent. if add inflation target inflation expectation 2 per cent sweden, get nominal interest rate 3.5–4.5 per cent. even see return nominal interest rate level previously regard normal, long-term nominal interest rate much high today. the important thing economic agent make decision long-term consequence bear mind. this could refer, instance, household borrow money buy home. in future interest rate loan three four time high current mortgage rates. i begin discuss major difference time horizon financial decision need make. some decision apply now. if make wrong decision difficult put right. in cases, make decision today consequence far future. it important assume condition apply today apply decade future. reference armelius, bonomolo, lindskog, rådahl, strid walentin (2014) “lower neutral interest rate sweden?”, economic commentary

philippines), chamber thrift bank convention, makati city, 18 march 2016. * * * in prepare remarks, i consider theme two word leap me. the first word “momentum”. a may know, take root physics. some may remember formula -- “mass x velocity”. in words, “mass motion”. the second really, phrase -- “inclusive growth”. picture then, object, say, truck call “the initiative program towards inclusive growth”, move take effort stop it. that conference about. first -- ensure critical mass initiative keep u move towards goal inclusive growth. and then, make sure continue motion. our current operate environment in gather think today’s event, i could help reflect last seven month affect operate environment. global growth slowed. development china surprise markets. the u federal reserve finally raise target fund rate (although yesterday feed turn dovish, retreat initially indicate four rate hike 2016 two). risk aversion cause de-risking. and oil supply significantly much large demand. the net result volatile financial market. and felt good see full tank’s worth fuel cost significantly less, remain cognizant countryman work oil-generating economies. without overlook emerge developments, also lose sight fact macroeconomic financial market fundamental remain solid intact. we 68 quarter continuous growth, finish 2015 full-year growth 5.8 percent. inflation record 1.4%, low rate since bsp adopt inflation target monetary policy framework 2002. our balance payment position 2015 surplus usd2.6 billion, turnaround usd2.9 billion deficit 2014. and gross international reserve still usd80 billion, sufficient service 10 months’ worth import good payment services. the exchange rate sustain relative competitiveness move line currency region. base assessments, therefore, current stance monetary policy remain appropriate, flexibility address development reason adjust policy levers. certainly, bank industry remain clear pillar strength. accord s&p, i quote, “philippine bank look forward another solid year 2016, thank economy’s good growth prospect banks’ healthy capitalization asset quality.” our favorable economic prospect also note fitch ratings, which, part, give philippine positive outlook among asia pacific bank system 2016 . i happy note thrift bank continue contribute strength overall bank industry. the collective asset tb reach php961.13 billion november 2015 grow annually 10.71 percent past five years. over period, deposit balance expand nearly 11 percent per annum [php773.37 billion 2 bi central bankers’ speech november 2015] loan grow 15 percent annually [php 681.41 billion november 2015]. quo vadis? give developments, take thrift bank industry? the textbook answer, follow mandate thrift bank act. under law, tb expect to: 1. promote economic development expand industrial agricultural growth; 2. place within easy reach people medium long-term credit facility agriculture, services, industry house reasonable cost 3. encourage industry, frugality accumulation save among public. while well aware these, also recognize trivial task targets. these speak thrift bank enabler economic development encourage retail save extend credit target sectors. your mandate make distinction base environment within operate. this, i feel, important highlight business strategy appear reflect “inclusive” track industry. by i mean branch footprint clearly extend beyond cities. specifically, number thrift bank branch locate city actually grow 26.3 percent (from 991 1252) 2010 2015 branch 1st 5th class municipality grow 37.5 percent (from 304 418). certainly, bulk branch still 1st 2nd class municipality i encourage expansion elsewhere. what 35 branch 3rd 5th class municipality 2010 73 branch end 2015. the number may modest absolute term pace growth trivial. which bring back conference theme: “thrift banks: sustain momentum inclusive growth”. now, critical question come mind-- how can/do thrift bank contribute inclusive growth? i think pragmatism humility, would well-served “scope” response say thrift bank play role financial inclusion, promote inclusive growth. inclusive growth role thrift bank there several policy issue consider space financial inclusion. for thrift banks, i think two relevant. first, would want ensure symbiotic relationship financial inclusion financial stability. certainly, defeat prudential purpose attainment one come expense other. here, expand footprint strategy critical element. a bank service offer outside traditional city-centers, expectation dynamic inclusion stability well change. the bsp bi currently write paper relationship inclusion stability explore empirical linkages. the preliminary result suggest information bank client well relationship bank bank vicinity matter. this sound rather straightforward implication operation bank simple. in practice, mean bank must maintain continue dialogue stakeholders. this kind transparency “another disclosure regime”. rather, communication prevent surprise allow stakeholder make inform decisions, avoid sharp spike often create and/or exacerbate evolve issues. bi central bankers’ speech 3 furthermore, bank must cognizant stakeholder look localize community financial service providers. in day age electronic communication affordable channels, financial consumer demand “banking services”, may long necessarily supply traditional “brick-and-mortar bank institutions. this lead second policy area i often refer “totality client experience”. a far financial consumer concerned, live digital age financial service expect deliver form define financial technology. the digitization financial services, popularly label fintech, require innovation support. the bsp put place e-money it risk framework enable environment. financial consumer need transfer fund one branch another bank (let’s say manila relative province or two branch metro manila) must able le friction possible. in event something unexpected happen transaction, “support” come play. here, bsp issue consumer protection framework focus pro-active intervention financial literacy initiative necessity remedial recourse way redress. the issue i discuss certainly relevant thrift bank one define target audience extension, provide “totality” clients’ experience, regardless may be. final think lady gentlemen, speak link financial inclusion financial stability; how, industry, would need harness fintech enrich clients’ total experience. we also speak strategy expand branch footprint help reach underserved. these support belief (well) way towards create critical mass collective initiative towards inclusive growth. importantly, mass moving. by definition therefore, momentum. but, enough, need sustain it. a bank regulator, enable environment commensurate regulatory framework calibrate may necessary. but form substance bank product services, include mean delivery distribution, choice bank make. thrift bank define market niche, individual institution compete others industry collaborate whole. competition collaboration may flipsides end goal totality experience financial consumer. absent positive experience, financial consumer simply drift shadow (i.e., shadow banking) choose financially excluded. i trust one room find acceptable outcome. the national strategy financial inclusion (nsfi) launched, focus execution. i therefore look forward active participation endeavor. lady gentlemen, work financial inclusion enormous. if pursue individually, likely hardly make dent. but collectively, form critical mass, know effort take us? we could simply turn unstoppable! thank attention. good morning. bi central bankers’ speech 1 françois villeroy de galhau: the role monetary policy speech mr françois villeroy de galhau, governor bank france, global interdependence center – central bank series “inflation expectations, implication policy response new paradigm commodities”, session i “central banker outlook”, paris, 21 march 2016. * * * since financial crisis, central bank test several levels: ability keep transmission channel monetary policy active; ability deliver price stability; ability support economy. central bank many jurisdiction do lot reach objectives. and role largely hail positive exit crisis. but face inflation remain target, commodity market go persistently bear territory growth momentum lose steam, central banks’ action call question: effective monetary policy effective future? aren’t central bank run ammo? monetary policy face challenges, true; challenge mitigated. central bank prove ready part; conviction cannot remain game town. let focus remark today case euro area. jeffrey [lacker, president federal reserve bank richmond] certainly give insight u situation. i would first like elaborate challenge face central bankers, instrument effectiveness. i. let start challenge a) a know, eurosystem’s primary objective maintain price stability, inflation rate below, close 2% medium term. however euro area, like advance economies, inflation remain low, despite historically low interest rates: harmonise index consumer price (hicp) indeed return negative territory, stand –0.2% february 2016, underlie inflation, i.e. exclude energy food, 0.7%. a certain number factor currently contribute low inflation. primarily, euro area face deflationary pressure associate series economic shocks: firstly, fall oil prices, well overall decline commodity prices; secondly, slowdown growth emerge economy chiefly china; and, lastly, inadequate growth euro area persistently high unemployment, curb wage rise weaken demand price growth. moreover, structural factors, age population, also likely exert downward pressure “natural” – “wicksellian” – interest rate. this rate define interest rate consistent full employment factor production. in case, order achieve right balance save investment, market rate must come too. in normal times, central bank cut key rates, pass yield curve. however, order deal financial crisis, ecb like central bank bring key interest rate low levels, around zero. this mean traditional monetary policy tool supplement instruments, know non-standard instruments, order reach price stability objective. i return point later. b) what regard challenge currently face, deflationary pressure create risk unanchoring expectations, would make hard u achieve 2% target again. indeed, inflation stay low long, economic agent may revise downwards inflation expectations, would create second round effects. low inflation expectation influence economic agents’ price- wage-setting behaviour, turn keep inflation low. it even raise risk deflation, define cumulative process fall prices, include assets, even wage production, world economy experience 1930s japan partially undergo 1990s. such deflationary dynamic play today. but risk 2 bi central bankers’ speech reason inflation target symmetrical. we consider low inflation costly high inflation. and, therefore, risky central bank act late early. since start year, observe market-based measure inflation expectation fallen. nevertheless, late forecast provide ecb continue point gradual rise inflation come years: 0.1% 2016, 1.3% 2017 1.6% 2018. c) some argue challenge mean eurosystem long achieve price stability mandate. i don’t think so. current challenge call question mandate, change way fulfil it. some argue eurosystem rather change objective. i don’t think either. for credibility monetary policy, objective must maintained: 2% target medium-term “anchor”, time much volatility short-termism affect economy. most central bank advance economy share medium-term 2% objective, include unite state japan. this ecb’s objective since 2003, propose german former chief economist, otmar issing. ii. this bring second point: effective monetary policy? a) since summer 2014, implement series non-standard monetary policy measure complement cut key interest rates. these non-standard measure produce tangible results. they translate substantial ease borrow condition euro area companies. since june 2014, cost borrow business fall 80 basis points. without non-standard measures, estimate would low key rate around 100 basis point june 2014 achieve similar effect bank interest rates. this also help stimulate lend real economy: euro area, outstanding loan business go contraction –2.5% june 2014 growth 0.6% january 2016. the impact even mark france, outstanding business lend grow 4.8% year-on-year first month 2016 – high pace growth euro area and, what’s more, low rate interest. convergent estimate ecb eurosystem indicate that, thing equal, measure introduce since june 2014 add 1 percentage point inflation period 2015–2017, similar impact growth. in france, help boost 2015 growth 0.3 percentage point, estimate insee even put impact slightly high +0.4 pp. that represent 80,000 additional job economy – although structural reform generate last gain country’s growth employment. to conclude estimate effectiveness, imf – regard objective judge relevance economic policy – unequivocal assessment last g20 meet shanghai end february, saying, “the ecb’s asset purchase programme support recovery improve confidence financial condition [and] monetary policy remain accommodative”. b) why decide 10 march? the comprehensive package introduce ecb send two clear messages: first, decision guide mandate bring inflation back towards target 2% medium term. we firmly set objective, broad range instrument achieve it. in addition interest rates, also act on: bank credit ease new series target longer-term refinance operation (tltro 2); market finance via extend qe asset purchase programme, 80 billion eur per month include corporate bonds. on top that, guarantee shall continue long necessary – via forward guidance. so, negative interest rate part much comprehensive package. we think effective, naturally limits. furthermore, govern council give strong signal towards internationally cooperative attitude, decide opt tiering system exempt bank negative rates. bi central bankers’ speech 3 second message: priority promote finance real economy. the goal tltro 2 not, claimed, offset impact negative rate banks. it encourage bank lend corporations, smes household alike; similarly, extend asset purchase programme corporate bond particular benefit large french corporations. in words, secure provision credit business households, protect tension link market volatility. c) now, risks? i talk early risk nothing: need take action order bring inflation back towards 2%. that said, also need keep close eye possible negative side-effects monetary policy, notably financial stability. we actively monitor financial cycle, include france task fall high council financial stability set 2013. i take part 8th meet finance ministry last week. for time being, sign bubble form main finance markets: whole, development equity market appear line corporate profit forecasts, evolution bond yield also seem consistent outlook inflation growth. nor sign excessive credit growth financial system. nevertheless, remain vigilant aspect current macroeconomic financial environment. last week high council financial stability alert potential risk associate commercial real estate, especially: “the sharp rise demand investor certain market segment high level prices, particular office price paris area”. the hcsf’s assessment release public consultation come weeks. we ready, needed, take action macroprudential measures, prevent mitigate systemic risk might arise. in sum, monetary policy great deal counter weak inflation support economic activity – duty continue steadfast resolve: consistent objective, ready act right instruments, alert possible risks. however, i would like stress “monetary policy cannot game town”. other economic policy also crucial role play. this precisely member g20 reiterate shanghai 27 february: “monetary policy continue support economic activity ensure price stability, consistent central banks’ mandates, monetary policy alone cannot lead balance growth”. where sufficient margin so, fiscal policy must support demand – currently case france, country europe. moreover, structural reform remain absolutely vital france, encourage creation job business thus bring economy back full potential. at european level, need move finally towards true economic union, addition monetary union embody eurosystem. only optimise governance euro area optimise growth. the current extremely accommodative monetary policy stance create ideal condition carry much-needed reforms. it use instead excuse put off: europe france urgently need make opportunity, right now. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: the future euro area remark mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, le cercle europartenaires, paris, 21 march 2016. * * * the footnote find end speech. president guigou, minister jeanneney, ambassador meyer-landrut, excellencies, lady gentlemen, thank invite here. this morning i would like share think echo association’s motto “acting europe europeans”. role european central bank “acting europe europeans” could also ecb’s motto. one strength indeed european mandate. the govern council take monetary policy decision interest euro area whole, view ensure price stability. a quid pro quo independence, ecb accountable action people’s representatives, elect european parliament direct universal suffrage. at time many european citizen express doubt europe, duty european institution strengthen legitimacy reinforce democratic accountability show meet objective they’ve entrust with. regard democratic accountability, would wrong underestimate importance ecb place relationship public. recent study show people’s knowledge understand objective principle monetary policy influence inflation expectations[1] well trust european central bank.[2] at time, study indicate level knowledge understand improved. we take several initiative area last years, publish account monetary policy discussion diary executive board members. but certainly facilitate understand ecb’s role policy general public. rebuild trust europe imply european institution deliver objective assign part mandates. during crisis, ecb hesitate act decisively.[3] to preserve price stability, adopt accommodative monetary policy stance precedent. our measures, whether standard (i.e. relate key interest rates) non-standard, achieve several objectives. • they support demand good service euro area. a ecb’s president recently stated[4], model show half recovery euro area (as percentage gdp) past two year attributable monetary policy half mainly result low oil prices. • our monetary policy also improve finance condition remedied financial fragmentation. a result non-standard measures, credit condition improve across euro area[5]: may 2014 january 2016, interest rate loan decline significantly (by 84 basis point non-financial corporation 2 bi central bankers’ speech 68 basis point households). furthermore, steep decline observe fragile economy euro area.[6] • finally, decision help maintain trust single currency context financial instability high uncertainty. indeed, market confidence euro remain strong, public confidence too: accord eurobarometer data, trust euro virtually unchanged compare pre-crisis level.[7] the measure announce 10 march 2016 form substantial package give priority loan household businesses, thus support recovery. they underline determination fulfil mandate entrust u people europe: bring inflation back nearly 2%, show shortage tools. but ecb cannot single-handedly create condition sustainable recovery growth. this require concert effort term economic fiscal policies. while unemployment start decline euro area january (10.3% compare 11.9% two year earlier), ambitious reform still need euro area economies, give low growth potential high structural unemployment. the measure raise productivity improve business environment, include public infrastructure, essential increase investment boost job creation. it’s true limit room manoeuvre term use fiscal policy support growth, fiscal rule cannot stretch point would lose credibility. but country margin stability growth pact (which already partly use support refugees), country make tax structure favourable growth redirect public spend towards investment, research education.[8] our monetary policy provide favourable context reforms.[9] it sometimes argue monetary policy discourage government undertake necessary reforms. for one thing, idea belie facts: reform carry interest rate higher? also, fundamentally conflict set-up euro area, give ecb narrow mandate focus price stability. the ecb’s role police fiscal structural policies. it’s government impetus commission. the progress necessary economic monetary union we must also continue work strengthen economic monetary union order increase resilience economic shocks. this economic interest, course, it’s also factor term political stability. uncertainty, polarisation political fragmentation increase substantially aftermath financial crises[10]. such uncertainty harmful, economically speaking[11], tend make crisis resolution difficult. the crisis we’ve go exception. across europe, lead decline confidence european institutions. the intergovernmental dimension european decision-making mechanism also lead polarisation position among member states, stir nationalistic impulse hamper decision-making[12]. maintain approach would prevent establishment common growth strategy condemn u future low growth repeat crises. however, significant progress make member state remain determine preserve integrity euro. in particular, euro area adopt crisis resolution mechanism (the european stability mechanism) develop financial, fiscal economic supervisory tools. it also create single supervisory mechanism banks, entrust ecb, resolution mechanism bank crisis support single resolution fund. however, still much work do tackle vulnerability persist certain member states. the country-specific recommendations, year identify key objective tackle vulnerabilities, hardly act upon. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the time come initiate new economic convergence process, thus relaunching convergence effort euro area country agree prior adopt single currency[13]. after adoption, effort dwindle and, crisis, saw divergence term inflation levels, unit labour costs, current account balance level gdp per capita[14]. the abrupt adjustment necessitate crisis show economic social cost divergence. political convergence necessary condition economic convergence[15], imply make economic fiscal policy share competence manner policy relate internal market. this particularly true france germany, whose cooperation drive force. the idea isn’t always move towards harmonisation, rather give option adopt common solution make sense – common framework manage insolvent business household could, example, facilitate resolution non-performing loan contribute development cross-border investment. relaunching economic convergence process also essential eventually want set fiscal tool absorb shock euro area level, without create risk permanent, one-way transfers, part euro area’s initial “contract”. a i say elsewhere, establish new european social contract, design john rawls’ “veil ignorance”[16]. the private sector component risk-sharing also extremely important – unite states, capital credit market act buff around two-thirds economic shocks[17]; flexible economy free movement goods, service worker necessary condition smooth function monetary union. again, however, risk-sharing must accompany common framework avoid excessive risk concentration. this essence ongoing debate concern european deposit guarantee scheme capital market union. this economic convergence process could include timeline clearly define milestones, would ultimately bring deep integration fiscal sphere creation share fiscal tools. the management tools, include european stability mechanism, could entrust euro area treasury accountable european parliament. define mandate tool political issue presuppose democratic debate[18]. lady gentlemen, the progress european integration increase interdependence member states. but still haven’t draw necessary conclusion european politician still don’t tool would allow respond expectation place them. this shortcoming fee popular frustration european policies, sometimes point question european integration itself. there nothing inevitable status quo, but, move forward, need redefine common project. it take many year implement project. it urgent start define it. thank attention.

measure effectiveness”, federal reserve bank new york, new york city, 18 march 2016. * * * welcome. it great see today discus objective measurement supervision large, complex financial institutions. nearly eight year pass since financial crisis hit, push financial system u.s. economy brink, leave scar still evident today. the hardship financial crisis unfortunately still open wind many people, especially lose jobs, home businesses, struggle sharp fall value home stay current debt bills. understand go wrong avoid severe financial crisis future is, i sure, issue foremost mind distinguish speaker today, i exception. before continuing, let indicate i say today reflect view necessarily federal open market committee federal reserve system.1 a central part financial crisis failure near-failure many large financial institution – institution supervise federal reserve many – constrain ability play crucial role supply credit financial service business consumers. in wake crisis, considerable attention devote role supervisor – include new york feed – play meltdown. but much discussion take place without broad understand supervisor actually – scope, breadth, limit activity authorities. within official sector, make distinction regulation – rule govern financial institution must must do, supervision – involve monitoring, oversight enforce compliance law, regulation supervisory expectation firms’ governance, internal process controls, financial condition. this distinction regulation supervision often well-understood, thus complementary role always fully appreciated. address distinction, see it, one important motivation conference. through paper present today discussion note academic researchers, policymakers senior supervisor u.s. overseas, hope broaden understand role objective supervision. the goal spur conversation new research supervision try achieve best mean achieve ends. just important, want generate idea good ass effectiveness supervisory activities. in world limit resources, deploy people technology effective way limit disruption distress individual firm financial system, still foster efficient innovative financial system? in consider questions, good start point understand fully supervisor current environment. the paper present today largely aim achieve goal. a describe first paper – “supervising large, complex financial institutions: what supervisor do?” – bank supervision long integral component federal reserve’s 1 beverly hirtle, david lucca joseph tracy assist prepare remarks. 2 bi central bankers’ speech responsibilities. at broad level, federal reserve supervision large financial institution guide two key objectives: “enhancing resiliency firm low probability failure inability serve financial intermediary [and] reduce impact financial system broad economy event firm’s failure material weakness.”2 in address objectives, bank supervisor enforce law regulations, much supervision enforcement. the activity practice large, complex financial organization simply intricate evolve quickly fully describe ex ante regulation. bank supervision work concert regulation flexible element bank policy. supervisory policy standard can, do, evolve time reflect evolution practice bank industry financial markets. overall, supervisor guide mandate identify practice condition supervise firm threat safety soundness firm – and, course, ensure firm take necessary step promptly remediate conditions. critically, definition constitute “safe sound” hard-coded regulation, guide information analysis do supervisor federal reserve staff, economists, attorney market analysts. supervisory expectation standard express public guidance supervision regulation letter (sr letters), publicly-posted examination manual guidance. on day-to-day basis, bank supervisor collect information financial institution examination analysis. examiner look key aspect supervise firm’s business risk management functions. they use information ass adequacy firm’s system process identifying, measuring, monitor control risk firm financial sector generally. that said, ultimate responsibility risk identification risk management remain supervise institution. the federal reserve’s role ensure institution necessary strong process place achieve objective. a risk emerge, supervisor intervene, within realm safety soundness mandates, require bank take corrective action necessary. supervision reduce chance financial firm fails, never provide guarantee failure. supervisory policy undergo important change past years, especially context large financial institutions. bank supervision long focus solely safety soundness individual institution – so-called micro-prudential supervision – also focus implication financial stability generally. the evolve supervisory framework result number organizational change way supervision conduct new york feed federal reserve system broadly. a important change federal reserve system supervision largest, systemically important financial institution coordinate across district large institution supervision coordinate committee (liscc). the liscc system-wide committee, chair

confidential action make supervision seem mysterious outsiders, complicate evaluation policy may effective ineffective. for example, bank fails, evidence poor supervision, instead evidence even good supervision can’t prevent bank failures? improve ability diagnosis critical. i confident today’s panel paper discussion help u move forward direction. thank participate conference. bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter praet: interview la repubblica interview mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, la repubblica, conduct mr ferdinando giugliano m tonia mastrobuoni 15 march 2016 publish 18 march 2016. * * * can explain take big package measure last thursday? you put decision context heighten risk price stability objective. external shocks, mainly originate emerge markets, high market volatility crucial need avoid second-round effect warrant strong comprehensive package counteract adverse forces. we don’t gloomy assessment economy, domestic condition improved, financial condition clearly improved. but still fragile, external shock easily trigger vicious circle, downward pressure inflation. we want ensure happen, line mandate. it decide vast majority govern council, act forcefully ensure even accommodative monetary policy stance. what say composition measures? we discuss pro con different measures. on negative deposit rate: clear serve u well past, quite efficient ease financial conditions, include exchange rate, natural by-product difference monetary policy stance major currency areas. a proceed path negative interest rate deposit facility, also clear look impact profitability banks. bank important monetary transmission mechanism, look impact package bank sector. against background, decide favour package still make use change ecb interest rate increase weight measure aim credit easing. since market already anticipate three cut deposit rate year many money market trader turn positions. however, little bite time scrutinize digest complex package, market analyst finally tune again. be surprise strength market reaction? i expect short end go repriced rest package would dominate. look volatility, get end make sense economic point view. basically, substantial impact credit markets, good financial condition worsen credit spread go up. what dominate much tltro broaden corporate bond asset purchases. in term asset prices, i believe market conscious already monetary policy course major world currency area remain quite different trajectory reflect fundamentally different domestic underlie conditions. a say time past, fact significant increase difference monetary policy cycle major advance economy become ever evident near future. but think market right believe cuts? in introductory statement say clearly “expect key ecb interest rate remain present low level extend period time, well past horizon net asset purchases. so haven’t reach low bound? 2 bi central bankers’ speech no, haven’t. a central bank demonstrated, reach physical low bound. this re-composition tool-box mean throw away tools. if new negative shock worsen outlook finance condition adjust direction extent necessary boost economy inflation, rate reduction remain armoury. on corporate bond purchases: would instrument accessible company like, let’s say, volkswagen? yes, long investment grade. you corporate bond sector too, utilities, insurance, telecommunications, energy. don’t think enter dangerous territory choose distribute money to? for example, may end favor large companies. normally give liquidity bank exchange collateral. here, take direct exposure. the point is, want avoid influence relative prices. we ask committee work specific definition bond buy. we could buy something close index, exclude banks, avoid price distortion corporate bond market. the important point price go buy non-financial corporations, search bond market participant rebalance portfolio bond portfolio. so initial effect purchase spread market still function. can put like this: country like germany france big company high ratings, help corporate bond purchases, country like spain italy, le access type measure, help via tltro? it true jurisdiction many corporate bonds. but i said: initial effect purchase spread asset markets. so reinvestment liquidity. those sell corporate bond rebalance buy things. some people question need measure. they right say situation dramatic, i would stress still fragile. yes, see situation improving, as, example, unemployment come down. but reach “escape velocity” yet rocket bind gravity anymore. on tltro, say go make much difference, problem demand, supply credit. a show bank lend survey, credit demand pick also see actual bank credit growth number improving. so give push development proceed maybe accelerate. do overlook following: in last tranche tltro i could borrow le le time, loan maturity, september 2018, environment rate falling. this time it’s different: one year still borrow four year condition prevail time. and, bank benefit negative rate low deposit facility rate meet threshold credit growth. all quite bold. it certainly facilitate cheap fund bank replace expensive fund instrument tltro ii. don’t think discussion germany harmful accommodative stance ecb lack analysis wrong business models, example one sparkassen? what experience bank sector difficult attentive that, also true bank rethink activity fundamentally. i mention digitalization, big challenge banks. it potential change business model fundamentally. the interest rate favourable factor, one factors. and long positive impact economy negative rates, good growth, few npls, see positive factor banks. the problem bi central bankers’ speech 3 bank 2016, medium term, situation become persistent business model adjusted, profitability become major issue. the staff projection don’t include impact new measures. what impact inflation growth package? the measure take bring u close 2 per cent target end 2018. but don’t forget, measure take like app suppose remain place long inflation reach sustainable adjustment path inflation. it must sustainable. we yet there. in forward guidance said: expect interest rate low low extend period time, well past horizon net asset purchases, currently horizon least march 2017. can i ask what’s leave toolbox? could see “helicopter drops”? there lot skepticism recently monetary policy, deliver say “your toolbox empty”. we say, “no it’s true”. there many thing do. the question appropriate, time. i think time have, appropriate discus next set measures. but principle ecb could print cheque send people? yes, central bank it. you issue currency distribute people. that’s helicopter money. helicopter money give people part net present value future seigniorage, profit make future banknotes. the question is, opportune make recourse sort instrument really extreme sort instrument. there thing theoretically do. there several example literature. so say haven’t reach limit toolbox, i think that’s true. in germany, big economy europe, distortive discussion ecb. aren’t worry discussion dangerous maintain trust within eurozone? i think responsibility problem collective. i think everyone look point view other. don’t forget, lot excess german save go spain, spanish bank system. i don’t deny problem creditor country get bad respect low cut deposit rate. it true look this, true decide recomposition toolbox, take account. but, fundamentally, issue much negative rates, main issue mistrust willingness indebted country really seize opportunity forcefully address problems. this much drive german view. italy often accuse enough solve structural problems. what change could really unlock growth italy? the real question “what drive prosperity?” i think prosperity link education, productivity, rule law, property right things, certainly monetary policy. in italy productivity really start stop grow early 1990s. i think fundamental reflection country. some key question like efficiency judicial system, labour market reforms, liberalization services, part tackled. but i think agenda remain unfortunately significant. to give examples, i worry insufficient spread ict technology. business investment recover everywhere, demand recover investment following, one weak investment performance italy. i think minister finance government well aware priority are, need done. one thing haven’t mention fiscal policy. in rome one often hear argument italy allow expand fiscal policy really help 4 bi central bankers’ speech recovery. one also hear european fiscal rule fit purpose. how respond that? experience tell always reason postpone fiscal save fiscal policy often procyclical. so appropriate response experience suitable fiscal rule follow full cycle. yes, risk wrong things. for example, 2011, necessarily mention italy focus european level, consolidation necessary. however, composition could growth friendly. instead raise taxes, spend could cut, instead cut investment infrastructure, government consumption growth could reduced. and particularly current juncture, investment penalize encourage country like italy. fiscal consolidation always lot composition, timing. successful consolidation could involve pension reforms, spread consolidation years. in respect, past italy go long way improve fiscal sustainability pension reform. i know italy discussion coordinate tax reduction. what i see fiscal policy slightly expansionary last year year. well-designed structural reform packages, entail short-term cost clear impact growth potential, take account commission may affect temporarily adjustment toward achievement fiscal objectives. but course low fiscal adjustment commensurate beneficial impact reform growth potential sustainability public finances. do think haircut greek debt? if look wealth improvement greece term disposable income, crisis spectacular go way quickly. so basically shaky grounds, large current account deficit, borrow money, point corrected. all make cautious say support recovery absence convince programme reforms. greece extreme case, demonstration monetary union unprepared deal financial cycle correction, especially countries. fortunately, new institution put place, european stability mechanism, single supervisory mechanism, single resolution mechanism. but yet, bank union real bank union yet. who stop third pillar bank union? it always problem. all accept it, trust member mutualized system address think risks. do accept argument one need find way limit risk bank sector? yes, question define that. that’s difference are. the single deposit guarantee rarely call small institutions. there plenty bail-inable asset reach small deposits. this deposit guarantee something distracts. we it. we could take risk guarantee. a common deposit insurance would help, it’s important allow european bank able operate euro area single entity. even small deposit guarantee scheme big political problem germany. i think personally announce objective roadmap. we roadmap deposit guarantee scheme, far away. we spell paper consider require condition mutualise in, example, 5 years. that would create new environment banking. bi central bankers’ speech 5 but german roadmap: say government bond must risk-free want common bankruptcy law. these difficult conditions. a sovereign debt, learn crisis risk-free, clear. on hand, sovereign debt play important role economy, financial sector. so one need thorough reflection this. that’s sustainability public finance key. that’s one can’t say “let’s low tax economy follow self-finance tax cut”. i think one need careful sovereign debt key pillar financial system. a final question brexit. do contingency plan place ecb? brexit part tendency say independent nation good collective solutions. i confident voter understand national solution worse, reinforce europe opposite. bi central bankers’ speech 1 haruhiko kuroda: innovation payment fintech – central bank’s perspective remark mr haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, forum payment settlement systems, tokyo, 17 march 2016. * * * introduction it great pleasure welcome today forum payment settlement systems. i. innovation payment fintech recent year see number development financial services, include area payments. innovation combine finance new technology, call “fintech,” become particular focus attention. it clear supply-side demand-side factor behind developments. on supply side, advance technological innovation relate information communication progressing. the process power computer continue grow rapidly, computer analyze huge amount data – is, “big data” – relatively short period time. there also rapid spread form infrastructure internet mobile terminals, easily accessible wide range people. in country – particularly emerge develop nation exist financial service provide bank penetrate sufficiently – new service mobile payment generate large expectation term “financial inclusion” – promotion access financial services. on demand side, globalization economy continue progress, transaction make across border well time zones. new form economic activity arise abroad – “e-commerce” “sharing economy” – lifestyle diversified. reflect developments, need financial service grow increasingly diverse complex. for example, emerge need payment method compatible internet shop weekend midnight well low-value cross-border remittances. there also grow need use form information associate payment utilize loyalty cards. a i point out, judge factor supply demand side affect development fintech. if consider financial business strong characteristic “information industry,” surprise development information technology large influence, especially finance. for example, credit, investment, risk management base accumulation great deal information analysis new technology large role play. in financial services, particularly payments, transmission information significant importance. thus, natural recent development information technology generate number innovation service area payments. ii. benefit merit innovation innovation financial service potential improve efficiency enhance access financial services. they also bring wide range benefit economy whole. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this happen several ways. first, expansion frontier financial service enlarge possibility new economic activities. for example, people lack access financial service become able use mobile payments, potential customer base many business expand new business target people might arise easily. moreover, payment method fast, inexpensive, ubiquity, expand frontier business use – example, business provide e-commerce, music, software precisely take account customer needs. second, new technology arise financial innovation possibly apply means. for example, distribute ledger – technology underpin digital currency – receive considerable attention way secure accuracy ledger verification users, without rely trust third party (that is, central operator government central banks). and distribute ledger consideration application record transfer financial asset stock well management registry book land houses. to sum up, innovation finance include payment back innovation information technology potential boost economic welfare revitalize economic activity interaction range businesses. now, i would like emphasize three point i consider important maximize benefit innovation lead development economy. the first point public’s great sensitivity innovation information technology financial requirements. at present, information technology develop rapidly new type business emerge one other. accordingly, involve provide financial service – include financial institution – increasingly expect pay close attention change public’s requirement development technology applied, sufficiently aggressive flexible use new technology provide concrete financial services. the second point importance communication many entity across business categories. to expand financial service capture diversify need adapt new technologies, useful form new network compose entity financial institution high-tech venture company enjoy advantage information technology data usage. it also important ensure communication, cooperation, sound competition among entities. the third point acquire public’s trust regard financial infrastructure. financial service use internet mobile terminal spreading, new type threat financial infrastructure – hack cyber attack – gain prominence. if concern spread countermeasure threat insufficient, might lead doubt innovative financial service themselves. therefore, provider new financial service prepare sufficiently new risk threats. in regard, important draw technology help enhance security encryption technique biometric authentication. iii. the central bank innovation payment lastly, i would like talk bank japan’s involvement payment settlement system perspective innovation payments. the bank issue banknotes, familiar type payment instrument. we also operate bank japan financial network system, boj-net, enable settlement large-value fund japanese government bond among financial institutions. consider fact fund ultimately settle use central bank money – is, cash central bank’s current account deposit – settlement infrastructure provide bank serf essential infrastructure japanese economy. bi central bankers’ speech 3 it also crucial central bank maintain stability improve efficiency payment settlement systems, include provide private sector. in regard, bank – oversight private-sector payment settlement system – monitors, communicate and, necessary, encourage system achieve stability improve functionality. concurrently, bank enhance boj-net. in oct 2015, new boj-net fully launched. it highly flexible system us late information technology offer enhance accessibility, thus provide powerful base development innovation payment settlement provision new financial services. furthermore, february 2016, boj-net extend operate hour 9 p.m. (japan standard time) achieve overlap almost asian market day european market noon. in addition, take part number forum discus issue relate payment settlement system – include committee payment market infrastructure bank international settlement – bank actively participate international discussion innovation payment payment settlement systems. from standpoint central bank, bank monitor closely great interest development innovation payment payment settlement systems, range perspectives. these include safety payments, efficiency payment service convenience users, stability financial system, influence finance intermediation economy. to make innovation payment take place due innovation information technology truly useful user financial service economy, important develop network win-win relationship wide range entity beyond traditional financial industry. the bank, nation’s central bank, firmly commit catalyst foster developments. moreover, i please announce bank soon establish “fintech center” payment settlement system department. we aim reinforce effort new wave fintech contribute enhance financial service achieve sustainable growth japan’s economy. i would like close remark wish today’s forum payment settlement system generate new knowledge perspectives, stimulate discussion lead development financial market vitalization economic activities. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 raghuram rajan: india global economy text first ramnath goenka memorial lecture dr raghuram rajan, governor reserve bank india, new delhi, 12 march 2016. * * * i thank dr. prachi mishra team assistance. thank invite deliver first ramnath goenka lecture. a know, shri goenka freedom fighter, build indian express national newspaper. in time, arguably best investigative newspaper country. he instrumental highlight excess emergency, probably contribute indira gandhi’s defeat lift it. he continue tireless scourge corruption government high-handedness, responsible unsettle many minister business tycoon. it would fit lecture memory speak effort make india today increase transparency curb corruption. however, i say i need elsewhere. instead, i speak today india’s engagement global economy, best manage turbulent time the global economy find hard restore pre-great recession growth rate – every report imf seemingly downgrade previous growth forecasts. why recovery slow? the immediate answer financial boom precede great recession leave industrial country overhang debt, debt, whether governments, households, banks, hold back growth. while remedy may write debt revive demand indebted, debatable whether additional debt fuel demand sustainable. at rate, large-scale debt write-off seem politically difficult even economically warranted. but perhaps debt overhang point deep cause; debt-fueled demand great recession, lead debt overhang now, hide fall global potential growth, perhaps difficult-to-understand consequence population age across industrial world, slowdown productivity growth. structural reforms, typically one increase competition, foster innovation, drive institutional change, way raise potential growth. but hurt protect constituency become accustom rent get status quo. moreover, gain constituency benefit typically late uncertain. no wonder jean-claude juncker, former luxembourg prime minister, say height euro crisis, “we know do, don’t know get re-elected we’ve do it!” instead, industrial country engage ever aggressive monetary policy moves. this impose tremendous risk emerge market like ours, face surge capital inflow one day investor go “risk-on” mode see outflow next switch risk off. at time, overcapacity competitor country threaten key industries. what india do? what india environment international investor manic depressive behavior country strive extra growth? importantly, global growth uncertain, make sure domestic environment promote strong, sustainable, stable growth. this require firm platform macroeconomic stability. let elaborate. the recent central budget emphasize fiscal prudence adhere past commitments, even allocate resource towards capital spend focus structural reforms, 2 bi central bankers’ speech especially agriculture. the subsequent fall government bond yield suggest market investor calm government’s overall message. fiscal consolidation, combine low commodity prices, also lead low current account deficit. inflation also clearly since day double-digit cpi inflation long ago. the rbi’s inflation-focused monetary framework strengthen constitution monetary policy committee moot finance bill. while rbi governor long able set monetary policy unilaterally, i believe shift decision committee economy’s interest. not committee aggregate multiple view good individual can, offer continuity, le subject undue pressure. i believe monetary reform government stand one signal achievements. the last leg stabilization agenda clean stress asset bank sector bank room lend again. the problem past bank simply enough power force promoter pay, put stress asset back track. unlike develop countries, function bankruptcy system, though bill currently parliament. therefore, first create effective out-of-court resolution system. have do that, work bank recognize resolve stress assets, even get raise capital necessary. our intent clean fully provision bank balance sheet march 2017. perhaps hard aspect stabilization agenda persuade economics commentariat need macroeconomic stability growth expectations. the constant call economic sirens, seek lure economy onto shoal economic distress, “lord, give u stability, yet!” growth always important, matter risk build up. usually, siren call doctrinaire (after all, academic economist care fiscal deficits), practical (does really matter npa recognize quarter three later), appreciate indian reality (everyone may say hate inflation one really want bear pain disinflationary process). i believe process prove siren wrong. give inhospitable world economy two successive drought india, either would throw economy tail spin past, focus macroeconomic stabilization must part explanation 7 percent growth, low inflation, low current account deficit unlike emerge market counterparts. now, build sound base. what particularly important engage world economy. i want talk specifically trade, exchange rate, capital flows, ideas. international trade for first time decades, global trade consistently grow slowly global output. there number possible explanations; country get richer, non-traded service constitute great fraction gdp, cause gdp grow fast trade. also, trade-intensive capital goods’ investment mute global overcapacity, trade grow slowly gdp. finally, industrial country become competitive, china move value chain, input go final product source inside country rather outside country. some global supply chain therefore contracting. for reasons, heady day indian trade good service expand double digit pace probably memory time. it useful examine recent trade data see india compare rest world. figure 1 suggest growth indian export good service broadly mirror emerge markets. bi central bankers’ speech 3 source. imf balance payment statistics. emerge market (ems) include brazil, china, indonesia, mexico, russian, south africa, thailand, turkey, india. the black line show simple average growth rate across ems. most recently, course, emerge market commodity exporter hit low prices. nevertheless, indian good export seem bad recently good export emerge market (see figure 2). source. imf balance payment statistics. emerge market (ems) include brazil, china, indonesia, mexico, russian, south africa, thailand, turkey, india. the black line show simple average growth rate across ems. 4 bi central bankers’ speech at time, growth indian service export seem somewhat better, perhaps country like unite state export service recover strongly. of course, difference short periods, probably unwise draw strong conclusion them. what one probably take away india alone suffer fall-off trade. source. imf balance payment statistics. emerge market (ems) include brazil, china, indonesia, mexico, russian, south africa, thailand, turkey, india. the black line show simple average growth rate across ems. however, indian trade slows, industry body urge authority something. of course, country experience slow trade, remedy may beyond control indian authorities. while examine possible dump certain industries, careful remedy increase price protect industry render domestic industry uncompetitive. it time slow trade pundit look exchange rate argue overvalued. of course, i argue alone experience fall trade, let u examine exchange rate. the exchange rate when people think exchange rate, think rupee’s value dollar. a figure 4 indicates, rupee seem weaken 6% dollar since begin 2015, approximately time relative underperformance good export started. this depreciation help exports, though effect depreciation show lag. bi central bankers’ speech 5 but note currency depreciate dollar also. so gain advantage versus u producers, foreign producer may become even competitive exchange rate depreciate more. economist therefore advise look index nominal effective exchange rate, compare rupee’s value versus exchange rates, weigh share trade. sources. rbi imf. the index normalize january 2013=100. an increase denote appreciation. by metric figure 5, rupee remain relatively flat since early 2015. what give dollar, gain euro real, overall, trade-weighted terms, rupee flat. but wait minute, economist friend say. inflation india high inflation countries. this affect competitiveness. if widget cost dollar make year 6 bi central bankers’ speech ago unite states, ₹63 india then, indian producer would competitive unite state dollar worth ₹63. but inflation india 5% zero unite states, would cost indian manufacturer ₹66.2 make today. if rupee stay ₹63 dollar, indian manufacturer would become uncompetitive today – u producer would able manufacture widget cost equivalent ₹63 only. in words, retain competitiveness, rupee depreciate inflation differential vi vi trade partner. an index competitive call “real effective exchange rate”. think nominal effective exchange rate adjust inflation. the high is, le exchange rate depreciate offset inflation, uncompetitive are. sources. rbi imf. the index normalize january 2013=100. an increase denote appreciation. figure 6, i plot real effective exchange rate, show age old truth interpretation eye beholder. if columnist want blame exchange rate export slowdown, look index low point september 2013 argue appreciate 20% (based imf measure). of course, would hard argue low point exchange rate reach september 2013 represent equilibrium rate. moreover, export quite well relative emerge market much period (see figure 1).1 indeed, last year good export slowed, real effective exchange rate rather flat. so someone want absolve exchange rate blame point recent period. 1 this true even focus attention manufacture export only. base data wto, manufacture export grow annual average rate 6.3% india 2013–14, grow 3% average emerge markets. bi central bankers’ speech 7 but another reason absolve exchange rate accusation overvaluation. the real exchange rate one measure competitiveness. productivity also matters. in rich country, firm already productivity frontier, typically improve productivity innovation. in poor country, productivity improve simply reduce exist bottleneck move little close productivity frontier adoption already-known best practices. productivity india, example, improve simply good road build factory rail head, firm manage inventory better. one reason indian manufacture gdp grow fast firm experience little increase final sale firm focus improve productivity. so offset rise real exchange rate productivity differential enjoy respect rest world. assume conservatively 2 percent year, much real appreciation economist complain offset productivity differentials. the bottom line even though indian trade slowing, slowdown similar happen elsewhere, significant portion due fall commodity prices, small share due fall trade volumes. while good export may suffer little last year, early discern clear pattern, certainly hard pin slow exchange rate.2 the goldilocks rate it worthwhile push discussion little though. if rbi could press button get exchange rate desire (as economist imagine possible) aim strong rupee weak rupee? non-economists typically advocate strong rupee – convey national strength, buy stuff rupee go abroad, import cheaper. the non-economist consumer focused. of course, precisely domestic tourism domestic production disadvantage relative tourism abroad foreign production many economist prefer weak rupee. yet modern day, producer-focused, mercantilists acknowledge undervaluation subsidy domestic producer pay domestic consumer savers. the domestic consumer pay high price foreign goods, interest rate keep artificially low reduce cost hold enormous foreign exchange reserve build intervention. there cost long run also. a sizeable portion investment make country base artificially low exchange rate turn uncompetitive exchange rate normalizes. one might argue reflect experience japan 1990s possibly experience part chinese industry today. an undervalue exchange rate might make sense past country weak firm small domestic markets. india different position today export-led east asian tiger embark growth path. the ideal exchange rate u neither strong weak, right. typically, market force get goldilocks rate. yet circumstance rapid capital inflow outflow move rate level unlikely support fundamentals. while rbi would claim know precisely equilibrium level exchange rate give point time, intervene moderate adjustment whenever believe movement extreme, drive sentiment, likely reversed. our intent prevent overshoot undue volatility, rather stand way need adjustment. 2 in fact, focus manufacture export perhaps le susceptible high frequency price movements, base limit data recent year find magnitude slowdown india last year comparable even le many emerge markets. 8 bi central bankers’ speech of course, temporary irrationality market overwhelm central bank. much like bank run, fall currency prompt fall foreign investor attempt get lose everything. to maintain orderly movement rupee versus currencies, believe need three ingredients. first, good policy ensure macroeconomic stability convince investor money safe medium term. i already discuss earlier. second, focus attract stable capital flow stay long run. this mean resist temptation open much short-term- well foreign currency denominate debt flow good times, matter low interest rate charge. in last years, limit foreign portfolio debt investment short term rupee debt instruments. it investor cannot sell long term bond leave moment’s notice, investor long maturity bond likely little stable investor want overnight exposure only. at time, steadily expand investment limit foreign investor government bonds, continue so. our new external commercial borrow rule encourage infrastructure project project limit foreign earn either issue rupee masala loans, borrow really long term tenors. this limit risk require repay exchange rate move adversely them. finally, government encourage foreign investor “make india”. one offshoot campaign sizeable rise foreign direct investment, stable sort investment. with two month leave year go, net fdi already second high level ever, comfortable high current account deficit. the bottom line policy towards foreign capital flow one steady liberalization, try tempt cheap finance, draw risk-bearing capital need finance growth. we intend foreign investor get decent return intend continuously ease entry exit country. finally, third line defence foreign exchange reserves. we intervene exchange market smooth volatility, typically find buy dollar certain time sell dollar others give year. bi central bankers’ speech 9 how increase export so exchange rate unlikely helpful tool quest increase make india, export more? the answer simple – improve productivity build infrastructure; improve human capital good schools, colleges, vocational on-the-job training; simplify business regulation taxation; improve access finance. fortunately, government focus on. i often asked, “what industry focus on, encourage?” learn past, i would say let u encourage anything; might sure way kill it. instead, let u make sure create good business environment support kind activity, let myriad entrepreneur figure new interest business create. in 1990s, iits pandit jawaharlal nehru create supply engineer command public sector height economy instead supply manager programmer body shop focus deal y2k bug. these turn evolve world-beating software giants. while government create software industry, inconsequential mean emergence development. similarly, let u enable business activity try impose much design it. idea analysis before concluding, let emphasize one additional area engagement world, idea analysis. today, seat international tables, many country want draw u bilateral multilateral treaties. when unimportant, use rail proposal inimical us, know would make iota difference. a get power, need develop capability use effectively. today, unfortunate reality international meet still dominate old powers. but le brute power politics power ideas, agenda setting, organization dominate. agenda g-20 still largely set element old g-7, often find already agree prefer approach. it big power disagree rest u hope influence outcomes. the fault power structure, us. unless amongst emerge world put forward agenda, build intellectual analytical basis push it, create coalition support it, chance move forward. encouragingly, brics discus policy issue try develop common approaches, need more. we also need build coalition sympathetic industrial countries. in india, need build capacity think tank university inform policy maker approach shape international policy agenda. we need well prepare negotiate bilateral multilateral treaties, wake late fact give away house little return. with careful analysis, engagement, coalition build able influence global agenda, stop see obstructionist ultimately powerless country may past. conclusion let conclude. shri ramnath goenka focus unearth fact would help move public debate forward. all often, public debate generate noise illumination, learn example set. a cope global slowdown, frame policy go forward, need debate policy path be, base facts, empirical analysis, sound arguments. i lay view. i look forward alternative viewpoints. thank listen me. bi central bankers’ speech 1 raghuram rajan: towards rule monetary game talk dr raghuram rajan, governor reserve bank india, imf/government india conference “advancing asia: invest future”, new delhi, 12 march 2016. * * * this talk draw extensively paper entitle “rules monetary game” dr. prachi mishra reserve bank india. there area robust growth around world, imf repeatedly reduce growth forecast recent quarters. this period slow growth particularly dangerous industrial country number emerge market need high growth quell rise domestic political tensions. policy attempt divert growth others rather create new growth, create growth foster instability elsewhere, likely circumstances. even create condition sustainable growth, need new rule game, enforce impartially multilateral organizations, ensure country adhere international responsibilities. i propose sketch could talk. why growth weak? why world find hard restore pre-great recession growth rates? the immediate answer financial boom precede great recession leave industrial country overhang debt, debt, whether governments, households, banks, hold back growth.1 while remedy may write debt revive demand indebted, debatable whether additional debt fuel demand sustainable. at rate, large-scale debt write-off seem politically difficult even economically warranted. but perhaps debt overhang point deep cause; debt-fueled demand great recession, lead debt overhang now, hide structural slowdown global potential growth, perhaps difficult-to-understand consequence population age across industrial world, slowdown productivity growth. structural reforms, typically one increase competition, foster innovation, drive institutional change, way raise potential growth. but hurt protect constituency become accustom rent get status quo. moreover, gain constituency benefit typically late uncertain. no wonder jean-claude juncker, luxembourg’s prime minister, say height euro crisis, “we know do, don’t know get re-elected we’ve do it!” the growth imperative if indeed fundamental industrial world has, will, grow slowly new technology new market come rescue, would politically easy settle slow growth? after all, per caput income high industrial countries, year slow growth would devastate aggregate level. why much political need growth industrial countries? one reason need fulfil government commitment debt social security entitlements. another reason growth necessary inter-generational equity, 1 see interest evidence atif mian amir sufi, house debt (princeton university press, new jersey, 2014) cross-country evidence carmen reinhart kenneth rogoff, this time different (princeton university press, new jersey, 2008). for illuminate overall view global financial crisis policy remedies, see martin wolf, the shift shocks: what we’ve learn have still learn financial crisis (penguin usa 2015). 2 bi central bankers’ speech especially young, benefit job creation, generation work pay commitment old generations. give young also cohort take streets, growth essential social harmony. a third reason that, within country, long period par growth lead unemployed become unemployable. growth also extremely important emerge market develop countries, population typically younger, poorer, social safety net thinner. with everyone look growth, limit political room structural reform substantial time lag pay off, every country look alternatives. the monetary dilemma industrial country central banker know monetary policy cannot substitute structural reform elevate growth potential. they different problem country’s political authorities, though root may common. inflation flirt low limit inflation mandate threaten stay low long. with interest rate already low, pundit constantly remind “inflation always everywhere monetary phenomenon” go beyond ordinary monetary policy, lose credibility risk violate domestic mandate. no central banker claim tools. for all, else fails, “helicopter drop”, central bank print money literally spray street create inflation (more prosaically, send check every citizen, perhaps poor likely spend). but reach pas monetary finance fiscal deficit, whole range unconventional tool range various form asset purchase term “quantitative easing” negative interest rates. but central banker flirt ever unconventional policies, worth ask policy really move economy towards desire objective. monetary policy work public’s expectations. if ever aggressive policy convince public calamity around corner, may tempt large segment save rather spend. the effect magnify sense consequence today’s policy (distorted asset prices, high government debt, high private debt etc.) reverse future great cost system. perhaps bad public belief policy never change, take leverage position asset commensurate that. while may help central bank achieve objective short run, shift asset price policy inevitably change, effect exacerbate enhance leverage, could create enormous dislocation. while jury still effect unconventional monetary policy domestic economy, seem fair say benefit seem diminish year effort, cost increasing. also, structural impediment primary cause slow growth, one could ask unconventional monetary policy, give public impression something done, actually take pressure politician undertake require policy action – state monetary policy game town, central banker make game town. unfortunately, give domestic inflation mandate, central banker cannot try anything could work. and lead important consequence policy neglected, external spillover effects. spillover monetary policy all monetary policy external spillover effects. if country reduce domestic interest rates, exchange rate also typically depreciates, help exports. the key, however, normal circumstances, “demand creating” effect low interest rate domestic consumption investment tend substantial, “demand switching” effect low exchange rate enhance external demand country’s good likely bi central bankers’ speech 3 relatively small. indeed, one could argue spillover rest world could positive net, enhance domestic demand draw substantial imports, offset high exports. matter le clear circumstance find today, unconventional policy country adopting. for instance, interest rate sensitive segment economy constrain exist debt, low rate may little effect enhance domestic demand, continue demand switch effect exchange rate. similarly, unconventional “quantitative easing” policy buy asset long term bond domestic player may certainly low long rate may effect domestic investment aggregate capacity utilization low. indeed, argue earlier, saver may respond increase distortion asset price save more. and certain domestic institutional investor pension fund insurance company need long term bond meet future claims, may respond buy bond le distort market abroad. such search yield depreciate exchange rate. the primary effect policy domestic demand may “demand switching” effect low exchange rate rather demand create channel. of course, country engage demand switch policies, could race bottom, one good off. nevertheless, country may find hard get policy immediate effect country exit might serious appreciation exchange rate fall domestic activity. the bottom line simply policy call monetary, unconventional otherwise, may beneficial net world. that monetary policy external spillover mean justified. what matter net spillovers. one source spillover trade channel, relative magnitude demand create versus demand switch effects. another source spillover cross border capital flows, effect financial stability elsewhere. of course, country’s international responsibility regard murky, central bank’s domestic mandate explicit. this lead possibly serious asymmetry responsibility. if central bank danger fall low bind inflation mandate, example, require adopt possible policy get inflation back target, matter external effect. indeed, even intervene directly exchange rate sustain unidirectional way, though internationally could see abdication international responsibility accord old standards. in current state affairs, industrial country central bank find sort way justify policy international fora, without acknowledge unmentionable – exchange rate may primary channel transmission, adverse capital flow spillover may sizeable. of course, central bank consider “spillbacks” policy abroad, may small fraction overall spillovers. in follows, i examine sensible rule monetary behavior assume domestic mandate trump international responsibility. rule game what would basis new rules? a describe elsewhere, state theoretical model empirical work allow clear cut identification spillover consequences.2 rather wait clear identification, may long coming, perhaps start policy could broadly rat base analytical input discussion. to use drive analogy, police generally see adverse spillovers, even encourage global community rat green, policy 2 see prachi mishra raghuram rajan, “rules monetary game”, 2016, mimeo. 4 bi central bankers’ speech use temporarily care could rat orange, policy avoid time could rat red. to establish ratings, effect policy see time, rather point time. in general, policy likely net adverse outside spillover time could rat red avoided. such policy obviously include small positive effect home country (where policy action originates) combine large negative effect foreign country (where spillover occur). for example, unconventional monetary policy action lead small positive effect export emerge economy (ems) feeble recovery source country large capital outflow asset price bubble ems, policy could rat red. global welfare would decrease policy. if policy positive effect home foreign countries, therefore global welfare, would definitely rat green. conventional monetary policy would typically fall category, would raise output home economy, create demand export foreign economy. a green rat policy would, however, assume stage financial credit cycle home foreign economy financial stability risk low interest rate likely limited. a policy could also rat green act booster shoot jump-start large home economy, create temporary negative spillover foreign economy. even temporary adverse spillover foreign countries, policy, effect home economy growth demand foreign goods, eventually provide offset large positive spillover rest world. of course, important home economy, receive booster shoot pick growth, follow policy (such hold exchange rate) minimize positive spillover countries. a policy rat red static basis could thus deem green base implicit commitment time. it possible visualize policy large positive effect originate country (because value policy country’s relative size) sustain small negative effect rest world. global welfare, crudely speaking, may go policy, even though welfare outside originate country go down. while hard rate policy without go specifics, may correctly belong orange category – permissible time sustain basis. even conventional monetary policy raise growth home economy could fall orange category country stage financial cycle low interest rate lead significant financial stability risk home foreign economies. clearly, foreign country may policy room respond, take account. perhaps right way measure spillover foreign country measure welfare without policy question` welfare policy implement response initiated. so, instance, home country a zero low bind may initiate quantitative ease (qe), foreign country b may respond cut interest rate avoid capital inflow exchange rate appreciation. the spillover effect qe would base b’s welfare qe undertake versus b’s welfare qe initiate responds. overall, whether policy rat red, green, orange would depend number factor time dimension; stage financial business cycle home foreign countries; whether policy action constitute booster shoot jump start economy give mild boost employ sustain period; whether standard transmission channel clog warrant use unconventional policies; whether foreign country room adopt buff policies; whether spillover impact poor country weak institution le room respond, etc. bi central bankers’ speech 5 move forward the next crucial question is: measure analyze spillovers, would appropriate forum discus spillover effect specific policies, rat policies? how proceed? international discussion give constraint political difficulty international organization operate, may appropriate start group eminent academic reasonable representation across globe, measure analyze spillovers, grade policies. perhaps next step would agreement discus policy international spillover effect meet imf board, imfc, bi g-20. the discussion would base background papers, would commission traditional source like imf, well non-traditional source like group academic em central banks. these paper would attempt isolate nature spillover well magnitude, attempt preliminary classification policy actions. almost surely, lot fuzziness color attribute wide range recent policies. but discussion help participant understand policy could classify good model data, well model data gather improved. country responsibility formal rule when policy discuss get good understanding, policy affect international monetary system table. importantly, simply denote policy label “monetary” give automatic free pas fall central bank’s domestic mandate. what important neither policymaker’s mandate, profess intent, instruments, actual channel transmission outcomes, include spillovers. policymakers respond background paper state explain policy actions, attempt persuade international community fall green orange zones. international conference perhaps free frank discussion may enough get country adopt responsible policies. if not, international community build understand constitute sensible rule game, label policy context, perhaps international conference may warrant see community’s understand beneficial rule implemented. at time, discussion central bank’s international responsibility fit domestic mandate may warranted. while recognize political difficulty alter central bank’s mandate, conference deliberate international responsibility weave exist mandates. it also decide whether new international agreement along line bretton wood needed, whether much accomplish small change international monetary fund’s article agreement. role fund what role would fund play? the obligation member authority fund derive article agreement. section 1 article iv make clear imf member general obligation “to collaborate member fund assure orderly exchange arrangement promote stable system exchange rates”. the mean “general obligation” unclear article could “relied upon basis fund 6 bi central bankers’ speech call member take specific action refrain take specific actions” (imf, 2006). article iv state “in particular, member shall … (iii) avoid manipulate exchange rate international monetary system order prevent effective balance payment adjustment gain unfair competitive advantage member …..”. further, the principle guidance members’ exchange rate policy (originally 1977, amend 2007) note “ … c. member take account intervention policy interest members, include whose currency intervene”. although article agreement the principle define “manipulation” detail, imf (2007) narrow scope manipulation note “manipulation exchange rate carry policy target – actually affect – level exchange rate. moreover, manipulation may cause exchange rate move may prevent movement.” in practice, may difficult determine policy target attain level exchange rate. direct policy action intervention foreign exchange market, indirect policy monetary, fiscal, trade policy regulation capital movements, regardless intent purpose, affect level exchange rate, interpret “manipulation”. the interpretation article agreement could perhaps broaden scope include wide range policies, primarily effect exchange rates, therefore beggar-thy-neighbor consequences. while article agreement include members’ obligation relation exchange rate policies, global financial stability implication country specific policy touch upon anywhere articles. members’ obligation consider relation domestic growth objectives. for example, base articles, country weak economy pursue loose monetary policy stimulate output employment. despite implication policy financial stability countries, country would argue policy line article iv, section 1(i) allow member “(i) … direct economic financial policy toward objective foster orderly economic growth reasonable price stability …”. more generally, fund’s article may need alter base discussion rule game. moreover, although broad surveillance fund members’ exchange rate policies, policy significant financial sector spillovers, perhaps public statement policy signal effects, country obligate follow fund advice unless program. the pertinent question, therefore, might fund really executive board determine particular country violation obligation new rule game? hopefully, clear focus downside particular country’s action rest world lead political economic pressure around world make country cease desist. the clear eventual rule game, likely outcome. conclusion give importance spillover monetary policies, especially face globally low inflation, important start build global consensus get good outcome world. nevertheless, economic analysis issue early stage, unlikely get strong policy prescription soon, let alone international agreement them, especially give number country authority like central bank explicit domestic mandates. this paper therefore suggest period focus discussion, first outside international meetings, within international meetings. such discussion need take place environment finger point defensiveness, attempt understand reasonable, overly intrusive, rule conduct. bi central bankers’ speech 7 a consensus build rule conduct, contemplate next step whether codify international agreement, see article multilateral watchdog like imf altered, country authority interpret alter domestic mandate incorporate international responsibilities. the international community choice. we pretend well global financial non-system hope nothing go spectacularly wrong. or start build system integrate world twenty first century. i hope consider initial steps. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 vítor constâncio: in defence monetary policy opinion piece mr vítor constâncio, vice-president european central bank, 11 march 2016. * * * this week ecb adopt new measure reinforce monetary policy face recent headwinds. that decision take backdrop vocal scepticism medium markets. the sceptics’ reason two-pronged. first, monetary policy sufficient address present low growth trend; second, monetary policy increasingly ineffective case. the notion monetary policy alone cannot raise trend growth mostly true trivial, especially challenge secular stagnation highlight robert gordon brilliant new book considered. the g20 appeal use policies, notably fiscal structural reforms. while policy would certainly welcome, one justify doubt implementation. for start, active stabilise fiscal policy restrict law eu politics us. more generally, country could use fiscal space, won’t; many would use it, shouldn’t. that leaf u structural reforms. some, like upgrade education judicial efficiency, important take long time implement produce results. the structural reform economist often mind (i.e. liberalization deregulation markets) lead low wage price short-term, help inflation normalisation. and concern unemployment, high productivity often initially imply labour saving. structural reform essential long-term potential growth, difficult see could spur growth significantly next two years, especially current problem lack global demand. and regard delivery governments, recall embarrass result g20 plan agree brisbane generate additional 2% world growth via long concrete list reform put forward imf oecd. in fact, world economy risk even attain consider baseline scenario. so policy either can’t won’t contribute significant degree, wrong start talk monetary policy – it’s actually dangerous. the second criticism monetary policy mostly base crude comparison inflation (or growth) begin policy. the conclusion: inflation didn’t change much, policy isn’t working. however, rational essential examine would happen policy adopt first place. use several models, ecb staff estimate that, without policies, inflation would third percent negative 2015 would stay significantly negative throughout 2016, would mean would permanent deflation since last year. this significant result. recall final outcome affect unexpected decline price oil 30% september december. we estimate two third one percent register growth past two year due monetary policy. however, achieve foster internal demand undo subsequent decrease net export decelerate world economy. these development make policy le effective, ex-post insufficient desire outcome. 2 bi central bankers’ speech naturally, policy limits. in case instrument using, particularly true negative interest rate deposit facility. the reason fundamental effect banks1. despite negative rate throughout last year, net interest income (nii) euro area bank increase percentage assets, return equity go 3.5% 2014 5.7% 2015 – correspond real return inflation zero. our policy also produce capital gain banks, securities’ price go (and yield down), impairment cost come recovery reduce amount npls. more broadly, negative deposit facility rate contribute negative rate money market, reduce fund cost banks. the whole yield curve lowered, sole objective use particular monetary policy instrument. to normalise inflation euro area urgently need high growth reduce negative output unemployment gaps, use really available policies. if monetary policy, what? 1 see cecchetti & schoenholtz (2016) how low can they go? bi central bankers’ speech 1 koji ishida: japan’s economy, price development monetary policy speech mr koji ishida, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, fukuoka, 18 february 2016. * * * i. development economic activity price at monetary policy meet hold january 28 29, 2016, bank japan produce outlook economic activity price (outlook report) publish projection japan’s economic activity price fiscal 2017. i would like explain bank’s view economic activity price present main content outlook report. a. overseas economy overseas economy – mainly advance economy – continue grow moderate pace, despite slowdown emerge economies. production trade manufacture sector weak global basis first half 2015, generally pick somewhat, albeit weakness still see emerge economies. in outlook, pace growth overseas economy expect accelerate moderately positive effect recovery advance economy gradually spread emerge economies. a similar projection present world economic outlook (weo) update release january international monetary fund (imf). however, give decline expect growth emerge commodity-exporting economy protract low commodity prices, capital stock accumulate amid high expect growth rate high commodity price past likely continue excessive. thus, firms’ restrain stance toward fix investment expenditure likely see globally time. reflect circumstances, business sentiment within major economies’ manufacture sector generally deteriorated. look development major region, u.s. economy continue steadily recover, reflect firmness household spending. a outlook, economy expect continue firm recovery center private sector, underpin accommodative financial conditions. the european economy project continue see moderate recovery, mainly back improvement employment income situation, well accommodative financial conditions. the chinese economy continue state deceleration due downward pressure overhang production capacity inventory adjustment manufacture sector. however, economy likely broadly follow stable growth path – albeit somewhat slow pace, mainly manufacture sector – authority proactively carry policy measure support economic activity. overall, emerge economy chinese economy commodity-exporting economy also remain situation deceleration, effect slowdown chinese economy spread decline commodity price protracted. these economy whole expect gradually see rise growth rates, due mainly effect recovery advance economy economic stimulus measures. 2 bi central bankers’ speech b. japan’s economy price development 1. current situation now i would like discus development economic activity price japan. japan’s economy continue recover moderately, although export production affect slowdown emerge economies. on domestic demand side, business fix investment moderate increase trend corporate profit continue improve markedly. accord december 2015 tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan), firm generally continue plan increase fix investment firmly despite slowdown emerge economies. against background steady improvement employment income situation, private consumption resilient house investment pick up. industrial production continue le flat background prolong inventory adjustment small car engine size 660cc le capital goods. export pick up, reflect development overseas economy i mention earlier, although sluggishness remain areas. with regard prices, year-on-year rate increase consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food 0 percent due substantial fall energy prices, reflect decline crude oil prices. 2. outlook japan’s economy likely moderate expand trend. the improvement corporate profit expect continue favorable external environment, owe low crude oil price low yen rate, likely continue support income-generating mechanism, overseas economy expect see moderate rise growth rates. employee income also project continue increase moderately back improvement corporate profit tighten labor market conditions. domestic demand likely follow uptrend backdrop income generate virtuous mechanism monetary ease effects. thus, japan’s economy likely continue grow pace potential fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2017, although demand relate host olympic game underpin economy, growth rate expect slow around level somewhat potential, mainly fall household spend due consumption tax hike. look median policy board members’ forecast january 2016 outlook report, real gdp growth rate project 1.1 percent fiscal 2015, 1.5 percent fiscal 2016, 0.3 percent fiscal 2017. look outlook detail major component, business fix investment project continue see moderate increase back mark improvement corporate profit accommodative financial conditions. private consumption project generally remain resilient, reflect development real disposable income. house investment expect continue pick up, underpin continue steady improvement employment income situation low level house loan rates. industrial production likely start pick inventory adjustment progress, thereafter likely follow moderate increase trend, support increase final demand home abroad. exports, pick up, expect head toward moderate increase time since automobile-related export likely continue increase back firm sale development unite states, europe, china. however, long run, export expect tend mark fall rather clear increase, give decline expect growth emerge commodity-exporting economies, protract low commodity prices, result excess production capacity relate material energy. on price front, year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food) likely 0 percent time being, due effect decline energy prices. nevertheless, underlie trend price steadily rise effect decline bi central bankers’ speech 3 crude oil price dissipate, rate likely accelerate toward 2 percent – price stability target. look median policy board members’ forecast january 2016 outlook report, year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food), exclude direct effect consumption tax hike, project 0.1 percent fiscal 2015, 0.8 percent fiscal 2016, 1.8 percent fiscal 2017. upside downside risk bank’s baseline scenario regard economic activity (1) development overseas economies, (2) effect consumption tax hike, (3) firms’ households’ medium- long-term growth expectations, (4) fiscal sustainability medium long term. the risk bank’s baseline scenario regard price (1) development firms’ households’ medium- long-term inflation expectations, (2) development output gap, (3) responsiveness inflation output gap, (4) development import prices. ii. the bank’s monetary policy next, i would like talk bank’s monetary policy. the bank decide introduce “quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) negative interest rate” monetary policy meet hold january 28 29, 2016. this policy framework design enable bank pursue monetary ease make full use possible measure term three dimension – quantity, quality, interest rate – negative interest rate add exist option qqe conduct date. specifically, interest rate side, bank partially apply negative interest rate minus 0.1 percent current account financial institution hold bank. this exert downward pressure interest rate across entire yield curve, combination continuation large-scale purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) conduct term quantity quality. under new scheme introduce january, bank adopt multiple-tier system apply negative interest rate minus 0.1 percent marginal increase current account financial institution hold bank, continue apply positive interest rate 0.1 percent average outstanding current account balance financial institution hold past year. the bank devise scheme take account follow unique circumstance japan: extremely large outstanding balance current account bank necessity bank proceed smoothly large-scale purchase asset even negative interest rate scheme. a describe january 2016 outlook report, japan’s economy continue recover moderately underlie trend price rise steadily. recently, however, global financial market volatile backdrop decline crude oil price uncertainty future development emerge commodity-exporting economies, particularly chinese economy. in situation, bank judge increase risk improvement business confidence japanese firm conversion deflationary mindset might delay underlie trend price might negatively affected. to preempt manifestation risk maintain momentum toward achieve price stability target 2 percent, bank decide introduce “qqe negative interest rate.” i explain outline bank’s assessment present january 2016 outlook report new monetary policy scheme introduce january. next, i would like touch upon several feature economic price developments. 4 bi central bankers’ speech iii. several feature economic price development a i mention earlier, global stock market foreign exchange market turmoil recently, especially since turn year, volatile movement start negatively affect financial market japan. investor become increasingly risk averse due several factor reinforce other: (1) shift toward monetary tighten unite states, (2) economic slowdown china well turmoil chinese stock yuan rate, (3) sharp decline crude oil prices, (4) sluggishness emerge commodity-exporting economies. i believe recent volatile movement global financial market le likely induce instability global financial system, unlike past. nevertheless, attention pay possibility that, volatile movement protracted, may affect confidence among individual firm ultimately economic activity. a continuation monetary tighten unite state would indicate economic condition deem favorable. if momentum economic activity judge weak, rate rise postponed. a china, room adequate fiscal monetary measures. i expect development intensify negative impact emerge commodity-exporting economy japan’s economy. in contrast, substantial decline crude oil price exert extremely large impact recent development global economy financial condition worldwide, regardless whether decline cause consequence developments. a. decline crude oil price the decline crude oil price negative influence wide range corporate activities. for example, firm substantially reduce fix investment relate crude oil production, account large share global business fix investment. firm provide oil-related facility service particularly affected. furthermore, oil-producing countries, excess funds, shortage funds, cause reversal flow funds, create considerable stress economic activity country also global stock market foreign exchange markets. a i described, substantial decline crude oil price large negative impacts; however, view somewhat long term, net positive effect global economy, income transfer economy low propensity consume high propensity consume, capital-intensive industry labor-intensive industries. i consider overall positive effect japan – self-sufficiency rate crude oil extremely low – particularly large, although magnitude effects, positive negative, differ firm industry. hike crude oil price often cause global economic recessions. however, never recession stem decline prices. the immediate negative effect decline price – financial market – pronounce positive effects, take time become apparent, view need overly concern present situation. b. price a substantial decline crude oil price lead fall energy prices, consequently push level overall prices. some say development individual price affect level overall prices, development cause price item move inversely individual prices. for example, even energy price decline, real income increase accordingly, thus price energy price rise increase spending. while may true long run, outcome unlikely occur within two years, time horizon central bank typically consider appropriate conduct monetary policy. a note january 2016 outlook report, bi central bankers’ speech 5 project time year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food) reach price stability target 2 percent delay overall inflation rate push due substantial decline crude oil prices. nevertheless, decline crude oil price nature considerable positive factor japan’s economy, effect overall price eventually dissipate. thus, i consider delay acceptable. also, term monetary policy, i believe appropriate exclude effect energy price temporary factor grasp underlie trend prices. the year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food) december 2015 0.1 percent item le fresh food energy – indicate underlie trend price – 1.3 percent. the bank project that, situation japan’s economy likely continue grow pace potential, year-on-year rate increase cpi (all item le fresh food) likely rise close 2 percent fiscal 2017 negative contribution energy item dissipates. inflation expectation refer factor largely affect price outlook, difficult actually ass them. it say inflation expectation firm consumer rise somewhat longer-term perspective – suggest recent price-setting behavior firm subsequent purchase behavior consumers, rise base salary two consecutive years. in addition, i consider two indicator – inflation swap rate break-even inflation (bei) rate jgbs, frequently use ass inflation expectation compile base financial market data – sufficiently reflect actual inflation expectation japan, unlike case unite state europe, give size liquidity japanese financial markets. therefore, indicator regard reference. let note price normally determine consumer accept price set firms. since spring 2015, manufacturer raise wholesale price standard products, due mainly rise costs, lead rise sale prices. in addition, price general service rise due labor shortages. these factor push underlie trend prices. it second year price increases, raise difficult issue include following: (1) whether manufacturer raise price standard product again; (2) whether manufacturer implement de facto price increase develop new product value add similar previous ones; (3) whether manufacturer raise price good postpone increase far; (4) whether cost absorb distribution sector pass sale prices; (5) whether service sector continue pas rise labor cost final prices. that said, many firm experience le room cost reductions. in circumstances, need increase sale order maintain raise level profit face upward pressure labor costs. in current situation difficult expect increase sale volume age population decline birthrate progressed, solution raise unit price good services. a firm start increase prices, focus whether consumer accept increases. in regard, i consider key continue steady rise underlie trend price whether consumer optimistic future development income wages. c. wage recently, labor market condition extremely tight, increase number firm experience labor shortages. in textbook theory, wage determine supply-demand balance labor market, statistic show pace increase wage whole remain moderate. this regular employees’ wages, account major part total employee income, rise moderately, 6 bi central bankers’ speech although hourly pay non-regular employee rise markedly, reflect tight labor market conditions. one major cause behind situation framework regular employee japan, although gradually changing. it unique japan country’s system practices. let elaborate point. in japan, difficult discharge regular employees, excess shortage regular employee balance number new graduate hired. new graduate go in-house train become well suit individual firms. the salary benefit available regular employee throughout career significant long regular employees. these factor low labor mobility move one firm another. if regular employee change job despite dissatisfaction salary levels, employer le incentive raise level salary secure suitably qualify employees. thus, employer take initiative set regular employees’ wages. even corporate profit increasing, employer tend reluctant increase wages, particularly base salaries, give uncertainty regard outlook profits. they also may reluctant allocate profit obtain overseas operation increase wage japan. a evident far, regular employees’ wage rise smoothly firm negotiate wage union amid low mobility regular employees. although point increase labor productivity necessary wage rise, difficult expect proper operation mechanism productivity economy whole increases. this because, low labor mobility, wage work intermediary function smoothly correct difference productivity among firms. in order increase productivity economic growth rate japan, change employment framework necessary labor transfer smoothly – increase wage – firm low productivity profit high productivity profits. this take time, economy continue grow pace exceed potential, firm may face acute labor shortage immediate issue secure suitably qualify employees. in addition, decline energy price underpin corporate profits, include small firms. reflect situation, wage level expect rise gradually among many firms. the bank, part, maintain accommodative financial condition conduct monetary policy virtuous cycle corporate profit wages, turn consumption, operate properly. give effect tight labor market condition spread wage smoothly, may voice various opinion government’s recent action encourage wage increases, i understand action necessary. bi central bankers’ speech 1 alex brazier: a macroprudential approach bank capital – serve real economy good time bad speech mr alex brazier, executive director financial stability strategy risk bank england, 27th annual institute international banker conference, washington dc, 7 march 2016. * * * i grateful rob edwards, jas elli calum mitchell assistance prepare remarks. your industry know good start year. bank stock down, volatility up, earn disappointing. all ghost crisis past. but one ghost return haunt us. question return haven’t translate they’ve do question resilience. investor may real question whether bank generate adequate return equity difficult global economic trade environment. they may also alert risk appropriate return contingent capital instruments. but uk bank price-to-book ratio low 2009, senior unsecured debt spread 350bps. at height euro crisis 2011, 300bps. today, 73bps (chart 1). underlie transformation bank capital. in uk, major bank core tier 1 equity ratio average nearly 13%. before financial crisis – basel iii definition – 4.5% (chart 2). those new level resilience see result stress tests. last year, bank england subject uk bank sharp slowdown china, fall oil price intense market volatility, couple stress estimate redress cost past misconduct. across system, bank test incur loss £37bn. that’s twice loss system financial crisis. back then, loss scale would wipe almost two third capital entire british bank system. with much capital today, stress test show loss could absorbed, even system continue grow credit real economy. far sideswipe real economy stress, test show bank system could continue support it.1and yet, still, eight long year crisis, lively debate newspapers, blog academia, whether capital strength bank system build further. 1 available http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/documents/fpc/results011215.pdf. 2 bi central bankers’ speech about whether authority abandon conclusion basel iii uk’s post-crisis independent commission bank compel bank go further. a debate like good; important question society. but balance merit clarity. clarity need run business effectively. clarity investor need allocate price capital efficiently. clarity public, parliaments, need hold policymakers bank account. that’s why, december, bank england give clear statement appropriate baseline level capital systemic part uk bank system.2 across major uk banks, le 3.75% total asset fund tier 1 capital. if risk properly measured, would translate 11% risk weight assets. however, shortcoming exist measure risk, include banks’ pension schemes, interest rate risk bank book concentration exposures. so current measures, expect major uk bank fund le 13½% risk weight asset tier 1 equity.3 after long march build capital strength, uk bank within hair’s breadth today. and reward great resilience reaped. our expectation capital found need bank system serve real economy, good time bad. our aim prudent make macroeconomic sense. our aim macroprudential. it’s clear approach prudent. the wide economic cost poorly capitalise bank immense. the cutback credit, market making, essential payment service stress economically devastating. on average, great recession, output fell country experience financial crisis nearly twice much country not. that gap performance persist since. we estimate full, net present value, economic cost typical past financial crisis catastrophic – around 75% gdp case much more. so nobody deny economic case well capitalise banks. and obvious aftermath crisis bank capital need go. up. a lot. 2 available http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/documents/fsr/2015/fsrsupp.pdf. 3 major uk bank require hold, average, additional tier 1 capital 2.5% risk weight asset “pillar 2a” requirements. these compensate exist shortcoming risk measure lift average capital requirement 11% 13.5%. should shortcoming risk measure corrected, measure risk weight asset would increase.but time, expectation capital share risk weight asset would fall back. the two effect expect offset extra capital would required. ongoing work basel committee address excessive variability risk weight materially affect overall capital requirements. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in fact, market confidence low time, capital boost resilience, also need lend resume. capital good resilience good growth. that’s country recapitalised bank system quickly secure early strong recoveries, u lead way. however, point, another unit capital buy much small fall probability bank failure. there may seriously diminish returns. and time it’s possible ever bank capital may best serve real economy. it may prudential. but may macroprudential. we alert possibility bank capital could hold back growth. the cost high level capital overstated, include – let’s face – bank executive mistake private cost today’s shareholder true economic costs. it’s often forget low leverage make equity debt le risky, drive cost both. that isn’t textbook result; it’s support data. but evidence numerous study effect incomplete. total fund cost rise company – sorts, bank – swap debt equity funding. and effect go beyond explain differential tax treatment debt equity.4 the driver unclear. it’s area much learn; partnership industry academia could productive bring theory practice close together.5 in general, seem investors’ preference different type asset affect risk return assets. equity investor seem want higher, volatile returns. they like equity equity-like. so make safe doesn’t reduce cost much should. and banks, whose short-term debt money use real economy, effect compounded. depositor want stable liquid store value rainy day. they don’t want equity. so understandably take persuade swap rainy day fund bank equity.6 regardless cause, evidence high capital requirement push bank fund cost can’t ignored. the cost bear real borrower – high cost funds, real saver – low returns. in theory, monetary policy may able offset overall effect inflation. but can’t alter fact cost high match lender borrowers, capital provider capital seekers, risk taker risk hedgers. 4 mile et al (2012) present central estimate reduction volatility equity return riskiness debt offset half increase fund cost would, thing equal, result switch debt expensive equity funding. 5 elliott (2013) set area disagreement debate economic cost high bank capital requirements. 6 the low risk anomaly, whereby low risk stock generate low case even high stock return high risk stocks, document bank baker wurgler (2013). the impact depositor liquidity preference discuss kashyap et al (2010). 4 bi central bankers’ speech that’s private cost. it’s social cost too. at margin, force change mix economic activity. the ability turn future cashflows today’s investment curtailed. spend replace investment. investment project low returns. that hold back future economic potential. although it’s impossible precise, seem baseline degree resilience established, capital could actually cost economy. we estimate 100bps increase capital requirement across bank system could result economic cost net present value 0.6% gdp.7 this raise important macroprudential question: best protect real economy without unnecessary risk hold back? our answer uk three parts. first, protect economy consequence bank failure. and minimal economic cost. effective bank resolution unlock this. with minimum disruption exist fund structures, open door preserve function fail bank without recourse taxpayer. serious progress make build resolution regimes. an eu-wide legal framework place. cross-border arrangement step up. agreement reach temporary stay close contract resolution. and g20 agreement total loss absorb capacity (tlac) standard global systemic bank game-changing principle heart. systemic bank must capacity replenish capital, minimum regulatory standards, even capital – tier – completely burn through.8 it’s game changer hardwires recapitalisation fail banks. bailed-in debt holder become, quickly, proud new owner bank. case study evidence striking. rapid recapitalisation fail bank speed economic recovery. it cut long-term cost systemic bank failure half. but resolution bail-in fire extinguisher. it’s non-flammable coat bank system too. it help prevent bank failure first place. unsurprisingly, evidence debt holder face consequence failure, bank take few risks. international estimate suggest removal heads-i-win-tails-you-lose ‘too big fail’ subsidy cut risk failure third. a know, removal subsidy isn’t pipedream. rat agency already remove “state support” uplift bank debt ratings.9 and yes, raise 7 this similar estimate mile et al (2012), find effect increase capital 3% total asset 6% total asset around 6% gdp. 8 the bank england, uk resolution authority, consult proposal implement principle uk systemic banks, must european bank recovery resolution directive. 9 moody’s s&p remove reduce government support rat uk u banks. fitch revise support assumption uk u bank remove ‘support rat floors’ capture government support assumptions. bi central bankers’ speech 5 cost bank service reduce return equity. but cost flipside removal subsidy – wide social costs. it essential effort ensure even large bank resolve remain track. in uk, include ringfencing entity take core deposits. impediment resolvability must continue addressed. if effort hit obstacles, high equity requirement need achieve ends. the necessary protection real economy bought. the question price. but even effective resolution backstop place, cost systemic bank failure far insignificant. so second part macroprudential approach baseline capital standard make economic disruption cause weak bank system extremely rare. but so. our baseline – tier 1 capital 13.5% risk weight assets, around 3.75% total asset – aim this. the dual key approach – risk-weighted capital leverage – recognise imperfection risk weight model guard them. on past loss performance, standard reduce probability failure extremely low levels, probability simultaneous failure drive crisis even low levels. and past performance include global financial crisis. in uk, even two big failure crisis – royal bank scotland halifax bank scotland – suffer loss comfortably within baseline standards. use basel iii definitions, suffer loss – even three year – around 5% risk weight assets.10 so go could sharply diminish effect probability bank failure. and could run risk economic cost. our standard recognise risks. by take higher, seek strike balance; macroprudential. that balance also serve make-up requirements. hard floor capital requirement don’t help real economy. they simply move point failure distress bank high level capital. they may make bank resilient, don’t make credit supply essential service provision resilient. so large slice bank capital take form useable buffer: cushion sit top minimum capital requirement run build gradually afterwards. the emphasis useable. 10 over three year period 2008–2010, hbos incur loss £25bn. this amount around 5% 2008 risk weight asset (£536bn basel iii basis). in period, rb incur loss trade activity impairment asset total £40bn, 5% risk weight asset (£783bn basel iii basis). these bank fail enter crisis low capital strength. on basel iii basis, rb estimate cet1 ratio 1.97% end 2007. hbos 4.1%. see fsa (2011) bank england/fca (2015). 6 bi central bankers’ speech that’s why, although well meaning, mandatory restriction distribution dividends, coupon pay capital buff use perverse effect. they create incentive avoid dip capital buff take action broad economic effects.11 our baseline standard mean big bank subject baseline capital buff nearly 5% risk weight assets, sit top 8.5% hard floor tier 1 capital (see table 1).12 a buff 5% go beyond agree international standards. basel iii set minimum buff 2.5% bank (the conservation buffer) supplement bank global importance. we intend go big bank domestic importance, unite state go capital buff large banks.13 a buff 5% give room systemic bank absorb loss without force close door cease service economy. it achieve great bank resilience, great resilience service macro economy. it’s macroprudential. stress test tell u capital buff would big enough absorb deep uk recession sharply rise interest rate fall property prices, deep global recession, centre china emerge markets, associate global deflation. but would mistake think 5% capital buff always everywhere right one. so third part approach flexibility. flexibility raise capital buff threat future loss grows, cut threat materialise recede. that flexibility avoid might otherwise need capitalise system risky times, time. it avoid take unnecessary risk hold real economy back. there time risk heighten protect economy, bank big capital buffers. broadly, seek match size buff – strength defence – threat future loss change time.14 but know threat level changed? 11 the bank england call european commission revisit rule european capital requirement directive iv. the bank’s response commission’s call evidence available http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/documents/regframework/detailed answers010216.pdf 12 the 8.5% minimum compose 6% common international standard agree basel iii plus 2.5% pillar 2a requirement reflect shortcoming risk measures. see footnote 3. 13 we plan systemic part bank system 5% buffer. in line basel standards, small bank subject buff half size. that reflect difference economic cost big – systemic – bank come close actually fail small bank so. 14 this take effect supplement baseline capital requirement countercyclical capital buff rate uk exposures. bi central bankers’ speech 7 we’ll look evidence borrower might overstretched; asset price could vulnerable reversal; economic imbalance exist could correct. assess risk isn’t “calling cycle”. we shouldn’t ask whether downturn bad event destine happen. we look irrefutable proof. capital buff base whether evidence say threat could materialise future, whether go to. the interest thing i hear senior policymaker say financial crisis, bank england policymaker, spend far long think whether house bubble enough time think house bubble. the consequence bank inform annual stress test. with stress scenario vary systematically assessment risks, test guide u – give banks’ exposure – judgement risk reflect capital buffers. in addition, we’ll bias act early gradually – raise countercyclical capital buff threat level see heightened. the bank england expect add around 1% capital buff uk exposure banks, even overall threat future loss look high. that bias reflect time lag implementation cost time-varying buff lag behind threats. a well, clear evidence sudden, sharp increase capital requirement material effect credit supply economic activity. act early allow u take small steps. with approach, uk’s systemic bank will, except post-crisis repair, require run capital buff little baseline standard. leverage requirement also scale up, bank typically require fund le 4% total asset tier 1 capital. should threat level rise normal, capital buffers. they’ll go far need ensure banks’ defence keep threat grow. and importantly, threat materialise, shrink, we’ll reduce expectation capital buff back towards baseline level. in this, we’re aim turn what’s happen past head. bank capital buff small good time need build bad. they pro-cyclical amplify bad times. now, we’re make countercyclical. buff build base level risk grow, draw down, risk materialise. in bad times, bank able absorb loss move continue serve real economy. our flexibility extend beyond move capital buff down. with high baseline capital leverage requirement reached, learn effect requirement provision service real economy. some effect come sharp focus recent months. sovereign repo market show sign reduce liquidity, example. and also sign reduce market-making activity sovereign corporate bond markets. none development make u rush amend capital standard put place protect real economy. after all, level dealer 8 bi central bankers’ speech activity market liquidity run-up crisis ephemeral. they serve real economy. it important part financial system, asset managers, adapt new environment manage liquidity position prudently. but development should, are, prompt u ass whether target amendment design regulation could benefit real economy, without expose risk. the design new requirement macroprudential. so must implementation. the system come long way march capital great resilience. the benefit see today. lend real economy grow again. resilience insulate question returns. with resolution regime well advance game-changing bail-in principle established, upward march high capital level soon reach new baseline. a baseline that, know today, protect real economy without unnecessary risk hold back. and flexibility adapt continually align resilience threats, compel answer question marry prudence macroeconomic sense. so protect serve real economy good time bad. thank

supply chain part globe. a result, monetary financial policy across country become much correlated. the conference organizer rightly ask crucial question whether international monetary system (ims) still sufficiently stable current environment grow interconnectedness. in addition heighten interconnectedness, global economy financial market face challenge unconventional unusual monetary policy advance economy well diverge monetary policy countries, uncertainty commodity prices, risk china’s economic hard-landing unintended market liquidity consequence recent financial sector reform across world. large asset purchase program major central bank depress global bond market decrease long-term yield well short-term yield negative nominal policy rate destabilize bond market general financial markets. heighten volatility global financial market associate presence low even negative rate rather underlie macroeconomic external imbalances. in circumstances, change interest rate differential across country likely create great impact otherwise. if interest rate change take place large significant economy world, impact expectedly magnified. the fed’s start interest rate normalization demonstrate impact global economy financial market indeed large, give rise significant capital outflow emerge market (em) economies, large adjustment volatility exchange rate well widen em spread interest rates. the adverse effect fed’s interest rate normalization average large occur previous two financial turmoil episodes, namely eurozone sovereign debt crisis u taper tantrum. however, disparity effect country large too. the plummet commodity price well factor lead outcome commodity exporter suffer low commodity revenue tighten global financial conditions. financial market also differentiate em country policy framework prudent policies. those rich good policy framework prudent policy withstand recent global financial turmoil good others. with lesson learn previous episode improvement years, emerge market economy average good position withstand financial turbulences, future, past. they embark extensive structural reform aim overhaul financial regulatory supervisory systems, strengthen public finance fiscal discipline, grant central bank independence adopt flexible exchange rate systems. these reform enable implement prudent countercyclical policies. em economy support post crisis reform accumulate adequate foreign exchange reserve alternative imf provide financing, carry strong conditionality, well deepen broaden domestic financial markets. a result, stock flow balances, policy frameworks, level economic confidence market development em economy strengthen substantially radically. deepen 2 bi central bankers’ speech broaden domestic financial market alleviate call original sin problem. it fair say look strong enough render adverse effect external financial shock manageable. give current ims em economy rely prudent policies, good policy frameworks, foreign exchange reserve flexible exchange rates. a ims relate question session namely • “do float exchange rate along largely unrestricted capital flow play role shock absorber? be go witness return currency crisis 1990’s? • what china economic slowdown current adjustment mean capital market quest renminbi internationalization? • should systematically important country “internalize” spillover effect mitigate negative external impacts?” i organize point around three function ims – liquidity, confidence adjustment. on liquidity function, two area require significant improvement current ims. the first relate excessive liquidity normal times. what appropriate policy curb excessive capital flows? the imf’s approach advocate recipient country implement capital flow management measure use macro-prudential tools. hence, asymmetric treatment country source country expect much all. there course room symmetric treatment. the holy grail may exist imf’s article agreement state section 1 “each member shall seek promote stability… foster monetary system tend produce erratic disruptions”. the second existence safety net provide liquidity financial stress times. again, optimal provision liquidity main issue. to extent divide among global, regional local sources. it classic efficiency versus moral hazard problem. change governance structure global safety net provide io potential alleviate problem. the 2010 imf quota governance reform significant development give great voice em country govern imf policy procedures. this development together increase awareness sufficient global safety net would strengthen imf recourse reduce stigma effect. again, symmetry issue provision liquidity financial stress time – whether internationally design mechanism enforce country supply excessive liquidity first place also provide liquidity recipient country financial stress time currency swap arrangements. the confidence function ims highlight fact stakeholder include financial market great confidence functioning, resource governance system. strengthen recourses, improve governance advance function crucially bolster stakeholders’ confidence system. what do recently along line 2010 imf quota governance reform, inclusion renminbi sdr system recent increase imf resource greatly improve confidence ims. the adjustment mechanism ims mostly relate sustainability also affect confidence function. the ims require symmetric fair adjustment mechanism. the g20 play central role adjustment mechanism ims foster international policy coordination cooperation. the ios, especially imf, largely execute g20 objective bilateral surveillance multilateral surveillance oversight world economy. since global financial crisis (gfc) giant step take g20 strengthen international policy coordination cooperation. overall two oppose bi central bankers’ speech 3 development affect ims. on one hand, significant reform since gfc strengthen ims. but hand, grow interconnectedness especially increase international investment position together unconventional monetary policy pose challenge ims. in global circumstances, face deterioration inflation outlook

lowe: resilience ongoing challenge keynote address mr philip lowe, deputy governor reserve bank australia, udia national congress 2016, adelaide, 8 march 2016. * * * accompany chart find end speech. i would like thank craig evans assistance preparation talk. it real pleasure back adelaide today. i would like thank urban development institute australia (udia) invitation part national congress beautiful city. i previously speak udia national congress 2010. that year hold sydney. on occasion, i speak australian economy come severe global downturn much good shape countries. i speak expect upswing mine investment positive effect likely economy next years. and i speak three specific challenges: need expand supply side economy; need get good balance supply demand house market; need ensure inflation remain low stable. in six year since then, lot water flow bridge. the global economy recovery sorts, although average growth rate still crisis. in australia, expect boom mine investment take place, lead large increase production capacity. for time, result economy grow above-average pace, follow year growth average trend mine investment return normal levels. in term challenge i speak six year ago, issue expand supply side economy boost productivity growth press then. a bite positively, house market appear good balance supply demand. and term inflation, outcome australia – almost everywhere around world – low early expected. today, i think might useful touch broad theme – resilience economy, productivity challenge, balance house market inflation outlook. the resilience australian economy so first australian economy. here, main point emphasise resilience economy ability adjust. a year back look peak mine boom, considerable trepidation quarter australia would manage come years. with commodity price already decline talk upcoming mine investment cliff, concern growth output and, importantly, growth job would come from. a thing turn out, though, manage pretty well far, despite fairly difficult environment. over past two years, price commodity export decline 40 per cent (graph 1). mine investment also decline almost 40 per cent, equivalent nearly 3 per cent gdp. yet two years, economy continue expand reasonable pace, growth 2015 bite strong early expect different long-term average. importantly, also sufficient growth aggregate demand recent time keep unemployment rate broadly steady accommodate rise participation rate (graph 2). again, take past two year together, annual employment growth 2 bi central bankers’ speech average almost 2 per cent, different long-term average. it also bite population growth, share working-age population employ also rise around ½ percentage point past two years. the job creation particularly strong range household service (graph 3). health care stand-out, annual growth job average 4½ per cent past two years. there also strong growth job business services, follow period weakness year ago exploration activity pre-construction work resource sector scale back. in contrast, little job creation goods-related industry recent years. this picture economy adjust reasonably well change circumstance also evident number indicators. over recent times, business survey suggest condition around, little above, average. business credit growth pick subdue quite while. and last week's national account confirm growth household spend also pick up. while none indicator suggest cusp return type growth rate saw 2008, suggest economy successfully rebalancing follow mine investment boom. this resilience reflects, part, flexibility three key prices: exchange rate, price money (or interest rates), price labour. the effect exchange rate depreciation evident improve condition prospect number industries, include tourism, education, agriculture part manufacturing. just early appreciation help economy avoid overheat resource boom, depreciation help economy adjust low commodity price low investment resource sector. the effect low interest rate clearly evident residential construction activity, increase 10 per cent 2015. this strong growth positive spillover part economy. over come quarters, expect increase residential construction, although slow rate see recently. finally, low wage growth one factor underpin reasonably positive employment outcomes. over past year, wage price index (wpi) rise 2¼ per cent, low outcome 17-year history series (graph 4). low still growth rate average hourly earn measure national accounts. this measure, take account compositional effect capture wpi, unchanged past year. these type wage outcome much low people become use low suggest historical relationship wage growth unemployment. while low wage growth one factor constrain consumption growth many individual households, importantly, mean people job clearly positive aggregate household spend broad society. so flexibility key price – exchange rate, interest rates, wage – serve u well. our central scenario remain growth output bite trend 2016, gradually strengthen drag low commodity price mine investment wanes, increase capacity lng sector come line. the main risk central scenario still seem lie international sphere. the first couple month 2016 volatile one bond, equity commodity markets. our large trade partner, china, go difficult transition consumption-led service-based economy deal high level corporate debt complication open capital account. on monetary front, interest rate unite state recently increase first time nine years, bank bi central bankers’ speech 3 japan unexpectedly move one key interest rate negative territory. in so, join european central bank, swiss national bank, swedish riksbank danish central bank negative rates. and number countries, expectation yet monetary ease take place. it remain see mean us. the recent international data mix but, stage, suggest momentum global economy lost. the monetary ease abroad complication us, tend put downward pressure currency ease take place thus upward pressure australian dollar. more positively, low oil price – primarily reflect increase supply capacity – mostly good global growth: low cost production almost every firm global economy put money hand consumers. the low oil price do, however, create financial strain economy companies. so lot cross-currents watch carefully moment. i want move three challenge i speak 2010. expand supply side – productivity the first expand supply side economy – lift productivity. six year ago, focus ensure economy sufficient productive capacity avoid overheat period strong demand flow resource boom. today, focus little different. while do pretty good job adjust change circumstances, not-so-good news growth real income per caput australia stall (graph 5). indeed, average real income high today 2008. this follow 17-year period growth average remarkable 3.1 per cent per year. during early period, benefit from: (i) strong productivity growth 1990s; (ii) large rise term trade; (iii) favourable demographics, help increase share population pay employment. in three areas, recent outcome kind. it coincidental time change fortune broadly coincide time increase pressure federal budget, increase general sense economic uncertainty, slow gain asset price slow growth wage profits. inevitably, income growth weak effect felt broadly community. look ahead, able look forward somewhat good outcome recent past. we could expect drag national income fall commodity price eventually lessen. and current trend employment continue, could look forward increase share population pay employment. both would positive real income growth. australia's fundamental also remain sound. we tremendous base natural resources, talented, diverse grow workforce, stable political legal system, highly regard university system, well place benefit increase demand service asia. but escape fact future growth average income australian rely largely ability lift productivity. while rebalancing resilience economy certainly something welcome, longer-term challenge lift live standard find new thing good way currently do. the need make press fact growth momentum global economy le was. ultimately, productivity growth heavily reliant decision make businesses. but policy decision also make difference. here, shortage ideas. they cover strengthen competition policy, good provision price transportation infrastructure, develop strong innovation culture, create strong incentive entrepreneurship hard work, invest high-quality education. the task collectively face, then, 4 bi central bankers’ speech identify right specific policy area find way implement them. clearly, easy task, neither impossible one. house i would like turn second issue – balance house market. again, i speak six year ago, focus pressure house market arise rather unusual situation growth rate population exceed number dwell substantial margin (graph 6). since then, population growth slowed, rate growth dwell stock increase exceed population. reflect increase, share gdp account build new dwell rise significantly close various peak reach past 50 year (graph 7). notwithstanding this, spend alteration addition relatively subdued, overall investment residential construction remain way previous peaks. this increase supply dwell come back large run-up house price australia's two large cities. but increase supply look contribute moderation rate increase house price cities. it also put downward pressure rents, cpi measure rent inflation run 1.2 per cent 2015, low 20 year (graph 8). whether trend maintain remain seen, continue watch development house market closely. however, overall picture appear one good balance supply demand case 2010. a i note earlier, lift residential construction important element cyclical rebalancing economy. in period ahead, expect increase residential construction, although slow rate take place last year. while modest increase mean modest boost overall gdp growth home-building, assist sustainability current boom residential construction. it unlikely collective interest surge construction new dwellings, share economy, follow would surely large prolong decline late on. overall, recent data build approval suggest reasonable path here. from longer-term perspective, challenge provide adequate supply reasonably price house increase population rest largely flexibility land supply and, particular, supply well-located land. this high house cost largely reflect high land prices, high construction costs. here, zone regulation transportation infrastructure make material difference. in areas, progress make since 2010, done. inflation the final issue inflation outlook. six year ago, inflation rate almost advance economy midpoint central bank targets. this remain case today (graph 9). the average core inflation rate across advance economy similar 2010, headline inflation rate low then, decline oil price past year. six year ago, australia one advance economy inflation midpoint target (in case, 2½ per cent) (graph 10). this was, perhaps, surprise give mine investment boom take place. but today, many countries, find midpoint target, although relatively small margin. importantly, unlike countries, inflation australia remain consistent medium-term target. bi central bankers’ speech 5 it would appear many advance economy inflation dynamic little different past. in early decades, rare central bank worry inflation inflation expectation low. yet today, hear concern quite often, ‘unconventional’ almost become conventional. one factor contribute low inflation outcome fall oil prices. but fundamental influence low wage increase advance economies. in number economies, include unite states, japan, germany unite kingdom, low wage increase coexist fairly strong employment growth not-so-strong output growth. this evident graph 11. the leave hand panel shows, country, average employment growth past two year relative long-term average. similarly, right hand panel show recent gdp growth rate relative long-term averages. the pattern reasonably clear: employment growth quite strong relative historical trends, output growth not. it also worth note four country at, near, conventional estimate full employment. the commonality experience low wage outcomes, strong employment gain relatively subdue output growth suggest global influence may work. one possibility worker advance country perceive le bargain power before, either after-effect financial crisis and/or incremental globalisation many service industries. another possibility reflection subdue growth global production good relatively strong growth services, output difficult measure. whatever reason, dynamic labour market critical future path inflation. it possible wage outcome remain subdue even country strong labour markets. if turn case, likely inflation rate also continue low monetary policy accommodative. alternatively, might witness slightly long lag normal relationship employment growth wages. if case, pick-up wage growth inflation may far away. here, unite state test case sort give recovery advanced. recently, sign pick-up inflation worth watch happen quite closely next months. for us, australia, continue low wage growth mean cpi inflation also likely remain relatively low. while upward pressure retail price import good result depreciation, pressure mute strong competition follow entry number overseas-based retailer australian market. a reserve bank indicate time, low inflation outlook provide scope easy monetary policy appropriate support demand growth economy. an important factor whether growth aggregate demand continue sufficient accommodate growth labour force. so, bring end remarks. i wish best success national congress. i hope another six years' time still talk satisfaction resilience growth australian economy. and i suspect issue productivity growth, balance house market inflation dynamic relevant today, 2010. thank i would happy answer questions. 6 bi central bankers’ speech graph 1 graph 2 bi central bankers’ speech 7 graph 3 graph 4 8 bi central bankers’ speech graph 5 graph

represent views, necessarily represent federal reserve board federal open market committee. this fit moment take stock economic financial developments, follow volatile start year. i begin review outlook, provide brief recap financial market liquidity fared, finish comment resilience resolvability large interconnect banks. outlook unite state i hearten continue strong progress employment resilience american consumers, stand considerably challenge global backdrop. i please continue strength u.s. labor market, draw people back labor force. in february, unemployment rate 4.9 percent – level one-half peak depth recession 2009. last friday, learn employment growth average 223,000 per month past 12 months. and likely room go: the prime-age employment-to-population ratio remain 1 3/4 percentage point level prevail prior financial crisis, relatively large share employee work part time would prefer work full time. in addition, wage growth remain relatively slow. domestic activity continue grow moderate pace. the pace consumer spending, slow end last year, look pick january, auto sale remain strong february. over past two years, consumption increase 3 percent pace, average, i expect see growth continue close pace base solid job income growth – together elevate read consumer confidence boost household purchase power persistent decline energy prices. the house sector also contribute steadily growth past year. with house activity well pre-recession norms, appear still scope continue growth construction activity. in contrast, sector economy sensitive energy price international demand drag. in response plunge oil prices, investment drill mine structure fell 50 percent last year, continue reduction number drill rig year suggest decline likely.1 at time, firm worker energy sector experience extreme financial difficulty severe job losses. although euro area japan recovering, demand growth remain low, despite extraordinary monetary accommodation. in emerge market economy growth last year come one-half average rate 2009 2013. because china account one-third growth world gross domestic product (gdp) trade, recent slippage chinese economic growth important effect globally. even chinese growth slide further, change composition growth toward consumption service away resource-intensive manufacture investment 1 despite drop-off drill investment, oil production surprisingly resilient, producer increase productivity establish wells. 2 bi central bankers’ speech pose important challenge commodity exporter emerge economies, especially since china previously account upwards one-half global import many base metals. weak foreign demand relative unite state push net export contribute nearly 20 percent strengthen real trade-weighted dollar since mid-2014. a result, net export subtract little 1/2 percentage point gdp growth 2014 2015, econometric model suggest past appreciation lead close another 1 percentage point subtraction year.2 these effect especially prominent u.s. manufacture sector, output sluggish, agricultural sector also hit hard rise value dollar. in addition, profit many firm adversely affect rise dollar weak demand abroad, business fix investment increase 1-1/2 percent last year contribute significantly growth early recovery. on balance, recent months, financial condition tighten somewhat equity price move low corporate risk spread widening, although condition improve recent weeks. in addition, progress inflation slow. price personal consumption expenditure (pce) increase 1.3 percent 12 month january, well federal open market committee’s (fomc) 2 percent target. reduction energy price are, part, responsible low rate, energy price stabilize, top-line inflation move higher. still, stabilization energy price assured. market participant repeatedly surprise depth persistence oil price declines: both spot far future oil prices, example, fall five past six quarter since mid-2014. but even discount influence energy prices, core pce inflation stubbornly stick vicinity 1-1/4 1-1/2 percent since 2012.3 most recently, dollar play important role hold non-oil import prices, fell 3-1/2 percent last year subtract estimate 1/2 percentage point core inflation.4 should dollar stabilize, downward influence inflation dissipate. but, oil prices, movement value dollar persistent market many observer expected, increase every quarter since mid-2014. if labor market continue improve, high resource utilization also put upward pressure inflation go forward. however, effect resource utilization inflation estimate much low today past decades.5 an important concern persistently low inflation lead fall longer-term inflation expectations, make much difficult achieve inflation target. for part, longer-term inflation expectation appear remain reasonably stable, though concern signs. longer-term inflation expectation professional forecaster primary dealer hold quite steady recent year level consistent fomc’s target. however, households’ inflation expectation appear move somewhat recently. five-to-10-year inflation expectation university michigan 2 see gruber, mccallum, vigfusson (2016). 3 core consumer price index (cpi) inflation 1/2 percentage point high core pce inflation 12 month january. over past 15 years, core cpi inflation average 1/4 percentage point core pce inflation. much recent large gap due difference coverage health-care service difference weight accord house service health-care services. the cpi cover out-of-pocket expenditure health-care services, pce index cover much broad range spending. expenditure house large share cpi pce index, price house service increase above-average pace recently. 4 see pp. 8–9 february 2016 monetary policy report (board governors, 2016). 5 see blanchard (2016); blanchard, cerutti, summer (2015); kiley (2015b). bi central bankers’ speech 3 survey consumer edge low past year two level february nearly 1/2 percentage point 10-year average. three-year inflation expectation new york federal reserve’s survey consumer expectation also move steadily low past two years, though recent decline energy price may explain much drift. notably, market-based measure inflation compensation base treasury inflation-protected security (tips) nominal treasury yield historically low levels. at five-year, five-year-ahead horizon, inflation compensation 1 percentage point low mid-2014 levels. decline swap-based measure inflation compensation similar. however, decline appear correlate oil prices, clear extent decline reflect change inflation expectations, change investor demand tip versus nominal treasury securities, improvement risk characteristic nominal treasury security versus assets. over next couple years, reason expect energy price dollar eventually stabilize, output increase around moderate pace average recovery thus far, foreign growth recover somewhat, u.s. labor market improve further, inflation move toward 2 percent target. however, risk around baseline forecast, prominent lie downside. for example, china face risk navigate sharp slow good sector, large buildup corporate debt, apparent surge demand foreign assets, although china posse resource deal challenges. more broadly, source robust demand around globe few, source weakness relatively greater, evidence persistently target inflation major advance economies. monetary policy in today’s circumstances, policy could usefully follow two simple guidelines. first, take strength u.s. labor market consumption granted. give weak decelerate foreign demand, critical carefully protect preserve progress make home prudent adjustment policy path. tight financial condition soft inflation expectation may pose risk downside inflation domestic activity. from risk-management perspective, argue patience outlook become clearer.6 7 second, put high premium clear evidence inflation move toward 2 percent target. inflation persistently underperform relative target. moreover, measure inflation compensation survey-based measure inflation expectation suggest inflation expectation may edge lower. give currently weak relationship economic slack inflation persistent, depress effect energy price decline exchange rate increases, cautious assess tighten labor market soon move inflation back 2 percent. we verify is, fact, take place. in regard, core pce inflation increase 1.7 percent 12 month end january, noticeable step-up increase 1.3 percent precede 12 months.7 6 to extent neutral rate interest – rate keep output potential level inflation target – fall unite state low around world, may weigh policy path. see laubach williams (2015), hamilton others (2015), kiley (2015a), johannsen mertens (2016), del negro

core pce price first part 2015, possible 12-month core pce inflation move low come month relatively large monthly increase drop 12-month window. 4 bi central bankers’ speech liquidity in addition raise uncertainty around outlook, recent financial market volatility underscore importance ongoing attention resilience market liquidity. although fair say recent uptick volatility part reduce early concern prolong low volatility associate reach-for-yield behavior, place add focus resilience liquidity, particularly markets, market corporate bonds, may prone gap liquidity demand supply stress conditions. the federal reserve’s surveillance liquidity condition financial market broaden deepen considerably since “taper tantrum” mid-2013 event october 2014 treasury market. the analysis far suggest preliminary observations. while appear day-to-day liquidity decline notably, characteristic liquidity provision changing. broadly, traditional price-based measure liquidity bid-asked spread price effect give trade size generally remain line pre-crisis norm markets. in contrast, anecdote market participant decline size trade market suggest may become expensive conduct, may take time

mr haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, meet hold yomiuri international economic society, tokyo, 7 march 2016. * * * accompany chart find end speech. introduction it great honor invite meet host yomiuri international economic society today. at end january, bank japan decide introduce “quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) negative interest rate,” add new dimension “a negative interest rate” exist policy qqe. specifically, bank apply negative interest rate minus 0.1 percent current account financial institution hold bank. this measure enable bank pursue additional monetary ease provide new option “a negative interest rate” addition “quantitative” “qualitative” measure use far. some market participant voice doubt expansion qqe would possible, argue qqe reach limit, i think view completely dispelled. “qqe negative interest rate” impact financial institutions, financial markets, and, broadly, people’s life general. moreover, term itself, “negative interest rate,” sound somewhat shocking, measure focus attention newspaper tv day day. give wide impact – financial markets, management financial institutions, people’s everyday life – have, measure give rise variety question concerns. today, i would like explain bank’s think regard policy respond frequently ask questions. i. benefit household firm be benefit household firms? to start with, i would like explain benefit “qqe negative interest rate” household firms. the medium report interest rate house loan declined, deposit interest rate also declined, ask whether net impact policy household negative positive. the answer clear. individual firm whole definitely benefit policy (chart 1). deposit interest rate declining, extent decline minimal, since rate already close 0 percent. for example, interest rate deposit ordinary account (the japanese equivalent check account retail customers) mega-banks decrease two-hundredths percent thousandth percent. in words, interest earn deposit 1 million yen year decline 190 yen – 200 yen 10 yen. on hand, extent decline lend rate much larger. lend rate 10-year fixed-rate house loan provide mega-banks decline 0.25 percentage point, tokyo inter-bank offer rate (tibor), benchmark rate lend firms, also fallen, 3-month tibor, example, decline slightly le 0.1 percentage point. while true interest earn deposit 1 million yen 10 yen, need consider since deposit interest rate become low. the first 2 bi central bankers’ speech time interest rate deposit ordinary account fell unit hundredth percent 1999, japan fall deflation. under deflation, price decline across board nominal interest rate fall accordingly. this situation persist japan prolong period. in order increase deposit interest rates, revitalize economy overcome deflation. another concern bank’s negative interest rate policy negative impact financial institutions’ business, make reluctant lend lead demand high lend rates. it certainly case prolong environment extremely low interest rates, financial institutions’ net interest income core business take deposit make loan decline trend. under circumstance strong concern introduction negative interest rate make situation even worse. from theoretical perspective, financial institution may tolerate cost impose negative interest rate instead pas cost increase lend rates. in europe, negative interest rate policy adopt japan, debate whether policy negative effect financial institutions’ business stability financial system, whether negative effect might put limit negative interest rate policies. however, situation japan quite different europe. first, japan’s financial institution sufficient capital buff remain sound, since severely affect subprime mortgage problem unite state global financial crisis. second, even though net interest income fallen, profit financial institution japan remain high due mainly low credit cost reflect japan’s economic recovery. in fact, fiscal 2014, major regional banks’ net income reach 3.3 trillion yen – close record high. therefore, entirely inconceivable japan function financial intermediation weaken due strain negative interest rate financial institutions’ business. in fact, give fierce competition japan’s lend market, bank unlikely increase lend rate offset rise cost negative interest rate policy. instead, financial institution consider cannot make sufficient profit core business – take deposit make loans. the reason deflation. under deflation, difference deposit rate short-term money market rate (deposit spreads) well gap long- short-term interest rate shrinking. this mean way drastically improve financial institutions’ profit revitalize economy overcome deflation. “qqe negative interest rate” aim overcome deflation completely achieve price stability target 2 percent. let explain policy seek achieve this. ii. background introduction “qqe negative interest rate” why policy implemented? to begin, i would like touch background introduction negative interest rate policy. since turn year, global financial market volatile backdrop decline crude oil price uncertainty future development emerge commodity-exporting economies, particularly chinese economy (chart 2). crude oil price drop around 30 u.s. dollars. the drop positive japan, importer crude oil, negative impact commodity-exporting economy include russia, brazil, country middle east, create uncertainty global economy. furthermore, chinese stock price decline considerably, resume slide start last summer. however, although chinese economy embark process deceleration, deteriorate suddenly. the reason slowdown chinese economy appear adjustment excess investment manufacturer restraint public investment municipal government tighten discipline. a bi central bankers’ speech 3 result, fix asset investment decelerate level municipal government resume public construction order second half 2015. in contrast, private consumption automobile sale remain firm, reflect progress transformation china’s economic structure one center manufacture one center nonmanufacturing. instead signal sudden deterioration china’s fundamentals, decline stock price see correction bubble well reaction movement exchange rate yuan. the yuan sell speculation devaluation, result decline china’s foreign currency reserves. this lead instability markets. consequently, stock price decline globally market become pessimistic, investor switch risk-off mode. in foreign exchange markets, demand yen, regard safe currency, increased, lead appreciation yen. although market become volatile, japan’s economic fundamental remain sound (chart 3). japan’s economy improve significantly three year ago. corporate profit historically high level unemployment rate 3.2 percent, essentially represent full employment. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index exclude fresh food energy increase minus 0.8 percent march 2013 1 percent recently. japan’s economy likely grow moderately inflation likely increase toward 2 percent. this baseline scenario remain unaffected recent volatility. nevertheless, light record profits, firms’ investment physical human capital remain rather subdued. under circumstances, volatility global market entail risk may lead deterioration firms’ sentiment setback conversion people’s deflationary mindset, underway. in fact, price perception firm recently deteriorated. thus, reason bank introduce “qqe negative interest rate” judge necessary order preempt manifestation risk maintain momentum toward achieve price stability target 2 percent. iii. effect “qqe negative interest rate” what effect negative interest rate policy have? next, i would like explain effect policy have. the key aim policy drive real interest rates, main transmission channel qqe. the fact past three year japan’s economy significantly improve long deflationary situation proof fall real interest rate positive impact economy inflation. let explain transmission mechanism qqe detail. first, qqe raise inflation expectation bank’s strong clear commitment achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time large-scale monetary ease underpin commitment. second, qqe put strong downward pressure nominal interest rate across entire yield curve massive purchase japanese government bond (jgbs). these two channel result decline real interest rates. the decline real interest rate boost business fix investment house investment decline interest rate business house loans. in financial markets, qqe underpin stock price help weaken yen, turn push corporate profits, thereby improve employment wages. the boost economic activity improve output gap – is, balance aggregate supply demand – together rise inflation expectations, lift prices. development since introduction qqe exactly conform anticipate transmission mechanisms. “qqe negative interest rate” represent framework transmission channel enhanced. the negative interest rate low short-term interest rates, 4 bi central bankers’ speech massive purchase long-term jgbs low long-term yields. these two element together exert strong downward pressure interest rate across entire yield curve. the important aspect effect yield curve strong two element implement tandem carry independently. the introduction negative interest rate current account financial institution hold bank reduce incentive sell jgbs exchange current account bank. the reason jgbs positive interest rate become valuable financial institution attach great importance interest income. a result, purchase long-term jgbs bank strong effects. under normal circumstances, short-term yield lowered, long-term interest rate decline extent. however, bank’s introduction negative interest rate, large part yield curve decline 0.2 percentage points, close decline short-term yields, (chart 4). this mean extent decline interest rate bring negative interest rate policy quite substantial. go forward, bank ass effect decline interest rate permeate spread real economy. doubt firms’ willingness invest even decline interest rate some argue decline real interest rate produce intend effect firm unwilling borrow invest. this possible short term, people pessimistic. over long period time, however, decline real interest rate surely boost economic activity inflation impact financial institutions’ behavior financial markets. in fact, bank lending, declining, increase past three year annual rate 2 percent (chart 5). stock price rise well, excessive appreciation yen corrected. against backdrop improvement capital markets, economic growth underlie trend inflation increased. a decline real interest rate effect expect growth rate, natural rate interest, low level central bank cannot produce real interest rate low that. while extreme case cannot rule theoretical possibility, i convince apply japan. let point couple reasons. first, past three years, decline real interest rate has, i mentioned, produce actual effects. and second, look japan’s economy japanese firms, i think situation dire that, give japan’s economic strength technological prowess skill-level labor force. it implausible natural interest rate low monetary policy would ineffective. doe volatility global financial market render monetary policy ineffective? the volatility recently observe global financial market certainly make difficult clearly see effect negative interest rate policy. immediately introduction negative interest rate policy, stock price rose, nikkei index add 800 point two days, yen fell 121 yen u.s. dollar. since then, however, global decline stock price appreciation yen continued, trigger pessimistic view u.s. economy concern stability financial system europe. these development lead newspaper headline claim effect negative interest rate policy cancel out. this accurate assessment. since introduction “qqe negative interest rate,” interest rate across board clearly declined. this exactly intended. the decline yen interest rate fact monetary ease possible – else equal – positive impact asset prices. in words, policy work direction raise stock price low value yen. at moment, effect outweigh excessive risk aversion among investor around globe. however, give fundamental japan’s economy japanese bi central bankers’ speech 5 firm remain strong negative interest rate policy powerful effect, financial market turn positive investor confidence returns. iv. adverse effect financial institutions’ earn financial market next, i would like discus possible cost associate negative interest rate policy. any policy come costs. in words, thing free lunch. in decide policy action, essential weigh expect cost need policy action try reduce cost wherever possible. how mitigate adverse effect financial institutions’ earn regard negative interest rate policy, potential adverse effect financial institutions’ earn function financial intermediary utmost importance. for example, financial institution might pas cost result negative interest rate policy borrower raise lend rate firm homeowners. in order avoid unintended consequences, bank adopt multi-tier system current account hold financial institution bank divide three separate tiers. multi-tier system place time european countries. under multi-tier system japan, zero interest rate positive interest rate apply financial institutions’ current account balance bank japan certain threshold (chart 6). let explain bank’s three-tier system works. first, interest rate – positive rate 0.1 percent – apply financial institutions’ current account balance already hold time introduction negative interest rate policy. specifically, balance calculate average amount outstanding financial institutions’ current account 2015 – refer financial institutions’ “basic balances” – minus require reserves. the total “basic balances” minus require reserve financial institution current account bank 210 trillion yen 80 percent aggregate amount outstanding financial institutions’ current accounts. second, zero interest rate continue apply require reserve hold financial institution subject reserve requirement system; zero interest rate also apply amount current account balance correspond outstanding amount borrow bank japan special facility (the stimulate bank lend facility, growth-supporting fund facility, funds-supplying operation support financial institution disaster area affect great east japan earthquake). the sum item call financial institutions’ “macro add-on balance.” the sum “macro add-on balances” financial institution start negative interest rate policy amount 40 trillion yen. and third, financial institutions’ remain current account balance call “policy-rate balance,” negative interest rate applied. at start negative interest rate policy, aggregate amount “policy-rate balances” financial institution current account bank 10 trillion yen net basis. since bank continue purchase jgbs annual rate 80 trillion yen proceed purchase pay financial institutions’ current account bank, financial institutions’ current account balance increase. therefore, threshold remain unchanged, balance negative interest rate apply increase time. in light this, bank raise amount current account balance zero interest rate apply (“macro add-on balances”) certain interval – example, every three month – incremental manner order keep amount current account balance negative interest rate apply (“policy-rate balances”) le unchanged. by so, amount current account balance financial institution incur negative interest keep minimum necessary achieve objective negative interest rate policy. 6 bi central bankers’ speech give negative interest rate apply part financial institutions’ current account balances, may wonder whether negative interest rate policy fully exert intend effects. we believe will. let give example. if one bank sell jgbs another, proceed transfer sell banks’ current account bank japan. this transaction lead increase sell banks’ current account balance, raise amount negative interest rate imposed. this mean price financial market – interest rates, stock prices, exchange rate – determine premise negative interest rate apply marginal increase financial institutions’ current account balances. a proverb says, see believing. all look change yield curve. interest rate indeed clearly drop across maturity since introduction negative interest rate policy (chart 4). japan’s three-tier system design minimize direct impact financial institutions’ earn maximize positive effect negative interest rate policy. the system work intended. despite carefully calibrate design multi-tier system, decline market interest rate inevitably adverse effect financial institutions’ profits. for example, virtually impossible bank cut interest rate customers’ deposit negative territory, want maintain long-term relationship customers. in addition, negative interest rate impose customers’ deposit, would prompt customer withdraw cash bank account hoard cash vaults. in fact, financial institutions’ retail deposit interest rate never turn negative even european country central bank cut deposit rate low minus 1 percent. on hand, banks’ interest income decrease reflect decline jgb yields. moreover, lend rate house corporate loan decline extent. a result, banks’ earn negatively affected. however, note monetary ease pursue view exert positive effect economic activity firm household – financial institutions’ customers. these positive effect economy negative impact financial institutions’ profit two side coin. a mention before, decline yield curve start point transmission policy effects. reduce impact something achieve change design policy. it productive consider adverse interest rate environment, responsible decline financial institutions’ profit core business – take deposit make loan – protracted. a i mention earlier, improvement japan’s economic activity price positive impact financial institutions’ business, example reduction credit costs. moreover, bank lend increasing, albeit moderately. however, financial institutions’ profit margin improved, financial institutions’ profit remain strong downward pressure. the fundamental cause protract deflation japan. in environment deflation low interest rate short-term interest rate close zero, profit deposit spread disappear, maturity transformation shrink narrow differential long- short-term interest rate due flatten yield curve. in addition, since japanese firm restrain fix investment instead hoard cash deposits, banks’ loan-to-deposit ratio substantially declined. further, reflect severe competition among banks, lend margin continue narrow. in order japan’s economy escape trap, economy need overcome deflation completely. if deflation return japan low interest-rate environment continue, would cause serious problem banks’ profitability. once deflation overcome completely, firm become proactive make investments, lead increase loan demand. under circumstances, short-term interest rate become positive, bank able profit deposit spreads. a yield curve bi central bankers’ speech 7 become steeper, interest-rate margin improve due large interest-rate differential long- short-term rates. therefore, overcome deflation essential recovery japan’s economy also full-fledged recovery financial institutions’ profitability improvement profit margins. how mitigate adverse effect financial market another important point take consideration introduce negative interest rate potential adverse effect function financial markets. another purpose three-tier system therefore ensure transaction continue take place short-term money market. under three-tier system, financial institution hold current account balance negative interest rate applied, financial institution unused allowance tier zero positive interest rate applied. i mention early aggregate amount policy-rate balance negative interest rate apply initially 10 trillion yen net basis financial institution hold current account bank. in fact, look january 2016 reserve maintenance period, sum amount outstanding policy-rate balance financial institution positive policy-rate balance, sum 20 trillion yen. however, give financial institution unused allowance tier zero positive interest rate applied, financial institution raise fund financial institution positive policy-rate balance rate still negative high (i.e., le negative) minus 0.1 percent. these transaction profitable sides. if arbitrage transaction take place full, net amount negative-rate balance 10 trillion yen. in words, suggest incentive financial institution engage transaction interbank money market. in switzerland, money-market transaction take place negative rates. in cases, private banks, large negative-rate balances, lenders, major banks, unused zero interest rate tier allowances, borrowers. go forward, expect arbitrage transaction money market gradually increase japan well. look development money market since february 16, negative interest rate start applied, although transaction negative uncollateralized overnight call rate day, uncollateralized overnight call transaction negative interest rate since february 17, weight average rate negative. meanwhile, volume transaction call market decrease previous reserve maintenance period. nevertheless, i believe financial institution proceed update computer system operations, market become accustom negative interest rates, transaction call market increase. in fact, mentioned, switzerland denmark, adopt negative interest rate earlier, transaction financial institution negative rate balance – become lender – unused zero positive interest rate tier allowance – become borrower – take place negative interest rates. the volume money market transaction two country quite substantial. the bank continue carefully monitor development money market, include financial institution adjust computer system operation cope negative interest rate transactions. conclude remark we cannot deny “qqe negative interest rate” adverse effect financial institutions’ earnings. that said, let reiterate aim policy benefit household firm ultimately fully overcome deflation. the policy seek reduce real interest rate strengthen effect qqe, prove effective past three years. by make full use “qqe negative interest rate,” bank achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. 8 bi central bankers’ speech deflation return japan. price stability 2 percent inflation definitely achieved. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 bi central bankers’ speech 1 hiroshi nakaso: japan’s economy monetary policy speech mr hiroshi nakaso, deputy governor bank japan, meet business leaders, okinawa, 3 march 2016. * * * accompany chart find end speech. introduction it pleasure opportunity today exchange view administrative, financial, business leader okinawa prefecture. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation activity bank japan’s naha branch. at monetary policy meet hold end january 2016, bank decide introduce “quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) negative interest rate.” today, exchange view you, i would first like explain bank’s view recent development outlook economic activity prices. i move recent conduct monetary policy elaborate “qqe negative interest rate” bank decide introduce. i. recent development outlook economic activity price home abroad current situation japan’s economic activity bank’s projection january 2016 outlook report to start with, let talk economic development japan. although global financial market volatile since turn year, i believe need pessimistic fundamental japan’s economy firm. with regard japan’s recent economic activity, domestic demand follow uptrend, virtuous cycle income spend maintain household corporate sectors. in corporate sector, profit clearly continue improve, reach record high, support improvement real economy well low crude oil price correction yen’s appreciation (chart 1). against background, business fix investment moderate increase trend. in household sector, labor market condition continue tighten. the active job openings-to-applicants ratio diffusion index employment condition december 2015 short-term economic survey enterprise japan (tankan) improve almost level around first half 1992. moreover, unemployment rate decline range 3.0–3.5 percent first time since 1997. the labor market situation close “full employment,” unemployment due solely mismatch job open job applicant (chart 2). reflect tighten labor market conditions, employee income increase moderately. under steady improvement employment income situation, private consumption resilient. look ahead, domestic demand likely follow uptrend, virtuous cycle income spend maintain household corporate sectors. export expect increase moderately back emerge economy move deceleration phase. against backdrop, japan’s economy likely moderate expand trend. a january 2016 outlook economic activity price (outlook report), estimate economy continue grow pace potential fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2017, project maintain positive growth, although 2 bi central bankers’ speech slow pace around level somewhat potential growth rate, reflect effect front-loaded increase subsequent decline demand prior consumption tax hike, well cyclical development economy. the median policy board members’ forecast real gdp growth rate also indicate january outlook report, fiscal 2015, 2016, 2017 1.1 percent, 1.5 percent, 0.3 percent, respectively (chart 3). price development japan outlook let turn price development japan. ａsignificant change price development observe introduction qqe. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi, item le fresh food), minus 0.5 percent introduction qqe, improve high 1.5 percent april 2014, exclude effect consumption tax hike (chart 4). thereafter, year-on-year rate change cpi declined, mark 0 percent recently, largely attributable substantial fall crude oil price since summer 2014. a underlie trend inflation, year-on-year rate change cpi exclude fresh food energy – large fluctuation – negative introduction qqe, turn positive october 2013. since then, remain positive 28 consecutive month increase 1.1 percent recently. the share price-increasing item minus share price-decreasing item cpi increase clearly, suggest price rise observe wide range good service (chart 5). in brief, forecast cpi (all item le fresh food) obtain add underlie trend inflation contribution energy item cpi. the january outlook report assume dubai crude oil price rise moderately recent 35 u.s. dollar per barrel range 45–50 dollar per barrel toward end fiscal 2017, mark end projection period. the contribution energy item year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) estimate slightly minus 1 percentage point high level recently. however, aforementioned assumption crude oil prices, contribution project decrease. meanwhile, since underlie trend inflation likely rise steadily, likely see clearly year-on-year rate change cpi. therefore, underlie trend inflation improve steadily baseline scenario would follows: year-on-year rate change cpi likely accelerate toward price stability target 2 percent economy likely moderate expand trend. take factor account, year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) project reach around 2 percent – price stability target – around first half fiscal 2017. global financial market overseas economy on hand, global financial market nervous since turn year; yen appreciate investor seek safe due elevate risk aversion backdrop decline global stock price result decline crude oil price loom uncertainty future development chinese economy. next, i would like explain current situation outlook overseas economy create turmoil global financial markets. to give overview recent developments, overseas economy – mainly advance economy – continue grow moderate pace whole, despite slowdown emerge economies. by region, u.s. economy continue steadily recover, reflect firmness household spending. some market participant hold cautious view toward development u.s. economy, new concern observed, therefore i suppose view pessimistic. the european economy also continue recover moderately (chart 6). bi central bankers’ speech 3 it true chinese economy, attract world’s attention, continue state deceleration due downward pressure overhang production capacity inventory adjustment manufacture sector (chart 7). other emerge economy commodity-exporting economy whole also remain situation deceleration, effect slowdown chinese economy spread decline commodity price protracted. some economy asia, however, see pick-up it-related demand. look ahead, chinese economy likely broadly follow stable growth path, albeit somewhat slow pace mainly manufacture sector, authority proactively carry policy measure support economic activity. other emerge economy commodity-exporting economy whole expect gradually increase growth rates, due mainly effect recovery advance economy economic stimulus measures, although commodity-exporting economy likely remain situation deceleration time being. ii. the bank’s monetary policy management basic mechanism monetary ease however, turn year, global financial market continue volatile, i mention earlier. at monetary policy meet hold end january 2016, many policy board member point increase risk volatility global financial market might delay improvement business confidence japanese firm conversion deflationary mindset, might also negatively affect underlie trend inflation. to preempt manifestation risk maintain momentum toward achieve price stability target 2 percent, bank decide introduce “qqe negative interest rate.” now, i would like focus bank’s monetary policy management. to begin with, let review basic transmission mechanism monetary ease bank pursued, talk newly introduce “qqe negative interest rate.” generally speaking, main transmission channel monetary ease would follows: cut real interest rate – is, interest rate adjust inflation expectation – stimulate economic activity business fix investment house investment. inflation expectation take account because, price expect rise, corporate profit wage also likely increase, thus real interest rate, mean real cost borrowing, become low nominal interest rate. when decide extent real interest rate lowered, policymakers focus natural rate interest reference level. every country natural rate interest, neutral economic activity neither accelerate decelerate economy. the effect monetary ease produce reduce real interest rate low level compare natural rate interest. in general, natural rate interest determine largely potential growth rate, represent economy’s growth potential. in japan, potential growth rate range 3–4 percent 1980s decline significantly turn 1990s. recently, estimate around 0.5 percent lower. bear factor mind, monetary policy since 1990s summarize follows. with aim take measure bring recovery follow economic recession burst bubble, bank gradually cut policy interest rates. a result, short-term interest rate reach approximately 0 percent end 1990s. however, time, potential growth rate become low, accordingly natural rate interest declined. even though bank low nominal short-term interest rate 0 percent, unable reduce real interest rate level significantly 4 bi central bankers’ speech natural rate interest due widely spread deflationary sentiment among public. in order make breakthrough situation, bank introduce qqe april 2013. this policy measure aim low real interest rate two mean (chart 8). the first raise inflation expectation bank’s strong commitment achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. the second make use room low nominal interest rate. although short-term interest rate already decline low 0 percent, long-term interest rate still room fall. therefore, bank decide massively purchase japanese government bond (jgbs), thereby put downward pressure across entire yield curve; i.e., short-term interest rate also long-term interest rate include 10-year jgbs, well super-long-term interest rate jgbs maturity 20 year longer. by refer specific data, let briefly explain intend effect spread far. yield 10-year jgbs already low record low level bank decide introduce “qqe negative interest rate,” thus entire yield curve push extremely low level (chart 9). at time, inflation expectation rise whole somewhat longer-term perspective. accord various survey-based indicators, inflation expectation generally raise 0.5 percentage point qqe (chart 10). the decline nominal interest rate rise inflation expectation suggest real interest rate largely push down. in fact, introduction qqe, real interest rate remain negative territory. thus, i mentioned, real interest rate, decline record low level, stimulate domestic demand, result moderate recovery japan’s economy improvement underlie trend inflation. zero low bind interest rate framework “qqe negative interest rate” the newly introduce “qqe negative interest rate” maintain reinforce basic mechanism qqe, produce intend effects. for long period time, common understand make u believe nominal interest rate cannot fall zero low bound. however, present, central bank europe, include european central bank (ecb), fact implement negative interest rate policies. the follow two point consider reason nominal interest rate cannot turn negative. first, financial institutions’ profit would squeeze negative interest rate apply current account central bank. if negative interest rate massively squeeze financial institutions’ profit – i would view extreme case – function financial intermediation could hamper and, result, intend effect monetary ease would wane. second, large negative interest rate would incentivize financial institution withdraw cash current account central bank attempt avoid negative interest rate applied. since financial institutions, hold large amount cash, suffer various cost include delivery storage, well run new risk theft, unlikely largely replace current account balance cash hold soon interest rate current account become negative. this implies, however, could certain limit depth negative interest rate. in words, two concern dispelled, negative short-term interest rate could form apply negative interest rate current account central bank, thereby push short end yield curve. the bank come solution challenge regard negative interest rate. this “qqe negative interest rate,” outstanding balance financial institution’s current account bank divide three tier negative interest rate apply certain tier. the three-tier system adopt partly consideration impact financial institutions’ profit well bi central bankers’ speech 5 (chart 11). the outstanding balance current account divide three tiers, positive interest rate 0.1 percent continue apply vast majority exist balance. practically, “first floor” three-tier system, “basic balance” define average outstanding balance current account january december 2015. in “basic balance,” 0.1 percent positive interest rate continue apply 210 trillion yen; words, amount outstanding exceed require reserves, zero interest rate apply old scheme. next, zero interest rate apply “second floor.” for part, second floor intend keep amount negative interest rate apply build time. therefore, balance “second floor” adjust appropriate time future. some lend program bank, loan support program funds-supplying operation support financial institution disaster areas, implement zero lend rate on. a zero interest rate apply amount outstanding facility negative margin incur lend rate interest rate apply correspond balance current account bank would disincentivize financial institution use facilities. in similar vein, interest rate apply require reserve continue zero. a negative interest rate minus 0.1 percent apply portion current account balance exceed amount outstanding “first” “second” floors. this “third floor” three-tier system call “policy-rate balance” negative interest rate apply course monetary policy. admittedly, true interest rate minus 0.1 percent apply current account balance bank, practice, i explained, negative interest rate apply “policy-rate balance.” at start negative interest rate policy, balance amount 10 trillion yen, consist small portion total current account outstanding 260 trillion yen. therefore, adverse impact financial institutions’ profit largely mitigate negative interest rate policy powerfully produce intend effect push short end yield curve. this price new financial transaction jgb transaction determine base “marginal” cost, economic jargon put it. consequently, negative interest rate minus 0.1 percent apply marginal increase current account balance bank define short end yield curve. besides cost incur hold current account deposit bank, downward shift entire yield curve admittedly negative impact financial institutions’ profits. it note always case monetary ease general nothing special negative interest policy regard: gist mere reflection monetary ease effects. look ahead, negative interest rate policy exert intend effects, private demand business fix investment house investment expect increase. in sense, negative interest rate policy accelerate process overcome deflation. this could quick way get low interest rate quagmire well bring favorable business condition financial institutions. financial institution may want properly consider point, hope proactively explore potential borrow needs, thereby create new business opportunities. spillover effect “qqe negative interest rate” in addition transmission mechanism qqe, intend push long-term interest rate massive purchase jgbs, “qqe negative interest rate” aim low short end yield curve apply negative interest rate minus 0.1 percent certain tier current account bank, thereby exert downward pressure interest rate across entire yield curve. “qqe negative interest rate” already bring tangible effects. the jgb yield curve decline 6 bi central bankers’ speech further; yield shorter-than-around 10-year jgbs negative (chart 9). reflect decline jgb yields, financial institutions’ benchmark lend rate house loan interest rate also decline clearly. look ahead, i confident effect decline interest rate steadily spread real economy prices. some may concern financial institutions’ retail deposit interest rate also might turn negative. admittedly, financial institution make decision interest rate depositors. in meantime, i would like emphasize negative retail deposit interest rate hardly see even european countries, negative interest rate policy already adopt much low rate compare japan – minus 0.75 percent switzerland, example. give european experiences, i sure grind retail deposit interest rate turn negative japan (chart 12). under negative interest rate policy, doubt wide range interest rate decline. however, mean deposit interest rate turn negative owe monetary policy. rather, policy bring positive effect borrower decline cost borrowing. in wake “qqe negative interest rate,” house loan interest rates, example, decline significantly deposit interest rates, already extremely low. the decline house loan interest rate spur house investment lead economic expansion. the unquestionable fact that, negative interest rate policy, kind monetary ease reduce interest rates. the change interest rate could different effect across individual entity short term; however, look economy whole, decline interest rate bring monetary ease would likely stimulate domestic demand expand economy. the bank’s determine commitment toward overcome deflation sustainable economic growth japan mire deflation 15 years. for japan achieve sustainable economic growth future, utmost priority overcome deflation early possible time. in order indicate unwavering attain target, bank decide introduce “qqe negative interest rate.” japan’s economy steadily progress toward overcome deflation past three year introduction qqe, halfway achieve price stability target. meanwhile, bank devise framework monetary policy various way adjust economic financial developments. relate point, i touch supplementary measure decide monetary policy meet december 2015 facilitate smooth implementation qqe. specifically, take measure (1) expand eligible collateral bank’s provision credit (2) extend average remain maturity jgb purchases. a expansion eligible collateral, bank continue massive purchase jgbs, amount eligible collateral private financial institution decrease. expand range eligible collateral contribute smooth asset purchase future. a extension average remain maturity jgb purchases, aim flexible smooth asset purchase assure liquidity jgb markets. a indicate measures, “a negative interest rate” additional monetary ease term “quantity” “quality” dimension naturally remain policy option. i convince new policy framework drastic measure fulfill bank’s responsibility overcome deflation. raise growth potential japan’s economy monetary policy in order achieve sustainable economic growth, japan’s economy inevitably tackle challenge raise medium-term growth potential, top overcome deflation. a i noted, potential growth rate japan estimate decline around 0.5 percent lower. take shrink population given, overall increase labor productivity key raise potential growth rate. in sense, look ahead, bi central bankers’ speech 7 structural reform need promote economic context also social context, focus develop productivity-enhancing mechanism environment. i strongly expect government continue commit structural reform without loosen reins. the bank also contribute raise growth potential powerful monetary ease dispel people’s deflationary mindset provide favorable environment firm make investment proactively take action improve productivity. furthermore, bank purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) annual pace 3 trillion yen qqe, additionally establish new program purchase etf annual pace 300 billion yen, compose stock issue firm proactively invest physical human capital. this program enact next month. we already receive various encourage opinion comment market participant run-up start-up new program place hope enhance growth potential. with encouragement, work diligently set eligible criterion operational framework purchases. a i note far, i believe monetary policy overcome deflation structural reform raise potential growth rate must pursue tandem bring japan’s economy back track toward sustain growth. now bank japan take monetary ease one step introduce “qqe negative interest rate,” i expect original third arrow abenomics, growth strategy, fly high faster. moreover, i hope household firm take bold step towards economic prosperity, make full use current financial environment, accommodative ever. conclusion in concluding, let touch economy okinawa prefecture. the economy continue expand whole. this attributable high level public investment increase tourism demand mainly support weak yen, increase volume international flights, ease visa requirements. the buoyant construction tourism sector lead expansion corporate activity, steadily improve employment income situation. in term private consumption recently, consumer incline purchase high-end products. these development

tourism demand. lead significant increase tourist china foreign regions, number tourist okinawa prefecture 2015 increase 0.7 million year early register new record high, mark 7.76 million total. even turn year, increase trend continued, effect slowdown chinese economy observe thus far. a tourism demand increases, hotel occupancy rate spend per tourist rising. i hear that, due increase tourist overseas, many domestic tourist even give visit prefecture high season last year. this uptrend tourism demand likely continue back overseas travel boom see neighbor economy expansion runway naha airport. okinawa prefecture assign national strategic special zone international tourism, lead increase domestic fix investment, construction hotels. increase demand duty free good souvenir reflect favorable corporate profit retail wholesale sectors. with regard outlook tourism industry, major industry okinawa prefecture, prefecture aim achieve 1 trillion yen tourism revenue 10 million tourist arrivals. with aim attain targets, plan develop world’s high quality 8 bi central bankers’ speech resort area attempt attract high-end inbound tourists. to realize goal, vital make best use nature-rich environment well historical cultural property inherit ryukyu kingdom date back 15th century, upgrade tourism industry. in term effort make use geographical characteristics, logistics front, set okinawa international logistics hub aim enable high-speed transportation major asian city progress steadily. the decision make build new international convention facility, expectation encourage demand mouse (i.e., meeting, incentive, convention, exhibition/event) promote business matching. the creation improvement infrastructure likely largely contribute development okinawa prefecture line economic growth neighbor economies. there old phrase okinawa prefecture: bankoku shinryo (i.e., bridge nations). i hear origin phrase go back 15th century, ryukyu kingdom – close proximity japan, china, korea, southeast asian region – prosper transit trade country. bankoku shinryo express ryukyu kingdom serve bridge connect entire world trade vessels, make use geographical advantages. this phrase fit today’s okinawa prefecture even better, since provide bridge country world term gateway international logistics also tourism site. the bank, center naha branch, hope

capacity euro area introductory remark mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, public hear european parliament, brussels, 2 march 2016. * * * madam chair, mr chair, honourable member european parliament, lady gentlemen, i grateful two rapporteur two committee chair hold hear today advance public debate fiscal capacity euro area. we well aware political attention largely focus elsewhere, lose sight objective complete economic monetary union (emu), secure capacity absorb economic shock create confidence today future economic performance. a i say elsewhere, downside risk recovery materialise, would make easy respond refugee crisis counter terrorism.1 a quick glance fiscal policy today convince u importance discussion: • the recovery euro area proceed sedate pace; mainly support monetary policy measure low price energy. at time, global economy overshadow renew uncertainty broad geopolitical risks. • public finance many euro area country still fragile condition. after past significant progress fiscal consolidation, fiscal policy present mildly expansionary average euro area. in many member states, even though quality improvement change composition fiscal spend still possible, high debt level leave room fiscal manoeuvre. only country currently fiscal space available. rigidity economic structure several member states, although addressed, still significant. this situation cast doubt euro area’s capacity face future economic shocks. a key policy challenge therefore dispel doubt today make sure euro area well-prepared downturns. a one two central banker podium, role explain specific design fiscal capacity would right choice euro area. this political choice outcome political discussion.2 what i offer today assessment, economist, need fiscal capacity euro area, cannot silver bullet make emu work better, condition could function well. fiscal policy emu the role fiscal policy emu core policy debate time now. fiscal policy span broad range issues, range public investment collective 1 see cœuré, b., “time new lamfalussy moment”, speech professor lamfalussy commemorative conference, budapest, 1 february 2016. 2 see cœuré, b., “towards political convergence process euro area”, speech interparliamentary conference “towards progressive europe”, berlin, 16 october 2015. 2 bi central bankers’ speech good – allocative function would also include eu budget – tool macroeconomic stabilisation. today, rather discuss what, broadly speaking, fiscal policy could support growth current juncture, i focus well-designed fiscal policy economic monetary union – monetary policy exercise european level – could act instrument stabilisation. let start clarify euro area today crossroad two starkly different routes, namely, responsible national fiscal policy one hand common fiscal capacity euro area budget other, choice route base political philosophical priors. from economic standpoint, complementary. and fact, already element both. first, precondition fiscal policy able contribute effectively macroeconomic stabilisation ensure market faith sustainability public finances. and adherence to, full consistent implementation of, stability growth pact fiscal compact important. a i say before, matter theology; political economic imperative. market need trust capability governance framework effectively coordinate fiscal policy emu, citizen need confident common rule respected. let add common fiscal capacity finance current future tax taxpayer company already fund national budgets. we cannot add edifice foundation shaky, is, national budget clearly sustainable. in concrete terms, mean member state rebuild fiscal buff national budget able weather future economic shocks, time adjust composition fiscal policy optimally support recovery. once buff available, stability growth pact provide ample flexibility adjust fiscal requirement enable function automatic stabiliser national level react severe downturn euro area whole need be. whether stability growth pact review complement new features, sovereign debt restructure mechanisms, improve ownership set right incentive open question, ramification go far beyond discussion today. but case, trust rebuild start unravel exist rules. second, see crisis that, without monetary policy instrument national level, fiscal policy become overwhelm country-specific shock large well cater shock-absorbing capacity economy financial sector. action take reduce probability size large shocks. the bank union, single supervisory mechanism, single resolution mechanism new bail-in rules, go long way direction, provide element implement resolute consistent way. but cannot responsibly assume euro area immune crises. the five presidents’ report therefore call creation shock-absorption capacity euro area level complement automatic stabiliser member states. and last least, ample scope euro area country good absorb shock internally, suitably resilient economies. additionally, need improve strengthen labour mobility risk-sharing via financial markets. this another reason complete bank union, complement capital market union substantial cross-border equity links, important. and also remind u importance preserve labour mobility temptation raise new fences. a fiscal capacity euro area there many way euro area fiscal capacity could implemented, range simple macro insurance unemployment benefit scheme fully-fledged euro area budget could include provision public goods. each option entail technical political challenge opportunities. in end, choice option combination bi central bankers’ speech 3 option adopt need political one. this fact opportunity debate europe’s collective goals; debate necessary ever go beyond economic sphere alone.3 from perspective economist central banker keen interest make emu whole work better, crucial question behind discussion fiscal capacity euro area maximise positive effect function emu, time preserve incentive sound fiscal policy-making address structural weakness national level. to start with, able agree objective fiscal capacity make emu resilient increase capacity automatic stabilisation euro area. the aim actively fine-tune national economic cycle equalise revenues. this line design principle describe five presidents’ report, notably insist fiscal capacity entail permanent transfer one direction. a fiscal capacity sense would also distinct nature allocative tool provide eu budget. to able reach objective, base introductory remarks, i believe need see significant progress along follow three dimensions: first, pool fiscal resources, whatever nature size might be, work solidarity go hand hand share responsibility. a move towards fiscal risk-sharing emu would therefore require commensurate shift towards increase joint decision-making within strong common institutions. in case, access joint euro area fiscal capacity make conditional compliance fiscal rule stability growth pact. second, aim contain burden fall fiscal policy strengthen market-based adjustment. a ludwig erhard famously said, need “as much market possible, much state needed”. this mean structural reform national level. but also mean complete bank union supplement comprehensive capital market union european level. in addition, call complete single market broadly, include service sector. third, lie heart insurance risk distribute equally ex ante. when come mutual insurance asymmetric shocks, clear fiscal risk always stem fiscal action, unsustainable economic financial policy elsewhere. therefore, move direction accompany new convergence process towards resilient economic structures. such process would allow u advance together towards better-equipped emu, outline clear path reform commitment fiscal capacity. political convergence need kick process, new convergence process effective legitimacy underpin it. conclusion let conclude say protection moral hazard course important. at time, use strategy relegate move towards fiscal capacity euro area never-never land. the move towards fiscal capacity could take form gradual conditional process allow u move parallel towards restore fiscal buff national level, convergence capacity absorb shock national level strengthen institution euro area level, moving, equally gradually, towards central fiscal stabilisation. 3 see cœuré, b.: “drawing lesson crisis future euro area” speech “ambassadors week”, paris, 27 august 2015. 4 bi central bankers’ speech i think ambitious respect. in fact, i would even argue urgent need accelerate effort complete emu architecture fiscal capacity. although acknowledge take time, get right require effort precision, act without delay speed work. thank attention bi central bankers’ speech 1 fernando restoy: european bank sector – situation challenge speech mr fernando restoy, deputy governor bank spain, base address deliver uimp seminar “¿qué hemos aprendido de la crisis?” (“what learn crisis?”), organise apie (association economics journalists), madrid, 17 june 2016. * * * thank you, miguel ángel, introduction. a know, pleasure santander, participate closure seminar organise apie (association economics journalists) menéndez pelayo international university (uimp). a always, i greatly appreciate invite become traditional event calendar. some day back course meeting, renowned economics practitioner tell complex interest citizen obtain well-founded view situation spanish bank system. this strike appropriate remark. despite extensive work banco de españa public private agency compile disseminate information analysis banks, always easy gain proper insight sector whole. that i would like take opportunity today offer in-depth analysis situation outlook spanish european financial institution context single supervisory mechanism (ssm). in connection, i shall first briefly review situation bank sector, focus thereafter challenge bank face short medium term. i shall conclude brief think ecb’s new supervisory framework. 1. recent development bank sector in recent years, response financial crisis, bank substantially improve solvency levels, largely result new regulatory supervisory requirements. at ssm-supervised banks, last year alone highest-quality (i.e. cet1) capital increase average 70 bp, 12.7% 2014 13.4% 20151. in case spanish banks, whose start level somewhat lower, increase exceed 80 bp, make average 12.5% cet1 end-2015. the profitability bank business, however, remain low level and, event, far double-digit figure see crisis. among ssm bank whole, return equity (roe) 2015 slightly 5%, whereas spain, consolidate terms, scarcely 5.6%. admittedly, unusual return capital stand euro area country level average cost capital, estimate make banco de españa. in case spanish banks, estimate cost capital stand 6.8% december 2015, draw close level 8% early 2016, result period instability observe financial markets. we thus environment return demand investor is, general, low obtain bank present. and despite fact risk acquisition bank share entail lessen consequence reduction banks’ leverage. 1 average ssm institution accord banco de españa calculations. 2 bi central bankers’ speech naturally, disappoint performance bank profit one factor behind decline banks’ share price recent month which, across board, stand significantly book value, see chart 1. this decline somewhat great case spanish banks, although continue evidence high ratio main euro area bank systems. chart 1 2. challenge bank sector several factor account low profitability bank business europe. 2.1 low interest rate one main factor maintenance interest rate low level which, along low level economic activity, exert downward pressure banks’ net interest income. the pressure exert low interest rate affect spanish bank common european entities, albeit differ intensity depend balance sheet structure predominant type bank business. hence, adverse effect profitability interest rate hold low level great high percentage loan extend float interest rate, low percentage asset record fair value great proportion account deposit bank’s finance structure. that say, current environment low rate particularly affect traditional bank business financial intermediation, namely prevail spain. additionally, bear mind impact change interest rate bank profitability linear. any reduction interest rates, environment already low levels, affect bank margin particular intensity. indeed, work perform banco de españa show (see chart 2) that, high level interest rates, moderate reduction euribor exert positive impact net interest income, since stimulus effect (quantity effect) exert low rate demand credit offset reduction unit return loan (price effect). however, interest rate source: datastream.0.00.20.40.60.81.01.2june 2015may 2016spainitalyfrancegermanyeuro areaeuropeprice to book value ratio of the bank sector bi central bankers’ speech 3 already low, decline euribor associate reduction interest margin (the price effect exceed quantity effect) bank le capacity pas reduction interest rate retail deposit owe proximity zero-rate level. it possible non-linearities may exacerbate interest rate move negative territory. chart 2 that said, also factor mitigate impact low interest rate results. in particular, low interest rate level contribute reduce loan loss provisions, insofar conducive decline non-performing loans. this mitigate effect particularly significant spain, owe prevalence asset float rate bank balance sheets. 2.2 non-performing loan the second factor weigh bank profitability still-high level non-productive asset balance sheet bank locate specific countries, despite continue downtrend observe time. a see chart 3, instance npl ratio exceed level 15% mid-2015. with ratio approximately 7%2, spain stand slightly euro area average, thank reduction witness past two years. nonetheless, npl ratio imperfect indicator effect non-productive problem asset may bank’s solvency, since take account asset collateral provision set aside. the so-called texas ratio, approximation 2 accord data spain eba 2015 transparency exercise (consolidated data, significant institutions). with data business spain, draw individual financial statements, relate ratio resident private sector spain stand 10.4% december 2015. 4 bi central bankers’ speech illustrate chart 4, offer much broad view also include calculation provision capital available bank. chart 3 chart 4 in event, ensure suitable level provision problem asset key properly identify impairment correctly measure bank’s solvency. moreover, rigorous provision review policy provide bank right incentive management non-productive assets, since reduce book loss disposal asset may generate. this achieve stringent account regulation strict supervision asset valuation bank’s balance sheet which, aware, key element banco de españa’s supervisory strategy. indeed, recently amend account circular bank must conform order, among purposes, fine-tune account criterion respect provision credit risk losses. further, time actively contribute within ssm develop common methodology field encompass best practice ensure uniform application across countries. 2.3 regulatory reform the ongoing still incomplete reform regulatory framework another factor uncertainty affect banks’ share prices. with regard basel committee’s agenda, major headway make reform prudential standard and, particular, treatment credit, market operational risks. one relevant area work way seek correct excessive variability risk-weighted asset (the denominator capital ratio) prompt use insufficiently homogeneous internal models. such heterogeneity lead inadequate risk measurement generate competitive distortions, harm institution subject demand regime model supervision. the current challenge come parameterisation new requirement enable risk measurement enhance without significantly

order hold prudential requirement level compatible pursuit bank activity proper footing. bank must also meet requirement stem new resolution regulations, seek minimise need use public fund manage bank crises. in particular, bank recovery resolution directive (brrd), significant institution shall, addition meet establish capital requirements, minimum volume liability enable loss absorb necessary. that say, shall debt instrument hand may convert capital experience problem viability. these requirement likely prove bind restriction financial institutions. the issuance instrument may pose challenge, especially unlisted bank little experience issuance convertible instrument subordinate debt. this concern quite substantial segment european bank sector. consider almost 70% bank supervise ssm issue list shares, 59% issue convertible bond 18% subordinate debt balance sheet (see chart 5). many bank foreseeably make adjustment business model, align change size composition bank balance

naturally, credit institutions’ first line defence gain efficiency. in recent years, observe chart 6, cost-to-income ratio across european industry appreciably improve different bank system remain significantly heterogeneous. that suggest considerable room improvement. spanish banks, part, relatively good position compare european counterparts, relatively high grow degree efficiency. in event, also true office density, despite fall recent years, remain high, especially compare european country (see chart 7). in area, new technological development allow gain efficiency provide proximity customer market product via mean face-to-face contact. chart 6 chart 7 3.2 new product service the second foreseeable response industry narrow financial margin search income supplement traditional commercial bank business. net fee income relate service (management transactional), proportion total operate income, slightly rise trend countries. in current setting, appear trend reflect less propensity bank subsidise certain transactional service charge net interest income. that said, fee-generating business subject grow competition owe emergence new unlicensed bank competitors, demonstrate ample ability harness new technology (the so-called fintech companies). these new competitor specialise specific segment service value chain, service past exclusively provide banks, without subject bank regulation requirements. bi central bankers’ speech 7 unquestionably, scenario new technology new emerge competitor pose challenge traditional bank business. however, technical progress also opportunity dynamic bank generate efficiency extend service provide customers. for instance, bank prove adept develop instant payment services. and might well-positioned develop direct lend facility (p2p) compete new non-bank operator (e.g. crowdfunding). bank retain advantage term experience, market root ability offer full range transactional intermediation service help face competition which, nonetheless, increasingly intense. in capacity regulator supervisors, seek strike balance facilitate technical progress, support development new product services, properly safeguard customer financial stability. 3.3 consolidation finally, orderly correction excess capacity bank industry foreseeably require great consolidation sector. i speak exactly year ago forum i believe since view process become increasingly likely become widespread. ideally, consolidation take place european level, order overcome strictly domestic vocation overwhelm majority banks. the existence bank pan-european outlook would amount private national risk pool mechanism would help weaken link macroeconomic risk exist country stability bank system, add robustness monetary bank union. it therefore important identify attempt eliminate obstacle continue hind bank consolidation europe, spite establishment bank union. in particular, must consider whether regulation supervisory practice tend unduly penalise geographical diversification bank’s business. it would also desirable ascertain whether current structure industry various countries, characterise existence numerous bank list public company maintain strong link national business sectors, hamper participation foreign competitors, whether directly acquisitions. all told, short medium term likely need continue reduce cost encourage bank merger acquisition within country order harness potential economy scale. in large european countries, would seem room consolidation. in fact, many country level concentration industry, measure herfindahl-hirschman index, might consider pose possible threat competition (see chart 8). 8 bi central bankers’ speech chart 8 accordingly, european bank industry face important challenge arise new macroeconomic environment, conducive income generation, regulatory reform which, order protect financial stability, introduce new rule safeguard restrict risk transformation business. a result, need bank adapt business model corporate strategies, undoubtedly affect structure sector. the role supervisor not, generally, impose specific strategic action, determine bank themselves. rather matter facilitate process maintain require supervisory standard and, thereby, offer incentive right decision make right time orderly fashion, always benefit shareholders, almost always contribute sector’s stability. allow conclude briefly mention bank union. 4. the single supervisory mechanism the supervisory framework europe significantly strengthen set single supervisory mechanism (ssm). barely year half start function, succeed put operation supervisory model consistent demand standards. a result action take follow analysis bank sector conduct 2014, ssm lead appreciable increase sector’s capital prompt vulnerable bank start clean balance sheets. the ssm also show capable participate effectively resolution crisis episodes, like one involve greek banks. moreover, ssm manage eliminate many national regulatory particularities, create common methodology supervisory review bank make bi central bankers’ speech 9 significant progress harmonise inspection practice draft develop manual common procedures. at operational level, record time, joint supervisory team put place significant institution ambitious programme on-site inspection developed. all action carry within framework cooperation national authority european central bank is, generally, function appropriately. naturally, fact almost 100 employee banco de españa recruit ecb’s supervisory arm, make national authority ecb rely cover supervisory staff requirements, something proud of, although also organisational challenge. give complexity project, include coordinate staff 19 national supervisor plus ecb, short time ssm existed, obviously still room improvement. that said, also palpable determination part responsible ssm supervisory board (on participate) continuously review arrangement process use order promote improvement needed, count conscientious contribution supervisory staff. in sum, national supervisory authority, congratulate impetus bank union give institutional strengthen euro area role preserve financial stability. we also positively value contribution (through staff experience) effective operation ssm ongoing improvement procedure supervisory arrangements. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yves

european central bank, ecb forum central banking, sintra, 28 june 2016. * * * in recent year central bank across advance economy engage task, namely raise inflation inflation expectation back level consistent price stability. each face condition particular jurisdiction. each deploy measure appropriate context. and act fulfil mandate lay constitution. and yet, fact central bank face common challenge low inflation coincidental. there global factor play. and beg question, best way u deal them? at one extreme, central bank take global condition entirely exogenous set policy accordingly. at extreme explicit coordination monetary policies. in range informal solutions. whatever one’s view options, clear question international dimension monetary policy become pertinent, since common factor affect central bank increasing. the global driver inflation indeed, grow literature suggest globalisation create common factor inflation developments, go beyond fluctuation energy commodity prices. high import volume increase importance international price wage relative domestic ones, make global output gap relevant.1 in context two type factor significant global low inflation environment face today: cyclical factor put downward pressure prices; structural factor low equilibrium real rate slow response economy monetary policy. the first type factor include large negative output gap generate financial crisis aftermath, still average 1% among g7 economy today.2 this global slack dampen particular import producer price inflation, weak several year among advance economies. price set producer euro area set producer trade partner country indeed highly correlated.3 also depress global inflation slump demand energy commodity link slowdown emerge markets. this feed low headline 1 inflation global phenomenon document e.g. m. ciccarelli b. mojon (2010), “global inflation”, the review economics statistics, 92:524–535. measure global economic slack good predictor national inflation advance countries, show empirically e.g. c. borio a. filardo (2007), “globalisation inflation: new cross-country evidence global determinant domestic inflation” bi wp no. 227; new keynesian open economy model

economy, one find since mid-2014 notable rise global component, link largely oil commodity price falls.4 these various factor may originate part global economy – originate advance economies, emerge market – integrate world global effects. cyclical weakness spill various channel similar challenge all. the second type factor structural nature. they concern global force lead low real equilibrium interest rate across advance economies, hence make complicate monetary policy everywhere provide appropriate boost global demand give effective low bind nominal interest rates. in particular, lead many central bank advance economy engage large-scale unconventional policies. that low interest rate environment consequence global excess desire save plan investment, result rise net save population plan retirement; increase demand low supply safe assets; relatively le public capital expenditure context slow population growth advance economies; secular shift industry intensive physical capital intensive human capital; slowdown productivity growth reduce return investment.5 again, factor may distribute homogenously across economies, effect global propagate global financial markets. with internationally mobile capital, clear interest rate balance save investment global concept local one. and accordingly, estimate equilibrium interest rate suggest low, possibly even negative, euro area, u advance economies.6 none mean central bank give pursue domestic price stability mandates. we demonstrate unconventional tool possible engineer accommodative financial condition even

isărescu: transition – secure strong economic future constituency? speech mr mugur isărescu, governor national bank romania, panel “transition: how secure strong economic future constituency?”, annual meet imf world bank constituency, kyiv, ukraine, 4 june 2016. * * * lady gentlemen, in address i would like focus challenge conduct monetary policy way contribute secure strong economic future country constituency. obviously, account shape romania’s experience, i hope still keep interested, may relevant small medium-sized emerge economies. 1. brief account monetary policy regime romania at time national bank romania choose strategy conduct monetary policy, i.e. early nineties, monetary target actually feasible option. not low forex reserve preclude fix exchange rate arrangement, but, even possible, alternative suitable give widen external imbalance. however, end decade, monetary target reach operational limit give break relation monetary aggregate inflation, phenomenon match development elsewhere world. at point, take account peg exchange rate, neither hard soft version deem appropriate. on one hand, crawl peg help control inflation bring 30%–40%, le useful low level envisaged, since crawl incorporate inflation expectations. on hand, exchange rate flexibility see asset economy big rigid romania time, especially give upcoming stage capital flow liberalisation. against background, romania opt inflation target early 2002, even though take several year preparation actual adoption, august 2005. the nbr choose “light” version strategy, mean retain manage float feature exchange rate regime. the actual form inflation target take romania match “managed-floating plus” concept, consider suitable choice emerging-market economy involve global capital market. this concept, introduce goldstein 2002, combine manage float part, allow fx market intervention order smooth excessive volatility, inflation target monetary policy strategy active pursuit measure limit degree currency mismatch economy. a matter fact, imf paper publish 2003, light version inflation target find widely spread among emerge economies, fiscal dominance continue weigh monetary policy cannot set aside concern financial stability external equilibria. 2. light inflation target romania draw line decade inflation targeting, i would say manage deliver steady disinflation anchor expectations, even though frequent occurrence exogenous shock lead high volatility inflation occasional miss annual targets. all central bank familiar supply-side shock relate surge fall commodity prices, romania also deal large (and necessarily predictable) adjustment administer price frequent change indirect taxation. some latter inherent eu membership (i.e. alignment excise 2 bi central bankers’ speech duties), others relate erratic tax legislation. in environment, two feature inflation target framework implement romania appear particularly relevant: • first, focus medium-term achievement inflation objective, rather hit target time. this approach allow sustainable price stability without incur cost excessive volatility output employment. • second, ex-ante definition set escape clause limit central bank’s responsibility attain annual target: 1. mark increases/decreases commodity price 2. natural disaster similar exceptional event induce cost-push demand-pull inflationary effect 3. large fluctuation exchange rate leu decouple domestic economic fundamentals, well monetary policy pursue national bank romania 4. major deviation administer price adjustment programme announce government, term magnitude propose calendar 5. divergence fiscal income policies, term implementation outcomes, program coordinate 3. case point: monetary policy string vat change to give flavour environment monetary policy operate lately, three vat rate cut 2013 2016, hike 2010, another cut schedule 2017. currently, annual inflation rate stand –3.25 percent, negative value eu. exclude first-round effect vat cut mid-2015 early 2016, headline inflation would hover around +1 percent. consequently, negative inflation deal condition bring persistent lack demand, economic activity, employment wage actually buoyant. this transitory development, induce aforementioned indirect tax cuts. the textbook policy choice would accommodate temporary deviation inflation target focus vat-adjusted inflation development – especially since latter paint quite different picture. if i may allow short digression, recourse vat-adjusted inflation measure analysis communication come fire. this mean different nature eurostat’s hicp constant tax – refined, sense take account fact pass-through vat change 100% cpi items. come back current economic context, point behind “perfect storm” deflationary exogenous shock (low energy, food metal prices, successive vat rate cuts), demand-side inflationary pressure looming: positive output gap emerging, unit labour cost pressure build up, fiscal policy take strongly expansionary turn. a such, medium-term prospect appear call tighten bias monetary policy, short-term context deeply negative inflation make communication public rather challenging. specifically, contend idea central bank low interest rate response vat rate cuts. it prof difficult think make people understand current negative read inflation transitory reflect neither postpone consumption, sluggish wage growth one would associate bi central bankers’ speech 3 negative inflation expectation – actually remain anchor target. therefore, none ingredient make scary deflationary trap present. frankly, i understand general public familiar concept like overheat positive output gap, i believe annual growth rate tune 20% retail sale excess 10% wage self-explanatory. still, obvious sign – even non-economists – economy grow fast, criticise fight deflation. the recent experience make u painfully aware – despite large amount information provide wide range communication vehicle – message get much less extent thought. therefore, enhance effort escape professional jargon try accessible possible explain public rationale behind monetary policy decisions. if i conclude romania’s experience inflation targeting, i would say work quite well, even though concept inflation target immune criticism, especially post-crisis period. i would mention axel weber, suggest 2015 inflation target simplistic framework could stabilise value money complex constantly evolve economic environment. however, opinion share well-known economists. for instance, 2013 charles wyplosz stress even though time inflation target seem inconvenient possibly counter-productive, alternative – monetary targeting, nominal-gdp target explicit strategy – would probably do good job. along lines, lucrezia reichlin richard baldwin conclude inflation target continue refined, replaced. of course, since i come central bank practice inflation targeting, i tend agree latter line thought, i believe that, whatever faults, strategy enough intrinsic flexibility enable address them. bi central bankers’ speech 1 raghuram rajan: the fight inflation – measure institutional development text foundation day lecture dr raghuram rajan, governor reserve bank india, tata institute fundamental research, mumbai, 20 june 2016. * * * i thank tata institute fundamental research invite give foundation day lecture. i always see tifr awe afar. some explanation order. my roommate first year mit dr. renganathan iyer, one smart mathematician i know – use help understand tutorial real analysis. and never miss occasion tell much smart everyone else tifr was. perhaps renga modest, i half expect come today see everyone gigantic head house enormous brains. it relief find that, outwardly, look normal. seriously, however, i think continue success tifr suggest u india want set world class institutions, can. while institute fortunate visionary like dr. homi bhabha found director, institution build collective effort dedicate researcher like all. congratulation job well done! in speech today, i think i would describe effort build different kind institution, one delf deep realm out space tiny constituent atom, one attempt control something affect daily life; inflation. there parallel institution build done, set control inflation, though clearly effort much le tie investigate fabric universe towards influence human behavior. ultimately, require fundamental change mindset. the cost inflation high inflation u india last four decades. most recently, experience average 9 percent inflation 2006 2013. what cost high inflation? clearly, everyone understand cost hyper-inflation, price rise every minute. money hot potato one want hold, people rush straight bank shop buy good case money lose value along way. a people lose faith money, barter good good service become norm, make transact significantly difficult; how much physic lecture would pay taxi driver drive bandra; moreover would taxi driver accept physic lecture payment; perhaps would lecture student, get student sing taxi driver…you get point, transact become difficult hyperinflation render money worthless. hyperinflation also redistributive effects, destroy middle class’ save hold bond deposits. the horror hyperinflation austria germany 1920s still make scary reading. so clearly, one want hyperinflation. but inflation 15 percent per year? haven’t country grow fast period time despite high inflation? the answer yes, perhaps could grow fast low inflation.1 after all, variability inflation increase level, dispersion price fundamental value economy. this make price signal confuse – price widget 1 in fact, seminal paper, fischer (1993) present cross-country evidence show growth negatively associate inflation, causality run inflation growth. 2 bi central bankers’ speech go high demand high generalize inflation? in former case, i sell i produce more, latter case i leave unsold inventory. production investment therefore become risky. moreover, high variable inflation cause lender demand high fix interest rate compensate risk inflation move around (the so-called inflation risk premium), thus raise cost finance. the long term nominal (and real) interest rate saver require rises, thus make long-duration project prohibitively costly. these effect kick inflation noticeably high. so legitimate ask, “at threshold level inflation start hurt growth?” unfortunately, question hard answer – develop country typically high inflation, develop country also high growth. so one might well find positive correlation inflation growth, though mean inflation cause growth. for reason, literature estimate threshold effect beyond inflation hurt growth vast well inconclusive. most study find double digit inflation harmful growth fuzzy single digit precise threshold lies.2 the inflation target nevertheless, give limit evidence, country set inflation goal low single digit – 2 5 percent rather 7 10 percent? three reason come mind. first, even inflation moderate level hurt overall growth, consequence inflation evenly distributed. while high inflation might help rich, highly indebted, industrialist debt come relative sale revenues, hurt poor daily wage worker, whose wage index inflation.3 second, high inflation variable. this raise chance breach give range around target set high level. to extent high target close threshold, make likely country exceed threshold experience low growth. third, inflation could fee high level – high target, chance enter region inflation spiral upwards. the receive wisdom monetary economics today therefore central bank serf economy cause growth best keep inflation low stable around target give government. this contrast early prevail view economics pump demand dramatic interest rate cuts, central bank could generate sustain growth, albeit inflation. that view prove hopelessly optimistic power central bank. there indeed short run trade-off inflation growth. in layman’s terms, central bank cut interest rate 100 basis point today, bank pas on, demand pick could get strong growth while, especially economic player surprised. the stock market may shoot days. but fool people time. if economy produce potential, would quickly see shortage sharp rise inflation. people also start expect central bank disregard inflation (that is, hopelessly dovish accord bird analogy abound) embed high inflationary expectation decisions, include demand high wages. if contrary expectations, central bank commit keep inflation control, may force raise interest rate substantially 2 for example, bruno easterly (1995) suggest 40 percent danger point, beyond increase inflation likely lead growth crisis. in contrast, khan senhadji (2000) estimate threshold inflation significantly slow growth 1–3 percent industrial country 7–11 percent develop countries. 3 accord easterly fischer (2001), “a grow body literature balance-but unanimously-tends support view inflation cruel tax”. bi central bankers’ speech 3 offset temporary growth. the boom bust good economy, average growth may low cut take place. this modern economics also say long run trade-off growth inflation – best way central bank ensure sustainable growth keep demand close potential supply inflation remain moderate, factor drive growth, good governance, take center stage.4 put differently, people say “inflation low, turn stimulate growth”, really understand two side coin. the rbi always set policy rate low can, consistent meet inflation objective. indeed, fact inflation fairly close upper bind target zone today suggest overly hawkish, wise disregard advice past cut deeply. if critic belief interest rate excessively high, either argue government-set inflation target high today, rbi excessively pessimistic path future inflation. he cannot ways, want low inflation well low policy rates. at time, rbi focus inflation exclusion growth. if inflation rise sharply, instance, sharp rise price oil, would sensible central bank bring inflation within target band immediately raise interest rate high kill economic activity. instead, make sense bring inflation back control medium term, is, next two year so, raise rate steadily point bank think would enough bring inflation back within target range. let emphasize prediction either path oil price forecast monetary actions, l i read paper tomorrow “rbi raise rates”. more generally, extend glide path bring inflation check appropriately balance inflation need reasonable growth. argument there many believe totally misguide actions. let focus four criticisms. first, focus wrong index inflation. second, kill private investment keep rate high. somewhat contradictorily, also hurt pensioner cut rate sharply. third, monetary policy effect inflation economy supply constrained, abandon attempt control it. fourth, central bank little control inflation government spend dominate (what jargon call “fiscal dominance”). the wrong index historically, rbi target variety indicators, put lot weight wholesale price inflation (wpi). theoretically, reliance wpi two problems. first, common citizen experience retail inflation, is, consumer price inflation (cpi). since monetary policy “works” contain public’s inflation expectation thus wage demands, consumer price inflation matters. second, wpi contain lot trade manufacture good commodity input basket, whose price determine internationally. a low wpi could result low international inflation, domestic component inflation education healthcare service well retail margin 4 i bite loose here. the short run tradeoff work economic actor surprise unexpected loosening, surprise positive growth effects. in long run, central bank lose power surprise, public embed correct forecast much inflation central bank create nominal variable interest rates. to extent high inflation harmful growth welfare, central bank continuously try give short run positive surprise entrench long run high inflation, bad growth. 4 bi central bankers’ speech non-traded food inflate merrily push cpi. by focus wpi, could delude think control inflation, even though stem largely action central bank elsewhere. in neglect cpi matter common man, consequence domestic monetary policy. the effective real interest rate, investments, save of course, one reason critic may advocate focus wpi low today, thus would mean low policy rates. this short-sighted reason commodity price global inflation pick up, wpi could well exceed cpi. there is, however, subtle argument; real interest rate difference interest rate borrower pay inflation – true cost borrow term good like widget dosas. if policy interest rate set control cpi, may high manufacturer see product price appreciate wpi rate. i sympathetic argument, i also think concern overblown. even manufacturer much price power global competition, commodity supplier even less. so metal producer benefit fall coal ore prices, even though may get high realization metal sale past. the true measure inflation inflation profits, likely significantly great suggest wpi. a second error make attribute component interest rate pay borrower monetary policy. for heavily indebted borrowers, however, large component interest rate pay credit risk premium bank charge risk may get repaid. this credit risk premium largely independent rbi set policy rate. so someone berate u heavily indebted industrialist borrow 14% interest wpi 0.5%, make two important error say real interest rate 13.5%. first, 7.5% credit spread, would significantly low cut policy rate (at 6.5% today) another 100 basis points. second, inflation matter industrialist 0.5% output price inflating, 4% profit inflate (because cost fall 5% annually). the real risk free interest rate experience 2.5%, little high elsewhere world, significant factor stand way investment. far useful low borrow rate improve lend institution borrower behavior bring credit risk premium, try push rbi low rate unduly. the policy rate effect play balance act. a important real borrow rate manufacturer real deposit rate saver. in last decade, saver experience negative real rate extend period cpi exceed deposit interest rates. this mean whatever interest get wipe erosion principal’s purchase power due inflation. saver intuitively understand this, shift invest real asset like gold real estate, away financial asset like deposits. this mean india need borrow abroad fund investment, lead grow unsustainable current account deficit. in recent years, fight inflation also mean policy rate come think depositor could expect reasonable positive real return financial savings. this help increase household financial save relative save real assets, help bring current account deficit. at time, i get lot heart-rending letter pensioner complain cut deposit rates. the truth good past, i try explain previous lecture, i understand upset see interest income diminishing. the bottom line control inflation, monetary policy maker effectively end balance interest investor saver business cycle. at one talks, industrialist clamor 4% rate borrowing. when i ask would deposit rate safe bank, leave alone invest one risky friends, say “no!” bi central bankers’ speech 5 nevertheless, insist cut rate significantly. unfortunately, policy maker luxury inconsistency. supply constraint food inflation contribute significantly cpi inflation, inflation service like education healthcare. some argue, rightly, hard rbi directly control food demand monetary policy. then proceed, incorrectly, say bother control cpi inflation. the reality hard u control food demand, especially essential foods, government influence food supply effective management, control demand other, discretionary, item consumption basket tight monetary policy. to prevent sustain food inflation become generalize inflation high wage increases, reduce inflation items. indeed, overall headline inflation may stay 6 percent recently even period high food inflation, precisely component cpi basket “clothing footwear” inflate slowly. fiscal dominance finally, one reason rbi historically reluctant lock inflation-focused framework fear government over-spending would make task impossible. the possibility fiscal dominance, however, mean give inflation objective set government, government rbi role play. if government overspends, central bank compensate tight policy achieve inflation objective. so long commonly understood, inflation-focused framework mean good coordination government central bank go towards common goal macro stability. i certainly believe responsible recent budget create room rbi ease april. pragmatic inflation focus a understand i saying, monetary policy inflation focus framework try balance various interest bring inflation control. in so, pragmatic rather doctrinaire mindset. for example, emerge market experience significant capital inflow affect exchange rate volatility well financial stability. a doctrinaire mindset would adopt hands-off approach, pragmatic mindset would permit intervention reduce volatility instability. nevertheless, pragmatic mind would also recognize best way obtain exchange rate stability bring inflation level commensurate global inflation. similarly, financial stability consideration explicitly rbi’s objectives, make way rbi keep growth mind control inflation. so rbi’s monetary policy contribute credit asset price bubble could lead systemic meltdown growth collapse, rbi resort corrective monetary policy macro-prudential policy alternative likely prove ineffective. the transition low inflation the period high inflation economy move low inflation never easy one. after year high inflation, public’s expectation inflation slow adjust downwards. a result, le will adjust interest expectation downwards. household financial save increase rapidly fraction overall 6 bi central bankers’ speech household savings, yet significantly fraction gdp.5 some friction interest rate set market also help. even policy rate down, rate pay government small save significantly high bank deposit rates, effective rate tax free bonds. i glad government decide link rate small save government bond rates, rate continuously examine ensure form high floor bank cannot cut deposit rates. all all, bank lend rate move down, commensurate policy rate cuts. the wrong thing time change course. a soon economic policy become painful, clever economist always suggest new unorthodox painless pathways. this problem specific emerge markets, become especially acute since every emerge market think unique, law economics operate differently here. in india, least consistent. flip book cartoon great economist, rk laxman, i find one indicate solution every ill 1997 cartoon published, now, rbi cut interest rate hundred basis points. argument change, clever solution not. decade study macroeconomic policy tell wary economist say try something box. argentina, brazil, venezuela try unorthodox policy depressingly orthodox consequences. rather experiment macro-policy, bring macro risk unprotected poor ill afford, good unorthodox microeconomic policy define business bank environment. not le chance damage go wrong, innovative policy may open new path around old bottlenecks. specifically, part rbi adopt liberal attitude towards bank licensing, towards financial inclusion, towards payment technology institution order foster growth. institution build let return institution building. we get use decade moderate high inflation, industrialist government pay negative real interest rate burden hide inflation tax fall middle class saver poor. what happen today truly revolutionary – abandon way past benefit expense many. a move towards embed institution result sustain low inflation positive real interest rates, require constituency make adjustments. for example, industrialist want significantly low rates, support effort improve loan recovery bank bond market feel comfortable low credit spreads. the central state government continue path fiscal consolidation borrow le thus spend le interest payments. household adjust low nominal rates, must recognize high real rate make save productive. they find worthwhile save finance enormous investment need country. adjustment difficult painful short run. we must get divert build institution necessary secure low inflation future, especially seem make headway. the government take momentous step set cpi base inflation objective rbi well framework set independent 5 data household survey also suggest household financial save move up. for example, two recent financial inclusion survey select state india – financial inclusion insight survey conduct intermedia finscope survey implement small industry development bank india (sidbi) – suggest among individual “who bank account”, fraction save bank deposit increase 60% 2013 98% 2015. of “save money”, fraction save bank increase 67% 2013 93% 2015. of “save money”, fraction “saving home” decline dramatically 90% 2014 6% 2015. bi central bankers’ speech 7 monetary policy committee. in day ahead, new governor, well member committee picked. i sure internalize framework institution set up, produce low inflation future india. the reward many. our currency stable investor gain confidence monetary policy goals, stability improve meet inflation goals. foreign capital inflow reliable increase long maturity buckets, include rupee investments. this expand pool capital available bank corporations. the government able borrow low rates, able extend maturity debt. the poor suffer disproportionately due bout sharp inflation, middle class see save eroded. all await u stay course.

veerathai santiprabhob, governor bank thailand, clmvt forum 2016 “towards share prosperity”, bangkok, 17 june 2016. * * * your excellencies, honorable speakers, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, a good morning all, it great pleasure morning. i would like start thank thai ministry commerce invite give keynote address important forum. let take opportunity welcome guests, especially friend clmv countries, thailand. i delight opportunity meet many ministers, senior government officials, business leader participate first clmvt forum. this forum provide meaningful platform u share perspective sustainably enhance regional connectivity unlock great potential region. over past decade, economic integration region strengthen impressively. drive international trade, direct investment production networks, share intra-regional trade within clmvt total trade volume nearly doubled. amid slowdown global trade due gradual fragile recovery major industrial economy china’s economic transformation, cross-border trade investment activity within region continue grow fast pace. for thailand, share export clmv country total export volume rise steadily 10 percent surpass export 27 euro-zone country combined. this reaffirm share benefit trade investment connectivity. owe largely complementarity various dimension among clmvt economies, integration continue strengthen future. expand trade investment accompany support development domestic service industry enhance connectivity service sector. a case point burgeon growth airline industry, low cost full service. over past years, frequent traveler would easily notice mark increase number flight within region, particularly operate low-cost airlines. price much affordable, attract traveler otherwise would travel planes. the development benefit airline industry itself, also unlock potential many industry serf citizen clmvt. more seamless travel promote tourism industry, reduce logistic costs, overcome obstacle transportation, thus allow close people-to-people connectivity open opportunity people realize full potentials. lady gentlemen, improve airline service connectivity might one aspect enhance regional connectivity. nevertheless, serf u well model develop domestic service industry promote regional connectivity service sector. the question i would like focus today could learn success airline industry? and, make happen area service sector potential serve region? 2 bi central bankers’ speech for first question, fast development airline industry mainly attribute two factors: right business model market enable infrastructure eco-system. on private sector’s part, low-cost airline know region’s untapped market come serve large unmet demand right business model. needle say, offer customer simple products, include no-frills service single cabin class. their business model successful minimize operate cost use single aircraft model choose fuel efficient plane type reduce fuel maintenance costs. the airline also revolutionize ticket system first offer internet booking, paperless ticket mobile check-in great convenience low costs. apart right entrepreneurial spirit private sector, policymakers credit creation airline network region. there least five factor policymakers contribute success regional airline industry. • first introduction “open sky” policy open opportunity new potential players, scale large enough create strong viable network airlnes provide regular service competitive prices. • second, investment necessary infrastructure undertaken, airport facilities, land slots, aeronautical radio network facilitate flight communication. • third, rule regulations, especially cross-border services, harmonize support airlines’ operation. visa requirement custom procedure also streamline accommodate travelers. • fourth, authority lift standard pilots, crews, airlines’ staff, drive airline actively promote human resource development par international standards. • lastly, airline encourage leverage investment specialize facility country region low costs, instance, use common aircraft maintenance center pilot train facilities. this combination right business model appropriate policy support yield tangible benefit region. a strong regional airline network bring high competition, low cost good service quality, thus improve people’s livelihood pave way type business benefit grow. lady gentlemen, the big question replicate low-cost airlines’ success story service industry region, large room improvement yet address lot potential unlocked. among others, finance industry one many untapped opportunities. currently, wide group people country still need good access finance still lot demand financial service meet – savings, loans, insurance products, payment service domestic cross-border transactions. by apply airline industry’ experience policymakers, let lay five key condition necessary develop domestic financial system nurture financial connectivity clmvt period ahead. analogous “open sky policy”, first factor promote domestic financial liberalization policy well-integrated regional financial system. the financial liberalization policy aim lessen degree domestic financial repression, thereby strengthen financial institutions’ performance, broaden offer financial bi central bankers’ speech 3 product services. this do along policy enhance financial connectivity promote presence capable player regional focus. under mandate, bank thailand aim promote financial connectivity connect bank network integrate payment systems. under asean bank integration framework, country clmvt gear effort strengthen regional bank networks, serve diverse range business local people gain access high quality bank service fair prices. i glad see several bank region already spread wing establish representative offices, branch subsidiary neighbor countries. last month, thai financial system opportunity welcome new representative office

chamber commerce industry india) – interactive meet industry & trade, bengaluru, 22 june 2016. * * * accompany chart find end speech. thank much invite give talk. ordinarily, city like bengaluru, would talk startups. today, however, i want talk resolution financial distress. i argue slowdown credit growth largely stress public sector bank high interest rates. a such, require clean-up balance sheet public sector banks, underway need take logical conclusion. specifically, i describe india change culture surround loan contract. to start, let u look public sector credit growth compare growth credit new private banks. public sector lend v private sector lend a chart 1 (credit india) shows, public sector bank non-food credit growth fall relative credit growth new private sector bank (axis, hdfc, icici, indusind) since early 2014. this reflect credit industry (chart 2), also micro small enterprise credit (chart 3).1 the relative slowdown credit growth, albeit dramatic, also see agriculture (chart 4), though growth pick again. whenever one see slowdown lending, one could conclude demand credit – firm investing. but see slowdown lend public sector bank vi vi private sector banks. why that? the immediate conclusion one draw something affect credit supply public sector bank specifically, perhaps lack bank capital. yet look personal loan growth (chart 5), specifically house loan (chart 6), public sector bank loan growth approach private sector bank growth. the lack capital therefore cannot culprit. rather across-the-board shrinkage public sector lending, seem shrinkage certain area high credit exposure, specifically loan industry small enterprises. the appropriate conclusion public sector bank shrink exposure infrastructure industry risk right early 2014 mount distress past loans. private sector banks, many past exposures, will service mount demand traditional borrowers, well corporates deny public sector banks. given, however, public sector bank much big private sector banks, private sector bank cannot substitute fully slowdown public sector bank credit. we absolutely need get public sector bank back lend industry infrastructure, else credit growth suffer economy pick up. these chart refute another argument make look evidence – stress corporate world high interest rates. interest rate set private bank usually equal high rate set public sector banks. yet credit growth seem suffered. the logical conclusion therefore must level interest rate problem. instead, stress loan already 1 in chart 2, late negative growth april number may aberration uday bond transfer bank loan book investments). 2 bi central bankers’ speech psb balance sheets, unwillingness lend sector high exposure. there two source distress loan – fundamental borrower good, ability lender collect weak. both work current distress. the source lend distress: bad fundamental why bad loan made? a number loan make 2007–2008. economic growth strong possibility limitless. deposit growth public sector bank rapid, number infrastructure project power plant complete time within budget. it time bank make mistakes. they extrapolate past growth performance future. so will accept high leverage projects, le promoter equity. indeed, sometimes bank sign lend base project report promoter’s investment bank, without due diligence. one promoter tell pursue bank wave checkbooks, ask name amount wanted. this historic phenomenon irrational exuberance, common across country phase cycle. the problem growth always take place expected. the year strong global growth global financial crisis follow slowdown, extend even india, show much integrate become world. strong demand projection various project show increasingly unrealistic domestic demand slow down. moreover, variety governance problem couple fear investigation slow bureaucratic decision make delhi, permission infrastructure project become hard get. project cost overrun escalate stall project become increasingly unable service debt. i say malfeasance – country’s investigative agency look case undue influence use get loans, actual fraud commit divert fund company, either over-invoicing import source via promoter-owned subsidiary abroad export relate shell company abroad claim defaulted. i say that, typically, factor malfeasance play, number genuine commit entrepreneur trouble, bank make reasonable business decision give know then. the source lend distress: poor monitor collection the truth is, even sensible lend entail default. a banker lend intent never experience default probably over-conservative lend projects, thus hurt growth. but sensible lend mean careful assessment front project prospects, i argue may mar irrational exuberance excessive dependence evaluation others. deficiency evaluation somewhat compensate careful post-lending monitoring, include careful documentation perfection collateral, well ensure asset back promoter guarantee register tracked. unfortunately, many project leave weakly monitored, even cost increased. bank may expect lead bank exercise adequate due diligence, always happen. moreover, project go distress, private bank sometimes agile secure position additional collateral promoter, get repaid, even public sector bank continue support project fresh loans. promoter astutely stop infuse equity, sometimes even stop put effort, know project unlikely repay give debt overhang. the process collection, despite law like sarfaesi intend speed secure debt collection, prolong costly, especially bank face large, well-connected bi central bankers’ speech 3 promoters. the government propose reform judicial process, include speed function debt recovery tribunals, make easy bank collect, legislative reform parliament. know bank would find hard collect, promoter encourage “double-up” expand scale project, even though initial scale unable service debt. of course, unscrupulous among promoter continue divert money expand lending, increase size problem bank balance sheets. the inefficient loan recovery system give promoter tremendous power lenders. not play one lender another threaten divert payment favor bank, also refuse pay unless lender bring money, especially lender fear loan become non-performing asset. sometimes promoter offer miserly one-time settlement (ots) know system ensure bank collect even secure loan years. effectively, loan system become implicit equity, tough promoter enjoy upside good times, force bank absorb loss bad times, even hold equity. clean banks: principle the world over, three cardinal rule face incipient distress. 1) viability depend debt outstanding, economic value. debt may write correspond viable. because change circumstances, demand may low project cash flow may significantly low project earlier. the project economic value complete – sense operate cash flow positive, much le interest debt carries. if debt write down, project continue npa, even promoter, know cannot repay, lose interest. if neglected, project may stop generate cash flow asset may depreciate rapidly. 2) complete project viable, even require additional fund infusion. stall project get good time. if small investment need complete project, promoter funds, may still make sense lend it, even write overall debt. essentially, new loan make possible generate operate cash flow service debt, even outstanding debt. 3) don’t throw good money bad money simply unreliable promise debt become serviceable. this opposite (2). if project unviable, double size make viable. promoter over-borrowed often propose increase scale bank’s outstanding debt new loan become serviceable. perhaps would good bank write loan initial project, rather go deep hole promoter may incur new cost-overruns expands. an incompetent unreliable promoter remain even scale expands. bank moral hazard unfortunately, incentive build public sector bank system make difficult public sector bank executive follow principle (i add private sector bank executive also immune occasion). the short tenure manager mean unwilling recognize loss immediately, will postpone future successor deal with. such distort incentive lead overlending “ever-greening” unviable projects. unfortunately, also, taint npa immediately make reluctant lend project even viable, fear investigative agency buy rationale lending. the absence sound well document loan evaluation monitor practice bank make outcome 4 bi central bankers’ speech likely. so excessive lend bad project little lend viable one coexist. the regulator’s dilemma for regulator want bank system clean start lend again, create variety objectives, somewhat conflicting. first, want bank recognize loan distress disclose it, paper ever-greening unviable projects. loan classification merely good account – reflect true value loan might be. it accompany provisioning, ensure bank set aside buff absorb likely losses. if loss materialize, bank write back provision profits. if loss materialize, bank suddenly declare big loss, set loss prudential provision made. thus bank balance sheet represent true fair picture bank’s health, bank balance sheet mean to. second, want realistic project’s cash generate capacity, structure lend repayment match that. third, want continue lend viable projects, even restructure past npas. the problem forbearance label loan npa restructure make easy avoid disclosure indulge ever-greening. on hand, strict disclosure classification rule could imply cessation lend even viable projects. there clean solution give kind incentive system, give absence operational bankruptcy code india. therefore, rbi adopt pragmatic approach clean-up, create new enable processes. the rbi’s approach our first task make sure bank information lend borrower. so create large loan database (crilc) include loan rs. 5 crore, share banks. the crilc data include status loan – reflect whether performing, already npa go towards npa. that database allow bank identify early warn sign distress borrower habitual late payment segment lenders. the next step coordinate lender joint lenders’ forum (jlf) early signal seen. the jlf task decide approach resolution, much bankruptcy forum does. incentive give bank reach quick decisions. we also try make forum effective reduce need everyone agree, even give unconvinced joint decision opportunity exit. we also want stop restructure unviable project bank want avoid recognize loss – end ability bank restructure project without call npa april 2015. at time, number long duration project road structure overly rapid require repayments, even though cash flow continue available decade now. so allow project payment restructure 5/25 scheme provide long date future cash flow could reliably established. of course, always possibility bank use scheme evergreen, monitor work practice, continue tweak scheme necessary achieve objectives. because promoter often unable bring new funds, judicial system often protect equity ownership, together sebi introduce strategic debt restructure (sdr) scheme enable bank displace weak promoter bi central bankers’ speech 5 convert debt equity. we want bank project indefinitely, indicate time-line find new promoter. all new tool (including i space describe) effectively create resolution system replicate out-of-court bankruptcy. bank power resolve distress, could push exercise power require recognition. this asset quality review, complete october 2015 subsequently share banks, seek accomplish. since bank classify exist distress loan appropriately, since march 2016 look weak-but-not-yet-distressed portfolio necessary actions. there change culture, bank quite will get spirit aqr. many go significantly beyond indication clean quarter end march 2016. of course, bank properly classify non-performing loan provision it, incentive evergreen avoid write debt appropriate level diminished. nevertheless, clean-up ongoing work. the sdr scheme deal weak promoters. but promoter competent even project overly indebted. the ‘scheme sustainable structure stress assets’ (s4a) optional framework resolution large stress accounts. the s4a envisage determination sustainable debt level stress borrower, bifurcation outstanding debt sustainable debt equity/quasi-equity instrument expect provide upside lender borrower turn around. thus capable-but-over-indebted promoter incentive perform, project deem npa adequate provision made, public sector bank continue lend necessary. most recently, government contemplate fund lend distress situations, significant participation third parties, new loan make viable distress projects. provide decision make dominate bank whose loan distressed, could effective vehicle speed resolution. why many scheme constant tinker the source borrower distress many, seek provide lender menu option deal it, even limit discretion paper problem. effectively rbi try create entirely new bad loan resolution process absence effective bankruptcy system. we tinker, since scheme’s effectiveness, seemingly obvious designing, monitor light distort incentive system. a learn, adapt regulation. our objective theoretical pragmatic, even subject system increase discipline transparency. the good news bank get spirit cleanup, pursue reluctant promoter take necessary step rehabilitate projects. indebted promoter force sell asset repay lenders. we shortly license number new asset reconstruction company (arcs) provide deep market stress assets. we also work framework enhance efficiency transparency price discovery sale stress asset bank arcs. bank investors, initially get alarm size disclosures, bid psb bank shares. to extent still trade fraction book value, still room upward valuation bank improve prospect recovery. the new schemes, well improve economy, help. fraud willful default even make easy commit promoter restructure experience bad luck unforeseen problems, reduce ability fraudster willful defaulter, pay simply disincline so, fraudster, get away. this 6 bi central bankers’ speech extremely important bank use new flexible scheme promoter habitually misuse system (everyone know are) fraudsters. the threat label promoter willful defaulter could effective former case, coordinate sebi increase penalty willful defaulters. for fraudsters, quick effective investigation investigative agency extremely important. we send message one get away, i glad prime minister’s office push prosecution large frauds. the rbi set fraud monitor cell coordinate early report fraud case investigative agencies. and divert money companies, especially highly visible asset abroad, stern message send banker sit together investigative agency help send message alternative repayment harsh. bank risk aversion banker often argue easy people label fraud banker themselves, often could victim rather perpetrators. similarly, accuse vigilance authority excessive zeal loan go bad, immediately suspect banker malfeasance bad loan could unintended consequence sensible risk taking. unfortunately, often, investigation also uncover sloppy due diligence loan monitor bankers. after fact, hard distinguish sensible risk take carelessness corruption. while vigilance authority continuously attempt reassure banker vigilantes, banker know enthusiasm deficiency expose unwarranted accusation corruption. certainly, part solution banker pull socks. but another part solution label banker base outcome single loan instead look pattern across loans. a banker make excessive number bad loan compare cohort deserves, least, questioned. but banker make occasional bad loan amidst lot good one probably need rewarded. such pattern-based monitor bank authorities, serious punishment vigilance action evidence money change hands, could control malfeasance reward risk taking. this require change current system, include de-emphasize committee base approach loan approval banks, appear diffuse responsibility loan decisions. what responsibility rbi have? banker sometimes turn around accuse regulator create bad loan problem. the truth bankers, promoters, circumstance create bad loan problem. the regulator cannot substitute banker’s commercial decision micromanage even investigate made. instead, situations, regulator best warn poor lend practice undertaken, demand bank hold adequate risk buffers. the important duty regulator force timely recognition npa disclosure happen. forbearance may reasonable risky regulatory strategy hope growth pick soon system recover own. everyone – banker, promoter, investors, government official – often urge strategy kick problem road, hopefully someone else deal with. the downside growth pick up, bad loan problem bigger, deal difficult. it bad loan problem allow accumulate forbearance non-recognition regulator difficult task bring system back track. that problem deal rbi. a i show you, consequence since early 2014 past build-up stress loan slowdown public sector bank lend certain sectors. the cessation rbi forbearance asset quality review mid 2015 therefore responsible bi central bankers’ speech 7 slowdown. instead, high distress exposure certain sector already occupy psb management attention hold back. the way supply economy’s need credit, essential high economic growth, clean recapitalize. the silver line message slow credit growth bank lend indiscriminately attempt reduce size stress asset expand overall balance sheet, bode well future slippages. in sum, question come first, clean growth, i think answer unambiguously “clean up!”. indeed, lesson every country face financial stress. it important, therefore, clean-up proceed conclusion, without resort regulatory forbearance again. sometimes, easy monetary policy propose answer reduce bad debt problem. for heavily indebted promoter, however, easy monetary policy typically bring relief. even low policy rates, bank, typically make whole even grab borrower’s cash flows, incentive reduce interest rate borrower pay. and bank compete borrower’s business, competition force loan rates. the bottom line easy monetary policy answer serious distress, contrary widespread belief. what government do? the government process speed debt recovery process, create new bankruptcy system. these important step improve resolution process. in near term, however, two action pay large dividends. the first improve governance public sector bank face situation again. the government, indradhanush initiative, send clear signal want make sure public sector banks, healthy, stay healthy. break post chairman manage director, strengthen board management appointment bank board bureau, decentralize decision professional board, find way incentivize management, help improve loan evaluation, monitor repayment. the second infuse bank capital, infusion relate strong performance, good bank room grow. capital infusion weak bank ideally accompany improvement governance, give need absorb loss associate balance sheet clean up, good government capital infuse quickly. government sometimes reluctant infuse bank capital many press demand funds. yet, high return activity capitalize public sector bank support credit growth. finally, economic survey suggest rbi capitalize public sector banks. this seem non-transparent way proceeding, get bank regulator business own banks, attendant conflict interest. good rbi pay government maximum dividend can, retain enough surplus buff consistent good central bank risk management practice. indeed, do, last three years, pay surplus government. separately, government infuse capital banks. the two decision need linked. alternatively, le effective form capital, government cannot buy bank equity directly cash, issue bank “government capitalization bonds” exchange equity. the bank would hold bond balance sheet. this would tie part balance sheet, would certainly capital. 8 bi central bankers’ speech conclusion the clean bank balance sheets, restoration credit growth vital, relate element growth agenda. the government rbi help public sector banker difficult critical task. i know process working, public sector bank soon set finance enormous need economy again. bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 hendar: produce competitive human capital economic empowerment

stanley fischer: comment resolution framework bank bank hold company unite state speech mr stanley fischer, vice chair board governor federal reserve system, panel discussion resolution riksbank macroprudential conference, stockholm, 22 june 2016. * * * i grateful mark van d weide, barbara bouchard mark savignac federal reserve board assistance preparation comments. i’m grateful organizer invite participate conference. i would like briefly describe legal framework exist resolve bank organization unite states, step federal reserve u.s. regulator take make global systemically important bank organization (gsibs) unite state resolvable, criticism u.s. regulatory action area, together response them. u.s. law provide several legal framework resolve fail financial firms. in unite states, fail depository institution resolve federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) use framework create federal deposit insurance act. the fdic act receiver several thousand fail bank since 1934, include 465 2008 2012. most fail bank relatively small community banks, considerably small systemically important firm active today.1 while federal deposit insurance act create special resolution framework fail banks, fail u.s. bank hold company – is, corporate entity control one bank – would generally resolve provision u.s. bankruptcy code would apply corporate debtors, industrial firms, proceed oversee federal judge. during recent crisis, fear systemic consequence would follow bankruptcy systemically important financial firm motivate extraordinary government action prevent firm failing. unfortunately, fear prove well founded: the bankruptcy lehman brother hold – large bankruptcy file american history – significantly exacerbate crisis.2 to increase viability bankruptcy code framework resolve fail financial firm without major systemic consequences, section 165(d) dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act 2010 (dodd-frank act) require large bank organization produce resolution plans, also know live wills, demonstrate could resolve bankruptcy code orderly fashion event failure. although bankruptcy code provide default legal framework resolution fail bank hold company, title ii dodd-frank act create backup resolution framework, call orderly liquidation authority, use resolution fail financial company bankruptcy code would serious adverse effect u.s. financial stability. if criterion several others met, title ii allow secretary treasury appoint fdic receiver fail financial company 1 the average (per bank) asset 465 bank resolve fdic 2008 2012 roughly $1.5 billion, total $680.3 billion. the large depository institution ever resolve fdic washington mutual, resolve 2008 total asset $307 billion prior failure. 2 lehman’s pre-bankruptcy total asset $691 billion. the second-largest bankruptcy american history bankruptcy washington mutual, inc., save loan hold company own washington mutual; pre-failure total asset nearly $328 billion. both lehman washington mutual file bankruptcy september 2008. 2 bi central bankers’ speech alternative bankruptcy resolution oversee judge. the orderly liquidation authority several feature could reduce systemic effect financial company’s failure relative bankruptcy resolution, include orderly liquidation fund provide government liquidity support fail firm provision prevent unwind fail firm’s derivative qualify financial contract transfer solvent firm. the federal reserve board recently propose important new rule increase prospect orderly resolution gsib minimal effect financial stability. last october, board propose rule subject eight u.s. gsibs total loss-absorbing capacity (tlac) long-term debt requirements, build international tlac standard establish financial stability board.3 the proposal would require systemically important firm maintain outstanding large quantity long-term debt could use absorb loss recapitalize firm orderly resolution either bankruptcy code orderly liquidation authority.4 the proposal would also apply internal tlac long-term debt requirement u.s. intermediate hold company foreign gsibs order facilitate recapitalization fail foreign gsib’s u.s. operations. finally, proposal would restrict operation gsib hold company (as distinct operate subsidiaries) legal entity could go resolution proceed without set short-term wholesale fund run otherwise jeopardize financial stability. in may year, board issue another proposal make gsibs resolvable. this second propose rule would impose restriction gsibs’ qualify financial contract – include derivative repo agreement – guard mass unwind contract resolution gsib.5 the propose restriction key step toward gsib resolvability rapid unwind gsib’s qualify financial contract could destabilize financial system cause asset fire sale topple firms. act conjunction fdic, federal reserve board also seek increase gsib resolvability review firms’ live wills. in april year, board fdic announce result review eight u.s. gsibs’ 2015 resolution plans, evaluate plan base firms’ capital, liquidity, governance mechanisms, operational capabilities, legal entity rationalization, derivative trade activities, responsiveness prior agency feedback.6 3 board governor federal reserve system (2015), “federal reserve board propose new rule strengthen ability large domestic foreign bank operate unite state be resolve without extraordinary government support taxpayer assistance,” press release, october 30. 4 under proposal, u.s. gsib would require hold minimum (i) long-term debt amount great 6 percent plus gsib surcharge risk-weighted asset 4.5 percent total leverage exposure (ii) tlac amount great 18 percent risk-weighted asset 9.5 percent total leverage exposure. see board governor federal reserve system (2015), “total loss-absorbing capacity, long-term debt, clean hold company requirement systemically important u.s. bank hold company intermediate hold company systemically important foreign bank organizations; regulatory capital deduction investment certain unsecured debt systemically important u.s. bank hold companies,” notice propose rulemaking (docket no. r-1523), federal register, vol. 80 (november 30), pp. 74931–32. the gsib satisfy constraints. tlac encompass equity capital eligible long-term debt. 5 see board governor federal reserve system (2016), “federal reserve board propose rule support u.s. financial stability enhance resolvability very large complex financial firms,” press release, may 3. 6 see board governor federal reserve system federal deposit insurance corporation (2016), “agencies announce determination provide feedback resolution plan eight systemically important, domestic bank institutions,“ joint press release, april 13. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the agency find five gsibs’ plan fell short dodd-frank act’s standard require firm fix deficiency plan october year potentially face stringent prudential requirements. the agency also identify less-severe shortcoming plan eight gsibs, gsibs expect address next round resolution plan submissions, due july 2017. the deficiency shortcoming identify agency touch category i listed, especially liquidity, governance mechanisms, operational capabilities, legal entity rationalization. i want end briefly address several criticism make dodd-frank act’s orderly liquidation authority board’s tlac proposal. one criticism need backup orderly liquidation authority bankruptcy code provide adequate framework resolution financial company. a title ii dodd-frank act recognizes, however, bankruptcy code may adequate minimize systemic impact resolution systemically important financial firm. the bankruptcy code direct judge take financial stability account make decisions, provide important stabilize feature orderly liquidation authority, government liquidity support stay-and-transfer treatment qualify financial contracts. a relate line criticism hold orderly liquidation authority enshrine “too big fail” provide taxpayer bailouts systemically important firm orderly liquidation fund. however, board’s propose tlac rule, fail gsib would recapitalized private-sector long-term creditor (whose debt claim would convert equity), government. the orderly liquidation fund would use provide liquidity support, inject capital, unlikely event fund incur losses, dodd-frank act provide loss would cover assessment major financial company would pass taxpayers. i also note credit rat agency recognize public-sector effort end too-big-to-fail phenomenon. the rat agency long assume u.s. government take extraordinary action prevent failure systemically important u.s. financial firms. finally, one criticism level tlac proposal impose long-term debt requirement gsibs lead firm increase leverage thereby raise probability failure, instead require hold high level equity capital. i agree equity capital play key role prevent financial firm failures, raise equity capital requirement bank organization – especially gsibs – substantially since crisis. but protect financial stability, must reduce probability gsib fail, also damage failure could occur. at point failure, bank firm’s equity capital likely zero negative, improve gsib resolvability, proposal require gsibs thick tranche gone-concern loss-absorbing capacity ensure resolution authority necessary raw material manufacture fresh equity recapitalize stabilize firm.7 that role play proposal’s long-term debt requirements. and expect firm would generally come compliance propose requirement replace exist

india, 11th annual conference foreign exchange dealer association india (fedai), hong kong, 11 june 2016. * * * the speaker acknowledge contribution shri himansu mohanty reserve bank india. 1. shri c. venkat nageshwar, chairman, foreign exchange dealer association india (fedai), shri ravi sinha, act consul general india hong kong, shri d. g. patwardhan, outgo ceo fedai, shri ashwani sindhwani, incoming ceo fedai, distinguish speaker panellist delegate conference. it great pleasure today modern city hong kong wikipedia describe world’s competitive economy, world’s visit city, among world’s significant financial centre high financial development index. my sincere thank fedai invite inaugurate 11th annual convention. these annual event fedai quite well know recent time wide participation foreign exchange market participants, depth detail deliberations, course, idyllic location chosen. i sure convention would excel predecessor aspects. 2. fedai form 1958, foreign exchange regulation act, 1947 force life rather simple. the bretton-woods arrangement force, fix exchange rate regime rupee peg pound sterling tranquillity reign markets, were. mandate fedai simple too: set basic rule inter-bank customer transaction pertain computation rate settlements. forex market fedai traverse long way since keep momentous change take place financial market general forex market particular, globally well india. though formally designate self-regulatory organisation (sro), effectively play role smooth transition transformation experience indian foreign exchange market year ascribe fedai small measure. i sure fedai continue play role future great élan. 3. in modern times, economic market condition evolve rapidly whenever find cusp transformational events, global dimension involved. today, indian economy report integrate rest world u china sense trade-gdp ratio india (at 49.6 per cent) high china (41.2 per cent) u (30 per cent). if also look wide parameter global connectedness index develop pankaj ghemawat steven a. altman, india’s score rank pretty high, e.g., 2013 rank 71 ahead china 84 universe 140 countries. the quest mobilise resource india’s vast investment need also pronounce outward-looking refrain. a engage rest world, cross border transaction increase magnitude also become complex. even grapple issues, as, improve ease business attract foreign investment contain potential instability due increase cross border engagements, critical factor influence think policy set condition foreign exchange market. in backdrop, i shall discus today select theme relate “foreign exchange market cross border transactions,” keep view broad topic conference, allow freedom foreign exchange market internationalization indian rupee. 2 bi central bankers’ speech foreign exchange market: freedom stability 4. the modern foreign exchange market know evolve bretton wood system break early 1970’s global currency become freely floating. it may recall bretton wood regime currency almost fix vis-a-vis u dollar exchange rate carry within narrow band. u dollar turn link gold guarantee u monetary authorities. when u government withdraw guarantee august 15, 1971 currency market go turmoil float rate regime come existence. float rate regime experience early example, 30’s market volatile disorderly extreme shut extend periods. it may pass interest note reserve bank india act,1934 frame period preamble say ” ….and whereas present disorganisation monetary system world possible determine suitable permanent basis indian monetary system….” 5. the float exchange rate regime come existence early 70’s remain force four half decades. it occasion disorderliness turbulence market regime turned. 6. three interrelate factor contribute evolution foreign exchange market see now. first, tremendous improvement global communication infrastructure go day trade settlement use do telegraphic system (hence term cable rate). the modern communication network reach time space gap limitation diurnal motion earth. secondly, period also coincide quantum advancement compute capacity. this help improve communication network. but importantly make trade settlement quite easier. it possible trader well back office instantaneously understand implication trade. the ultimate culmination course “algorithm trading”. thirdly, along development computation, sophisticate mathematical model evolve engineer complex bespeak financial products. a combination three factor bring foreign exchange market truly global, liquid large. 7. notwithstanding complexity sophistication foreign exchange market, fundamental principle remain simple yet profound. the foreign exchange market deal currency foreign currency commodity vis-a-vis domestic currency. the price exchange rate. any price two determinants. the supply factor demand factor. the first see derive cost production second factor affect demand, utility instance. in foreign exchange market, first factor ultimately determine exchange rate long run purchase power parity inflation differential. the second factor cause exchange rate movement short run expect earn exchange rate dynamics. in simple case derive interest rate differential real world exchange rate demonstrate random walk behave like financial asset. it important remember factor play equally important role determination price. to quote alfred marshall, “we might reasonably dispute whether upper low blade pair scissor cut piece paper, whether value govern utility cost production. it true one blade hold still, cut effect move other, may say careless brevity cut do second; statement strictly accurate, excuse long claim merely popular strictly scientific account happen (marshall [1890] 1997, 290).” 8. the exchange rate key macro-economic variable. it shape country’s balance payment engagement rest world. it affect country’s export competiveness, course conjunction factor income employment bi central bankers’ speech 3 extent export sector important economy. it determine cost import extent import constitute article essential investment growth, act retard factor. it affect price level linkage provide tradeable sector. 9. a see early foreign currency behave like financial asset. the price financial asset forward look base expectation future state world. a country face large capital inflow outflow depend whether future perceive promise discouraging. this turn affect exchange rate may consonance fundamental real economy example appreciation rupee 2007–08 cause large capital inflow attract buoyant promise economy affect export sector adversely. the reverse perhaps case east asian crisis. the capital flow also pose challenge monetary policy setting. i allude much discuss mundell-fleming trilemma, i.e., impossible open capital account independent monetary policy fix exchange rate. capital account openness independent monetary policy framework could lead flexible exchange rate disorderly volatile. 10. the reason i discuss issue detail emphasise criticality exchange rate. the importance exchange rate cannot emphasise develop countries. for instance, get special importance india like unemployment american inflation germans. the memory 60’s 70’s critical shortage foreign exchange reserve force u resort pl 480 meet food requirement country pretty strong. exchange rate movement either way affect u adversely. appreciation could hurt export depreciation would make import expensive. give large part import comprise crude, fertilizer, capital good intermediates, increase cost import due depreciation currency hurt growth employment affect fiscal balance. 11. in backdrop, two question need posed. first, ensure exchange rate remain stable and, state preamble fema, 1999, preserve orderliness foreign exchange market? second, exchange rate stable fixed, therefore, volatility foreign exchange market. therefore, enable affect exchange rate cope risk inherent volatile market? 12. i deal second problem first. a long inflation differential india country remain positive, indian currency exhibit depreciation long term. however, world dominate capital flows, significant deviation long-term path indicate real effective exchange rate (reer). reer itself, one note, function several dynamic factor variable hence, may serve accurate anchor base period lose relevance face recent developments. even case u dollar, deviation long term represent reer know order 80 per cent. such volatility affect earn balance sheet firm contract even economic exposures. the approach resolve problem provide deep liquid foreign exchange derivative market enable market participant hedge foreign exchange risk. i speak derivative market detail elsewhere wish deal detail here.1 the straightforward derivative forward contract exchange trade counterpart, currency future payoff simple linear. while price derivative fairly simple base interest rate differentials, use product market participant mostly 1 “indian derivative market – strike balance risk protection liquidity” address mr harun r khan, deputy governor reserve bank india, finance conclave 2015 organise sp jain institute management & research, mumbai, 17 january 2015. 4 bi central bankers’ speech motivate expectation future spot rate. ordinarily, foreign exchange receivable payable enter forward sale buy contract, exposure even bother happen exchange rate. however, concept mark-to-market book account also people’s minds. not unexpectedly, cloth manufacturer exporter decide hedge strategy base view expect future spot price different forward price course often base advice “experts”. a i mention earlier, foreign exchange rate exhibit random walk short run best prediction tomorrow’s rate today’s rate. about “expert” advices, i paraphrase samuelson’s famous words, “to prove wall street early omen movement still come gnp, commentator quote economic study allege market downturn predict four last five recessions. that understatement. wall street index predict nine last five recessions! and mistake beauties.”2 now, book forward contract, one track path spot rate start revel repent imagine gain losses! 13. the way hedge risk use non-linear derivative options. once non-linearity bring hedge strategy, universe become virtually unlimited. any combination linear derivative still linear payoffs. but combination non-linear derivative linear derivative result payoff vary complexity. such complex product along future shroud ignorance pretty unpleasant outcome sometimes even threaten market stability. 14. in backdrop adopt gradualist approach respect regulation expansion forex derivative market, keep view certain uncertainty witness global local level macro-economic environment. on one hand, commit enable entity, whether resident non-resident, exposure exchange rate rupee hedge use onshore derivative other, circumspect introduce new products, as, complex option include so-called exotics reason misuse products, either match one’s risk even buy risk speculative strategy. a i see it, universe permit derivative expand even undertake derivative transaction become simpler. all this, however, depend stable currency market remain responsibly market participant behave. i hardly need stress financial transaction general derivative transaction particular, principle caveat venditor apply strongly principle caveat emptor. regulate cross-border transactions: responsibility & responsiveness 15. now i come first question i pose earlier, is, ensure stability exchange rate. the obvious response spring one’s mind intervention central bank. intervention, however, use extreme situation cannot part policy framework. intervention get cost implication like negative carry foreign exchange reserves, interference monetary policy framework, cost sterilization intervention operations, etc., depend upon whether intervention consist buy sell foreign exchange. the strategy, therefore, seem combination capital control flexible exchange rate. early year, bank japan governor kuroda report advise china “impose capital control defend yuan rather keep burn currency reserves”3. the role capital controls, rather active capital account management, preserve stability external sector foreign exchange market well recognise aftermath 2 science stocks, newsweek, september 1966. 3 bloomberg – january 23, 2016. bi central bankers’ speech 5 global financial crisis. some study show capital control measure capital account management desirable certain circumstance even exchange rate flexible. here, i cite example calibrate outflow permit liberalize remittance scheme (lrs) inflow external commercial borrow (ecb) framework indian context. 16. during fera regime, complete exchange control. not capital account, even current account transaction also subject control measures. during acute foreign exchange crisis, capital account open slightly expatriate non-resident indian way incentivised accounts, access secondary market equities, etc. since liberalisation process start early 1990s, capital account progressively liberalised. we courageous enough think full capital account convertibility two occasion – 1997 2007. unfortunately, unfold global macro-economic developments, implementation path full capital account convertibility remain draw board stage. our commitment progressive liberalisation capital account course remain steadfast problem range post-pokhran ii global reaction recent global financial crisis. 17. what approach management capital account? one way look issue see affect three different segment economy – non-financial firm businesses, individual financial firms. a far first segment concerned, open capital account provide good access resource investible funds, bring good technology management practice improve valuation. right since first day open capital account, emphasis ensure real sector deprive benefit open capital account. we say that, effect, capital account fully open real business sector. the restriction respect individual financial sector. in resource starve country, enable individuals, particularly high net-worth, transfer wealth foreign place surely low priority policy objective. a far financial sector concerned, restriction stem premise segment create systemic vulnerability open economy. 18. there another way classify capital flows, viz. asset class – equity, debt immovable property. the distinction equity debt well known. the two financial contract structure implications. from limit perspective external sector stability, suffice say capital inflow nature equity pose little stability issue (except socially economically sensitive sector foreign ownership may consider appropriate) debt contract lead build significant risk firm importantly systemic level. history stand witness proposition. whether latin america east asian country greece recent times, financial economic stability root borrow foreign currency currency country control. 19. the regime foreign debt dictate concern excessive indebtedness foreign currency sow seed instability. take example ecb regime force today. the prudential focus current ecb framework provide nudge towards long term borrow mitigate rollover risk and/or borrow rupee currency risk bear borrowers, discourage borrow natural hedge way foreign currency earn earn link exchange rate, all-in-cost-ceiling prevent poor quality borrower access risky foreign currency loan encourage borrow long-term lenders/investors like sovereign wealth funds, insurance company pension funds. 20. here, i would like mention two inter-related issue passing. often, hear mention foreign currency borrow source cheap funds. be really cheap? in perfect market capital account restriction opportunity 6 bi central bankers’ speech arbitrage fully hedge foreign currency borrow rupee borrow one hand borrow long-term coupon repayment spread lifetime borrow cost hedge long term average rate depreciation other. thus, far cash flow concerned, would matter whether indian firm avail foreign currency borrow rupee borrowing. the arbitrage opportunity exist due market imperfection barrier arbitrage. but whether foreign currency borrow truly cheap require deep study long-term data. the second issue relate whether foreign currency borrow hedged? it intuitive expect whose revenue neither foreign currency index exchange rate leave currency mismatch unhedged. although may argue cost hedge often rate long term depreciation rupee, worth ask question whether one trust one’s instinct remain unhedged hop bet one would able ride best part exchange rate cycle protect oneself possible adversity line prudential risk management framework. this choice carefully evaluated. 21. come back issue asset class equity, need note regime foreign investment equity pretty permissive – foreign direct investment foreign portfolio investment. a far i see, two high level restrictions: (i) sector extent foreign investment cap due sensitive nature and, (ii) stipulation issue transfer security fair value. but always, devil often detail. obviously, investment equity securities. some leeway provide hybrid security – fully compulsorily convertible preference share debentures. the hybrid security partially convertible debentures, optionally convertible debenture equity embed optionality treat par equity hence permit instrument make foreign direct investment. 22. most detail structure foreign direct investment regime come concern allay appreciation fdi use camouflage debt. but complex structure become! in manner speaking, every investment act speculation. every investor must expectation future state affair cash flow return accrue him. every act investment subject usual information asymmetry. therefore, every investment contract must provide probable state affair investor protect uncertainty information problems. straitjacketing investment contracts, thus, often result disputes, worse, much need investment shy away socially useful sectors. here i would like refer case hybrid instrument (e.g. optionally convertible preference shares) issue option exit link pre-determined milestones. this become imperative investment strategy many investor (e.g. private equities) often different need reasonable exit option certain circumstance without assure return. 23. this problem aggravate way fema structured. unlike case current account transactions, principle everything specifically forbid allowed, case capital account transaction principle anything allow forbidden. this make great demand framer regulations, l investment business subject limitation perceptions. the way business do forever evolve difficult job regulator keep pace it. there good case relooking principle align regulatory approach current capital account transactions. even liberalise capital account more, universe restriction shrink regulatory structure simple mention prohibit rather allowed. 24. a move liberalisation rationalization regulations, unsettle development recent past. advance remittance import without correspond import india, receipt advance export without export bi central bankers’ speech 7 materialise long time recently revelation call “panama papers”. in case panama papers, basis reports, suspect indian individual may involve set business maintain balance abroad illegally. investigation situation assess conclusion process full detail available. the question trouble u unfold event influence approach regulate cross-border transactions? 25. on subject i cannot help recall finance minister yashwant sinha say lok sabha november 19, 1999 reply debate foreign exchange management bill. i quote “what try legislation bring entire management foreign exchange line change take place result liberalization current account. i strongly refute emphasis command piece legislation go help blackmarketeers, black money operator hawala operators. this figment imagination section member house i refute i say emphasis command. this term meet new situation come result liberalization foreign exchange management act facilitate management. that reason introduce legislation. we already introduce prevention money launder bill. the two legislations, i suggest, consider together cover entire gamut issue involve two piece legislation.” 26. often come across contravention fema indeed issue relate tax evasion money laundering. i wonder would appropriate deal wrong within framework tax money launder laws. it nobody’s case wrong doer go unpunished; indeed punishment swift exemplary. what i emphasize colour perception respect cross border transaction mould regulatory approach regressive fall back fera mindset. after all, country foreign exchange law wrong effectively deal them. there case avoid possible attempt regression fera regime. this course help authorise dealer foreign exchange collecting, collate share information ensure regulatory intent compromise letter spirit. 27. just word pass internationalisation rupee recognition fact one theme conference today. this excite topic discussion amongst academia market participant recent times. in annual conference fedai hold zurich 20124, i allude aspect detail keep view seven prerequisite move towards internationalization currency lay peter kennen. the issue relate pace sequence internationalization; fact, even definition desirability, continue raise lot passion. i must mention rupee sense international currency till 60’s even legal tender part africa much gulf. those bretton wood day fix exchange rate rupee link sterling. after quarter century near autarchy currency, 90’s saw flexible exchange rate regime, complete convertibility current account gradual open capital account. today, indian hold global asset include official reserve global hold indian asset large. india tremendous growth prospect even day tardy growth around globe, indian growth story continue beacon light. the world obviously want share pie indian asset continue value attractive. but come exposure volatility indian rupee 4 “musings fedai, forex market indian rupee” address shri harun r. khan, deputy governor reserve bank india, 7th annual conference foreign exchange dealer association india (fedai), zurich, 5 april 2012. 8 bi central bankers’ speech need hedge risk. the ndf market come existence address need and, wonder, continue thrive. the correct approach address problem engage ad hominem tirade ndf market participant address genuine need increase access domestic onshore market legitimate rupee exposure. several step take direction offing. 28. in sense, internationalisation rupee rather process event. the pace process depend upon fast capital account open turn depend upon evolve macroeconomic condition financial stability concerns. rupee cannot international currency issue fiat. pound sterling time u dollar today achieve status lead international currency day inherent strength economy financial market administrative proclamation. the condition necessary great internationalization indian rupee term acceptability trade cross-border transactions, reserve currency reach much high level capital account convertibility ensure macro-economic stability, deep liquid financial market. in interim, measure take plan use indian rupee trade denomination settlement, particularly neighbour countries, intra-regional trade volume low, take forward. and also facility onshore hedge non-resident entity increase capital account exposure include off-shore rupee bond issue multilateral institution indian corporates ease further. conclude think 29. a i prepare hang boot long campaign, various shade feel emotion flash across mind. i almost four decade long association country’s central bank financial system. this pretty long period modern times. around time i join reserve bank, momentous thing happen around globe. the bretton wood system break down, smithsonian agreement. follow jamaica agreement jan 1976, flexible exchange rate regime officially endorsed. the european exchange rate mechanism conceive would introduce 1979, culminate single currency two decade later. 30. close home, though “draconian” legislation fera, enact 1973 cofeposa, 1974 prohibitive peak, begin emerge dark ages. the green revolution take root mitigate pressure bop import foodgrains remittance expatriate buoyant. both put together, ease external sector management. since then, despite up downs, grow strength management external sector, turn catalyse quest growth development. though much remain done, achievement scoff at. to mention one statistic, life expectancy birth 41 year 1960, 54 year 1978 go almost 70 year late count. 31. a vibrant financial sector inevitable part develop modern society. in due process development financial sector, culminate seamless integration rest world. in meantime, responsibility regulator steer process non-disruptive facilitative manner. i hope achieve large extent i personally feel happy proud play part process. we ready transit develop economy advance society. a prime minister paraphrase walt whitman recent address u congress “the orchestra sufficiently tune instruments, baton give signal, …..there new symphony play” i shall enjoy music comfortable perch outside burden responsibility. bi central bankers’ speech 9 32. i wish convention success would like convey best wish participant whatever endeavour may choose pursue. thank all. bi central bankers’ speech 1 guy debelle: liquidity australian fix income market speech mr guy debelle, assistant governor (financial markets) reserve bank australia, 4th australian regulatory summit, sydney, 21 june 2016. * * * thank jon cheshire work locally globally topic. fix income market many jurisdiction go period change, result debate whether continue function effectively and, particular, function effectively time stress. change dealer business model increase use electronic trade platform influence nature liquidity bond markets. however, change prevalent australia market overseas, i go talk today. globally debate bond market liquidity ebb flow past couple years. you hear simultaneously best time bad time liquidity bond market. or stick water analogy prevalent discussions, market awash liquidity time tide go out. a aside, water reference liquidity discussion pervasive pixies’ songs. i discuss issue speech last year1 two recent publication two bi committee i member provide comprehensive account recent development bond market liquidity globally.2 rather recount global discussion, instead i try make directly relevant audience run factor affect australian fix income markets, draw work do colleague jon cheshire publish rba bulletin last week.3 the assessment jon makes, i share, liquidity segment physical bond market australia low past. that is, generally little costly transact volumes, immediacy, australian bond market use be. these change partly response regulation partly reassessment business model banks. but, give liquidity oversupplied underprice year prior global financial crisis, change liquidity broadly desirable and, date, present significant issue australian market. measure liquidity what actually mean bond market liquidity? often participant debate talk cross purpose use different metric liquidity, let explain assess bond market liquidity. market liquidity ability execute transaction size, immediately, low cost limit price impact. a see, quantity time element liquidity often conflate discussion it. 1 debelle g (2015), ‘bond market liquidity, long-term rate china’, speech actuary institute ‘banking change’ seminar, sydney, 16 september. 2 market committee (2016), ‘electronic trade fix income markets’, market committee publication no 7 available <http://www.bis.org/publ/mktc07.htm>, bank international settlements, basel. cgfs (committee global financial system) (2016), ‘fixed income market liquidity’, cgfs paper no 55, bank international settlements, basel available <http://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs55.htm>. jon cheshire make significant contribution papers. 3 cheshire j (2016), ‘liquidity fix income markets’, rba bulletin, june, pp 49–58. 2 bi central bankers’ speech give different dimension liquidity, measure precisely straightforward exercise. this particularly case australia, much secondary market activity conduct electronic platform trade data le readily available. it would good see trade data transaction market, although, say that, possible much transparency regard. this particularly relatively small fix income market like australia, revelation market participants’ position close real time problematic. the first metric i use illustrate development liquidity turnover; is, quantity dimension. i discus price aspect below. a small share stock outstanding bond transact relative past (graph 1). the turnover ratio (the ratio value transaction undertake bond market course year relative average outstanding stock bond issue year) government bond decline average around five decade prior 2012, little three past four years. however, time, supply grow significantly, absolute amount turnover hasn’t change much. the turnover ratio corporate security decline little one decade prior 2012 current level half. graph 1 look another way, share government bond market use turnover average month take bite six weeks, average share corporate security market use turnover one month take close two months. we also hear market participant is, general, bite difficult transact size. should concern this? not necessarily. the corporate bond market australia never highly liquid secondary market. it always predominantly buy bi central bankers’ speech 3 hold market, participant well aware this. more generally, bond market activity australia structurally decline long period. in mid 1990s, turnover ratio government bond around 10, late ninety fall around 7. a decade late mid 2000s, fall around 5 3. there number explanation decline turnover i turn to. derivative market participant increasingly transact derivative instrument rather cash bonds. since mid 1990s, activity bond future interest rate swaps, relative bond outstanding, increase sharply (graph 2). in 2015, value turnover bond market around $a2½ trillion whereas value turnover australian dollar interest rate swap bond future market around $a9 trillion.4 growth activity market recent year significantly outpace growth issuance australian dollar bonds. overall, increase derivative activity offset decline bond market activity. graph 2 4 these figure source afma. i’m refer interest rate tenor basis swap turnover here. 4 bi central bankers’ speech there clear preference bond issuer investor australia manage risk associate bond issuance bond hold transact derivative instrument rather physical instruments.5 this result concentration liquidity derivative instrument decline liquidity cash instruments. this development likely continue occur, particularly le liquid segment bond market. this occur standardise derivative instrument significantly cheap transact physical instruments. one reason simply physical transaction large cash component derivative transaction. this cash component funded. if cost fund relatively high, market participant likely shift activity instruments. that said, fix income derivative market cannot act perfect substitute bond market fund source seller represent investment buyer. the underlie bond still issued! electronic trade the share derivative market transaction relative cash transaction large australia european north american fix income markets. this present challenge local bond market compete business derivative markets. how could come about? one way look low cost transact bond markets. this could happen great share transaction conduct via electronic trade platforms. electronic platform typically offer low cost structure traditional phone dealing. the share electronic trade government bond market australia around third. but european u bond market share electronic trade considerably great fifty per cent. in bond future market trade conduct via electronic platform around 25 per cent interest rate swap transaction occur via electronic platforms. there appear scope great share trade australia’s government bond market, least, take place electronic platforms. the price liquidity have talk far stock liquidity, i turn development price liquidity. while turnover appear low bond markets, price transact doesn’t appear much different past. this apparent bid-ask spreads, measure difference price buyer will pay typical amount asset seller will sell. bid-ask spread narrow around narrow domestic government bond markets. part explanation decrease volume transact spreads, consequence increase electronic trade decrease principal-based market-making. so spread narrow much make use narrow spread trade large volume clear, often root divergence opinion current health markets. other measure price liquidity also paint positive picture. for instance, spread risky bond government bond level prevail year lead financial crisis, significantly low average extreme level see crisis years. volatility bite high past six twelve months, reach level see crisis. 5 for instance, bond dealer issuer use exchange physical transaction manage interest rate risk. see cheung b (2014), ‘trading treasury bond future contract bond australia’, rba bulletin, september, pp 47−52. bi central bankers’ speech 5 one reason australian fix income market continue function smoothly derivative market operate effectively. for instance, market depth (the size trade execute give trade size) future market appear similar level prevail prior financial crisis (graph 3). a i mentioned, market account bulk activity australian markets. a such, play key role price discovery facilitate transfer risk among market participants. while part concern global market withdrawal market-making activity bond markets, apparent issue important australia time. graph 3 the role market maker the australian bond market still rely relatively significantly market maker dominant presence markets. for instance, accord afma data, bank account around 45 per cent trade australian government security (ags) market, around 60 per cent decade 2011. at 45 per cent, bank account slightly large share transaction semi market past. their share transaction non-government bond market decline slightly 50 45 per cent. while aggregate, bank still significantly involved, shift composition activity. australian bond market traditionally mix local foreign banks, although number institution involve bond market ebb flow size markets. there increase participation foreign bank 2010 2011, partly response increase demand offshore clients, seek capitalise strength fix income market australia relative jurisdictions. this lead domestic market oversupplied opinion. more recently, see foreign participant leave become uneconomic continue provide market-making services. a result, bond market currently larger, relative gdp, past, foreign bank presence little small time past. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the decline presence foreign bank reflect change business strategy and, cases, effect regulations. for many bank operate australia, effect regulation increase capital requirement leverage ratio bind business models. nevertheless, happen large fix income market offshore, bank operate australian bond market change business models. this see low level great ration principal-based market-making result decrease appetite warehouse risk, particularly bond liquid. this evident bond inventory bank hold trade books. bank decrease stock non-government bond hold trade book increase share government bond holdings. this partly drive decrease willingness warehouse bond trade actively secondary market. it also reflect incentive bank hold government bond satisfy liquidity coverage ratio (lcr). banks’ hold government bond increase around 30 per cent market. the rba’s judgement great hold 30 per cent may impair function government bond markets. in come assessment, one consideration sizeable share government security hold offshore investors. in case ags, currently amount 60 per cent stock. many investor buy-and-hold investors. they generally undertake security lending. a result, bond hold contribute liquidity market. hence, relevant metric consider share government bond market bank hold meet lcr stock bond hold domestic investors. last week, rba publish late assessment amount ag semi could reasonably hold domestic bank without impair market functioning.6 (apra set aggregate size commit liquidity facility difference lcr requirement bank amount ag semi reasonably held.) we maintain assumption domestic bank reasonably hold quarter stock ag semi 2017. foreign bank operate local market hold around another 5 per cent stock meet lcr requirement. so, total, remain 30 per cent. base budget projection commonwealth state governments, expect domestic bank could reasonably hold $220 billion without impair market, would increase $25 billion compare hold 2016. high frequency trade high-frequency trade prevalent domestic bond market market there mix view contribution high-frequency trade market functioning, particularly term contribution flash event bond market occur u treasury market 15 october 2014 german “bund tantrum”.7 6 see rba (reserve bank australia) (2016), ‘the commit liquidity facility’,

high-frequency trade presence physical bond market modest presence bond future market, grow around 15 per cent past years. that said, high-frequency trade activity domestic market often concentrate around particular events, notably bond future rolls. the share high-frequency trade around future roll considerably higher. the presence high-frequency trader reduce costs, term spread, transact small parcel sizes. there evidence occur domestic market. but, high-frequency trade firm hold trade position long period time. during period market price adjusting, presence market participant long hold period beneficial participant absorb order imbalance. one possible concern future evolution bond market high-frequency firm reduce return market-making activity normal (benign) time cause market maker exit activity become uneconomic. this reduction market-making become problematic turbulent time exacerbate market disruption. this potential development monitoring, although evidence issue date local market. conclusion in conclusion, australian fix income market continue function satisfactorily, even overseas market increase concern capacity market function effectively. a i’ve noted, part explanation difference withdrawal dealer bond market australia sizeable elsewhere. regulatory change contribute reduce capacity domestic market, detriment market functioning. indeed, fact price liquidity accurately reflect cost provide liquidity positive outcome. another development contribute satisfactory outcome domestic market large share market activity undertake derivative market don’t rely much market-making capacity relatively low cost efficient. it likely fix income market australia continue evolve come years, require market participant keep adapting. on side, continue monitor evolution impact efficient function market. bi central bankers’ speech 1 janet l yellen: semiannual monetary policy report congress testimony m janet l yellen, chair board governor federal reserve

economy make progress toward federal reserve’s objective maximum employment. and inflation continue run 2 percent objective, federal open market committee (fomc) expect inflation rise level medium term. however, pace improvement labor market appear slow recently, suggest cautious approach adjust monetary policy remain appropriate. in labor market, cumulative increase job since trough early 2010 top 14 million, unemployment rate fall 5 percentage point peak. in addition, detail monetary policy report, jobless rate decline major demographic groups, include african american hispanics. despite declines, however, trouble unemployment rate minority group remain high nation overall, annual income median african american household still well median income u.s. households. during first quarter year, job gain average 200,000 per month, bite slow last year’s pace. and unemployment rate hold steady 5 percent period, labor force participation rate move noticeably. in april may, however, average pace job gain slow 80,000 per month 100,000 per month adjustment effect strike. the unemployment rate fell 4.7 percent may, decline mainly occur few people report actively seek work. a broad measure labor market slack include worker marginally attach workforce work part-time would prefer full-time work unchanged may remain level prior recession. of course, important overreact one two reports, several timely indicator labor market condition still look favorable. one notable development tentative sign wage growth may finally pick up. that said, watch job market carefully see whether recent slow employment growth transitory, believe is. economic growth uneven recent quarters. u.s. inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (gdp) currently estimate increase annual rate 3/4 percent first quarter year. subdue foreign growth appreciation dollar weigh exports, energy sector hard hit steep drop oil price since mid-2014; addition, business investment outside energy sector surprisingly weak. however, available indicator point noticeable step-up gdp growth second quarter. in particular, consumer spend pick smartly recent months, support solid growth real disposable income ongoing effect increase household wealth. and house continue recover gradually, aid income gain low level mortgage rates. the recent pickup household spending, together underlie condition favorable growth, lead optimistic see improvement 2 bi central bankers’ speech labor market economy broadly next years. monetary policy remain accommodative; low oil price ongoing job gain continue support growth income therefore consumer spending; fiscal policy small positive growth; global economic growth pick time, support accommodative monetary policy abroad. a result, fomc expect gradual increase federal fund rate, economic activity continue expand moderate pace labor market indicator strengthen further. turn inflation, overall consumer prices, measure price index personal consumption expenditures, increase 1 percent 12 month end april, noticeably pace much last year still well short committee’s 2 percent objective. much shortfall continue reflect early decline energy price low price imports. core inflation, exclude energy food prices, run close 1-1/2 percent. a transitory influence hold inflation fade labor market strengthen further, committee expect inflation rise 2 percent medium term. nonetheless, consider future policy decisions, continue carefully monitor actual expect progress toward inflation goal. of course, considerable uncertainty economic outlook remains. the late read labor market weak pace investment illustrate one downside risk – domestic demand might falter. in addition, although i optimistic longer-run prospect u.s. economy, cannot rule possibility express prominent economist slow productivity growth see recent year continue future. vulnerability global economy also remain. although concern slow growth china fall commodity price appear ease early year, china continue face considerable challenge rebalances economy toward domestic demand consumption away export-led growth. more generally, current environment sluggish growth, low inflation, already accommodative monetary policy many advance economies, investor perception appetite risk change abruptly. one development could shift investor sentiment upcoming referendum unite kingdom. a u.k. vote exit european union could significant economic repercussions. for reasons, committee closely monitor global economic financial development implication domestic economic activity, labor markets, inflation. monetary policy i turn next monetary policy. the fomc seek promote maximum employment price stability, mandate congress. give economic situation i described, monetary policy remain accommodative first half year support improvement labor market return inflation 2 percent objective. specifically, fomc maintain target range federal fund rate 1/4 1/2 percent keep federal reserve’s hold longer-term security elevate level. the committee’s action reflect careful assessment appropriate set monetary policy, take account continue below-target inflation mix read labor market economic growth see year. proceed cautiously raise federal fund rate allow u keep monetary support economic growth place ass whether growth return moderate pace, whether labor market strengthen further, whether inflation continue make progress toward 2 percent objective. another factor support take cautious approach raise federal fund rate federal fund rate still near effective low bound. if inflation remain persistently low labor market weaken, committee would limit room reduce target range federal fund rate. however, economy overheat inflation seem likely move significantly bi central bankers’ speech 3 persistently 2 percent, fomc could readily increase target range federal fund rate. the fomc continue anticipate economic condition improve economy evolve manner warrant gradual increase federal fund rate. in addition, committee expect federal fund rate likely remain, time, level expect prevail long run headwind – include restraint u.s. economic activity economic financial development abroad, subdue household formation, meager productivity growth – mean interest rate need keep economy operate near potential low historical standards. if headwind slowly fade time, committee expects, gradual increase federal fund rate likely needed. in line view, fomc participants, base projection prepare june meeting, anticipate value federal fund rate le 1 percent end year le 2 percent end next year consistent assessment appropriate monetary policy. of course, economic outlook uncertain, monetary policy mean preset course fomc participants’ projection federal fund rate predetermine plan future policy. the actual path federal fund rate depend economic financial development implication outlook associate risks. strong growth rapid increase inflation committee currently anticipate would likely make appropriate raise federal fund rate quickly. conversely, economy disappoint, low path federal fund rate would appropriate. we commit dual objectives, adjust policy appropriate foster financial condition consistent attainment time. the committee continue policy reinvesting proceed mature treasury security principal payment agency debt mortgage-backed securities. a highlight statement release june fomc meeting, anticipate continue policy normalization level federal fund rate well way. maintain sizable hold longer-term security help maintain accommodative financial condition reduce risk might low federal fund rate effective low bind event future large adverse shock. thank you. i would please take questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 haruhiko kuroda: overcome deflation – theory practice speech mr haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, keio university, tokyo, 20 june 2016. * * * introduction it great honor opportunity speak today faculty economics keio university. found yukichi fukuzawa 1858, keio gijuku history span 150 years. the faculty economics – precursor which, together faculty letter faculty law, one three original faculty keio university establish 1890 – say old economics faculty japan. since then, lead force economic scholarship japan wide range research area also turn large number individual go play prominent role world politics, business, finance. since i give opportunity speak academic venue, today i would like talk implementation so-called unconventional monetary policy link development academic research, base bank’s experience implement quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe). i. qqe negative interest rate japan struggle deflation since late 1990s, process need powerful monetary ease gradually become evident. the abe administration inaugurate december 2012 launch so-called “abenomics” policy consist “three arrows,” i assume role governor bank japan march 2013. in april, first monetary policy meet i become governor, bank decide introduce qqe. qqe comprise two element design break bind previous monetary policy measure (chart 1). the first element consist try drastically convert deflationary mindset gain hold among people raise inflation expectation bank’s strong commitment achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. the second element consist exert downward pressure short-term nominal interest rate entire yield curve massive purchase japanese government bond (jgbs). the consequence element make possible exert great monetary ease effect real economy substantially low real interest rate short end also long end. subsequently, pace monetary expansion accelerate october 2014 quantitative qualitative term and, january year, policy augment third dimension add interest rate dimension quantitative qualitative dimension introduction “qqe negative interest rate” (chart 2). the introduction negative interest rate aim exert downward pressure entire yield curve low short end yield curve, couple massive purchase jgbs. this could call “enhanced qqe” extension previous qqe policy enhance effects. with regard massive purchase jgbs, bank initially conduct purchase amount outstanding jgbs hold bank would increase annual pace 50 trillion yen, october 2014 accelerate today’s pace 80 trillion yen. since japan’s nominal gdp 500 trillion yen, annual increase 80 trillion yen correspond 16 percent gdp (chart 3). a result purchases, 2 bi central bankers’ speech bank japan’s balance sheet relative nominal gdp increase 35 percent end-march 2013 81 percent end-march year continue rise. for comparison, follow three round large-scale asset purchase (lsaps) unite states, ended, federal reserve’s balance sheet end-march year equivalent 25 percent nominal gdp. i think show massive monetary ease conduct bank japan is. ii. the cost deflation a mentioned, aim qqe overcome prolong deflation grip japan. even deflation mild, fact continue 15 year mean cumulative cost extremely large. look term price level, annual inflation rate minus 0.3 percent period 15 year imply price level fall around 5 percent, annual inflation rate 2 percent period 15 year mean price level rise around 35 percent. therefore, i think clear even mild deflation, continue prolong period, large impact medium- long-term decision-making economic entities. the problem persistent deflation give rise vicious cycle firm household – since expect price fall due heighten uncertainty – postpone various expenditures, prolong weak growth deflation. under circumstances, fall price heighten uncertainty, postpone expenditure may optimal response individual economic entities; however, macroeconomic perspective, typical example “fallacy composition,” since result prolong weak growth deflation. therefore, overcome deflation, absolutely essential drastically convert deflationary mindset. moreover, merely achieve positive inflation rate sufficient; also necessary self-reinforcing cycle strengthen economic activity gain traction price increase moderately. during period deflation, japan’s economy experience simultaneous downward shift flatten phillips curve (chart 4). if average inflation rate low, opportunity cost leave price unchanged also low, frequency price adjustment firm likely fall. macroeconomic theory suggest decline frequency price adjustment micro level link flatten phillips curve macro level.1 a key question context, i think, whether flatten phillips curve or, words, decrease responsiveness inflation rate economic fluctuations, simply result change firms’ price-setting behavior. if look japan’s experience prolong deflation, decline frequency price adjustment also regard signal weaken metabolism economy, postponement expenditure activity firm household symptom. if case, possible change shape phillips curve reflect deterioration fundamental japan’s economy. of course, moment, nothing hypothesis. to examine hypothesis, need theoretical empirical study take interaction deflation firms’ behavior account, date limit amount research issue. moreover, consider lesson japan’s prolong deflation, also essential deepen understand regard link deflation macroeconomic performance. 1 laurence ball, n. gregory mankiw, david romer, “the new keynesian economics output-inflation trade-off,” brook paper economic activity, no. 1, 1988, pp. 1–65. bi central bankers’ speech 3 iii. formation inflation expectation earlier, i mention qqe consist two elements. one drastic conversion deflationary mindset, relate this, i would like consider formation inflation expectation detail. when consider formation inflation expectations, theoretical empirical research forward guidance zero interest rate provide useful insights. with many central bank grapple zero low bind policy rate theoretical possibility problem encounter practice, research forward guidance make considerable progress.2 such research help elucidate that, even situation zero low bind reach possible low policy rate further, monetary ease effect achieve forward guidance commit maintain zero interest rates, regard mechanism borrow monetary ease effect future (chart 5). the first time mechanism employ actual conduct monetary policy introduction zero interest rate policy commence bank japan february 1999. at time, bank commit maintain zero interest rate deflationary concern dispelled, impact policy call “policy duration effect.” back grow theoretical research, similar policy subsequently adopt central bank major advance economy recently come refer forward guidance. it well know standard macroeconomic models, macroeconomic variable respond strongly forward guidance central bank, give rise substantial policy effects. thus, theoretical perspective, commitment continue zero interest rate prolong period allow borrow unlimited monetary ease effect future, policy effect also materialize immediately. however, prediction odds effect actually observe practice – phenomenon describe “forward guidance puzzle.”3 when consider puzzle, two factor important. the first standard macroeconomic models, limit consumption smooth time due large intertemporal elasticity substitution absence borrow constraints. the second inflation expectation respond instantaneously change policy. it latter point – speed inflation expectation respond – i would like focus next. in theoretical model assume forward-looking phillips curve, inflation expectation respond instantaneously commitment regard future monetary ease credible. however, inflation expectation observe practice highly sticky change slowly. this mean actual formation inflation expectations, backward-looking component determine actual inflation rate observe past play large role. moreover, standard theoretical models, assume outright commitment monetary ease perfectly credible, potentially give rise discrepancy theoretical model reality. if consider japan’s experience, inflation expectation decline deflationary period, play extremely important role process overcome deflation push inflation expectation back close target inflation rate re-anchor there. how this, include deal impact backward-looking component inflation expectations, challenge necessarily address 2 gauti eggertsson michael woodford, “the zero bind interest rate optimal monetary policy,” brook paper economic activity, no. 1, 2003, pp. 139–211. 3 marco del negro, marc giannoni, christina patterson, “the forward guidance puzzle,” staff report 574, federal reserve bank new york, 2012. 4 bi central bankers’ speech theory. moreover, bank japan many central bank around world currently nearly exhaust conventional monetary policy mean – is, low short-term interest rate – respond deflationary pressure firmly stabilize inflation expectation desire level represent unprecedentedly difficult challenge. in sense, formation inflation expectation regard “old new” issue debate. iv. large-scale purchase financial asset next, i would like talk push entire yield curve massive jgb purchases, another element qqe. a well known, although market operation central bank – exchange monetary base government bond – transaction financial asset perfect substitute, neutral regard price formation arbitrage financial market operate fully.4 however, arbitrage financial market reason imperfect, market operation central bank affect term premiums.5 moreover, likely financial market imperfection become severe time financial crisis. in practice, look back response central bank unite state europe immediately collapse lehman brothers, find important issue stabilization financial market financial system, central bank end provide large amount liquidity intervene financial market show sign malfunction. subsequently, financial market calm extent, central bank continue large-scale asset purchase aim stabilize macroeconomy avoid deflation push various premium financial markets. furthermore, another important component qqe, mention earlier, raise inflation expectation influence forward-looking expectation formation. a number study employ new keynesian model – standard type macroeconomic model employ analyze monetary policy issue – seek incorporate various kind financial market imperfection examine impact quantitative easing.6 however, i think date sufficiently clear circumstance mechanism quantitative ease effective. in fact, former feed chairman bernanke quip “[t]he problem qe work practice, doesn’t work theory.” give different country region different financial systems, i think examine impact quantitative ease necessary focus financial market large-scale asset purchase conduct also explicitly take account differences, example transmission mechanism financial systems. v. monetary policy rule i would like slightly change topic consider unconventional monetary policy monetary policy rules. 4 neil wallace, “a modigliani-miller theorem open-market operations,” american economic review, vol. 71, no. 3, 1981, pp. 267–274. 5 franco modigliani richard sutch, “innovations interest rate policy,” american economic review, vol. 56, no. 2, 1966, pp. 178–197. 6 see, example, mark gertler nobuhiro kiyotaki, “financial intermediation credit policy business cycle analysis,” benjamin friedman michael woodford, eds., handbook monetary economics, vol. 3a, 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 5 one area considerable progress since 1990s theoretical empirical research monetary policy research policy rules, taylor rule prime example.7 study area highlight importance systematically set policy rate line change macroeconomy order maximize monetary policy effects. put differently, indicate order ensure effectiveness monetary policy, important thing cause unanticipated shocks, maintain consistent predictable policy response (chart 6). these consideration regard conduct monetary policy essentially also apply conduct unconventional policies. this mean that, order raise effectiveness monetary policy, important show advance policy option central bank use address exogenous shock economy large enough interest rate hit zero low bound. however, look back japan’s experience since late 1990s policy response unite state europe follow collapse lehman brothers, central bank essentially stumble along devise new policy measure respond situation problem face time. since practice world full uncertainty, difficult present policy option contingency advance. moreover, policy response unanticipated event formulate take financial economic circumstance also various structural institutional constraint account, tend consist complex package policies. the issue kind institutional framework build order achieve efficient allocation resource circumstance uncertainty great necessary deal complex challenge fall arena incomplete contract theory.8 research field make rapid progress recent year find apply practice grow range areas, firm organization, financial contracts, legal systems. i think that, employ new understand gain consider possible policy framework comprehensive policy rule – include response crisis – well application rules, may possible expand research frontier monetary policy. vi. long-term equilibrium while premature talk time exit “qqe negative interest rate” go it, i would finally like take valuable opportunity speak today say word relationship japan’s economy monetary policy deflation finally overcome. standard model analyze monetary policy take trend growth rate inflation rate steady state give focus economic fluctuation around trend. the central interest monetary policy analysis employ model smooth cyclical economic fluctuation stabilize inflation rate near target level. standard macroeconomic model generally make simplify assumptions: short-term model focus business cycle take potential growth rate exogenously given, long-term economic growth model examine determinant potential growth rate ignore short-term economic fluctuations, since assume smooth time affect long-term economic growth. 7 the pioneer study area john b. taylor, “discretion versus policy rule practice,” carnegie-rochester conference series public policy, vol. 39, 1993, pp. 195–214. 8 a standard textbook field patrick bolton mathias dewatripont, contract theory, the mit press, 2005. 6 bi central bankers’ speech similar simplify assumption make analysis unconventional monetary policy. when unconventional monetary policy analyze use standard theoretical macroeconomic models, assume even shock large enough interest rate hit zero low bind economy return steady state shock dissipates. in words, analysis unconventional monetary policy examine impact large shock smooth absorb time. however, downward shift steady state natural rate interest, reflect long-term growth expectations, shift permanently, stimulative effect decline real interest rate economic activity weaken effectiveness monetary policy substantially hampered. moreover, substantial uncertainty regard level natural rate interest, would make difficult ass degree monetary ease tighten require would increase uncertainty future course monetary policy. in addition, since decline potential growth rate likely also low expect permanent incomes, give rise negative income effect, likely exert downward pressure economic activity. in fact, see “secular stagnation” debate recent years, active debate major advance economy regard possibility that, follow large shock suffered, steady state may shift downward due variety factors.9 meanwhile, whereas japan’s potential growth rate early 1990s range 3 4 percent, subsequently follow downward trend, fall around 1 percent second half 1990s level 0.5 percent collapse lehman brother (chart 7). the natural rate interest – is, interest rate economy neither accelerate decelerate – likely also follow downward trend line decline potential growth rate. in sense, relationship uncertainty surround medium- long-term steady state conduct monetary policy say issue face bank japan, central banks. in order consider issue, necessary devise analytical framework take interaction long-term economic growth short-term business cycle fluctuation account. do practical importance also present interest research topic academic perspective. conclusion japan’s experience battle mild extremely persistent deflation provide valuable case study academic research unconventional monetary policy practical conduct monetary policy central banks. by make use experience, make significant progress past decade half academic research actual conduct monetary policy. however, also true that, i mention today, still remain gap two. go forward, i sure academia central bank continue join force efforts, produce important benefit sides. thank you. 9 lawrence h. summers, “have enter age secular stagnation? imf fourteenth annual research conference honor stanley fischer, washington, dc,” imf

perry warjiyo: indonesian economic outlook year year ahead keynote speech mr perry warjiyo, deputy governor bank indonesia, bnp paribas economic outlook 2016, jakarta, 23 march 2016. * * * introduction follow success strong macroeconomic policy adjustment since feed tapper tantrum mei 2013, indonesia economy already surpass turn point since second half 2015. macroeconomic financial stability intact back continue turbulence global economic financial environments. there unintended consequence policy adjustments, though, domestic economic growth slowing, albeit still relatively comfortable level compare emerge countries. i believe indonesia economy good year. and even accelerate next year year come. let persuade this. • first, continue stress importance macroeconomic financial stability prerequisite sustainable growth. we already show commitment long-standing track record this, continue so. the recent global economic financial condition still challenge uncertain. but compare last year, i reckon challenge year, element certainty make 2016 good 2015, include likelihood ffr increases. • second, time three policy mix indonesia economic developments, i.e. fiscal, monetary, structural reforms, work together reinforce other. this actually indonesia differ countries. follow brave removal subsidies, fiscal stimulus effect accelerate high economic growth. structural reform speed too. the government do remarkably well accelerate reform many key areas: good investment climate, infrastructure developments, manufacture industry, agriculture, maritime, tourism. • third, central bank policy reinforce fiscal stimulus structural reform government. last year, backdrop uncertainty surround ffr increases, start relax macroprudential policy ltv ratio reserve requirement support bank lend economic growth. this year already cut bi policy rate three time january, february, march total 75 bps 6.75%. we believe monetary macroprudential ease consistent forecast stable macroeconomic condition high economic growth. these three reason i confident 2016 indonesian economic prospect better, high economic growth sound macroeconomic financial stability. and i believe even promise 2017 beyond. now let talk three follow aspects: first, assesment global economic financial outlook, challenge saw; second, indonesian economic outlook, try stimulate economic growth maintain stability; third, bi policy mix play key role road indonesia promise outlook future. 2 bi central bankers’ speech global outlook risk we particularly put emphasize three aspect global economic financial outlook risk: global economic growth, commodity prices, divergence monetary policies. in addition, also monitor closely development china, important role global regional economy. on global economic growth. it still challenge year. imf release january world economic outlook year next year 3.4% 3.6%, respectively, 0.2% low early forecasts. the u still main engine global economic growth, 2.6% 2016 2017. we see slow recovery europe 1.7% years, slightly high 1.5% 2015. so i think part develop economy start economic recovery albeit slow pace. the challenge is, course, china, forecast grow around 6.3% year 6.0% next year. these main challenge global economic growth, force u rely domestic demand support growth. on commodity prices. last year, saw decline export commodity price index. this year still decline rebound 2017 slightly positive increase. this mean commodity price reach bottom year, start rise next year. in fact, palm oil price already state rebound, forecast increase year. though volatile short-term, oil price likely around $35 per barrel, much low $50 per barrel assume budget. that mean inflation lower, even though put pressure budget revenues. all all, imperative indonesia ladder commodity export base manufacturing. on divergence monetary policy. after first ffr increase 25bps end last year, market predict another 50bps increase year, probably june another end year. we already include scenario policy making. although still challenging, compare 2015 i think uncertainty volatility low year. we closely monitor negative policy rate euro japan. frankly, i doubt effective address deflation problem compare quantitative easing. all all, ffr outlook negative rate europe japan ‘push factors’, positive outlook part ‘pull factor’, positive fdi portfolio inflow indonesia rupiah exchange rate. on china. there three channel need anticipate china factors: trade, renmimbi depreciation, investment. on trade, china slowdown commodity price decline continue put pressure export. our simulation show every 1% economic slowdown china correspond 0.3% slowdown indonesian economic growth. on renmimbi, i believe big devaluation saw last year. i think pboc continue intervene reckon renminbi depreciation gradual year. the challenge china course policy adjustment implement right now, i.e.: capital account liberalization, financial market development, well great exchange rate flexibility. this lead third china factor must forget. china aggressively pursue outward investment support economic growth, embed ambitious silk road strategy. so prepare open arm great investment china, do japan south korea. these see global economic financial condition. last year september difficult time, december see improvements. the uncertainty still there, overall confident now. we incorporate uncertainty policy making. indonesia show resilience past, poise progress well future. bi central bankers’ speech 3 indonesia economic outlook risk with stimulus fiscal monetary fronts, well accelerate structural reform many key areas, see significant improvement indonesia economy year beyond. the fiscal stimulus start kick third fourth quarter last year, budget absorption accelerate since early year, notably capital expenditures. the continuous series deregulation package government provide great impetus good investment climate, competitiveness, buoyant economic activities. we see accelerate completion key infrastructure projects: toll road, airports, energy, irrigation, more. our macroprudential relaxation monetary ease also provide support high economic growth. let provide late economic outlook year next year. on economic growth. last year, record economic growth 4.79%. with fiscal stimulus, economic growth reach bottom 4.66% second quarter last year pick 5.04% last quarter. investment construction relate government project together private government consumption support recovery. this year much better. compare early last year, government must deal administrative procedures, year fiscal stimulus acceleration government project already start kick-in first quarter. with that, economic growth forecast year around 5.2–5.6%. it support fiscal stimulus well monetary policy ease accelerate economic growth. private consumption still robust. government relate expenditures, especially investment infrastructures, boost economy, saw since q3-2015. that sector start rebound construction, transportation, communication, electricity, government relate fiscal stimulus sectors. i sure trade manufacture sector follow economic growth start gain broad momentum. this dynamic stimulus economic growth see future. on inflation. we manage low inflation 8.3% 2014 3.3% 2015, i think part success owe monetary policy credibility gain since 2013. this year next year forecast inflation within range 4±1%. in past, challenge price stability mainly come administer prices, namely subsidy fuel electricity. but government succeded reform subsidies. this help central bank certain forecast control inflation. unlike past, cpi core inflation convergent controlled. exchange rate passthrough benign, weak domestic demand, commodity price declines, well anchor inflation expectation. on current account deficit. our macroeconomic adjustment past succeded low cad peak 4.4% gdp q2-2013 2% whole year 2015. for indonesia, cad 2.5–3% still sustainable, still need grow need sustainable finance fdi long-term financing. that why, 2% cad 2015, room monetary ease without worry external sector stability. this year, economic recovery gain momentum, cad expect widen still within long term sustainable cad norm 2.5–3% gdp. we expect enough external finance deficits, fdi constitute majority capital inflow less extent long-term private external borrow portfolio investments. on financial system stability. overall bank industry sound, car relatively high 21%. lend growth slowing, 10% january 2016. but economic stimulus fiscal monetary, well liquidity injection 1% reduction reserve requirement bank indonesia decide recently, expect lend growth increase 12–14 % year. overall npl low 2.7% (gross) 1.4% (net), although bite increase bank especially mine sectors. we do 4 bi central bankers’ speech analysis corporate risk well household risk. last year record corporate earn decline economy slow down. but overall corporates adjust quite well, lot efficiency early repayment debts, local external debts. with economy rebounding, overall corporate performance also improve year. bank indonesia policy mix bank indonesia mandate achieve price stability (inflation) maintain exchange rate stability support economic growth. we also support financial system stability. for policy making, analyze forecast macroeconomic condition two year ahead: inflation, economic growth, exchange rate, current account balance, bank lending, take account late assessment fiscal financial system condition well global economic growth, interest rates, commodity prices. we rely one instrument, i.e. interest rate, employ policy mix monetary, macroprudential, capital flow management payment systems. a such, every monthly board meet formulate interest rate, exchange rate policy, monetary operation, capital flow management, macroprudential measure base late assessment forecast overall macroeconomic financial system. early last year, note need balance macroeconomic stability support economic growth. we forecast time inflation would control within target, current deficit narrowed, economic growth slow external domestic factors. that theme policy coordination bank indonesia government. we agree accelerate fiscal stimulus support economic growth, benefit save subsidy reform 2014. at bank indonesia, also rebalance policy mix. while interest rate cut possible time possibility ffr increases, start relax macroprudential policy. we relax ltv ratio average 10% june 2015 low reserve requirement june december 2015. follow first ffr increase december 2015 le uncertainty future course possible ffr increases, start cut policy rate year. thus, monetary macroprudential policy ease modes. together fiscal stimulus structural reform government, national policy mix, i.e. fiscal, monetary structural reforms, reinforce accelerate economic growth maintain macroeconomic financial stability. let brief late board decision bank indonesia policy mix. on monetary policy. with inflation remain low within target year next year, current account deficit control witin sustainable range, room monetary easing. we communicate since october last year, start cut bi policy rate 25bps january 2016. we cut bi rate february march 25bps 6.75%. more that, cut reserve requirement 1% 6.50% february 2016, count would add liquidity bank system idr 34 trillion (about usd 2.6 billion) money multiplier 4.8 time add liquidity economy idr163 trilliun (usd12.5 billion). our signal clear, macroeconomic stability provide u room monetary ease support economic growth interest rate cut ample liquidity bank system. eventhough still room, cautious deliberate monetary easing. we ass throughly overall economic financial developments, domestic global, formulate monetary policy every monthly board meeting. in meantime, focus strengthen monetary operation reinforce monetary policy transmission mechanisms. on exchange rate policy. we adopt great exchange rate flexibility. we let market mechanism determine exchange rate accord evolve supply demand. and proud continuous financial market deepen size bi central bankers’ speech 5 price mechanism foreign exchange market much develop now. that case exchange rate reflect market mechanism. but shy away intervene market exchange rate move excessively jittery market, especially case large foreign capital reversals. if necessary, intervene supply foreign exchange buy government bond secondary market. that see excessive volatility exchange rate well government bond yield. last year bite difficult capital outflow equity due turbulence global market. but reverse year, accumulate inflow fix income equity. our exchange rate appreciate 5.5% year-to-date mid march. go forward, economy rebounding, i believe domestic global factor provide favorable environment exchange rate financial market. on macroprudential policy. we start relax loan value ratio, average 10% june last year. we also ease liquidity bank system, monetary operation well reduction reserve requirement. overall lend growth still low 10% demand rebound strong yet. however, look close sectors, construction loan increase 20% real estate loan increase 23%, show significant demand bank lend fiscal stimulus relate activities. we haven’t see impact mortgage loan yet, grow 10% last month, demand house recover yet. on second half last year, fiscal stimulus monetary easing, domestic demand keep pace demand bank lending. we see increase demand lend government project relate activities, see increase demand bank loan economic sector domestic economic growth become broad based. final remark i share optimism positive indonesian economic outlook year year ahead. economic growth higher, macroeconomic financial stability sound. there risks, course, need closely monitor address, e.g. ffr increases, china factors, commodity price declines, fiscal revenues. this time indonesia move forward, will. all three policy mix national level, i.e. fiscal stimulus, monetary easing, accelerate structural reforms, reinforce support high economic growth. we know it, investor see it. that investor already make differentiation view valuation among emerge countries, indonesia one promise economies. that support good indonesia future. hope i bring optimism you. i

issues; • press releases, provide information communicate bank’s position topical issues. all activity communicate public bank’s stance economic issues, outcome collective work carry departments, particularly economic analysis research department, endorse bank’s decision-making bodies. in year crisis bank greece saw need enhance public discourse increase frequency interventions, view to: – warn major risk although clearly looming, realize general public ignore governments. – raise awareness complexity situation need change course economy, thus contribute formulation policy effective management crisis. the bank greece’s public discourse enrich new element since bank seek strengthen role advisor society, communicate directly public, period inundate conflict inaccurate information signal often result confusion high uncertainty. through statement participation public debate, bank greece aim present true fact comprehensible manner, dispel misconception misunderstand provide citizen reliable timely information available option implication thereof. it note central bank undertake similar change regard communication policies, – response condition crisis – shift away traditional communication model whereby discourse address close circle expert often cryptic. to sum up, i convince greece abundant supply public knowledge benefit country. non-domestic knowledge also added, bi central bankers’ speech 3 communicate public numerous reports, studies, analyses, proposal forecast greece publish international organisations, think-tanks research bodies. thus, one safely assume greek government disposal bulk knowledge evaluate use – consider helpful – formulation economic policies. the demand side let discus demand side, i.e. governments’ willingness recognize usefulness outside knowledge, particularly public knowledge i describe it. experience show government reluctant general, perhaps one exception, simitis government, i happy see tonight, exploit public knowledge, even proposal recommendation potentially relevant useful. a reveal example prolegomenon present crisis: many year 2008, many independent observers, among bank greece, warn greek economy vulnerable large public external deficit restrained, severe crisis unavoidable. they also put forward concrete policy proposal structural reform – adopt – could change course events. the warn however heed successive government continue borrow spending, bring economy edge disaster international crisis break out. in general, government greece reluctant accept outside expertise perceive available supply distrust. the reason behind attitude lie fierce partisanship greek politics. the political system base confrontation breed strong distrust “other”, leave grind independent voices. the term “technocrat” carry derogative connotation definitely consider inferior “political”. independent proposal and/or technical expertise judge merits, perceive position political spectrum. the preference “political” decisions, oppose “technocratic”, ever present greek politics reflect ideological system give precedence “political”, considerations. this clearly indicate method greek government recognize need external knowledge use policy planning. the first method hire individual expert advisor consultant ministers. the fact however leave position together government hire reveal basic problem. a relevant case chairman council economic advisors, body economic expert ministry finance participate vigorously formulation economic policies. the chairman council usually prominent economist, person change every change government. i would say also minister government. panos tsakloglou confirm that. when i left, minister succeed me, change panos well. the position term political, mean academic excellence sole criterion choice head. another example practice appointment university professor minister high positions. government case want input outside, i.e. professors’ knowledge, condition knowledge politicized. a second method government use order acquire expertise external source set extra parliamentary committee expert study suggest policy guideline major issues. the participant practitioners, academics, representative various social group individual prove knowledge subject. issue committee kind deal past been, among others: social security system, fiscal policy tax reforms, system national statistics, policy growth. the spraos report famous example. the work committee end detail reports, extensive analysis fact concrete policy recommendations. these reports, besides sum exist knowledge subject, reflect interchange different 4 bi central bankers’ speech idea consensus participant feasible desirable time. in sense constitute ideal start point policy decision could easily legitimize broad, non-partisan character committees. government however miss opportunity too. the find committees, go maze political considerations, eventually forgotten. it politics upper hand. a third way government internalize extraneous expertise decision make commission consultant firms, think tanks, university center and/or individual academic carry research project specific, mostly technical issues. the term condition project set relevant authority selection candidate do accord provision european greek law. there quantitative evidence show extent practice use find project published. it seem however undertake kind rare often part large project finance european funds. this reveal demand indicate public authority recognize need external expertise resort institutional framework. in year crisis importance external expertise become paramount. economic policy adapt direction specify agreement eu, ecb imf, technical expertise urgently need deal new problems. under condition bulk technical assistance come outside, non-domestic source (imf, ecb, eu) indispensable, mandatory input formulation economic policies. in greece, new situation visible effect way government evaluate use external knowledge. the response great challenge radical reform plan in-house, help non-domestic consultants. moreover, political criterion continue weigh policy decisions, contrary obvious need non-partisan solutions. i argue (from personal experience) rare occasion political criterion set aside decision support strong technocratic knowledge, outcome positive policy successful. to conclude: there two main reason behind distrust outside knowledge: first, override importance give “political” oppose “technocratic”. second, partisan nature greek political life polarize opinions, minimize middle ground, exclude consensus degrade expertise, unless partisan. a long attitude persist, outside knowledge marginal role formulation policy decisions. and i really sorry notice tonight nikos theocarakis’ speech mine example partisan politics, since i use finance minister government describe almost colonial partisan speech. he fail though admit “brave” negotiation yanis varoufakis led, lead change name troika institution remove troika ministry hilton, also cost. if assume describe benefits, cost course €86 billion: that third memorandum capital control impose €45 billion deposit outflows. and capital control impose order safeguard financial stability follow “brave” negotiation mr. theocarakis mr. varoufakis. i sorry say that, i obligation put record straight. i believe however even deeply embed belief change pressure extraordinary condition traumatic experience last several year help change attitude past. we already witness gradual convergence political force necessary policy overcome crisis sterile confrontation anti-memorandum pro-memorandum supporter fade out. it therefore reasonable assume that, future, policy increasingly base fact knowledge le preconception ideas. the long negotiation successive greek government european partner imf, year crisis, leave u valuable legacy: analysis facts, technical bi central bankers’ speech 5 expertise accurate forecast indispensable cannot substitute political will. i hope paradigm forgotten, government future see clearly need advantage independent, outside knowledge expertise. bi central bankers’ speech 1 agus d w martowardojo: growth diagnostic indonesia – focus human capital infrastructure keynote speech mr agus d w martowardojo, governor bank indonesia, bank indonesia-asian development bank international seminar “structural reform emerge asia”, jakarta, 23 march 2016. * * * distinguish speakers, seminar participants, lady gentlemen, good morning. 1. it pleasure bank indonesia host international seminar jointly organize asian development bank, i delight welcome event. 2. i find theme seminar “structural reform emerge asia” relevant important u today, global economy still state growth deficit, future path seem look bleak uncertain. 3. i believe seminar provide great opportunity discus structural reform provide breakthrough accelerate growth, make sustainable inclusive. the discussion also good platform share experience implementation structural reform various countries, draw valuable lessons. 4. i also excite know seminar precede technical workshop issue surround similar topic, particularly use growth diagnostic method relevant economic model identify growth bind constraint need policy reforms. lady gentlemen, global indonesia’s recent economic development challenge 5. enter 2016, global economy continue period uncertainty linger since global financial crisis 2008. with global growth decline inflation remain low, another sign ambiguity global economy emerged, divergence economy monetary policy among major economies. 6. pressure financial market begin 2016, middle uncertain bottoming-up oil prices, add concern global growth. conversely, deteriorate macroeconomic outlook worry medium-term vulnerability global economy unsettle financial markets. with financial institution renew pressure, adverse feedback effect finance real economy could become significant. 7. the emerge economy withstand recent global economic turmoil take advantage credit-fuelled growth spillover effect large accommodative monetary policy advance economy. what may happen next recent normalization u monetary policy china’s current economic rebalancing process could heighten pressure emerge economies’ growth financial market. we may simply face period emerge market-originating spillbacks, previous emerge market-receiving spillovers. 8. despite tangible result effort increase resilience external shocks, vulnerability emerge economy remain, due rather weak economic structure. 2 bi central bankers’ speech indonesia’s economy particular, manage pick growth 2015 help increase government consumption good investment infrastructure projects. 9. in meantime, dissipate global economic uncertainty improve confidence indonesia’s economy lead surplus capital financial account last quarter 2015, bolster increase foreign capital inflows, mainly government securities. 10. the confidence indonesia’s economy also contribute stable rupiah upward trend le volatility, foreign exchange reserve still hover well international standards. moreover, low global price amid weaken domestic demand also bring domestic cpi inflation slow down. outlook, risk policy 11. against background maintain stability carefully monitor vulnerabilities, still optimistic domestic economic growth go slightly high 2016, support acceleration infrastructure project fiscal side, increase private investment result government policy package measurable monetary ease maintain macroeconomic stability. 12. inflation expect around 4±1% inflation target, current account deficit project 3% gdp. 13. however, outlook present overshadow risk horizon, external domestic, include another ffr increase expect second half 2016, slowdown chinese economy, continue decline commodity prices, domestically, rise volatile food inflation. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, 14. the recent economic dynamic show u significance impact external economic condition indonesia’s economy, emerge economy general. while indonesia still optimistic toward rise growth, risk weigh down, especially external sector, normally uncontrollable small open economy emerge market general. 15. in juncture, arrive point domestic economic strength need increased, effective way rise growth potential. monetary fiscal policy mainly aim support demand, demand cannot optimize structural problem address well. therefore, i believe timely policymakers emerge economies, indonesia included, focus structural reform boost economic growth sustainable manner. growth dynamic analysis 16. on note, important point reform need differ one country another. history reveal reform package commonly prescribe provide small benefit country try adopt it. on hand, country implement well-focused reform key area accelerate growth. have said, certainly need growth strategy cater domestic opportunity constraints. 17. economist conclude growth acceleration materialize bind constraint growth removed. many country include indonesia, keen interest growth diagnostic approach, aim identify bind constraint economic activity, respective set policy prioritize implement allow accelerate sustainable growth. 18. growth diagnostic method profound use number country well international organization imf, world bank adb bi central bankers’ speech 3 country analysis. a number donor agency also use approach part toolkit formulate operational strategy develop countries. growth diagnostic analysis indonesia 19. bank indonesia also conduct research use growth diagnostic analysis, take account view development priority put emphasis factor-driven aspects, also efficiency-driven innovation-driven areas, combine avoid middle-income trap. 20. bi’s growth diagnostic research unique since take account different characteristic indonesia’s regional economy bring quantify analysis policy response. the result reveal low level return economic activity main factor hind indonesia’s economic growth. 21. further analysis show root problem, bind constraint hind country’s economic growth, area human capital enhancement infrastructure development, particularly relation connectivity logistics. 22. human capital issue indeed classical problem middle income countries. human development certainly important inclusive growth. currently, indonesia period demographic bonus 30 year ahead, period 2015–2045 mark 70% work class total population. 23. however, large population without appropriately large proportion highly skilled educate people would make difficult exit middle income trap. labor force high education crucial shift exist majority labor-intensive/low-technology resource-based industry middle high technology industry. 24. the development human capital would lift productivity level labor force, would turn enhance indonesia’s competitive advantage, important prerequisite excel within current asean economic community era. 25. infrastructure problem also pose indonesia’s major constraint accelerate growth. connectivity issue among regions, include need high quality high capacity harbors, airports, road railway indonesia spur logistical costs. manufacture activity relate export import especially need appropriate harbors, even java region contribute large part national economy. 26. in addition, energy particularly electricity, also become crucial issue serf important prerequisite domestic industry’s development. a reliable adequate supply electricity would attract investors’ interest build manufacture facility indonesia. the increase foreign direct investment enhance indonesia’s role within global value chain. 27. policy simulation growth diagnostic research indicate importance resolve human capital infrastructure issue growth acceleration process. bank indonesia find modest increase electricity capacity human development enhance growth around 0.25% per year, enhancement quality human capital contribute increase employment around 0.50%. lady gentlemen, policy priority 28. to address exist challenges, i believe come common understand reform improve economic structure underline properly implemented. cyclical policy monetary fiscal domain remain indispensable indeed, sufficient respond short term recurrent symptoms. 4 bi central bankers’ speech 29. thus far, bank indonesia’s monetary macroprudential policy among key factor safeguard macroeconomic stability, support structural reform pursue central regional government. 30. bank indonesia low bi rate primary reserve requirement available room ease monetary policy become apparent back solid macroeconomic stability, include low inflationary pressure go forward. however, stability remain priority. 31. in regards, bank indonesia also continue strengthen coordination government. in addition, cooperate harmony authority indonesia financial service authority (ojk), bank indonesia also strive maintain financial stability, together macroeconomic stability, provide strong grind country’s accelerate sustainable growth. 32. the need structural reform target address bind constraints. for indonesia particular, may include build education facilities, provide highly competent teach resources, well increase fund education government private sector. 33. to address infrastructure problem, provide sufficient land power plants, improve business climate investment infrastructure, enhance regional tax collection, well public private partnership raise fund infrastructure project become priority policy implement. lady gentlemen, go forward 34. let reiterate good balance monetary policy, fiscal policy structural reform altogether bring policy mix take country many step forward toward fast sustainable growth. lesson country successful implement structural reform boost economic growth china india, especially valuable. 35. let also express special appreciation successful collaboration adb bi produce joint book entitle “growth diagnostic indonesia.” i look forward launch book, i certain provide valuable insight us. 36. a final note, i would like wish pleasant fruitful experience one day seminar. i believe ideas, insights, experience share among international domestic expert well audience session contribute good understand important topic growth diagnostic, bring refresh idea policy formulation priorities. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stephen s poloz: monetary/fiscal policy mix financial stability – medium term still message text the doug purvis memorial lecture mr stephen s poloz, governor bank canada, 50th annual conference canadian economics association university ottawa, ottawa, montreal, 4 june 2016. * * * accompany chart find end speech. the paper benefit greatly assistance stephen murchison, well josé dorich, vadym lepetyuk hanjing xie, perform model simulations. all remain error omission responsibility. summary financial stability risk become topical wake global financial crisis subsequent extend period low interest rates. this paper investigate significance mix monetary fiscal policy financial stability counterfactual simulation three key historical episodes, use bank’s main policy model, totem (terms-of-trade economic model). the paper find intimate relationship monetary/fiscal policy mix dynamic private sector public sector debt accumulation. no attempt make develop criterion policy mix optimization, since clear model simulation appropriate policy mix highly state-dependent. this find point need coherent framework weigh relative financial macroeconomic consequence accumulate public sector versus private sector debt. furthermore, analysis suggest potential benefit ex ante monetary/fiscal policy coordination, canada’s policy framework – monetary fiscal authority jointly agree inflation target enshrine central bank operational independence – represent elegant coordinate mechanism. 1. introduction doug purvis friend mine. i undergraduate degree economics queen’s university 1974 1978 and, fourth year, lucky enough invite take doug’s graduate macro course. doug 30 time, six year senior, already serious stature. for reason, take interest me, undergraduate thesis plan graduate school, stay touch i start work bank canada 1981. needle say, i admire greatly crush pass away 1993. therefore, truly honour ask deliver doug purvis memorial lecture today. it unique opportunity pay homage someone special and, hopefully, offer new insight time. a i begin think i might discus today, i find remember important talk – harold innis lecture – doug give meet canadian economics association 1985 montréal (purvis 1985). i audience day. that lecture title “public sector deficits, international capital movement domestic economy: the medium-term be message.” doug certainly hold fiscal policy effective tool economic stabilization, draw u important caveat – stimulative fiscal policy mean government borrowing, accumulation debt channel would one day important side effect capture macroeconomic model time. a doug showed, cumulative debt dynamic would, time, domestic international consequences. 2 bi central bankers’ speech those important side effect would manifest medium term. many recognize doug’s subtitle, “the medium-term be message,” reference familiar quote, “the medium message,” pen back 1964 canadian philosopher marshall mcluhan, may famous student harold innis. this typical doug – always clever words, way connect broad audience. my hope today something similar doug’s memory, leverage work many others followed. back 1985, doug walk u series theoretical models, mostly extension mundell-fleming model debt-stock effect captured; today, i explore issue use state-of-the-art policy model simulate instructive counterfactuals key episode canadian economic history. of course, i find actually job i dream sit doug’s macro class 38 year ago. i’m quite sure doug would never forecast that. in fact, rather hop i would land academia. but central banker, would unusual give lecture fiscal policy per se. in fact, i focus implication alternative mix monetary policy fiscal policy public sector private sector debt, financial stability. the concept monetary/fiscal policy “mix” precise. for one thing, measure shift policy stance require definition neutral, particularly uncertain case monetary policy. further, change nominal interest rate reasonable proxy change stance monetary policy, change fiscal balance fiscal policy, variable highly endogenous rest economy. for example, government may set balance fiscal policy ex ante, unexpected weaken economy, fiscal balance turn negative, would interpret ex post expansionary fiscal policy never intention. in sense, mix monetary fiscal policy ex post partly matter plan prior choice. in follows, therefore, i use term “policy mix” understand truly control variable, although course possible monetary fiscal authority exercise degree coordination policy mix ex ante, even make clear intend do. meanwhile, financial stability issue become top mind since global financial crisis 2007–08 persistently low interest rate blame various financial imbalances, include rise household debt hot house markets. indeed, experience spawn new literature best incorporate financial stability risk monetary policy decision make (e.g., poloz 2014). i argue – illustrate concrete example – issue financial stability monetary/fiscal policy mix intimately related. i begin remind important policy history bring u present day, i think issue doug love debate remain highly relevant. 2. some history to fix ideas, worth spend moment describe policy set doug find mid-1980s. in fact, good start narrative bite earlier. when i doug’s student 1977, inflation perceive paramount macroeconomic problem since fluctuate 8 12 per cent range (chart 1). the bank canada deploy target growth money supply mean reduce inflation time. experiment wage price control deliver much. by 1980, break inflation trend would take hike interest rate around 20 per cent – first chairman u federal reserve time, paul volcker, follow bank canada governor gerald bouey. after severe recession 1981–82, inflation fell 4–5 per cent range remain next decade so. real interest rate stay elevate throughout 1980–95 period (chart 2). bi central bankers’ speech 3 give array developments, fiscal deficit balloon run-up doug’s innis lecture 1985 (chart 3). the 1970s witness persistent fiscal deficit 2 5 per cent gdp, deficit expand 1981–82 recession continue widen even recovery gain traction, hit 8 per cent gdp 1984. doug’s message implication deficit debt accumulation would someday matter. a happens, deficit begin shrink 1985, would take full 10 year budget balance achieved. a consequence, stock fiscal debt continue build period (chart 4). the macroeconomic situation make even difficult significant decline canada’s term trade (the ratio export price import prices) 1984–87 period, drive mainly significant drop global oil price (chart 5), make process fiscal consolidation doubly challenging. a fiscal debt ratio rise mid-1980s early 1990s, consternation global financial market also grew. in 1994–95, federal debt share gdp reach peak 67 per cent. today, government debt ratio sound high certainly catastrophic. importantly, though, real interest rate much high mid-1990s, make relative burden service debt much great today’s rates. in case, market come look negatively canadian sovereign debt, even describe weaken canadian dollar “the northern peso” early 1995 (chart 6). both monetary fiscal policy-makers respond sour investor sentiment renew urgency. the bank canada commit inflation target 1991, interest rate decline path, along inflation. however, interest rate increase 1994–95, despite slow economy cause part weak oil prices; extent, interest rate rise market perceive associate exchange rate depreciation would loop back inflation pressures, force bank tighten policy eventually. with benefit hindsight, likely market dynamic reflect fact domestic inflation expectation yet become anchor bank’s new inflation-targeting policy, turn make difficult keep one-time relative price effect inflation distinct underlie trend inflation. this sharp contrast recent experience, well-anchored inflation expectation enable bank “look through” temporary increase inflation cause weak currency actually cut interest rate cushion blow economy fall oil prices. meanwhile, fiscal policy tighten sufficiently generate surplus, fiscal debt share gdp begin long decline would interrupt global financial crisis ensue global recession. a consequence, federal government debt share gdp around half peak mid-1990s. accordingly, risk oversimplification, characterize history canada’s monetary/fiscal policy mix follows. when doug prepare innis lecture, tight monetary policy easy fiscal policy. over follow 10 years, fiscal policy gradually tightened, monetary policy take trend account pursue inflation targets. then, late-1990s global financial crisis, fiscal surplus generally norm, monetary policy remain focus keep inflation close target. in aftermath global financial crisis, course, g20 country undertake coordinate fiscal easing, many ease monetary policy well. start 2010, however, bad effect crisis behind us, canada’s fiscal policy gradually move back consolidation mode. even so, legacy effect financial crisis linger many countries, canada’s export recovery halt best. accordingly, monetary policy remain easy order keep inflation near target. thus, broad strokes, 30 years, canada’s policy mix move tight monetary/easy fiscal neutral/neutral easy monetary/tight fiscal, fiscal adjustment make 2016, time writing. 4 bi central bankers’ speech this quick historical sketch raise obvious question mix monetary fiscal policy consequence debt dynamics, government private sector. intuitively, tight monetary/easy fiscal policy mix mean relatively slow accumulation private sector debt relatively rapid accumulation fiscal debt; easy monetary/tight fiscal policy mix would deliver opposite dynamic. either dynamic eventually give rise financial stability risks, case rise government debt mid-1990s rise household imbalance past years. in follow sections, explore linkage great depth. 3. some counterfactuals in section, use bank canada’s core policy model, totem (terms-of-trade economic model) investigate significance policy mix key macroeconomic episodes. totem large-scale, multi-sector, dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium (dsge) model reflect consensus view key macroeconomic linkage canadian economy (murchison rennison 2006; dorich et al. 2013). in particular, totem capture stock-flow dynamic government debt household wealth (and therefore debt) preoccupy doug purvis. totem represent 30 year research effort, begin (not coincidentally) time doug begin work issues. totem essentially grandchild sam (small annual model) (rose selody 1985), develop mid-1980s. sam incorporate first time fully articulate household government debt dynamics, endogenous potential output model-consistent (i.e., rational) inflation expectations. sam late make quarterly elaborate number respect produce qpm (quarterly projection model) (black et al. 1994; armstrong et al. 1995), bank’s projection model mid-1990s mid-2000s. a name suggests, totem first model kind fully develop commodity sector capture economic financial interaction term trade. this investment model pay 2015, bank able reach early understand plunge global oil price take place late 2014 early 2015. i doubt doug would enjoy use totem explore issue monetary/fiscal policy mix canada. although preference gain insight tractable theoretical models, literature progress elaborate model mainly go numerical. in follows, seek insight examine alternative scenario know macroeconomic episode construct use totem. 3.1 counterfactual 1: purvis’s 1985 warn heed immediately a discuss above, doug express considerable concern 1985 medium-term debt implication fiscal policy place time. although budget deficit begin slow decline around time, effort really become aggressive emergence international financial market pressure 1994–95. a note earlier, headwind decline oil price pose significant challenge fiscal policy 1980s. accordingly, first counterfactual, ask implication economy might doug’s warn heed immediately, federal deficit bring balance five year 1985 1990, five year early actually occurred. the historical counterfactual budget deficit show chart 7, along number simulation results. in totem simulation, monetary policy model use reaction function estimate historical data aim keep inflation therefore aggregate demand (or real gdp) close actual historical paths. since neither fiscal monetary policy model truly optimal, abstract possibility different policy might offer different, potentially superior, set macroeconomic bi central bankers’ speech 5 outcomes. we also abstract key monetary policy issue time, namely, lack well-defined policy target, inflation target formally introduce 1991. totem build credible inflation target mixture rule thumb rational expectations. despite caveats, simulation instructive. the shock analyze series cut government spend begin 1985 bring federal budget balance 1990 hold there. notice that, give importance debt service federal spend time, would mean significant surplus 4 5 per cent gdp measure primary term (i.e., net interest payments). obviously, since base counterfactuals actual history, start point matter simulations. accord model, assumption aggressive fiscal consolidation, federal debt would peak 50 per cent gdp 1986–89, instead around 67 per cent 1995. indeed, federal debt would decline next several years, fall high 30 percentage gdp, 30 percentage point low actually occurred. under tight fiscal scenario, interest rate would low 1 2 percentage points, since monetary policy would cushion economy downside shock low fiscal spending. this low interest rate profile would significant impact canadian dollar, would low much 8 cent us. the currency would peak around 80 cent u (measured annual average terms), compare actual peak 87 cent u average 1991. canadian household would respond low interest rate environment purchase durable good house therefore borrow more. household debt would high 1995, 3 per cent gdp. clearly, le government demand economy, would private sector activity, include consumption spending, house construction and, give low canadian dollar, exports. what counterfactual illustrate shift policy mix along line suggest doug 1985 would predictable implication canadian economy. notice, however, low trajectory government debt would mirror image, albeit modest scope, household debt. thus, even modest experiment, clear stock fiscal debt household debt interrelated. a desirability one policy mix another, hindsight always 20:20 discussion would little mean here. the canadian economy go challenge period – recover trauma high interest rates, fall oil price unanchored inflation expectation – monetary policy fiscal policy try achieve important objectives. here, subsequent sections, refrain evaluate pro con alternative policy mixes. 3.2 counterfactual 2: fiscal policy primary structural balance 2000 have examine interest fairly arbitrary counterfactual adjustment fiscal policy late-1980s, turn rigorous experiment around policy mix. in remain counterfactuals, hold fiscal policy balance (moving primary structural fiscal balance zero) allow monetary policy adjust produce level economic activity observe historical data. the primary structural fiscal balance (chart 8) estimate adjust budgetary component revenue spend account effect output gap trading-gain gap, estimate bank canada (see pichette et al. [2015] information output gap barnett matier [2010] information trading-gain gap). this approach similar one use parliamentary budget officer (barnett matier 2010). have estimate primary structural balance, add fiscal spend shock model force definition fiscal balance zero constrain real gdp follow original historical path 6 bi central bankers’ speech correspond adjustment path short-term interest rates. this allow u investigate policy issue purely term monetary/fiscal mix. the simulation summarize chart 9. because government run persistent fiscal surplus prior global financial crisis, counterfactual would imply considerably easy fiscal policy 2000–07 period, additional fiscal spend 3 4 per cent gdp primary term years. federal debt would rise steadily throughout 15-year period, include sharp rise great recession 2008–10. by 2015, federal debt would around 70 per cent gdp still rise – high level one prompt market angst mid-1990s. clearly, therefore, counterfactual simulation could test limit policy mix flexibility. indeed, policy might prove technically unsustainable, give start point. monetary policy scenario would much tight easy fiscal policy profile central bank would work achieve path real gdp occur history, despite much high government spending. in words, monetary policy would work offset fiscal stimulus. short-term interest rate would fluctuate 5 10 per cent period, except aftermath global financial crisis rate would fall low around 2 per cent. but rate still would rise around 7 per cent 2012–15. not surprisingly, canadian dollar would much strong scenario. already push toward parity steady rise price oil commodity 2002–12, dollar would average 6 cent u high actual historical level would average around 10 cent high 2012–15. this would mean even long-term damage export sector even laborious recovery global financial crisis. clearly, alternative scenario strain credibility various ways, objective derive preferable policy path rather consider implication shift policy mix debt financial stability. while federal government would rack historically high stock debt fiscal assumption counterfactual, canadian household would opposite. by 2015, household debt share gdp would 20 percentage point low today, government debt would nearly 40 percentage point higher. notice 1:1 inverse relationship debt stock public private sectors. this reflect empirical find household indebtedness modestly influence monetary policy, characteristic embed simulations. it also reflect overall impact monetary policy real gdp, extend well beyond influence household borrowing. the trade-off two debt stock highly dependent array shock hit economy point time. 3.3 counterfactual 3: fiscal policy primary structural balance 2011 our third counterfactual scenario look post-crisis period. after significant ease monetary fiscal policy 2008 2010 across g20, fairly synchronize return toward neutral tight fiscal policy next couple years. monetary policy remain easy many countries, particularly advance economies, case ease recovery faltered. this give rise debate around monetary/fiscal mix – essentially ask would happen fiscal policy remain easy longer. in particular, issue rise household imbalance associate risk financial stability come fore. accordingly, use totem conduct simulation primary structural fiscal balance constrain zero, start 2011. the result show chart 10. because canada’s primary structural fiscal balance actually move surplus 2011 rise 2 per bi central bankers’ speech 7 cent gdp 2015 (chart 8), counterfactual would entail rise fiscal spend persistent fiscal deficit 2011–15 period. by 2015, federal debt would rise 6 per cent gdp, 37 per cent. to therefore achieve level real output, monetary policy would somewhat tighter, interest rate fluctuate around 2 3 per cent instead around 1 per cent, actually happened. the canadian dollar would strong well, 3 cent us, average. it would fair argue that, context soft economy, monetary policy might tighten scenario describes, especially since 2012 2013 core inflation around 1 per cent, 1 percentage point target. by force model replicate historical gdp performance, monetary policy would necessarily tight would clearly offset effect increase fiscal spend counterfactual – unlikely outcome, give situation. with high profile interest rates, household debt would low actually 2015, 7 per cent disposable income, 5 per cent gdp. notice trade-off private sector debt fiscal debt short simulation close 1:1. even financial vulnerability associate household debt low throughout period, would still begin rise again, begin 2014. thus, although counterfactual shift policy mix would mitigate financial stability risks, would still figure prominently monetary policy deliberation 2015. 4. the appropriate policy mix depend state economy these counterfactual simulation offer practitioner’s glimpse difficult problem – define guide monetary/fiscal policy mix that, optimal ex ante, least work well average ex post. the literature subject employ increasingly complex dsge model (see, example, gnocchi lambertini 2016). despite complexities, model remain far simple sort elaborate model policy-maker generally rely on, totem. thus, one learn much conclusion reach date. a key find literature relate monetary policy’s “commitment,” or, common parlance, inflation targets. in model government debt, high level debt, incentive government create surprise inflation, surprise inflation erode real value outstanding debt reduce need future taxation. such inflation surprises, course, erode value private sector save and, time, lead de-anchoring inflation expectations. clearly, inflation target commit central bank (and, case canada, agree jointly federal government) help offset incentive. accordingly, model inflation commitment tend predict low stock government debt. a well, credible inflation commitment give monetary fiscal policy ability offset macroeconomic fluctuations. because inflation stability emerge economy sustainably full capacity, coordination problem monetary fiscal policy highly simplify joint commitment inflation targets. where issue monetary/fiscal policy mix come fore economy far equilibrium, persistently so. a saw simulations, start point matter, persistent disequilibrium give rise accumulate debt stock either public sector private sector, both. a well known, so-called ricardian effect likely become increasingly apparent private sector debt rise – household know full well pay money back someday, accumulate debt ad infinitum. there every reason expect similar reaction high rise public sector debt: since household know someday pay high tax cover debt government incurring, might respond increase government spend increase save today and, doing, partially offset government’s stimulus efforts. 8 bi central bankers’ speech this suggest meaningful trade-off policy space medium-term consequence debt monetary fiscal policies. an easy monetary/tight fiscal policy mix lead high private sector debt low public sector debt, thing equal. similarly, tight monetary/easy fiscal policy mix lead low private sector debt high public sector debt. in effect, give macroeconomic situation, policy-makers ability choose dynamic two debt stock – can’t influence two debt stock independently, policy choice simultaneous implication variables. what lack time coherent framework weigh relative macroeconomic consequence private sector debt versus public sector debt. for give economic situation, combination public sector debt private sector debt represent best outcome point view financial stability? on counts, trade-off likely extremely complex, highly dependent economic situation therefore likely complicate significantly choice

terms-of-trade shocks. in addition stock debt, enrich model would include dimension financial stability risk, overvalue property stock market prices, feedback element consumer financial intermediaries. a good understand medium-term trade-off private sector versus public sector debt helpful develop strong guidance around monetary/fiscal policy mix. no doubt, next year canada, learn trade-off practical level. 5. conclusion we see lot 30 year since doug purvis give innis lecture. we learn limit much government debt financial market tolerate, doug thoughtfully predicted. we also learn that, unusual circumstances, private sector debt reach level similarly strain tolerance financial markets. these strain inevitably fee back monetary policy deliberations, either real effect economy central bank see danger make financial stability risk bad try lessen macroeconomic risks. central bank actively engage determine best incorporate financial stability concern conduct monetary policy. the analysis present demonstrate intimate connection debt stock embed financial stability issue monetary/fiscal policy mix. objective monetary policy, monetary inflation targets, historically see mainly recipe stay trouble; words, mean manage macroeconomic risk face uncertainty, deliver le uncertain environment economic decision making. while experience show inflation target improve macroeconomic performance, experience global financial crisis aftermath demonstrate well target sufficient prevent trouble. clearly, medium-term consequence must take account formulate monetary policy, certainly presence persistent shock economy. this strongly suggest best mix monetary fiscal policy depend economic situation, derive optimality condition likely serve rough guide. rather, policy coordination around agree goal seem hold promise seek optimality condition. give sanctity central bank independence, narrow form monetary fiscal policy coordination would central bank take fiscal policy account pursue inflation target independently. however, within institutional arrangement enshrine central bank independence, scope ex ante bi central bankers’ speech 9 share information judgment two authorities. after all, inflation target canada agree central bank government. this institutional framework simple yet elegant form monetary fiscal policy coordination may anticipate recent literature (e.g., leeper leith 2016). my guess doug purvis already understand this. certainly, point u right direction 30 year ago. so, i may paraphrase one late friend’s famous lines,

dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank chairman board director bank international settlements, deutsche bundesbank’s third cash symposium, frankfurt main, 13 june 2016. * * * 1. introduction lady gentlemen, good morning warm welcome this, deutsche bundesbank’s third cash symposium. we launch cash symposium platform foster dialogue promote interaction various stakeholder cash space. so give great pleasure today officially open already third cash symposium see quite obviously strong endure demand event kind. and ask me, there’s good place host event frankfurt. this city, all, close tie money, cash coinage, too. and i’m say nearby bank tower bundesbank’s collection coin banknotes, which, incidentally, rank among country’s four large year celebrate centenary – though that’s exactly ripe old age world numismatics. no, lady gentlemen, city frankfurt’s close tie cash also lot choose hold today’s symposium. many already know, i’m sure, bethmannstrasse, street today’s venue situated, name bethmann bank, credit institution establish bethmann brother back 18th century. but few you, i suspect, aware back late 17th century, ancestor bethmann brothers, certain konrad bethmann, employ mintmaster princess von nassau-holzappel today german federal state rhineland-palatinate. the profession mintmaster without doubt reputable one. but even back days, people certainly wit come fill state coffers. the debasement small coin like pfennig groat quite widespread phenomenon, especially era konrad lived. so back then, mintmaster bethmann may well among generally suspect debase coinage – say, “tipping scales”, possibly even employer’s behest. and absolutely honest, aren’t central bankers, too, often widely suspect “tipping scales”? after all, era money make paper, metal value coin le face value, become much cheap manufacture currency. it nip suspicion bud european treaty commit eurosystem objective maintain price stability make independent political influence. the rationale prevent monetary policy subjugate fiscal whim government would keep value money stable. that central bank attach great importance sound government budget fiscal compliance – criterion which, end day, serve override goal shield monetary policy. 2. cash – anchor confidence german sociologist georg simmel write century ago “... money ... perhaps concentrate point form manifestation confidence socio-political organisation order.” money confidence inextricably linked. and confidence currency root cash. that perhaps even true euro 2 bi central bankers’ speech currency since euro cash – common mean payment use throughout euro area – manifest symbol european integration. it’s call card, will, every single european institution, something pass everyone’s hand regular basis. that’s one reason cash hugely important us. and that’s bundesbank set high standard quality cash introduce system. quality price, course – instance, it’s dedication provide sufficient quantity cash consistently meet high quality standards. just two year ago – second cash symposium, fact – professor otmar issing recount how, shortly take office bundesbank 1990, informed, half-jokingly, then-bundesbank president karl otto pöhl bundesbank responsible monetary policy “primarily business engage transport distribute banknotes”. the staff levels, mr pöhl explained, proof that. not much change since regard. cash-related operation endure day labour-intensive five core business areas. say that, number staff involve run bundesbank’s cash operation almost halve past twelve years. and it’s cash pastime bundesbank choose indulge in. it’s field mainly respond general public’s payment habits. and one thing sure: german love cash. although overnight short-term bank deposit nowadays make lion’s share – 90 %, fact – money, still case majority purchase germany settle cash. cash use 80 % transactions, though figure dwindle somewhat. it would slight exaggeration say money save account spend note coins. germany world’s number one country use cash. for one thing, german strong preference cash – indeed, particularly evident one consider customer tend pay petrol stations. not point sale customer pay either card cash country observed; transaction value roughly same, too. but still factor bear whether much people tend pay cash. these include ease access atms, rate interest current accounts, extent retail merchant accept card payments, much effort card provider put boost popularity card payment run market campaign loyalty schemes. many factor also play role relatively strong propensity use cash germany. a case point, retail merchant germany accept debit credit card payments, would undoubtedly drive share cash high payment amount – though i admit bring mind question “what come first: chicken egg?”. even scenario materialise, debit credit card payment would crowd cash payment altogether. contrary might believe, cash isn’t actually particularly expensive form payment. indeed, term cost per transaction, cash payment far cheap debit credit cards. only cost regard share transaction amount cash lose debit cards, credit cards. so there’s certainly nothing unreasonable pay small amount cash use card large purchases. and course, cash tend grow popularity whenever confidence financial sector evaporates. only last summer greece see bank shut door day end long queue form atms. and germany, too, saw popular cash financial crisis, when, wake lehman brother insolvency, bundesbank bi central bankers’ speech 3 issue many €500 euro banknote single month do entire previous year. only euro banknote sole unrestricted legal tender; give general public cast-iron certainty full possession money times, free influence. that’s often say “cash king”. all aspect worth consider current deliberation whether place constraint cash payments. i know full well politician utmost clamp terrorism. but single academic paper i know proves, beyond doubt, restrict use cash really effective mean combat organise crime, tax evasion international terrorism. whereas potential resolution upper limit cash purchase still pending, govern council ecb already take decision €500 note, namely discontinue production. the new series euro banknote therefore long include €500 note. follow adequate transitional period probably last least end 2018, issuance €500 note discontinue well. the time use produce banknotes. this time certainly needed, €500 note account much one-third currency circulate euro area (in term value). what mean that, future, banknote need print order cope rise quantity currency circulation. moreover, i expect €500 banknote return eurosystem fully deposit bank accounts. there initial sign public already begin trade €500 note small denominations. the quantity euro note therefore tend rise overall – along cost manufacture, quality assurance transportation. at least €500 note remain legal tender exchange national central bank indefinite period time. in words, €500 note still circulation recall withdrawn. this mean approach bundesbank always practise prevailed. in view, important point. any action would conducive confidence single currency. moreover, debate abolition €500 note lead govern council ecb come clearly favour cash. this signal especially important current low-interest-rate environment, restriction use cash are, cases, mention breath proposal away cash altogether, would one way make easy broadly push negative deposit rate context even accommodative monetary policy. however, opinion, proposal would wrong entirely disproportionate response monetary policy challenge close zero low bound. the right approach question strengthen growth force euro area way move rate away zero low bind go forward. and there’s another thing i wish express clearly: need loosen monetary policy current environment, either. let explain briefly below. 3. economic activity monetary policy 3.1 economic activity the global economy moderate growth path. though momentum weak expect little half year ago, fear prevail financial market every materialise. however, right see shift dynamic growth. in emerge markets, situation cloud perceptibly begin year, situation stabilise degree. the recessionary tendency plague russia die down, although sustainable recovery yet sight. in china, growth prospect repeatedly require downward revision past. the shift growth see thus far, though, consistent china’s transition services- 4 bi central bankers’ speech oriented, domestically drive economic model; look way, cause anxiety. and country derive large proportion value add commodity export likely benefit late recovery commodity prices, especially significant increase oil prices. by contrast, unite state unite kingdom recently saw slight deceleration growth, u growth curb oil industry delay investment, amongst factors. private consumption also weak side countries. on hand, euro area get good start 2016. gross domestic product grow healthy 0.6 % quarter. lively domestic demand, benefit low oil price accommodative monetary policy, pillar upturn. however, another decisive factor surprisingly mild weather start year, boosted, all, construction sector. the strong first-quarter growth therefore extrapolate year whole. on aggregate, euro-area economy’s growth path still tepid present. the late eurosystem staff projection euro-area economy grow 1.6 % year, 1.7 % growth assume come two years. economic growth germany look relatively similar, even though situation – seen, instance, term capacity utilisation labour market indicator – significantly good rest euro area. our country did, all, post respectable first-quarter growth 0.7 %. however, even germany, aggregate economic growth peter somewhat year progresses. bundesbank economist expect growth 1.7 % year. owe difficult external environment, growth project decelerate temporarily 1.4 % 2017 climb back 1.6 % 2018. 3.2 monetary policy for u central bankers, macroeconomic analysis is, course, end itself. after all, mandate steer economy instead maintain price stability. economic growth, however, one determinant enterprises’ capacity utilisation scope raise prices. it also indicate much leeway wage bargainer wage negotiations. inflation rate low time many currency areas, euro area exception. here, inflation even negative territory; may, price 0.1 % year. in past two years, mainly sharp fall commodity prices, particularly oil prices, push inflation down. however, impact change oil price automatically wash inflation rate time. and recent rise oil price help speed process somewhat. however, low inflation rate euro area outcome fall oil prices. core inflation, i.e. price index adjust exclude energy food prices, likewise relatively low. the mute domestic price pressure measure manner also show euro-area economy recover gradually unemployment level country still high. see euro-area economic recovery tepid, eurosystem projection foresee gradual increase inflation 1.3 % next year 1.6 % 2018. in view mute price outlook, accommodative monetary policy appropriate present, though reasonable people disagree specific design non-standard measures. there one thing i would like stress, though: our definition price stability require target inflation rate achieve medium term. this give u enough time see adopt monetary policy measure impact price movements, especially since, i point time again, eurosystem still something novice come apply non-standard monetary policy, risk side-effects ultra-accommodative monetary policy grow time. bi central bankers’ speech 5 4. conclusion lady gentlemen, i cover wide range themes: cash confidence currency monetary policy. however, i wish unduly tax attention span, for, say goes, good speaker talk anything – long it’s 20 minute less. you still excite programme ahead today. i hope enjoy interest talk we’ve line stimulate exchange views. thank much! bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: structural reform way complete economic monetary union speech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, international conference structural reform advance economies, hertie school governance, berlin, 17 june 2016. * * * the footnote find end speech. introduction many people would like central banker remain quiet need structural reforms. in end, clear narrow mandate define price stability[1]. and undergraduate-level economics learn inflation long run always everywhere monetary phenomenon. so bother? and we, unelected policymakers, venture policy debate obviously shape political considerations? i agree central banker tread cautiously economic policy areas. but monetary policy, particularly monetary union, operate vacuum. although central banker take decision independently, also take account party doing. a i already say elsewhere, monetary policy independent interdependent.[2] in respect, least three reason central banker cannot indifferent structural reforms. first, combination low potential growth debt overhang inherit crisis threaten european social contract, contract establish post-war era fair affordable time[3]. this turn threat sustainability social market economy, environment monetary policy operates. second, factor reallocation time across sector necessary order adjust shock therefore key smooth transmission monetary policy. and third, convergence economy economic political prerequisite well-functioning monetary union. i argue today structural reform successfully lift potential growth monetary union, fulfil two important criteria: (i) need comprehensive well sequence (ii) all-encompassing. “comprehensive” mean narrow focus labour market reform sufficient. structural reform also incentivising innovation, competition fight rent-seeking monopolistic structures. they entail offer new income chance – particularly young generation – reduce redistribute rents, encourage economic player adjust.[4] “all-encompassing” mean reform cannot focus address inefficiency member states, take account externality inefficiency level union. this imply reform area economic governance, progress complete single market. and form basis good function economic monetary union. why need structural reforms? potential output growth euro area, advance economies, steady downwards trajectory several decades. there however thing make situation even problematic large economies. first, decline trend growth go much in, instance, us: european commission estimate potential output growth euro area 1% year, half 2 bi central bankers’ speech equivalent figure us. in contrast, difference 1992 small: euro area potential output growth estimate 2.6%, compare 2.8% us.[5] although already serious problem itself[6], close examination composition potential output uncover full extent problem. total factor productivity u consistently outperform euro area last 15 year expect continue also come decade[7]. in words, use paul krugman’s famous words, euro area trend growth risk become product “perspiration rather inspiration”[8]. there two issue associate observation. first, know growth literature, input-based growth risk incur diminish returns. second, imperfect monetary union, raise question input allocated. indeed, come allocate capital, still make bad job allocate utilise exist resources[9]. the high-risk project high expect returns, would like see give boost potential growth, difficult finance part world. this mainly europe’s bias towards bank debt finance oppose equity[10], persistent fragmentation financial systems, mention high administrative burdens[11]. and reallocation labour hamper rigidity national labour market well obstacle cross-border labour mobility, lack transferability social rights, language barrier cultural differences. and even firm sufficient access capital, seem innovative enough also fully exploit new technology work methods[12]. there also several reason secular decline europe’s growth. consider demographic “handicap”. over next 15 years, work age population actually shrink substantially best plateau almost euro area countries. bad yet, period, innovative segment population[13] contract even more. let give data this: accord european commission’s age work group[14], population 26 50 – several study identify innovative – shrink 12% germany, 2% france, 11% italy whop 29% spain. not share young people decline euro area, unfortunately, despite best-educated generation ever, trouble enter labour market. youth unemployment exceed overall unemployment country whole area difference stagger 12 percentage points. this already harm economy, young will work unable find job prevent develop skills. to avoid create “lost generation” need act quickly. the young generation also drag high level debt set inherit. a combination negative demographics, weak productivity growth, poorly function labour market steep increase public private sector debt burden mean dwindle number young people society carry increasingly heavy financial burden[15]. this limit ability entrepreneurial, innovate compete international markets. the good news lot do improve gloomy outlook[16]. today, i won’t talk much fiscal reforms, policy initiative could improve demographic outlook, i instead focus reform could boost medium- long-term growth employment. comprehensive well-sequenced reform when look range oecd structural indicators, clear euro area country well league table best international practice one several policy areas. measure oecd’s top three performers, euro area lag far behind product labour market efficiency, euro area country top three large euro area country often underperform euro area average[17]. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in recent year see number important reforms, particularly country carry economic adjustment programmes. the main focus reform labour market. the nominal real labour market rigidity traditionally live europe result call “european unemployment disease”: persistently high unemployment rate limit ability adjust economic shocks. you get tell picture plot unemployment rate euro area u several decade – say, 1970s. every time downturn economic activity, unemployment rate go regions. however, whereas u quickly readjust economy pick up, euro area take much long unemployment rate actually start fall almost never seem return previous low. the end result euro area unemployment rise steadily 40 years.[18] that said, solid theoretical empirical evidence show great flexibility result much low equilibrium unemployment rates[19]. it therefore welcome labour market reform recently implement several country rigidity consider particularly onerous, spain[20], italy, portugal greece, germany too, year ago. france still lag behind although labour market reform discussed, whether sufficiently ambitious significantly low equilibrium unemployment rate remain seen. although increase flexibility labour market produce good outcome medium term, reform may create loser short term[21]. it natural reform oppose fear short-term personal losses, even reform eventually beneficial society whole. we take concern seriously. there policies, however, help mitigate compensate negative short-term effects. first, labour market reform sequence carefully, way negative short-term effect employment ideally felt recovery gain momentum. this could practice mean employment protection liberalise reform increase nominal wage flexibility carry out. this quick effect reduce unemployment even shortly implementation[22]. second, active labour market policy help reallocate worker across sector economy adjustment take place. third, expansionary fiscal monetary policy also dampen negative short-term impact labour market reforms. the current low interest rate environment mildly expansionary fiscal stance aggregate euro area provide good opportunity government minimise short-run cost labour market reforms. finally, reform area economy compensate short-term loss disposable income household might suffer bad times[23]. indeed, right sequence point often made: implement product service market reform well labour market reforms, hold back latter[24]. the underlie reason partly short-term negative macroeconomic effect much great liberalisation of, say, employment protection lead spike unemployment product market reform decrease excessive rent margins, immediate benefit consumers. another argument make product market reform prioritise since boost output regardless overall economic situation, weigh public finances. why see exactly opposite sequence euro area country go significant reform recent years, is, labour market reform product service market reforms? it’s because, unlike labour market, change often produce major results, product service market reform practice make huge array small reforms. moreover, many product service sector represent powerful lobby group vest interest sometimes conflict interest consumer society whole. the greek programme one example; authority face strong resistance pressure groups[25]. i absolutely doubt one 4 bi central bankers’ speech would meet similar obstacle reforming, say, german french product service markets. in fact, country oppose wide service sector reform european level. and germany one country realise small share potential benefit service directive accord european commission[26]. strengthen single market governance if view euro area single economy sum 19 national members, must common growth strategy base identify structural weaknesses. the key word must view “productivity” “employment”, positive-sum game – “competitiveness”, could end zero-sum game. the member state lend much support euro area growth merely compete neighbours’ market shares. we act together raise productivity employment. improve function service market euro area therefore important large share overall gross value added, 65% average euro area, also 75% total labour force employ sector. even though steady shift towards service production, still lag behind advance economy u and, less extent, japan, high production service per capita. in particular, strike service sector output per caput (in ppp terms) 33% high u euro area, main reason small difference overall gdp per caput level (26%)[27]. to large extent due old-fashioned restriction prevent competition many country euro area. the european commission estimate ambitious implementation 2006 service directive would potential increase euro area gdp around 2.5%. the late estimate show around 0.8 percentage point realise – ten year directive enter force. also, bear mind figure significantly underestimate gain wide service market reform, give important sector – instance health care – completely exclude directive. another factor service sometimes overlook scale. in today’s fragment service market europe, insufficient pool resource drive large-scale r&d initiatives, new distribution platform increase competition market participants. we therefore need take step back consider do complete european single market services. to give example, original idea apply so-called country origin principle reconsidered. this would mean regulation export country applied. the benefit change straightforward: first, become easy service provider long deal regulation 28 country export across union. second, would incentivise country put place efficient well-functioning legislation. in addition, single market service expand additional sectors: is, instance, good economic reason exclude health care. a i say earlier, reform also improve economic governance. when first european semester launch january 2011, mark sea change economic governance euro area. with new tool, europe recognise ex ante coordination economic policy – fiscal policy – european level necessary. late year, macroeconomic imbalance procedure (mip) strengthen european semester further. for euro area, corrective arm mip even foresee sanction case non-compliance. the european semester mip powerful tool doubt make euro area stronger. yet – five year late – admit sun shine everywhere. the implementation record country-specific recommendation (csrs) high start decline recently. in 2015 4% csrs fully implemented, 7% 2014. in country excessive economic imbalance bi central bankers’ speech 5 persist could harm member states. more do improve national implementation i see lot merit imf's proposal csrs link outcome-based benchmark concrete, measurable, clearly link ultimate reform objective[28]. the dismal implementation record csrs nevertheless suggest governance framework envisage european economic policy priority legitimise implement national level limits. look forward, need engage process european level, base share institutions, provide economic resilience appropriate legitimacy. in process, consensus would need (i) policy area crucial preserve resilience euro area, (ii) designate policy area share competence democratic legitimisation european level. and i say before, get require economic political convergence. the success single market one uncontroversial achievement eu. it show share competence use implement economic policy lead great prosperity country and, time, ensure great resilience euro area eu whole. we build want make progress. conclusion it sometimes argue current expansionary monetary policy discourage government undertake necessary structural reform euro area. but beg question: weren’t reform carry interest rate higher? we stop search reason structural reform

economic governance growth performance eurozone? presentation mr françois villeroy de galhau, governor bank france, german institute economic research – diw berlin, berlin, 8 june 2016. * * * i delight opportunity, kindly offer diw, share remark europe berlin. a may know, i strong tie germany. in particular, i completely share german culture importance responsibility long-term vision. at juncture probably agree two thing – focus today two thing closely intertwined: • monetary policy cannot game town. • although monetary union success, economic union remain built. i want pay tribute helmut schmidt, say october 2011: “there failure set economic rule game currency union. a powerful authority responsibility fiscal economic policy set up.”1 i first argue monetary policy fair share (i). i discus need “full coordination” national economic policy euro area, discus concrete progress make (ii). finally, turn private risk-sharing eurozone, i focus importance build efficient finance investment union (iii). i. monetary policy duty, already do lot i well aware recent monetary policy decision govern council hotly debate germany. the expression criticism reflects, minimum, need explain monetary policy decision better. however, i’d like argue recent monetary policy decision much line principle stability german culture incarnate well. let elaborate three principles. first, independence. the divergent inflation performance major industrialize economy collapse bretton wood system profound effect subsequent conduct central banks. on practical side, germany see navigate so-called stagflation episode 1970s considerably good others. the bundesbank role model independence central banks. second, clear mandate price stability. the eurosystem build foundation enshrine maastricht treaty. we also adopted, early 2003, transparent quantitative definition price stability inflation rate close 2% medium term – close present definition u fed, boe boj: nothing new specific ecb. from 1999 2011, hicp inflation rate average 2% euro area, remarkably consistent objective. 1 helmut schmidt; remark farewell event ecb president jean-claude trichet; october 19, 2011. 2 bi central bankers’ speech but since then, eurosystem struggle match performance. inflation well 2% 3 year – exactly phenomenon germany – fall cannot explain completely decline oil prices. at time, inflation expectation gradually drift last three years. our mandate impose duty react, order protect eurozone economy – include german one – lethal danger deflation. third, patience within medium long-term perspective. in volatile world live in, policy reaction result short-term economic fluctuations, market overreactions, medium headline poll results. our credibility also symmetric. if tolerate long deviation inflation 2% now, risk future, inflation wander 2%, determination bring back close 2% lack credibility. a romer romer, two u monetary economists, forcefully argue recent paper2, dangerous idea central banker indulge idea monetary policy little shift output gap, negative positive. in retrospect, sound evidence great depression 30’s great inflation 70’s sustain belief. credibility anchor inflation expectation require give credit past “toothpaste” view monetary policy – contractionary policy cannot fight inflation – symmetrically current “string” view monetary policy – whereby accommodative policy cannot fight deflation. so, result judge medium term. we fifteen month real start qe eurozone already see positive effects. accord eurosystem staff assessments, without app (asset purchase program) inflation would negative 2015, half percentage point low 2016, around half percentage point low 2017. if pursue program, expect road? the u federal reserve show u way, take series important step increase monetary stimulus even bring policy interest rate zero. the feed issue forward 2 c. romer d. romer “the most dangerous idea federal reserve history: monetary policy doesn’t matter” american economic review: paper & proceed 2013, 103(3): 55–60. bi central bankers’ speech 3 guidance signal protract period low interest rate begin qe. the u logically lead way first epicenter great recession. the u qe begin november 2008 core inflation troughed october 2010. unemployment steadily fall since inflation rate return towards 2%, federal reserve’s inflation target. only could fomc stop increase balance sheet, raise federal fund rate floor initiate exit strategy. obviously we, eurozone, point business cycle travel along road monetary policy. some consider unconventional policy euro area counterproductive ultra-low interest rate hurt saver banks. however, monitor closely banks’ profitability – take account all element monetary policy 4 bi central bankers’ speech – 2015 evidence harm overall. moreover, global long-term real rate interest fall around 30 year reflect imbalance strong desire save relative scarcity will borrow invest. a know, imbalance extremely acute germany surplus order 8 % german gdp. above all, cannot base decision outcome particular group common good. economic activity depend saver also entrepreneurs, workers, homebuyers borrower benefit low interest rates. eventually, policy lead level inflation consistent mandate call high interest rate nominal real terms. in order sustainably high interest rate tomorrow, must low today. that said, unconventional instrument legitimate. there limit negative interest rate go, mario draghi stress it. so type unconventional measure, although useful, use care. and i think so-called “helicopter money” would bring harm good: need table. the real issue monetary policy cannot everything. we do bite cannot create last economic growth underpin prosperity, include savers. for need policy maker act. at time euro area experience negative output gap large external surplus – i.e. excess save investment, must reflect abundant european save could put productive use investment europe. this need foster extensive private risk-sharing eurozone, require integrate finance investment framework. a so-called fratzscher report increase investment germany put it: “the key sustainable recovery europe lie fast growth must bolster first foremost joint investment modernization campaign “. i come issue. but also need achieve good coordination public policies. to effect, need think concrete role euro area finance minister could play. abundantsavingsin euro areacurrentaccountbalance(% gdp)source : eurostat, banque de france-10,0-7,5-5,0-2,50,02,55,07,510,0-10,0-7,5-5,0-2,50,02,55,07,510,020012003200520072009201120132015spainfranceitalygermanyeuro area bi central bankers’ speech 5 ii. why need “full coordination” institution euro area, embody finance minister clearly, monetary policy cannot substitute economic policy coordination lack reforms. if reason central banker need take part debate, although take action obviously remain decision political leaders. this focus eurozone economic governance coordination. we know deep political resistance share fiscal resource sovereignty, well rise euroscepticism. this need make economic case. this discussion “more brussels”, concretely growth job europe. the euro crisis reveal unprepared were. the absence coordination indeed genuine economic cost. several approach point significant cost non-coordination, order 2 5 % gdp since crisis, therefore million jobs. to bring debate forward, principled choice made. first: make parallel progress domestic reform and, [not “or”], european coordination. this cornerstone of, instance, french-german agreement: fair, french call germany support coordination, german doubt french reforms, still well-founded. this require overcome distrust country bring together aspect umbrella, namely common institution. second, must recognize institution mandate superior rule without institutions, underline mario draghi discuss fundamental difference monetary policy institution fiscal rules. to bolster policy consistency coordination, admittedly need simple rules. but support strong institution discretionary powers. third, room intermediate level integration, show simple illustrative matrix: 6 bi central bankers’ speech i would call “full coordination national policies”, presently miss link integration, monetary policy decision-making, rule-based surveillance, currently case national fiscal policy europe clearly lack teeth. and i don’t think ready fully-fledged fiscal union common fiscal capacity great mutual trust requires. in addition completion bank union, need part emu reform set strong institution fully coordinate national fiscal structural policies. it would help make euro area sum parts. jean monnet famously declare “nothing possible without men, nothing last without institutions.” the idea finance minister euro area new: marcel fratzscher diw instance recently advocate “a joint finance minister”, aware single currency “requires economic convergence process close coordination economic policy common rules”3. but let specify her/his concrete tasks. i see four them. first, minister would charge prepare euro area-wide collective strategy fulfill sustainable growth mandate collectively agree division task set individual performance target member states. nobody seriously dispute collective strategy involve structural reform country include france, public investment others include germany would make good policy mix sustainable growth employment europe. second, finance minister would responsible supervise implementation collective strategy, use adequate instrument provide symmetric incentives. negative incentive would include exist sanction mechanisms, could broaden contractual procedures, already put forward 2013 franco-german contribution emu, chancellor merkel’s4 “binding reform contracts” proposal. a positive incentive could instance access euro area ”convergence fund”, member state could benefit common funding. third, finance minister would responsible implement centralize crisis management. a finance minister euro area would naturally charge oversee european stability mechanism operations. last, move towards integration, minister could give authority manage euro area convergence fund, progressively evolve towards euro budget. further integration democratic accountability move forward parallel. these institutional change obviously require new treaty. 3 marcel fratzscher, lesson europe german monetary union, diw economic bulletin 27.2015 4 angela merkel’s first parliamentary speech third term, december 18 2013. bi central bankers’ speech 7 first, need legitimacy-enhancing appointment process. the finance minister could thus appoint five-year period european council act qualify majority proposal president eu commission. the new appointment would subject formal approval european parliament, finance minister would member commission, well chair eurogroup. second, euro area finance minister would need back genuine treasury administration. such civil service would also benefit public advice two independent bodies, european fiscal board competitiveness council. last, succeed implement integration, need strong democratic control euro area affairs. to end, need consider euro area format european parliament. relationship euro area mp national parliament also need enhanced. a i said, need good coordinate public policies, also foster private risk-sharing throughout eurozone. to recall wolfgang schaüble, european leader need show “that balance budgets, growth investment mutually exclusive, rather go hand-in-hand”5. 5 wolfgang schaüble, “managing europe – what germany’s responsibility?”, speech lse, march 3 2016. alegitimate institution genuine admin. capacitylegitimacy:appointmentprocessand international rolecapacity:treasuryadministration advisorycouncilsaccountability:strongerdemocraticcontrol euro area affair 8 bi central bankers’ speech iii. build efficient finance investment union tomorrow we need improve investment finance eu. our effort direct towards finance growth innovation, towards find right mix debt equity financing, still preserve financial stability consumer protection. in eu, european commission launch investment plan – call juncker plan – capital market union (cmu). until now, initiative show results, enough. a ambitious approach would bring together cmu, bank union juncker plan. this i suggest think finance investment union. it essential clarify two objectives: (i) diversification finance firms, (ii) strengthen euro area. a argue joint article jens weidmann february, finance investment union – include equity finance – seem best way match abundance save lack appropriate investment financing. first, let’s focus diversification financing. the start point firms’ needs. new finance business investment, one key innovation, must enabled. there all, equity financing. • it essential fact equity share corporate finance europe half large unite states: 52% gdp ea, vs. 121% us. • this unfortunate equity finance best way share risk opportunities, well support innovation. “catch-up” growth, many emerge markets, finance debt. but economy stand technological frontier, u.s. hopefully europe, good finance equity: innovation risky, fund must upside. • the commission’s innobarometer survey suggest fund main barrier promote r&d innovation europe. what actually do? among others, taxation policy could revise favor equity funding. innovative scheme also need develop european level, european venture capital funds, order support creation growth new businesses. furthermore, finance investment union strengthen euro area. short term bank flow rise introduction euro, financial crisis demonstrate capital markets’ channel risk share still underdevelop bi central bankers’ speech 9 euro area. from reality financial fragmentation negative economic consequences, draw one obvious conclusion: equity finance clearly instrument best allow smooth asymmetric shock monetary union. it benefit many (ecb financial integration report 2016): le volatile debt finance enhance companies’ resilience adverse conditions. the integrate u equity market instance cushion 40% state-specific economic shock, company’s profit loss distribute owner us. in euro area, form risk-sharing virtually non-existent. * * * to conclude, let quote robert mundell6, father theory optimal currency areas. he acknowledge euro area far optimal. yet remain confident, saying: “it achieve because, europe, isn’t best game town, it’s game.” economic policy whole, central bank alone, indeed game town. we cannot afford another miss opportunity europe, good citizens, 2016–2017 decisive time act. 6 interview robert mundell laura wallace, « ahead time » , finance development, imf, september 2006, vol 43, n°3. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jerome h powell: recent economic developments, monetary policy consideration longer-term prospect speech mr jerome h powell, member board governor federal reserve system, chicago council global affairs, chicago, illinois, 28 june 2016. * * * the footnote find end speech. thank opportunity speak today. the chicago council global affair think leader nearly century, encourage public discourse, education, research important global issues. the council’s global focus particularly important understand challenge face u.s. economy today, show last week’s referendum unite kingdom’s status european union. in remarks, i review recent economic development outlook economy. i also discus economy’s longer-term productive potential. a always, view i express today own. the dual mandate state economy a know, federal reserve, federal open market committee (fomc), charge congress achieve maximum employment stable price – dual mandate. for price stability, fomc adopt goal 2 percent inflation, measure annual change price index personal consumption expenditures. many central bank develop economy adopt inflation goal center around 2 percent. the fomc set numerical goal maximum employment, long-run sustainable level employment determine mainly non-monetary factor outside fed’s control, demographics, social change, fiscal regulatory policies. nonetheless, four time year, fomc participant write estimate longer-run sustainable level unemployment rate (which many interpret “natural rate”); recent june fomc meet median estimate rate 4.8 percent. how evaluate current performance dual mandate? i would say make substantial progress toward maximum employment, although still room improvement. we work assure inflation move back 2 percent goal. let’s start employment mandate. after several year strong job growth, employment 5 million high pre-crisis peak 2007. the unemployment rate fall 10 percent 2009 4.7 percent may, essentially level many observer identify natural rate. this rate far bright line – cannot observe directly, estimate level subject great uncertainty.1 so look wide range labor market indicator ass overall health labor market. many indicator suggest labor market strong. to mention these, job open all-time high measures. the “quits” rate – rate employee voluntarily leave job – pre-crisis levels. survey individual business suggest ease find fill job similar experience mid-2000s. even though near natural rate unemployment, still room improvement several margins. important among labor force participation rate. if someone leaf labor force reason, even temporarily, person count unemployed. so labor force participation rate also key determinant unemployment rate. labor force participation influence many factors, include age structure population individuals’ perception availability jobs. 2 bi central bankers’ speech participation rise steadily 1970s 1990s increase number woman enter formal workforce. that process run course, and, around year 2000, participation begin gradual decline population age continuation long-term trends, particularly decline participation among prime age males. from 2008 2013, participation drop sharply 3 percentage points, remain flat, net, since late 2013 context strong job growth decline unemployment. economist estimate that, population ages, participation naturally tend decline trend rate 0.2 percentage point per year, period flat participation actually represent improvement post-crisis cyclical drop. today, participation near longer-run trend estimate group feed economist whose work widely cite issues.2 some estimate suggest still shortfall participation, and, course, estimate trend participation rate surround fairly wide band uncertainty. i incline believe potential worker margin labor market return recovery continues, labor market tighten wage increase. the u.s. participation rate worker 25–54 age group advance economies, include u.k., france germany, example. the number part-time worker want full time work remain pre-crisis levels, suggest may remain slack well. in addition, expect see strong wage increase labor market tightens. there welcome sign firm wages, see clearly data average hourly earnings, rise fast sum inflation productivity growth. after several year improve labor market conditions, recent data send mix signal level momentum economy. business investment weakened, even outside energy sector. growth gross domestic product (gdp) estimate slow rate 1-1/4 percent annualized basis fourth quarter last year first quarter year. incoming data point rebound. for example, atlanta fed’s gdpnow model, base projection range incoming monthly data, estimate growth 2.6 percent second quarter. in contrast, labor market data, especially monthly increase payroll jobs, display considerable strength several year right first quarter 2016, weaken significantly april may. while i would want make much two monthly observations, strength labor market key feature recovery, allow u look quarterly fluctuation gdp growth. so possible loss momentum job growth worrisome. turn inflation part mandate, fed’s prefer measure inflation consistently run 2 percent objective since end financial crisis, exception “arab spring” period 2011, oil price temporarily spiked. for 12 month end april, total inflation 1 percent, core inflation (excluding food energy prices) 1-1/2 percent. core inflation hold fall import prices, owe large part rise dollar, well indirect effect low oil prices. if dollar oil price remain broadly stable go forward, inflation move time 2 percent objective. when i first expose macroeconomics college, four decade ago, view inflation strongly influence amount slack economy. but relationship slack inflation weaken substantially years. in addition, inflation depend importantly inflation expectation worker firms. a widely share view among economist today that, unlike 1970s, expectation long heavily influence fluctuation inflation, fairly constant, anchored. for reasons, inflation become le responsive cyclical change economy. we measure inflation expectation survey forecaster general public, also market read inflation swap “breakevens,” represent inflation compensation measure difference return offer nominal treasury security offer tips. since mid-2014, market-based measure decline significantly historically low levels. some decline probably represent low bi central bankers’ speech 3 risk high inflation, elevate liquidity preference much heavily trade nominal treasury securities, rather expectation low inflation. some survey measure inflation expectation also trend down. give importance expectation determine inflation, development deserve, receive, careful attention. while inflation expectation seem remain reasonably well anchored, essential remain so. the way assure anchor achieve actual inflation 2 percent, i strongly commit objective. look ahead my baseline expectation economy likely continue path growth around 2 percent. i also expect ongoing heal labor market continue, healthy wage increase job creation. a economy tightens, i expect inflation move time committee’s 2 percent objective. for time, principal risk outlook abroad. global economic financial condition particularly important u.s. economy moment. weakness economic activity around world relate bout financial volatility weigh performance economy. give strong performance u.s. economy, trade-weighted value dollar rise roughly 20 percent since 2014. such large appreciation dollar mean “export” strength trade partner “import” weakness. growth inflation remain stubbornly low major trade partners. european japanese authority limit scope respond, daunt longer-run fiscal challenge policy rate already set zero. in china, stimulus measure support growth near term, may also slow china’s necessary transition away export- investment-led business model. emerge market nation brazil, russia venezuela face challenge conditions. these global risk shift even downside, last week’s referendum unite kingdom’s status european union. the brexit vote potential create new headwind economy around world, include own. the risk global outlook somewhat elevate even prior referendum, vote introduce new uncertainties. we say federal reserve carefully monitor development global financial markets, cooperation central banks. we prepare provide dollar liquidity exist swap line central banks, necessary, address pressure global fund markets, could adverse implication economy. although financial condition tighten since vote, market function orderly manner. and u.s. financial sector strong resilient. a recent stress test show, large financial institution continue build capital strengthen balance sheets. it far early judge effect brexit vote. a global outlook evolves, important ass implication u.s. economy, stance policy appropriate foster continue progress toward objective maximum employment price stability. i often ask rate remain low near full employment. a big part answer that, least time being, appropriate level rate simply low crisis. a result, policy stimulative might appear be. estimate real interest rate need keep economy even keel operate 2 percent inflation full employment – “neutral rate” interest – currently around zero. today, real short term interest rate negative 1-1/4 percent, policy actually moderately stimulative. i anticipate neutral rate move time, headwind weigh economic growth ease. 4 bi central bankers’ speech longer-term considerations: potential output, productivity, labor market fluidity, business dynamism i would like take step back current context explore issue ought receive attention – longer-run potential growth rate economy. one reason low neutral rate interest potential growth appear slowed. since crisis ended, forecaster broadly reduce estimate long run growth full percentage point – 3 percent 2 percent.3 this seemingly modest reduction imply dramatically small increase live standard time. a grow body research show deep recession accompany severe financial crisis often leave behind permanent damage.4 one recent analysis suggest one-third case permanent damage; one-third time permanent reduction level potential output subsequent growth rate; one third time reduction level potential output growth rate.5 unfortunately, many economy currently danger fall third category, include u.s. economy. output growth break increase hour work change output per hour, productivity. most decline estimate potential u.s. growth appear low productivity. labor productivity growth begin slow around 2005 – crisis – 1/2 percent annually since 2011 – slow five year period since world war ii. the productivity slowdown worldwide, see country strongly affect crisis, u.s. specific factor probably main cause.6 increase productivity necessary live standard continue rise generations. so two important question arise: why productivity growth slow? and future look like? we tentative answer first question. labor productivity function three things. the first two skill labor force, tool have, particularly equipment, software like. these input production drive private public investment. the third determinant call “total factor productivity,” tfp, refer ability firm produce efficiently give first two inputs. for example, business learn incorporate advance information technology production processes, surge productivity growth roughly 1995 2005. the weak performance productivity since crisis appear stem mainly weak business investment low tfp growth. weak business investment result weak demand uncertainty pace recovery. tfp equally important generally account variation productivity time, le well understand difficult forecast. the second question – happen productivity go forward – subject intense debate. the range forecast wide, historical record provide ample grind humility. this summer, many carry robert gordon’s massive the rise fall american growth beach (or perhaps lake, midwest), argue pessimistic view.7 for balance, maybe bring along brynjolfsson mcafee’s the second machine age, take optimistic view great deal shorter.8 one factor may contribute low productivity growth notable decline recent decade measure dynamism economy. entrepreneur start new firms; fail, succeed, grow rapidly, account significant amount job formation. old firm shrink go business fail keep innovation advance productivity. worker change job move around country (or world) career evolve company grow shrink. these process painful messy worker firms, essential allocation resource highest, productive uses. the high level innovation fluidity economy long think among principal reason high rise live standards. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the slowdown essentially process see decline rate creation destruction firm jobs. start-ups: start-ups key driver productivity growth. although may feel live age disruption, birthrate startup actually decline since 1970s.9 new firm loosely group two categories: start “lifestyle entrepreneurs” want boss, little prospect desire high growth; found transformational entrepreneur start business aspire grow dramatically change industry. before 2000, decline new firm entry mainly first sort; since 2000, also find among so-called transformational firms. while drop formation lifestyle-type firm could neutral even positive productivity, case u.s. retail sector, reduction creation high-performance new firm suggest low dynamism could associate slow productivity growth.10 labor market dynamism: while change job painful, job change aggregate associate high compensation, imply high productivity. but reward job change may declined. few start-ups mean low “job flows,” measure job creation destruction, few opportunity worker find good jobs. and labor market dynamism across many dimension decline explain reduction startups. worker become le likely leave jobs, change jobs, move geographically take new jobs.11 dynamism relatively new field inquiry, consensus yet reason for, implication of, developments. some plausible source change benign, others negative suggest reduction dynamism may factor behind slow increase productivity. for example, historically robust correlation firm level productivity growth, high productivity level correlate fast growth low productivity level associate contraction exit. this relationship weaken since 2000, particularly high-tech sector.12 high productivity firm grow quickly, low productivity firm shrink exit slow pace. it may government policies, well intended, contribute trends. one example may explain small portion reduction dynamism substantial increase occupational licensing.13 by estimates, fraction worker require hold government issue license certification perform job rise 5 percent 1950s close 40 percent.14 like many policies, license benefit costs. among cost tend reduce job switch employment opportunity exclude workers, may restrict competition thus increase price face consumers. among benefit may high quality product service improve health safety standards. some researcher advance view license requirement become overly burdensome may contribute secular decline job worker reallocation.15 dynamism fast-developing field research, important public policy react appropriately work continues. it go without say economic policymakers use available information tool create supportive environment growth. we need policy support labor force participation development skills, business hire investment, productivity growth. for part, policy outside remit federal reserve, monetary policy contribute support strong durable expansion, context price stability. conclusion how think performance economy since crisis? the picture mixed, question doubt debate decade ahead. but facts. since 2011, job growth strong unemployment decline fast 6 bi central bankers’ speech forecasts. on hand, economic growth consistently low almost private- public-sector forecasts, include fomc participants. growth slow recovery many previous recoveries; grow body research show weak recovery norm deep recession associate severe financial crises. finally, recovery also strong many advance economy follow crisis. i expect economy continue make progress. monetary policy need remain supportive growth, work challenge global environment. a always, important carefully monitor economic development order ass stance policy appropriate foster continue progress toward objective maximum employment price stability. 1. confidence interval around

bank’s (central bank norway) 200th anniversary, oslo, 16 june 2016. * * * sweden norway lot common. we understand one another’s languages. we common labour market, though nowadays mainly swede travel norway work. and get little irritate ski champion lose neighbours. but all, many respect common history. today celebrate 200th anniversary norge bank. however, monetary history norway start even back time, 1000 year earlier, viking spread fear throughout europe. coin first arrive nor-way viking return raid england. in 995 ad first christian king, olav trygvason, come power norway. he also important numismatic history since first know norwegian coin penny attribute him. around time, first swedish coin mint sweden’s first christian king, olof skötkonung. there many link sweden norway throughout centuries, kalmar union norway, denmark sweden late middle age union sweden norway 19th century. during napoleonic war, sweden lose finland russia kiel peace treaty january 1814 decide norway, part danish kingdom, instead join sweden. the treaty course op-posed norwegians, spring 1814, sweden occupy war fronts, norwegian take action. they declare independence, draw constitution appoint committee plan new norwegian central bank. but july swedish soldier arrived. after brief battle, norway accept swedish king king norway. however, union create fairly loose. except foreign service, norway retain state institution characterize independent state. in june 1816, exactly 200 year ago, norge bank established. the bank locate trondheim far politician kristiania (which know oslo) even away stockholm swedish king. norge bank found challenge environment economy state chaos follow napoleonic wars, confidence monetary system low. the previous joint currency denmark col-lapsed, attempt restore failed. it take long time newly establish norge bank manage create credibility norwegian currency. in first year existence, bank’s main task include manage silver tax payment handle receipts, print distribute banknote bookkeeping. in january 1817 bank country. it receive deposits, charge fee service. thus, today’s situation depositor pay keep money bank entirely new phenomenon. in 1870s norway join currency union denmark sweden last outbreak first world war. the scandinavian country enjoy strong economic growth period. large cross-border capital flow support industrialization scandinavian countries, financial integration drive gold standard currency union probably contribute factor favourable development. both sweden nor-way relatively poor country situate outskirt europe norge bank found 200 year ago, advent industrialization late 2 bi central bankers’ speech 19th century country begin journey become two rich nation world. economic political development norway sweden also show similar pattern period since second world war. the role central bank limit sweden norway. the monetary policy decision make government norge bank become technical implementer government policy. for much 1970s 1980s, economic policy norway sweden lack long term strategy credibility. inflation wage soared, lose competitiveness result repeat devaluations. in 1982, large devaluation swedish krona, declare would devaluations. the thing hap-pened norway 1986, norwegian krone devalue tenth time decade. interest-rate set become genuine responsibility norge bank. we also share similar problem regard lend spree start mid-1980s, end systematic bank crisis bad re-cession since 1930s. both country experience solid economic growth rapid credit asset price growth, follow cyclical downturn heavy loan loss exhaust capital many bank over-ex-tended themselves. the strong credit growth partly due early de-regulation. borrow also encourage generous tax deduction interest payments. while crisis certainly aggravate external shocks, currency crisis europe early 1990s, mostly homemade bad policy mix bad time reforms. however, prompt broad-based government intervention help bank sector recover relatively quickly. the fiscal cost solve bank crisis also comparatively low. nevertheless, negative impact real economy severe, particularly sweden, unemployment soared. sweden pay high price defence krona early 1990s, return fix exchange rate regime realistic option time. instead, new monetary framework take form. an inflation target adopt krona allow float free. in norway, situation somewhat different. the norwegian krone depreciate much norway leave exchange rate mechanism. norway therefore return fix exchange rate regime, although regime gradually change 2001 norge bank also formally adopt inflation target new fiscal framework introduced. so two country similar strategy monetary policy base inflation target float exchange rate since 2001. during period frequent deep contact staff, i thankful sverige riksbank learn exchange methodology experiences. however, emergence norway oil nation make norge bank unique many respects, least manage sovereign wealth fund. norge bank one central bank charge task. in fact, fund one large investor swedish stock exchange. when norway become oil nation 1970s, country start journey become one rich nation world. we swede some-times little envious this, perhaps even think shame long union! huge oil revenue also create major challenges, many country manage well. but norway has. by create petroleum fund, norway manage save revenue keep separate domestic economy. furthermore, fund manage norge bank see model show way sovereign wealth funds. bi central bankers’ speech 3 even though monetary policy norway – sweden – gear towards inflation target, development exchange rate cannot ignored. it also worth note riksbank norge bank pursue monetary policy shadow ecb. both central bank take ac-count effect exchange rate monetary policy, since value krona greatly influence import price ultimately inflation. this may imply monetary policy stance optimal term stabilize domestic economy financial system. in fact one main issue economic policy sweden norway days. central bank limit find optimal strategy monetary pol-icy. what central bank need shape development whole world economy, largely influence political circumstances, in-side outside countries. both formal cooperation informal ex-changes idea intense central bank many countries, particular norge bank riksbank, continue face similar challenges. so round off: norway sweden follow one another centuries, war peace, crisis growth. and thankful succeed move poverty wealth become two world’s wealthy nations. often central bank able contribute high welfare, sometimes monetary policy unfortunately destabilizing. our joint history continuing, common challenge face go for-ward. high capital labour mobility throughout world open new possibility raise welfare even further, globalisation also require try find common strategy across countries. we also enjoy similarity continue tease one another meet sport field. a sweden follow team euro 2016, can’t help ask, oh where’s norway? but hand expect lot tease next world cup ski event! bi central bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: opt-in opt-out? the future european union light uk referendum speech dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, atlantik-brücke, hamburg, 23 juni 2016. * * * 1. introduction mr schwenker mr kracht lady gentleman yet again, europe find crossroads, least uk’s perspective. 41 year uk referendum country come favour become member european economic community, people great britain northern ireland are, i speak, vote “european question”. though decision quite clearly one uk alone take, voice quarter sound note caution right last minute. one notable example imf’s christine lagarde, recently underscore many benefit european partnership bring uk imf paper sketch distinctly bleak future post-brexit uk economy. echo m lagarde’s remarks, federal reserve chair janet yellen warn uk vote leave eu could “significant economic repercussions”. uk voter alone make scenario will. now neither time place pas judgement decision hold referendum pro contra respective standpoint uk angle. i instead look matter european vantage point invite discus today’s referendum mean european union. in so, i take look direct challenge face event brexit long-term outlook eu. 2. stand firm face uncertainty: direct repercussion brexit eu lady gentlemen, half uk’s export go eu countries. 46% foreign direct investment uk come eu; way around, figure 43%.1 thank uk’s long-standing membership eu, economy enjoy close tie ever european partner countries. figuratively speaking, brexit, then, would set motion highly complex divorce proceed herald protract spell uncertainty. what brexit would mean practice depend large extent what’s hammer brexit negotiations. while mechanic leave eu codify article 50 treaty european union, article map process preliminary two-year timeframe within agreement negotiate union withdraw member state. both side would undoubtedly interest maintain exist trade links. but time, doubt eu resist effort uk cherry-pick advantageous terms. 1 c fuest, d brexit ist ökonomisch irrational (in wirtschaftswoche, 27 may 2016). 2 bi central bankers’ speech a glance agreement exist country make plain share market always mean stick common set standard well. the european free trade association (efta) iceland, liechtenstein norway, instance, tie membership european economic area (eea). but also mean apply full set eu legislation, notable component freedom movement – issue “brexiteers” cite run-up referendum one reason think uk leave union. by contrast, alternative model use switzerland, part eea, initially envisage country freedom access common market. in likelihood, individual arrangement grant access won’t possible without concessions. and jungle contractual small print contend with, time constraint mean negotiate party unable repeatedly redraft proposal effort hammer agreement. so it’s anything certain legal situation ultimately pan out. the term eu treaty would remain force negotiation period. but business side channel would unable forge longer-term plan long condition haven’t clarify – plan uncertainty bind costly. and it’s much air whether spell uncertainty two year whether negotiate party agree mutual consent extend negotiate period. put aside tall order gauge economic fallout brexit decision, naturally another question arise european angle personally central banker – give “leave” vote might spark turbulent market response, far europe’s bank financial system remain stable continue function properly? financial market already start price brexit scenario, heighten volatility climb risk premium come fore lead-up referendum. it’s safe bet market remain turmoil uk choose leave eu. for example, pound open exchange rate risk, could devalue strongly vote leave eu. effect also expect stock markets. in particular, british bank share could come pressure market expect brexit push banks’ wholesale fund cost detriment profitability. see financial sector account much great share uk economy, 6.7%, rest europe,2 uk bank share epicentre market jitters. so it’s surprise mark carney, governor bank england, speak out, part boe’s monetary financial stability mandate, repercussion brexit point likelihood negative short-term effects.3 that’s european supervisor waste time urge euro-area credit institution precisely quantify continuously review forex, credit, equity bond market risks, simulate scenario draw “contingency plans”. the vast majority bank treat brexit scenario seriousness deserve rigorously prepare face aftermath – cases, preparation require great deal time effort. the go central banks, too, course. they’re ready face real risk “leave” vote. a thing stand today, i think risk might emerge, say, theoretical uk rat downgrade possible revaluation uk property sector manageable overall, course, one really know sure. a eu, brexit would also cause fallout medium term. european bank base continent operate uk market branch london. the uk capital also home great number non-european institution use eu’s 2 financial insurance activity express share uk gdp; equivalent eu whole 4.7% (source: oecd.stat). 3 bank england inflation report q&a (12 may 2016). bi central bankers’ speech 3 passporting regime conduct business eu country – make london hub entire european market. if uk vote leave eu, institution germany eu country operate branch uk would face prospect lose access passporting regime see changed. this would force institution either convert london branch standalone subsidiary apply licence bank england shift operation uk euro area – two immensely costly options, might i add. but say that, also true uk opt leave eu, wait outcome post-referendum negotiation anything really say eu’s passporting regime stand court. but financial centre elsewhere eu, brexit scenario open number opportunity medium term. also, large number foreign bank look set switch uk mainland europe – that’s something might even benefit frankfurt financial centre. london’s pull power venue european bond forex trade would shrivel. for even today, supervisor take critical view fact euro trade base mostly london, therefore outside euro area. this criticism would intensify uk choose leave eu, course. the say clear business central security depository services, least euro-denominated business – supervisory authority need lot tolerant business allow conduct outside euro area outside eu well. if truth told, that’s level tolerance i barely imagine. look medium-term horizon, european union also need consider how, give close link financial agent uk continental europe, intend safeguard financial stability europe national brand regulation supervision reintroduce side channel. while uk bank aren’t currently affect single supervisory resolution mechanism bank union, need comply single rulebook. incidentally, european bank authority play important role regard. not eba ensure harmonise interpretation rules, also promote interaction dialogue supervisory practice member states. and i’m sure know, currently headquarter london. so uk vote leave eu, eba wouldn’t find new home; would also rebuild prudential cooperation uk scratch. so “leave” vote throw vast number plan issue raise considerable uncertainty. but even electorate come favour “remain”, would still loose end deal relationship uk rest european union. just consider, instance, question revision eu rule agree event uk remain eu actually affect economic political dynamic within eu. 3. strengthen crisis resistance: long-term outlook eu lady gentlemen, outcome referendum something britain resolve – something able influence. what influence, though, eu itself, ability function. and i see far consequential issue affect europe’s future. for uk referendum understand le result anticipate benefit exit – early on, i give insight imponderable risk leave union – outcome widespread dissatisfaction european union. and, uk vote remain union, referendum likely represent resound commitment part briton eu. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in addition, know, dissatisfaction eu purely uk phenomenon, instead grow significantly many member states. support eurosceptic party mounting. a uk vote favour brexit could also launch movement member state look way leave eu. moreover, even uk vote today remain, cannot expect underlie attitude towards european union change overnight. motif dissatisfaction may partly find domestic politics. on hand, however, search cause also need include european union’s specific actions, deal refugees, euro crisis, general cost-benefit consideration harmonise rule “ever close union” – juncture, i go detail individual topics, would beyond scope mandate. what reverberate everywhere, however, question whether european union capable take decision effectively efficiently. the eu yet demonstrate ability deal diversity – cultural economic – channel right directions. let explain view euro area outstanding reforms. the challenge channel diversity right direction come quite prominently monetary union. in large economic area, quite natural individual region evolve variety different ways; owe structure economy societies, respond change way. the underlie question this: system whole respond asymmetrical shocks? put differently: eu make crisis-resistant? in single monetary area euro area, exchange rate adjust; therefore, channel need cushion imbalances, adjustment price factor markets, sufficient labour force capital mobility, also, course, stability-oriented economic fiscal policy. despite variety effort harmonisation, still 19 different set economic fiscal policy euro area. yet state necessarily address respective structural problem appropriate manner eu-level sanction mechanism either non-existent or, put mildly, underused. it also occur past that, deal structural issues, government fob part negative fallout national policy measure rest euro area. over course euro crisis, become clear connection sovereign debt. other policymaking areas, too, expose threat member state force pay consequence individual member states’ policy errors. the european union consequently increasingly view synonym lack reform dump grind national risks. let frame reform problem way: europe face challenge overcome obstacle reform along route sustainable coherent community order. there certainly one solution. the option reform common economic financial framework towards strong european liability, however, predicate upon transfer national sovereignty european level. if look discontent “ever close union,” appear option currently political non-starter. however, another way european order ensure synchronicity action liability consequence consequence bear vast majority scope action located: national decision-makers. this mean need take responsibility action convince incentive eliminate structural problems. i would like illustrate cite two topical area financial reform: first, sovereign debt, second, european deposit insurance. both reform relate nexus sovereign domestic banks. and, cases, obviously apparent problem is, enthusiasm reform still remain demonstrated. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the excessively close sovereign-bank nexus primary example factor make sovereign debt structural problem, engender unhealthy mutual interdependence. it precisely large stock sovereign bond book domestic bank create dependencies. the bundesbank one first point role preferential regulatory treatment government bond key aspect problem. bank currently require set aside capital loan euro-area sovereigns, unlike loan enterprise households. nor cap ceiling lend borrowers. bank therefore have, least short term, huge incentive invest government bonds. sovereign likewise benefit short term since easily obtain fund artificially inflate demand government bond – yet time lessen pressure reform, consolidate government finance achieve debt level sustainable long term. the crisis show clearly even euro-area government bond may expose risk. this why, view, risk-based capital requirement need extend cover banks’ on-balance-sheet lend sovereigns. i also believe still make sense limit banks’ exposure individual sovereign – much like large exposure limit private-sector borrowers. that way, even borrower default, bank would still enough capital disposal. if preferential regulatory treatment sovereign debt do away with, would also increase investors’ incentive take great account differ risk profile individual states, turn would thus strengthen disciplinary function capital markets. country pursue unsustainable policy would face rise risk premiums. where political action need take know – however, eu need demonstrate is, fact, will act. there similar political constellation regard topic deposit protection. under european commission’s current proposal, exist national protection scheme – already operate standard harmonise across europe – gradually replace european deposit protection scheme. although single supervisory mechanism europe bank supervise accord uniform european guideline harmonise rules, well single resolution mechanism go it, financial situation supervise institution hinge state economy, well as, course, legal framework affect country. insolvency, instance, still govern patchwork different national regimes. rush madly introduce european deposit insurance scheme would create unfair situation bank would likely dig quite deeply share pot; would also tend reduce pressure member state conduct reforms. let reiterate guide theme forego remarks: in-built conflict short-term relief balance action responsibility consequences, thus also basis rules-based order function long run. it eu level also, particular, member state unpleasant structural reform undertake order make eu le vulnerable crises. time essence and, give challenge face eu, wasted. 4. conclusion lady gentlemen, hour, uk’s future eu balance knife edge. we won’t wait long tomorrow learn uk voted: whether wish remain member 6 bi central bankers’ speech eu leave. however, worry immediate impact referendum – “brexit” “bremain”. what decisive medium long term, however, find good solution problem chronic dissatisfaction europe’s institutions. we confront detect deficiency decisive manner. europe must demonstrate ability conduct credible political reforms. this task necessary irrespective today’s referendum unite kingdom. should uk vote leave eu, however, one thing certain: europe’s political landscape miss voice caution proponent stability market economy. that something i would highly regret; however, hope britain’s know penchant pragmatism prevail evening. thank much coming, i would please join discussion. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jerome h powell: introductory comment – roundtable interim report alternative reference rate committee introductory comment mr jerome h powell, member board governor federal reserve system, roundtable interim report alternative reference rate committee, sponsor federal reserve board federal reserve bank new york, new york city, 21 june 2016. * * * i want thank come today, i also want thank alternative reference rate committee (arrc) work develop interim report. this report mark new stage reference rate reform.1 reference benchmark key part financial infrastructure. about $300 trillion dollar contract reference libor alone. but benchmark give much consideration prior recent scandal involve attempt manipulate them. since then, official sector think seriously financial benchmarks, conduct number investigation charge manipulation, publish international organization security commission’s (iosco) principle financial benchmark and, financial stability board (fsb), sponsor major reform effort interest rate foreign exchange benchmarks.2 the institution represent arrc also think seriously issue develop interim report. now, need end user begin think seriously use benchmark risk take rely heavily reference rate – case u.s. dollar libor – le resilient need be. in say this, i want make clear libor significantly improved. ice benchmark administration process make important change methodology, submission libor regulate unite kingdom’s financial conduct authority. however, term money market borrow bank underlie u.s. dollar libor experience secular decline. a result, majority u.s. dollar libor submission must still rely expert judgement, even submission transaction-based may base relatively actual trades. this call question whether libor ultimately satisfy iosco principle 7 regard data sufficiency, require benchmark base active market. that principle particularly important one, difficult ask bank submit rate believe could borrow daily basis actually borrow often. that basic fact pose risk libor could eventually force stop publication entirely. ongoing regulatory reform change market structure raise question whether transaction underlie libor become even scarce future, particularly period stress, bank might feel little incentive contribute u.s. dollar libor panel transaction become le frequent. market participant use think possibility, benchmark sometimes come halt. the sudden cessation benchmark heavily use libor would present significant systemic risks. it could entail substantial loss would create substantial uncertainty, potential legal challenges, payment disruption market participant rely libor. these disruption would even great viable alternative u.s. dollar libor market participant could quickly move to. 1 see alternative reference rate committee (2016), interim report consultation (pdf) (new york: arrc, may). 2 for information iosco principles, see board international

council call promotion alternative libor, lead federal reserve convene arrc cooperation u.s. treasury department, u.s. commodity future trade commission, office financial research. libor currently dominant reference rate market liquidity. we illusion move significant portion trade alternative rate simple easy. but i believe arrc provide workable credible plan create liquidity new rate begin

keynote speech mr yannis stournaras, governor bank greece, london business school greek alumnus association stanford club greece event title “breaking bottleneck – step towards sustainable growth”, american school classical studies, athens, 8 june 2016. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure today chance share think impact greek sovereign crisis greek bank sector, outline challenge financial stability policy initiative take primarily, only, bank greece. at outset, important highlight financial stability necessary condition achieve goal prosperity sustainable growth. that goal share amply reflect current mandate central bank emphasis price stability, support general economic environment and, recently, safeguard financial stability. i begin briefly outline global landscape effort safeguard financial stability take place. then, i discus development greek bank sector. in particular, emphasis place on: (i) first, significant worsen macroeconomic environment subsequent deterioration greek banks’ fundamentals, general, asset quality, particular; (ii) second, euro area monetary policy initiative limit impact greece; (iii) third, new role bank greece stem mandate revise address current challenges. finally, i conclude outline challenge ahead provide think way forward. a. the set – broad context over last seven years, european union face series unprecedented challenges; challenge test international financial system coherence stability union. the response challenge show eu build upon solid grind bond among member state become ever stronger. the global financial crisis, trigger 2008, provide first challenge stability raise major issue relate “too-big–to-fail”, “too-big-to-save” “too-complex-to-resolve”. the euro area sovereign debt crisis rapidly follow real economic activity deteriorate considerably certain part euro area. a key lesson crisis establishment bank union vital prerequisite make monetary union sustainable. more recently, recovery euro area still fragile, new geopolitical tension lead unprecedented refugee crisis increase uncertainty. finally, matter probability brexit, different approach among member state regard bank union slow progress establish single european deposit insurance scheme, hind progress towards secure financial system architecture appropriate ensure stability. b. the sovereign crisis greece cause greek bank sector crisis unlike recent experience financial instability, origin greek crisis find bank sector. in context unfavorable international 2 bi central bankers’ speech economic financial landscape i outline above, greece undergo serious sovereign crisis require three adjustment programmes, including, inter alia, substantial reform tough austerity measures. the rapid deterioration macroeconomic environment, reflect cumulative loss 25% gdp, show crisis face greece deep protract initially expected. in term overall deterioration key macroeconomic aggregate duration crisis, one could say greek crisis prove severe even great depression. at outset, deterioration macroeconomic environment, sovereign debt downgrade rise sovereign spread render access international capital money market impossible bank sovereign. extremely tight liquidity condition ensue pressure bank sector grew. in adverse macroeconomic landscape, unemployment increase historic (post-war) levels, disposable income drop substantially. a consequence, adverse development bank sector unprecedented; particular, greek banks’ fundamental asset quality ratio deteriorate substantially. the extent deterioration may describe term impact restructure greek government bond hold private sector (the so-called private sector involvement psi): greek bank suffer loss €38 billion 2011, 170% total core tier i (ct1) capital time. due liquidity squeeze, intermediary role bank undermine channel finance real economy restricted. in addition, deposit decline €117 billion (i.e. drop –44%) september 2009 december 2015. mainly, decline reflect depositor uncertainty regard prospect greece within euro area. but additionally, decline deposit reflect negative loan growth throughout period. in normal times, deposit create loans, loan also create deposit via money multiplier; decline loan analogously lead endogenous decline deposits. the significant deleveraging greek bank undertake – end-2010 end-2015, loan private sector fell €54 billion – partly response tight fund condition partly consequence need set aside capital since potential unexpected risk rise considerably. a consequence become ever difficult bank play natural role, finance real economy. the considerable decline household disposable income, consequence wage cut rise unemployment, result significant increase non-performing loan impairments, thus undermine prospect bank profits. bank 2010 onwards begin experience losses, erode capital base. despite effort support profitability reduce costs, high level loan loss provision result series loss-making result right first quarter 2016. c. european policy initiative the response europe global european financial crisis effective despite initial lack crisis mechanism unfavorable challenge environment – environment fire often fight simultaneously number fronts. the initial response come form monetary policy significant ease monetary policy stance. indeed, october 2008, six major central banks, include ecb, implement coordinate simultaneous cut interest rates. additionally, time euro area member state set action plan coordinate measure (including, inter alia, grant government guarantee bank debt issuance recapitalization banks) restore confidence improve financial conditions. with eruption euro area sovereign debt crisis malfunction monetary transmission mechanism lead ecb resort increasingly nonstandard monetary tools. additionally, europe set european financial stability facility (efsf) provide bi central bankers’ speech 3 financial assistance distress member states. the efsf replace powerful european stability mechanism (esm) october 2012. the sovereign debt crisis also reveal strong negative feedback loop bank sovereigns, irrespective whether crisis originate sovereign banks, well contagion among national financial markets. in response developments, 2012, european leader initiate creation bank union – complementary integral part genuine economic financial union. it three pillar are: single supervisory mechanism, single resolution mechanism still-to-be complete common deposit guarantee system. apart element bank union, number important regulatory initiative taken, cover almost aspect financial sector activity (namely bank recovery resolution directive – brrd, capital requirement regulation directive – crr/crd iv bank sector, solvency ii insurance, european market infrastructure regulation – emir financial market infrastructure on). turn monetary policy initiatives, ecb address severe persistent disinflationary force euro area economy broad set measures. initially, move refinance operation fix rate full allotment. it also extend time horizon refinance operations, provide 3-year maturity instead usual 3-month. more recently, so-called target long-term refinance operation (tltros), seek incentivize bank on-lend private sector provide finance 4 years. finally various asset purchase programme eurosystem purchase marketable asset include public sector/government bonds, corporate bonds, abss, uncover bank bonds, etc. these non-standard measure implement meet variety goals. first, support financial market malfunctioning. second, provide liquidity bank long periods. it recall wake international financial crisis, interbank market dry completely counterparty risk rose; day, remain fragile. third, kick-start lend real economy. ultimately, course, goal prevent deflation raise inflation euro area target. to great extent, measure help improve financial condition euro area. work do bank greece show financial condition respond positively non-standard measures, even measure yet restore inflation target below, close to, 2 per cent. however, respect greece, anticipate positive effect expansionary monetary policy stance yet realized. financial condition greece, whilst low 2012, still extremely tight historical standards. moreover, condition virtually unchanged since begin 2013, despite non-standard measure employ ecb. what factor might account outcome? the eurosystem lend commercial bank collateral. the collateral framework define eligible relate asset’s rating. greek bank often find constrain amount eligible collateral. moreover, haircut apply eligible collateral. that is, €100 bond necessarily give bank access €100 refinancing. greek asset rat much low crisis. thus asset become ineligible and, asset still eligible, haircut increased. this has, occasion, restrict access refinance operations. since february 2015, greek bank unable use greek government bond refinance operations, since rat low minimum acceptable collateral framework. a waiver introduce country adjustment programme complete associate review successfully. in february 2015, govern council decide greece meet criterion hence waiver withdrawn. furthermore, greek bank various time suspend eligible counterparties eurosystem. this occur psi bank recapitalized. 4 bi central bankers’ speech under circumstances, bank turn emergency liquidity assistance provide bank greece. but ela carry stigma, expensive banks, know fund plans, explain plan reduce recourse ela reasonably short period. suspension, example, prevent greek bank participate second ltro. finally, greece benefit asset purchase programmes. the cover bond ab programme aim banks. but greek bank cannot issue cover bond abs meet rat criterion. similarly greek corporates issue limit bond meet rat criterion. with respect public sector asset purchase programme, greek government bond ineligible since country “in programme”. thus financial condition greece benefit significantly raft non-standard measure introduce crisis. conditions, however, expect improve pass 1st review reinstatement waiver. d. the response greek authorities, include bank greece i turn response greek authorities. the role central bank throughout eu considerably increase due challenge face bank system wake lehman brothers’ failure. one manifestation increase role mandate amend explicitly refer financial stability core central bank task. at time, toolbox available expand include macro-prudential policy tool enhance micro-prudential policy tool ssm national authorities. the greek authority exception trend. throughout crisis, bank greece guardian financial stability, protect fully depositor (regardless type size) support economy public interest. initially, accomplish 2008 law provide capital support greek bank allow bank issue government guarantee bond could use refinance operations. similar law enact throughout eu. with onset sovereign debt crisis, however, situation intensify require continuous action bank greece two broad fronts: ensure adequate provision liquidity manage recapitalization, resolution restructuring. with respect liquidity provision, bank critical ensure continuous liquidity provision bank use one old macro-prudential tool available, lender last resort. on various occasions, bank greece extend ela bank system. this help preserve financial stability ensure liquidity problem turn solvency problems. with respect manage recapitalization, resolution restructuring, bank’s strategy, context adjustment programmes, aim strengthen viable institution wind non-viable institution whilst safeguard financial stability. to end, viability assessment capital need assessment undertaken. those bank deem viable recapitalized. the first round recapitalization, follow loss incur psi, complete june 2013. a combination private capital resource hellenic financial stability fund used. the second recapitalization take place 2014, follow macro-prudential stress test, involve private equity capital injections. a recapitalization take place end 2015, mainly due uncertainty prevail first half year, negative impact macroeconomic financial fundamentals. follow agreement third adjustment programme, financial envelope €25 billion provide bank system. in august 2015, ecb launch asset quality review stress-test exercise four systemic greek bi central bankers’ speech 5 banks. the ecb appropriate authority because, since november 2014, four systemic bank supervise single supervisory mechanism (ssm). the bank greece undertake similar exercise small banks. the result exercise identification capital need baseline adverse macroeconomic scenario. the actual amount capital raise identify adverse scenario, namely €14.4 billion. thank coordinate effort greek authority bank greece, successful right issue result full coverage shortfall december 2015, private investor subscribe €9 billion. these effort minimize hfsf participation help restore confidence longer-term viability greek banks. a consequence, greek bank among high capital ratio bank euro area. those deem non-viable resolve ‘good’ part absorb systemic banks. the resolution tool use meet two main criteria. first, resolution do way ensure continue stability financial system. to end, deposit resolve bank transfer systemic banks. this process also ensure minimum disruption customer resolve banks. the second criterion minimize cost restructure tax-payers. the bank greece assess cost use purchase assumption resolution tool low alternative. with 14 resolution successfully take place since 2011, process also facilitate considerable restructure bank system, eliminate excess market capacity. e. challenge ahead, way forward conclude remark lady gentlemen, with successful completion first review, number positive benefit likely ensue bank system. the reinstatement waiver allow greek government bond eligible collateral eurosystem refinance operations. greek bank expect participate come target long-term refinance operation. these development considerably reduce fund cost greek banks. at time, late year, greek government bond could also become eligible public sector asset purchase programme. fall spread impact positively bank system since sovereign effectively act floor interest rate bank business ratings. however, room complacency. the system still face challenges. the ssm identify banks’ business model profitability top priority supervisory action plan 2016. yet background priority take place challenge one. the macroeconomic environment still fragile, market sentiment volatile capital control still force. a large part challenge address new business model relate increase stock non-performing exposure (npes) management. these exposure act significant impediment banks’ reorient business model well as, broadly, growth financial stability, particularly country european south. it highlighted, however, good position deal challenge issue. thank work do past years, fully aware problems’ analytics important knowledge accumulate monitor manage trouble assets. moreover, recent bank greece study indicates, domestic npes primarily drive recession. this find lead u inevitable conclusion pro-active loan restructure immediate involvement loan servicers private equity fund (gaining upside ebitda) may add value. the bank greece’s key priority present contribute towards sustainable solution management npes. a number initiative underway goal set accelerate efficient framework private debt resolution. these elements, 6 bi central bankers’ speech amongst others, include: (a) recently vote amendment law 4354/2015 pave way development secondary market non-performing loans; (b) establishment enhance framework out-of-court workout pre-bankruptcy process; (c) elimination series taxation drive obstacle borrower lenders; (d) re-drafting code conduct address issue identify early implementation phase; (e) amendment legislation, would ensure cooperation old shareholder restructure underlie businesses; and, finally, (f) launch comprehensive monitor framework relation banks’ non-performing exposure resolution activities. the ultimate aim meet challenge shape bank system position undertake efficiently main task, namely finance real economy. to end, bank greece ssm ensure appropriate policy mix. central bank today undertake monetary policy, macro-prudential policy micro-prudential supervision. macro-prudential policy bridge gap micro-prudential supervision individual bank monetary policy. it imperative different policy area adequately coordinated. in context, important macro-prudential toolbox enhance innovative tool beyond focus capital requirements. for instance, cyclical systemic risk arise result excessive credit expansion (an issue address countercyclical capital buffer) also due inadequate channel credit keep real economy under-financed significant periods. i focus remark today bank system policy role central banks. other policy-makers, however, also recognize responsibilities. i could refer completion bank union, proposal share fiscal responsibility outline five presidents’ report continue implementation structural reform enhance product market competition, improve educational systems, raise efficiency judicial system, promote financial literacy on. the objective restore confidence enhance resilience credit institution withstand shock uncertain economic environment always challenge task. yet forget prerequisite fulfill ultimate objective finance real economy promote sustainable economic growth, create job ensure good standard live citizens. financial stability prerequisite sustainable growth; also true, however, financial stability sustainable basis cannot achieve without growth. failure maintain strong growth big threat long-term stability eu. the appropriate balance manage risk enable investment need strike crucial regulatory framework impede growth. the key sustainable recovery high investment, yet significant investment gap exists. the financial system stability crucial role play close gap, central banker supervisory authority catalytic responsibility

then, i briefly analyze impact widespread uncertainty country’s financial markets; finally, i make comment inflation monetary policy. before i begin, i note remark entirely necessarily reflect position bank mexico govern board. economic development outlook a natural start point comment find international economic conditions, last couple year characterize le favorable emerge markets. in particular, advance nation continue witness slow recovery amid decelerate growth emerge economy stagnant global trade. add condition doubt concern monetary policy stance expect monetary divergence among develop countries. worry health chinese economy, turn, persist amid uncertainty grow geopolitical issues, brexit currently number-one fear. in addition, commodity price expect remain low time. finally, environment fuel heighten risk aversion, hit emerge economy especially hard. in complicate world, mexican economy maintain relatively stable moderate growth since 2014, reach 2.8 percent first quarter 2016 year-on-year basis. the main driver expand service sector, industrial production decelerate somewhat, although pick recently. three factor behind soft industrial growth clear. first foremost, oil extraction see longstanding decline. construction activity, part, slow somewhat erratic, apparently still affect restructure process sector subject last years. to round list, manufacture production, hold tight relationship industry manufacture unite states, le dynamic. give significant vertical integration two countries, slow u.s. industrial activity, reflect downsize oil sector amid low prices, cap expansion mexican manufacturing. a result, manufacture export lose steam, decline rate annual growth fall negative territory recent quarters. this deceleration take place spite significant real peso depreciation, occur along emerging-market currencies. this fact highlight 2 bi central bankers’ speech dominant negative effect stem decline external demand, notably unite states, mexico’s main trade partner, also nation well.1 in short, main engine recent mexican economic expansion domestic spending, largely private sector, include consumption investment. yet worth note that, although represent small weight total aggregate demand, government consumption expanding, thereby support spend well. in 2016 first quarter, however, trend changed. additionally, public investment, even small contributor aggregate demand, continue contract. a global economy world regions, mexico’s economic outlook subject downward revisions, modest recovery project follow year. even lackluster scenario, mexico distinguish itself, expect expansion high average pace foresee latin america.2 this mean satisfy middle growth. a emerge economy, mexico eventually enjoy much high rate economic expansion, break previous long-term, excessively encouraging, record. to sure, short term, real challenge prevail. specifically, mexico’s scenario modest improvement face risks, among downside force seem numerous. let mention three. in first place, u.s. import industrial output may slow further, potentially inhibit country’s manufacture production, also generate spillover effect service sector private investment. second, producer consumer sentiment could deteriorate due le favorable international financial events. finally, larger-than-anticipated fall mexican oil extraction could occur. on upside, however, recent structural reform could start yield greater-than-expected benefits.3 financial market international financial market affect uncertainty implication extraordinary lax monetary stance undertake advance nation normalization process unite states. a central bank region navigate unchartered waters, consequence impossible predict. meanwhile, portfolio adjust away emerge markets, low capital inflow even outflow cases. asset prices, time, include emerge market bond currencies, see downward pressure.4 also, spike financial volatility hit amid geopolitical jitters, include fear brexit. these development reflect tension headwind emerge markets, test strength fundamentals. in mexico, unprecedented shrinkage oil balance result large current account deficit. this gap still remains, however, slightly 3 percent gdp. 1 for econometric estimation effect u.s. manufacture production bilateral real exchange rate mexico’s manufacture export country, see banco de méxico (2016). quarterly report october – december 2015, box 1. 2 analysts’ estimate gdp latin america mexico are, respectively, –0.6 2.4 percent 2016, 2.0 2.8 percent 2017. see consensus economics inc. (2016). “latin american consensus forecasts,” may. 3 for online progress report mexico’s structural reforms, see presidencia de la república, reformas en acción, http://reformas.gob.mx/. 4 see koepke, r. farnham, s. (2016). “may 2016 em portfolio flow tracker,” institute international finance, june. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the enlargement current account deficit catch attention many observers, perhaps much sheer magnitude total balance, likely underlie trends, may eventually trigger external finance restrictions. this type concern neglected, must properly assessed. one fact precisely weaken oil trade balance, reflect low extraction significant deterioration oil term trade. a second component, nonoil balance, improving, partly aid real exchange rate depreciation. nevertheless, performance sufficient completely offset trend oil balance. in word, recent le favorable balance-of-payments development reflect mexico’s oil situation. to preclude continuation tendency support financial stability, adjustment public-sector spending, already underway, obviously call for. the necessity clearly confirm rise pemex credit risk perception, high cd spread begin mid-2014 coincide low oil price surprising, slightly le pressure since last february. an important consequence contamination pemex credit risk perception exert mexico’s sovereign debt. inaction state oil company definitely acceptable, nothing else, danger contagion country risk perception. additionally, share nonresident hold peso-denominated government security total outstanding decreased, change composition away short-term zero coupon instrument (cetes) favor long-term bonds. these portfolio change could interpret natural investor reaction le optimistic view emerge markets. hence, far, seek exit mainly holder short-term securities, hold long-term bond rise absolute term year. in case, development foreign fund mexico must continue monitored. a emerging-market economies, heighten risk aversion since taper tantrum widen interest-rate spreads. it worth note current spread unprecedented, similar observe begin 2012, fear surround sustainability euro area also feed risk aversion. a countries, flexible exchange rate perform crucial role buff market adverse financial environment. the mexican peso depreciate significantly since mid-2014, hurt emerging-market currency present year. these difficult development underscore importance ongoing fiscal strengthening, necessary welcome development face external headwinds. adjustment already include least four measures, start financial business restructure implement pemex. additionally, cut 2016 budget public expenditure process, initiative send congress positive primary balance 2017. finally, aim keep public finance sustainable, commitment place stabilization decline total balance public-sector borrow requirement gdp medium term.5 inflation monetary policy annual inflation continue benign unprecedented low levels. specifically, 13 month row, inflation remain permanent 3 percent target. this quite achievement, convergence objective assume inflation fluctuate 5 see shcp (2016). “documento relativo al cumplimiento de la disposiciones contenidas en el artículo 42, fracción i, de la ley federal de presupuesto responsabilidad hacendaria,” april. 4 bi central bankers’ speech sufficiently close 3 percent, sometimes sometimes below. before 2015, inflation persistently run around average 4 percent. low inflation result relatively contain core price increase decline noncore inflation. a surge core merchandise inflation reflect modest effect peso depreciation tradable good prices. at time, core service component remain subdued, benefit persistently fall telecom tariff result competition enhance reform sector. it may also suggest absence significant overall aggregate demand pressure date. fall noncore inflation reflect reduce agricultural price increases, well contraction index energy government-determined prices. short- medium-term inflation expectations, reflect analysts’ surveys, gradually move towards 3 percent permanent target, extract market instrument seem converge target, significant advance light history high inflation.6 some threat consolidation inflation convergence target prevail. upward risk particularly substantial view relatively short time inflation remain anchor target. the big menace may come peso weakness, could result great pass-through misalignment inflation expectations. another risk could emerge aggregate demand pressure, total absorption increased. agricultural price rise may also pick up, revert medium-term average, carry second-round price effects. thus, monetary policy must avoid complacency, remain watch consolidate inflation convergence. results, although recently positive, include guarantee future. in addition, exchange rate consideration view perspective bank mexico’s price stability mandate. for time-consistency considerations, relative monetary stance vis-à-vis unite state continue factor. however, challenge price stability may surface whatever u.s. federal reserve does. hence, monetary policy action independent fed. in case, bank mexico continue act timely decisive way consolidate price stability. conclusion let conclude say mexico’s economic fundamental tested. structural reforms, improve rule law, good security could produce rapid growth medium long term. with financial state pemex weak pose contamination risk mexican sovereign, meanwhile, adjustment fiscal stance welcome development. fortify economic fundamental ongoing challenge policy makers. a recent good inflation performance guaranteed, complacency cannot allow seep monetary policy. pursuit permanent convergence target must continue. 6 see banco de méxico (2016). “encuesta sobre la expectativas de los especialistas en economía del sector privado: mayo de 2016,” june. bi central bankers’ speech 1 takahide kiuchi: recent development economic activity, price monetary policy speech mr takahide kiuchi, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, ishikawa, 23 june 2016. * * * i. economic activity price japan a. the bank japan’s view the bank japan explain assessment current situation outlook japan’s economic activity price statement monetary policy, release monetary policy meet (mpm), outlook economic activity price (the outlook report), publish four time year. therefore, i first give overview assessment current situation outlook base late outlook report statement monetary policy. japan’s economy continue moderate recovery trend, although export production sluggish, due mainly effect slowdown emerge economies. the outlook fiscal 2018 envisage that, although sluggishness expect remain export production time being, domestic demand likely follow uptrend, virtuous cycle income spend maintain household corporate sectors, export expect increase moderately. thus, japan’s economy likely moderate expand trend. a prices, year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi, item le fresh food) likely slightly negative 0 percent time being, due effect decline energy prices, thereafter accelerate toward 2 percent. meanwhile, assume crude oil price rise moderately recent level, time year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) reach around 2 percent – price stability target – project fiscal 2017. thereafter, year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) likely around 2 percent average. b. my personal view i believe japan’s current growth rate inflation rate generally stable, light economy’s growth potential, relatively high probability situation continue projection period april 2016 outlook report. however, express figures, view fairly cautious compare median policy board members’ forecasts. this mainly i believe (1) drive force demand side – include term effect monetary ease – bring economic growth pace clearly high potential; (2) downside risk median policy board members’ forecast term demand home abroad; (3) result factors, output gap expect remain le neutral level, make difficult expect underlie trend inflation rise markedly. next, i mention several point attention regard outlook economic activity price base view. 1. stagnant potential growth rate accord bank’s estimates, potential growth rate japan’s economy, represent supply side – pace growth consistent economy’s 2 bi central bankers’ speech growth potential, still low level range 0.0–0.5 percent. no notable improvement observe past several years, either. in particular, line sluggish rate increase total factor productivity (tfp), reflect technological advances, rate increase labor productivity – considerably affect firms’ wage-setting behavior, turn impact private consumption price – continue stagnant. however, output gap, represent degree utilization capital labor, generally maintain neutral level past several years. this mean japan’s economy continue show stable growth le consistent growth potential. 2. medium- long-term growth expectation business fix investment although business fix investment moderate increase trend, grow strongly expect consider high level corporate profits. i think fact behind situation that, high level profit recent year bring largely improvement price factor cannot necessarily consider sustainable – namely, improvement term trade reflect change exchange rate commodity price – prospect future sale volume improved. in respect, potential growth rate still low level expect improve moderately; therefore, firm may significantly change cautious stance business fix investment domestic market. 3. sluggish private consumption private consumption resilient, i think still sluggish. it seem price-related factor curb private consumption, consumption tax hike price increase food daily necessities, fade away recently. however, wage improve much expected, see fact base pay increase result labor-management wage negotiation spring seem somewhat low level 2015. this lead households’ cautious outlook wages, might one factor restrain private consumption. i would note development wage might attributable persistent concern among firm rise labor costs, include increase base pay, may undermine future situation corporate profit amid lack rise expect productivity growth rate expect medium- long-term economic growth rate. in addition households’ cautious outlook wage arise firms’ stance curb labor costs, future concern root fiscal condition social security system may another factor restrain private consumption among broad range age groups. 4. overseas economy downside risk japan’s export the expectation global economic downturn mount begin 2016 recede somewhat recently, reflect improvement u.s. chinese economic indicator stabilization crude oil prices. however, difficult expect u.s. economy current status act strong drive force global economy. therefore, scenario advance economy lead global economic recovery remain unrealized. in emerge economies, business fix investment weak due excess production capacity excess debt, erode global economy’s current recovery potential. these problem could destabilize global financial markets, particularly adjustment corporate bond market emerge economy may trigger by, example, change flow fund cause u.s. monetary policy. moreover, i pay attention possibility that, global economy show sign slowdown again, bi central bankers’ speech 3 result decline energy prices, grow risk financial front, include (1) adjustment market high-yield bonds, mainly issue energy-related firms, (2) heighten credit risk involve financial institutions’ exposure firms. in light export environment, i continue regard development overseas economy global financial market serious downside risk japan’s economy. 5. development underlie trend inflation since begin fiscal 2016, year-on-year rate change retail price consumer good – mainly process food – tend shift downward. presumably, begin fiscal year, price increase spread much past two year owe (1) depreciation yen come pause, (2) private consumption sluggish, partly due effect irregularly warm weather, (3) pace wage increase remain moderate. under circumstances, i expect year-on-year rate change indicator underlie trend prices, cpi (all item le fresh food energy) cpi (all item le food energy), decelerate somewhat next several months. moreover, i assume year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) reach price stability target 2 percent fiscal 2018, last year projection period april 2016 outlook report. even so, expect decline underlie trend inflation time largely attributable disappearance temporary factor depreciation yen, i expect price generally stay stable. while level underlie trend inflation – represent by, example, year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food energy) – low price stability target 2 percent, i believe cause particular problem current economic activity rate deviate widely firms’ households’ medium- long-term inflation expectations. ii. conduct monetary policy the bank introduce quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) april 2013 qqe negative interest rate january 2016, view achieve price stability target 2 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi early possible time. against decisions, i insist change qqe – include reduction pace bank’s asset purchase – review negative interest rate policy, base examination comparison positive effect side effect measures. furthermore, i think enhancement facility provide liquidity important, order maintain financial system stability secure smooth function financial market financial intermediation. i would like explain organization think behind policy stance. a. rebalancing two mandate bank’s policy the two mandate bank’s policy ensure price stability financial system stability. monetary ease measure recent year – qqe negative interest rate policy – proceed emphasis place price stability, base recognition financial system stability sufficiently secured. i admit financial system assess generally stable present. however, potential vulnerability financial system increase prolong 4 bi central bankers’ speech low-interest rate environment, trend augment large-scale monetary easing. therefore, i think outlook mean optimistic. from viewpoint, i continue cast dissent vote negative interest rate policy since introduction recent mpm hold june 2016. i consider negative interest rate would decrease function financial market financial intermediation, well impair stability jgb market smooth conduct bank’s jgb purchases, therefore interest rate 0.1 percent – rate – apply current account balance exclude amount outstanding require reserve hold financial institution bank. moreover, i think time bank shift focus policy price stability financial system stability. i believe shift eventually benefit bank pursue ultimate goal contribute sound development national economy achieve intermediate objectives, i.e., bank’s two mandates, well-balanced manner. b. necessity maintain sound function financial intermediation in recent years, financial institutions’ profitability – represent operate profit core business – loss-absorbing capacity declining, particularly among regional financial institutions. downward pressure net income also seem increase recently, due part fact profit taking, mainly sale investment trusts, become difficult situation change observe depreciate trend yen increase stock price continue see past several years. furthermore, concern profit environment financial institution might become increasingly severe, mainly due narrow interest rate margin loan great reduction yield security – follow introduction negative interest rate policy – well rise credit costs. in situation, bank may take excessive risk time profit deterioration attempt increase profits, may become excessively risk averse future, mainly loss incur possible worsen economic financial developments. this could negatively affect economic activity financial market exacerbate firms’ households’ borrow constraint banks’ fire sale assets. furthermore, longer-term perspective, impairment banks’ financial soundness might also negative effect efficiency productivity economy. to give example, bank decline loss-absorbing capacity might postpone appropriate treatment borrower weak performance amid continue decline banks’ profitability. this may cause situation capital labor allocate inefficient firms, thus result push rate increase tfp overall economy long term. with point take account, malfunction financial intermediation impairment banks’ financial soundness might push potential growth rate economy, currently low level range 0.0–0.5 percent. monetary policy usually think affect demand side economy. however, policy impair financial system stability, supply side economy – example, productivity growth rate potential growth rate – may also adversely affected, cause loss social welfare. c. concern stability jgb market smooth conduct bank’s jgb purchase since introduction negative interest rate policy, jgb market increasingly unstable – evident heighten volatility jgb yields. i consider exert negative effect stability financial market whole. in situation, bi central bankers’ speech 5 adverse effect smooth conduct bank’s jgb purchases. for example, bid-to-cover ratio jgb purchase operation decline somewhat grow tendency bid rate fall market rates. before introduction negative interest rate policy, financial institution face particular problem sell jgbs bank turn increase fund current account bank interest rate 0.1 percent apply without take interest rate risk. however, give many financial institution attach importance obtain stable income gain rather temporary capital gains, i consider become significantly discourage sell jgbs bank increase fund current account bank. this difference yield jgbs hold financial institution interest rate apply current account bank widen introduction negative interest rate policy. in addition, introduction negative interest rate policy, bank adopt multiple-tier system outstanding balance financial institution’s current account bank divide tiers, different interest rate – include negative interest rate – apply tier. because this, financial institutions, particularly begin introduction policy, tend reduce increase policy-rate balance, negative interest rate applied. a result, proceed purchase jgbs, particularly super-long maturity still offer positive yields, i think one factor behind tighten jgb market condition somewhat unstable conduct bank’s jgb purchases. give this, i consider decline jgb yields, particularly jgbs super-long maturities, since introduction negative interest rate policy necessarily evidence policy exert positive effect stably. i would like note that, increase amount outstanding jgb holdings, bank also increase amount reinvestment jgbs result redemption. thus, even though target pace increase amount outstanding jgb hold remain same, gross amount bank’s jgb purchase increasing. also, fiscal 2016 mark important point consider supply-demand balance jgbs. it year gross amount bank’s jgb purchase expect almost reach gross amount jgb issuance government. this imply become difficult bank maintain pace increase amount outstanding jgb hold solely purchase market equivalent amount jgbs issue government. it consider bank increasingly need purchase jgbs financial institution redemption jgbs amount need maintain pace increase amount outstanding jgb holdings. give this, necessary sufficiently recognize exact time negative interest rate policy – discourage financial institution sell jgbs – introduced. d. future conduct monetary policy my assessment qqe, focus jgb purchases, already exert considerable effect, evidence close negative output gap early stage subsequent correction weak prices. however, i consider additional effect qqe diminishing, give continue decline long-term real interest rates, consider main source policy effects, already come halt. on hand, numerous side effect qqe arise bank’s jgb purchase diminished; rather, seem increase steadily. these side effect include (1) various problem stem distortion jgb market – example, risk instability financial system cause impairment proper function jgb market term liquidity price-discovery function, risk drastic fluctuation jgb price cause revision price financial product assets; (2) limit bank’s jgb purchase increase volatility market case arise concern among market participant 6 bi central bankers’ speech limit; (3) deterioration bank’s financial soundness course normalize monetary policy. under circumstances, i believe that, reduce pace bank’s jgb purchase – annual pace increase amount outstanding jgb hold – balance positive effect side effect qqe could improve ensure stability jgb market. in meantime, bank reduce amount outstanding jgb holdings, possible avoid rise long-term real interest rate – factor lead decline policy effect – thereby firmly ensure accumulate effect bank’s jgb purchases. on basis, i propose since april 2015 reduce annual pace increase amount outstanding bank’s jgb holdings. in proceed reduction, i think possible diminish effect financial market provide thorough explanation, forward guidance, market reduction actually enhance stability sustainability bank’s jgb purchases. moreover, i think measure review negative interest rate policy give due consideration stability function financial market financial intermediation, critical infrastructure economic activity. implementation measure bring efficient resource allocation appropriate operation say functioning, thereby support positive effort government firm toward increase productivity effort lead high potential growth rate ultimately improvement people’s lives. lastly, i believe improve communication financial market enhance flexibility immediate challenge bank conduct monetary policy. a bank emphasize stance achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time, overly heighten expectation additional monetary ease tend observe financial market whenever expectation outlook report present delay project time year-on-year rate change cpi (all item le fresh food) reach around 2 percent. in addition, since introduction negative interest rate policy, view become increasingly widespread bank launch unforeseen ease measure unexpected timing. i presume phenomenon become one factor behind reduce predictability monetary policy increase volatility financial markets, also lead impairment credibility bank’s monetary policy conduct. for reason, i consider important bank thoroughly communicate financial market regard conduct monetary policy bear mind need provide detail explanation narrow perception gap them. in order achieve 2 percent price stability target, i think vital positive change economic structure would increase underlie trend inflation – through, example, effort government firm – considerable period time require take place. therefore, rather aim achieve 2 percent price stability target monetary policy alone short term, i believe reset time frame achieve target medium long term conduct monetary policy flexible manner – couple improvement communication financial market – lead maintain economic financial market stability. this result reach bank’s ultimate goal contribute sound development national economy. bi central bankers’ speech 1 raghuram rajan: the fight inflation – measure institutional development text foundation day lecture dr raghuram rajan, governor reserve bank india, tata institute fundamental research, mumbai, 20 june 2016. * * * i thank tata institute fundamental research invite give foundation day lecture. i always see tifr awe afar. some explanation order. my roommate first year mit dr. renganathan iyer, one smart mathematician i know – use help understand tutorial real analysis. and never miss occasion tell much smart everyone else tifr was. perhaps renga modest, i half expect come today see everyone gigantic head house enormous brains. it relief find that, outwardly, look normal. seriously, however, i think continue success tifr suggest u india want set world class institutions, can. while institute fortunate visionary like dr. homi bhabha found director, institution build collective effort dedicate researcher like all. congratulation job well done! in speech today, i think i would describe effort build different kind institution, one delf deep realm out space tiny constituent atom, one attempt control something affect daily life; inflation. there parallel institution build done, set control inflation, though clearly effort much le tie investigate fabric universe towards influence human behavior. ultimately, require fundamental change mindset. the cost inflation high inflation u india last four decades. most recently, experience average 9 percent inflation 2006 2013. what cost high inflation? clearly, everyone understand cost hyper-inflation, price rise every minute. money hot potato one want hold, people rush straight bank shop buy good case money lose value along way. a people lose faith money, barter good good service become norm, make transact significantly difficult; how much physic lecture would pay taxi driver drive bandra; moreover would taxi driver accept physic lecture payment; perhaps would lecture student, get student sing taxi driver…you get point, transact become difficult hyperinflation render money worthless. hyperinflation also redistributive effects, destroy middle class’ save hold bond deposits. the horror hyperinflation austria germany 1920s still make scary reading. so clearly, one want hyperinflation. but inflation 15 percent per year? haven’t country grow fast period time despite high inflation? the answer yes, perhaps could grow fast low inflation.1 after all, variability inflation increase level, dispersion price fundamental value economy. this make price signal confuse – price widget 1 in fact, seminal paper, fischer (1993) present cross-country evidence show growth negatively associate inflation, causality run inflation growth. 2 bi central bankers’ speech go high demand high generalize inflation? in former case, i sell i produce more, latter case i leave unsold inventory. production investment therefore become risky. moreover, high variable inflation cause lender demand high fix interest rate compensate risk inflation move around (the so-called inflation risk premium), thus raise cost finance. the long term nominal (and real) interest rate saver require rises, thus make long-duration project prohibitively costly. these effect kick inflation noticeably high. so legitimate ask, “at threshold level inflation start hurt growth?” unfortunately, question hard answer – develop country typically high inflation, develop country also high growth. so one might well find positive correlation inflation growth, though mean inflation cause growth. for reason, literature estimate threshold effect beyond inflation hurt growth vast well inconclusive. most study find double digit inflation harmful growth fuzzy single digit precise threshold lies.2 the inflation target nevertheless, give limit evidence, country set inflation goal low single digit – 2 5 percent rather 7 10 percent? three reason come mind. first, even inflation moderate level hurt overall growth, consequence inflation evenly distributed. while high inflation might help rich, highly indebted, industrialist debt come relative sale revenues, hurt poor daily wage worker, whose wage index inflation.3 second, high inflation variable. this raise chance breach give range around target set high level. to extent high target close threshold, make likely country exceed threshold experience low growth. third, inflation could fee high level – high target, chance enter region inflation spiral upwards. the receive wisdom monetary economics today therefore central bank serf economy cause growth best keep inflation low stable around target give government. this contrast early prevail view economics pump demand dramatic interest rate cuts, central bank could generate sustain growth, albeit inflation. that view prove hopelessly optimistic power central bank. there indeed short run trade-off inflation growth. in layman’s terms, central bank cut interest rate 100 basis point today, bank pas on, demand pick could get strong growth while, especially economic player surprised. the stock market may shoot days. but fool people time. if economy produce potential, would quickly see shortage sharp rise inflation. people also start expect central bank disregard inflation (that is, hopelessly dovish accord bird analogy abound) embed high inflationary expectation decisions, include demand high wages. if contrary expectations, central bank commit keep inflation control, may force raise interest rate substantially 2 for example, bruno easterly (1995) suggest 40 percent danger point, beyond increase inflation likely lead growth crisis. in contrast, khan senhadji (2000) estimate threshold inflation significantly slow growth 1–3 percent industrial country 7–11 percent develop countries. 3 accord easterly fischer (2001), “a grow body literature balance-but unanimously-tends support view inflation cruel tax”. bi central bankers’ speech 3 offset temporary growth. the boom bust good economy, average growth may low cut take place. this modern economics also say long run trade-off growth inflation – best way central bank ensure sustainable growth keep demand close potential supply inflation remain moderate, factor drive growth, good governance, take center stage.4 put differently, people say “inflation low, turn stimulate growth”, really understand two side coin. the rbi always set policy rate low can, consistent meet inflation objective. indeed, fact inflation fairly close upper bind target zone today suggest overly hawkish, wise disregard advice past cut deeply. if critic belief interest rate excessively high, either argue government-set inflation target high today, rbi excessively pessimistic path future inflation. he cannot ways, want low inflation well low policy rates. at time, rbi focus inflation exclusion growth. if inflation rise sharply, instance, sharp rise price oil, would sensible central bank bring inflation within target band immediately raise interest rate high kill economic activity. instead, make sense bring inflation back control medium term, is, next two year so, raise rate steadily point bank think would enough bring inflation back within target range. let emphasize prediction either path oil price forecast monetary actions, l i read paper tomorrow “rbi raise rates”. more generally, extend glide path bring inflation check appropriately balance inflation need reasonable growth. argument there many believe totally misguide actions. let focus four criticisms. first, focus wrong index inflation. second, kill private investment keep rate high. somewhat contradictorily, also hurt pensioner cut rate sharply. third, monetary policy effect inflation economy supply constrained, abandon attempt control it. fourth, central bank little control inflation government spend dominate (what jargon call “fiscal dominance”). the wrong index historically, rbi target variety indicators, put lot weight wholesale price inflation (wpi). theoretically, reliance wpi two problems. first, common citizen experience retail inflation, is, consumer price inflation (cpi). since monetary policy “works” contain public’s inflation expectation thus wage demands, consumer price inflation matters. second, wpi contain lot trade manufacture good commodity input basket, whose price determine internationally. a low wpi could result low international inflation, domestic component inflation education healthcare service well retail margin 4 i bite loose here. the short run tradeoff work economic actor surprise unexpected loosening, surprise positive growth effects. in long run, central bank lose power surprise, public embed correct forecast much inflation central bank create nominal variable interest rates. to extent high inflation harmful growth welfare, central bank continuously try give short run positive surprise entrench long run high inflation, bad growth. 4 bi central bankers’ speech non-traded food inflate merrily push cpi. by focus wpi, could delude think control inflation, even though stem largely action central bank elsewhere. in neglect cpi matter common man, consequence domestic monetary policy. the effective real interest rate, investments, save of course, one reason critic may advocate focus wpi low today, thus would mean low policy rates. this short-sighted reason commodity price global inflation pick up, wpi could well exceed cpi. there is, however, subtle argument; real interest rate difference interest rate borrower pay inflation – true cost borrow term good like widget dosas. if policy interest rate set control cpi, may high manufacturer see product price appreciate wpi rate. i sympathetic argument, i also think concern overblown. even manufacturer much price power global competition, commodity supplier even less. so metal producer benefit fall coal ore prices, even though may get high realization metal sale past. the true measure inflation inflation profits, likely significantly great suggest wpi. a second error make attribute component interest rate pay borrower monetary policy. for heavily indebted borrowers, however, large component interest rate pay credit risk premium bank charge risk may get repaid. this credit risk premium largely independent rbi set policy rate. so someone berate u heavily indebted industrialist borrow 14% interest wpi 0.5%, make two important error say real interest rate 13.5%. first, 7.5% credit spread, would significantly low cut policy rate (at 6.5% today) another 100 basis points. second, inflation matter industrialist 0.5% output price inflating, 4% profit inflate (because cost fall 5% annually). the real risk free interest rate experience 2.5%, little high elsewhere world, significant factor stand way investment. far useful low borrow rate improve lend institution borrower behavior bring credit risk premium, try push rbi low rate unduly. the policy rate effect play balance act. a important real borrow rate manufacturer real deposit rate saver. in last decade, saver experience negative real rate extend period cpi exceed deposit interest rates. this mean whatever interest get wipe erosion principal’s purchase power due inflation. saver intuitively understand this, shift invest real asset like gold real estate, away financial asset like deposits. this mean india need borrow abroad fund investment, lead grow unsustainable current account deficit. in recent years, fight inflation also mean policy rate come think depositor could expect reasonable positive real return financial savings. this help increase household financial save relative save real assets, help bring current account deficit. at time, i get lot heart-rending letter pensioner complain cut deposit rates. the truth good past, i try explain previous lecture, i understand upset see interest income diminishing. the bottom line control inflation, monetary policy maker effectively end balance interest investor saver business cycle. at one talks, industrialist clamor 4% rate borrowing. when i ask would deposit rate safe bank, leave alone invest one risky friends, say “no!” bi central bankers’ speech 5 nevertheless, insist cut rate significantly. unfortunately, policy maker luxury inconsistency. supply constraint food inflation contribute significantly cpi inflation, inflation service like education healthcare. some argue, rightly, hard rbi directly control food demand monetary policy. then proceed, incorrectly, say bother control cpi inflation. the reality hard u control food demand, especially essential foods, government influence food supply effective management, control demand other, discretionary, item consumption basket tight monetary policy. to prevent sustain food inflation become generalize inflation high wage increases, reduce inflation items. indeed, overall headline inflation may stay 6 percent recently even period high food inflation, precisely component cpi basket “clothing footwear” inflate slowly. fiscal dominance finally, one reason rbi historically reluctant lock inflation-focused framework fear government over-spending would make task impossible. the possibility fiscal dominance, however, mean give inflation objective set government, government rbi role play. if government overspends, central bank compensate tight policy achieve inflation objective. so long commonly understood, inflation-focused framework mean good coordination government central bank go towards common goal macro stability. i certainly believe responsible recent budget create room rbi ease april. pragmatic inflation focus a understand i saying, monetary policy inflation focus framework try balance various interest bring inflation control. in so, pragmatic rather doctrinaire mindset. for example, emerge market experience significant capital inflow affect exchange rate volatility well financial stability. a doctrinaire mindset would adopt hands-off approach, pragmatic mindset would permit intervention reduce volatility instability. nevertheless, pragmatic mind would also recognize best way obtain exchange rate stability bring inflation level commensurate global inflation. similarly, financial stability consideration explicitly rbi’s objectives, make way rbi keep growth mind control inflation. so rbi’s monetary policy contribute credit asset price bubble could lead systemic meltdown growth collapse, rbi resort corrective monetary policy macro-prudential policy alternative likely prove ineffective. the transition low inflation the period high inflation economy move low inflation never easy one. after year high inflation, public’s expectation inflation slow adjust downwards. a result, le will adjust interest expectation downwards. household financial save increase rapidly fraction overall 6 bi central bankers’ speech household savings, yet significantly fraction gdp.5 some friction interest rate set market also help. even policy rate down, rate pay government small save significantly high bank deposit rates, effective rate tax free bonds. i glad government decide link rate small save government bond rates, rate continuously examine ensure form high floor bank cannot cut deposit rates. all all, bank lend rate move down, commensurate policy rate cuts. the wrong thing time change course. a soon economic policy become painful, clever economist always suggest new unorthodox painless pathways. this problem specific emerge markets, become especially acute since every emerge market think unique, law economics operate differently here. in india, least consistent. flip book cartoon great economist, rk laxman, i find one indicate solution every ill 1997 cartoon published, now, rbi cut interest rate hundred basis points. argument change, clever solution not. decade study macroeconomic policy tell wary economist say try something box. argentina, brazil, venezuela try unorthodox policy depressingly orthodox consequences. rather experiment macro-policy, bring macro risk unprotected poor ill afford, good unorthodox microeconomic policy define business bank environment. not le chance damage go wrong, innovative policy may open new path around old bottlenecks. specifically, part rbi adopt liberal attitude towards bank licensing, towards financial inclusion, towards payment technology institution order foster growth. institution build let return institution building. we get use decade moderate high inflation, industrialist government pay negative real interest rate burden hide inflation tax fall middle class saver poor. what happen today truly revolutionary – abandon way past benefit expense many. a move towards embed institution result sustain low inflation positive real interest rates, require constituency make adjustments. for example, industrialist want significantly low rates, support effort improve loan recovery bank bond market feel comfortable low credit spreads. the central state government continue path fiscal consolidation borrow le thus spend le interest payments. household adjust low nominal rates, must recognize high real rate make save productive. they find worthwhile save finance enormous investment need country. adjustment difficult painful short run. we must get divert build institution necessary secure low inflation future, especially seem make headway. the government take momentous step set cpi base inflation objective rbi well framework set independent 5 data household survey also suggest household financial save move up. for example, two recent financial inclusion survey select state india – financial inclusion insight survey conduct intermedia finscope survey implement small industry development bank india (sidbi) – suggest among individual “who bank account”, fraction save bank deposit increase 60% 2013 98% 2015. of “save money”, fraction save bank increase 67% 2013 93% 2015. of “save money”, fraction “saving home” decline dramatically 90% 2014 6% 2015. bi central bankers’ speech 7 monetary policy committee. in day ahead, new governor, well member committee picked. i sure internalize framework institution set up, produce low inflation future india. the reward many. our currency stable investor gain confidence monetary policy goals, stability improve meet inflation goals. foreign capital inflow reliable increase long maturity buckets, include rupee investments. this expand pool capital available bank corporations. the government able borrow low rates, able extend maturity debt. the poor suffer disproportionately due bout sharp inflation, middle class see save eroded. all await u stay course.

chile, finance commission honorable senate republic, santiago de chile, 6 june 2016. * * * both monetary policy report june 2016 financial stability report first half 2016 find http://www.bcentral.cl. introduction mr. president senate’s finance commission, senator andrés zaldívar, senator member commission, lady gentlemen, thank invitation present central bank chile’s vision recent macroeconomic financial developments, prospect implication monetary financial policy making. this vision contain detail monetary policy report june 2016 financial stability report first half 2016. over last months, economy evolve line estimate march report. inflation decline 4.2 percent annually new baseline projection – i share moment – indicate return tolerance range within months. on economic activity, first-quarter gdp growth outperform march forecast. however, year’s outlook foresee remain potential still quarters. the world economy continue mark expectation federal reserve (fed)’s decision trajectory monetary policy normalization, risk come chinese authorities’ effort meet country’s target growth rates. during quarter, markets’ assessment phenomenon result loosen financial condition compare begin year. most recently, however, trend partly reversed. thus, new baseline scenario assume trade partner post similar growth rate 2015, external lend condition tight commodity price remain long-term levels. in context, hold monetary policy rate (mpr) 3.5 percent annually foresee that, within forecast horizon, increase necessary. of course, contingent incoming information project inflation dynamics. thus, new indicator point high expect inflation, monetary policy need tightened, vice-versa. in case, maintain significantly expansionary monetary stance, remain scenario believe likely. let share work baseline scenario main risk perceive, depict report i present now. macroeconomic scenario a i say before, recent month headline (cpi) core (cpiefe) inflation behave expected. by component cpiefe, good inflation begin show moderate expansion, y-o-y variation go nearly 5 percent end 2015 4.4 percent late figure. this respond largely fact that, despite important fluctuations, exchange rate show comparable increase one mid- 2013 third-quarter 2015. cpiefe service inflation also slowed, still near 5 percent annually, reflect past-inflation indexation effect depreciation. 2 bi central bankers’ speech plus, gap still narrow labor market – despite somewhat fast deterioration lately – still show low unemployment rate strong growth nominal wage (figure 1). so, likely scenario, annual cpi inflation enter tolerance range third quarter year approach 3 percent first half 2017 (figure 2). this projection us work assumption real exchange rate (rer) hover around current value throughout projection horizon. bear mind rer rise little since cutoff date last report, near 97 (index, 1986=100) (figure 3). the convergence inflation also link output gap forecast widen near future labor market adjust year, especially help drive reduction – albeit moderate – service inflation. regard output, first-quarter gdp demand growth figure exceed march expectations, influence improve figure agriculture and, somewhat less, mining. overall, growth outlook essentially unchanged. we expect economy continue grow potential quarters, due mainly poor performance sector close link investment. anyway, worth note retail trade personal service prove resilient, reflect gradual adjustment consumption side. the baseline scenario report see gdp grow 1.25 2.0 percent year 2 3 percent 2017. this estimate base assumption economy resume near-potential growth towards end projection horizon. finally, us work assumption public expenditure follow trajectory consistent fiscal rule administration’s announce budgetary consolidation path. the process growth normalization slow. of particular concern behavior investment, baseline scenario estimate drop third year row. indeed, year several indicators, among survey capital good corporation, level import capital good business confidence, anticipate drop investment. moreover, house sector limit performance highly dynamic 2015, public investment follow trajectory consistent objective fiscal consolidation. however, towards 2017 non-mining investment restart grow pace match recovery overall economy (figure 4). about current account, believe year’s deficit small think march show big change 2017. in particular, trade balance outperform march forecast first quarter, drive mainly volume export goods, especially copper, tourism-related services. furthermore, slowdown capital good import expect adjustment investment. in addition, generally upward revision non-copper export prices. consumption, meanwhile, continue grow around 2 percent. detail domestic economy’s baseline scenario show table 1. in context, foresee adjustment labor market come quarters. lately, annual growth salaried employment slow significantly, 0.5 percent last move quarter. the national unemployment rate adjust gradually, thank increase self-employment, still low historic pattern (figure 5). by regions, north country unemployment rise sharply areas. firm interview may’s business perception report – quarterly publication bank – reveal increase labor availability together low wage claims. look march survey university chile, also see increase unemployment rate great santiago, 9.4 percent, confirm weaken labor market. the evolution employment real wages, slow annual term last year, imply slow growth wage mass. this, couple still low household expectations, consistent positive, yet moderate, growth consumption (figure 6). bi central bankers’ speech 3 turn world economy, i said, international financial market mark two situations. one, u monetary policy normalization process, two, chinese policy makers’ effort achieve growth financial stability objectives. early quarter market assume feed would take thing extremely gradually chinese authority figure policy mix would allow keep growth line objectives. thus, calm financial market begin close last report prolonged. capital flow return emerge world, stock market recovered, interest rate drop spreads, dollar weaken commodity price improved. nonetheless, increase doubt chinese financial system perception u monetary policy soon implement adjustment – still uncertain development – tend reverse trajectory recent weeks. this particularly visible depreciation emerge currency (figure 7). consistently volatility see risk inherent international economy, baseline scenario assume come quarter international financial condition be, average, le favorable past two months. our growth outlook world economy trade partner change little march: 3.2 3.0 percent, respectively, 2016–2017 average. still, significant revision expect u growth: 1.9 percent 2016 (2.3 percent march). this estimate input low output figure first quarter, drop energy investment weak external sector. in case, aside one-time data, service labor indicator show recover trend baseline scenario foresee economy resume high growth 2017. it also estimate chinese economy able carry adjustment process without seriously compromise growth rates. but process free difficulties. the term trade drop 2016, although sharply assume last report, owe mainly evolution non-copper export prices. consider trajectory past months, baseline scenario assume copper price average us$2.15 us$2.25 per pound 2016 2017, respectively. for oil, forecast two year raise us$45 us$52 per barrel brent-wti average (table 2). about monetary policy, baseline scenario describe us work assumption mpr follow trajectory similar one deduce financial asset price statistical close report (figure 8). this mean monetary policy advance normalization throughout policy horizon, line assume economic outlook horizon, little slowly think march. under assumption, monetary policy continue provide boost economy. it important stress monetary policy keep expansionary stance, help economy weather change macroeconomic condition best can. in way succeed accommodate significant depreciation peso inflationary consequence without jeopardize monetary policy’s medium-term anchor: inflation expectation two year out. unlike economies, able sustain expansionary monetary policy without drive inflation expectation away target (figure 9). this expansionary monetary policy notorious market interest rates. on one hand, chile’s long-term rate low historic standard also cross-country comparison. the true lend rates, historic average and, case mortgage loans, even near record low (figure 10). risk scenario a usual, implementation monetary policy respond incoming information project inflation dynamics. therefore, development push either direction prompt necessary adjustment monetary policy. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in world economy, risk pretty much identify march report. still critical trajectory feed choose follow advance monetary policy normalization process. in particular, market expectation still misalign likely scenario define feed itself, especially long horizons. the situation china pose risk possible impact world growth, might trigger new episode financial volatility. latin america also pose significant risk chile, major trade partner investment destination, effect external financial condition face us. it macroeconomic challenge compound complex political situations. in brazil, market take change political scene well, important adjustment pending. argentina return international financial markets, also face significant challenges. there several factor could cause new intensify ongoing episode financial volatility, include uk referendum define whether stay leaf european union, number electoral process way around world could cause shift towards protectionism. however, consolidation economic growth europe unite state could contribute boost world activity. the possibility oil price’s upward trend continue steepen another risk baseline scenario, direct impact local world inflation, implication global growth. but also reason price recede level early months. actually, inventory historically high. at home, although inflation diminish expected, high level many quarter already still important risk baseline scenario. in short term, evolution still closely tie exchange rate therefore risk come abroad. for activity, risk outline previous quarter persist. confidence remain pessimistic chilean economy receive mild impulse world economy early years. the recent evolution labor market stand out. if deteriorate sharply world economy acquire adverse configuration, might result low gdp growth forecast. conversely, labor market make small adjustment and/or external economy remain fairly calm, output may perform good expected. this could translate strong consumption growth favorable investment, both. upon assess risks, estimate risk balance unbiased output inflation. to sum up, macroeconomic scenario is, broadly speaking, march’s. inflation return target range come month output continue post bound growth. investment, however, bad expect before. the external scenario continue present risk new volatility episode probably occur financial markets. now let turn financial stability report (ief). financial stability report our financial stability report release june december year, contain recent macroeconomic financial development might affect chilean economy’s financial stability. this report’s external scenario include risk i describe examine monetary policy report, particularly respect u monetary policy evolution chinese economy. in financial stability report also present brexit-related risks, well difficulty european bank resolve non-performing portfolio problem – legacy global financial crisis – scenario weak world growth estimate global bank industry adapt new regulatory standards. most bi central bankers’ speech 5 recently, scenario become complex banks’ profitability threaten low interest rates. another risk need monitor come month price commodity possible impact country export them. although lately price tend stabilize, still low year back might endanger fiscal revenue economies. in context, various risk-rating agency downgrade sovereign rat oil export countries, revision commodity exporter – chile include – cannot rule out. our rat unchanged certainly good news, let’s forget dynamic process must never let go. the risk exist policy mitigate it. on domestic front, i said, local interest rate low historical perspective, reflect monetary policy external financial conditions. thus, downsloping trend long-term rate continue encourage investment medium- long-term mutual funds, reach high stock volumes. accordingly, significant increase long-term interest rate pose risk agent become magnify channel react hastily sell asset portfolios. a financial situation companies, diverse indicator confirm weaken describe previous reports. a first quarter year, debt-to-gdp ratio remain near 120 percent, relatively high compare emerge economies, although margin stabilize even decline little (figure 11). the financial indicator company report superintendency security insurance (svs) present big change close 2015. however, historical patterns, debt level high profit low. still, exchange rate mismatch indicator continue show limit exchange rate risk (figure 12). the real-estate sector adjust dynamic 2015. new house sale santiago fell sharply first quarter 2016, largely due advance purchase last year (figure 13). a substantial part sale last year account promise purchase unfinished units, schedule delivery mainly next year. in sense, one risk real-estate company stem promise honor economic outlook worsens. finally, vacancy rate office-space sector around 10 percent, rental price show slight reduction end 2015. in context, new house price index santiago estimate chilean chamber construction rise 6.8 percent real annual term first quarter 2016, slightly le 7.2 percent show third quarter 2015. meanwhile, third quarter last year, house price index new use unit calculate bank rise 9.4 9.7 percent real term nationwide santiago metropolitan region, respectively (figure 14). about households, aggregate borrow – debt income ratio, rdi – continue rise, context weak output employment. the rdi reach 63 percent close 2015, largely explain increase share mortgage debt, continue expand real annual rate nearly 10 percent. the aggregate financial burden stand 15 percent sector’s disposable income (figure 15). although non-performing indicator bank consumer credit remain low, lately increase case small amount loans. here risk arise drastic deterioration labor market could hind households’ repayment capacity. any development front need closely monitor come quarters. a banks’ lend activity, evolve line state business cycle. real growth commercial loan line low demand credit firms, consistently 6 bi central bankers’ speech reduction investment result bank lend survey. consumer credit growth recover slightly mortgage loan still grow strongly, around 10 percent real annual terms. thus, real annual growth rate total bank credit around 5 percent. at time, aggregate default indicator stable, despite deterioration commercial loans. a point last financial stability report, bank system’s capitalization level decrease recent years. at close 2015, capital adequacy ratio (car) 12.6 percent. although announce capitalization account change push indicator slightly 13 percent, decline dynamic observe past five years. this contrast international trend, bank increase capitalization several jurisdictions. thus, oecd comparison, chile low part ratio’s distribution (figure 16). although current capital level sufficient absorb possible severe stress scenario, gap narrowed. while every bank’s car exceed 8-percent regulatory minimum stress scenario, share bank car 10 percent scenario drop recent years, le half system’s asset late test (figure 17). let conclude final thoughts. conclude think in past several month macroeconomic scenario bring big surprises, mean challenge absent. inflation drop line expectations, remain tolerance range. our projection indicate month return range decline towards 3-percent target. if so, end quite long period inflation 4 percent monetary policy-making particularly complex, deal significant depreciation currency ensue rise prices, aside economic slowdown. still able keep inflation expectation projection horizon well anchor 3-percent target. in short term, obvious inflationary risks, could push back convergence. a say time again, short-term evolution exchange rate important determinant behavior inflation, therefore short-term inflation affect external risk identify report come true, namely: trajectory feed fund rate well market expect sharp deceleration chinese economy would hit copper price. the medium-term impact event hard predict, depend persistence exchange rate movement effect output. the medium-term effect are, doubt it, important monetary policy, policy framework define short-term inflation deviation tolerable, long project inflation two year depart 3-percent target. this approach allow u keep inflation expectation well anchor apply counter-cyclical policy stance situation like present one. not deny importance this, i must say great challenge face economy growth. in baseline scenario, 2017 fourth year row annual growth around 2 percent, far satisfactory. however, scenario also assume towards end next year country approach potential growth, estimate 3 3.5 percent. this growth trajectory lean three fundamental premises: first, impulse receive abroad, although mild could foresee year back, particularly low. of course would rather live world high copper price two-digit growth china. but hindsight, clearly bi central bankers’ speech 7 unsustainable time. nevertheless, world growth figure see today project next two years, differ much saw 2015. the term trade tend stabilize towards 2017 external financial condition good historic patterns. surely face risks, don’t always. second, macroeconomic standpoint, economy well balanced. the external account good order, fiscal policy sound, inflation expectation remain well anchor and, beyond importance mitigate risk identify financial stability report, local financial market well equip contribute recovery. the third premise return confidence. on point let digress. it good sign goal 3.5 percent growth seem elusive. just couple year ago believe growth 4.5 5 percent possible. after all, last thirty years, chilean economy grow average 5.2 percent annually. certainly many thing happen last thirty year explain this. on one hand, so-called “convergence” economic growth. i mean, country high per-capita income grow le average poor countries, rich one capital close technological frontier, find hard sustain high growth rates. therefore, natural country achieve level development chile grow slow pace three decade ago. on hand specific elements, like end boom commodity price mine investment. also world long boom, u small, open economy touch that. all affect consistent vision low trend growth 3.5 percent. but, trouble achieve level growth? there two – relate – essential element behind, debt: investment productivity. if cannot ensure strong growth investment, projection economic recovery hardly meet labor market deteriorate further. obviously capital major production factor significant effects. but that, investment critical u able achieve productivity growth rate close 1 percent non-mining sectors, essential element trend growth forecast. without investment, technology become gradually obsolete and, importantly, kind shock hit chilean economy recent year require u reallocate resource sector attractive past others must pull growth wagon, especially non-traditional exports. but reallocation, accord research important source productivity growth, achieve time investment new sectors. thus, factor clearly relate other. the question must ask is, do enough promote factors. i believe productivity agenda agree different agent good start point must deepen carry forward. but must also bear mind loss confidence affect country today, beyond specific causes, put brake investment. remember, baseline scenario assume confidence recover. a monetary policy, do bit, interest rate today among low ever remain expansionary throughout projection horizon. monetary policy help smooth business cycle task, successfully i may add. however, source countries’ long-term growth area economy clearly beyond reach monetary policy. it important u understand, agree implement whatever need take leap towards develop country. we must forget region fail experience before. country condition become develop didn’t

020406080100020406080100111213141516 bi central bankers’ speech 1 yves mersch: monetary policy euro area – scope, principle limit keynote speech mr yves mersch, member executive board european central bank, natixis meet chief economists, paris, 23 june 2016. * * * lady gentlemen, the past years, speak present days, challenge one central bank worldwide, euro area exception. the ecb’s monetary policy decision come great scrutiny ever before. some commentator argue ecb sufficient tool counter deflationary pressure euro area. others contend use wide range instrument normal times, ecb exceed remit. neither view correct. our statute allow u use wide range tool meet mandate, tool sufficient purpose. but correct limit far monetary policy go. the ecb cannot, not, need exceed limits. our framework require unconventional tool use long necessary, intensively necessary. within limit independently decide best comply price stability mandate. today, major central bank clear price stability mandate discharge large measure independence. in ecb’s case, price stability mandate enshrine treaty,1 give “instrument” independence carry out. we cannot decide whether achieve objective – obey law – decide so. this position confirm european court justice, rule ecb deploy available instrument explicitly mention statute ensure price stability. but discretion use instruments, though wide, unlimited “whatever takes” qualify “within mandate”. independence must confuse arbitrariness. the treaty also set number restriction principle guide monetary policy. there three particular stand out. first prohibition monetary finance lay article 123, prevent central bank take action would directly finance government spending. we prohibit monetary finance good reasons. if central bank systematically finance government budgets, fall prey so-called “fiscal dominance” fail price stability mandate. that because, inflation start rise, central bank lose-lose situation: either continue finance deficit risk overshoot objective, refuse finance deficit risk deflationary government default. but central bank ex ante forbid law monetary financing, incentive strong government run sound fiscal policy first place – independence central bank preserved. “monetary dominance” prevail “fiscal dominance”. fiscal soundness essential feature monetary union single monetary policy national fiscal policy necessary even achieve fiscal union. what – specific euro area – monetary finance could imply redistribution wealth among member states, thus undermine spirit “no bailout 1 article 127.1, treaty function european union (tfeu). 2 bi central bankers’ speech clause” (art. 125 tfeu). if central bank facilitate regime unsound fiscal policy inflationary government deficits, would inevitably expose loss – either real loss inflation tax, nominal loss reduction principal amount owed. that would tantamount deliberate fiscal redistribution different set taxpayer via central bank’s balance sheet, permissible monetary union fiscal union. in words, prohibition monetary finance monetary counterpart “no bailout clause”. second principle judicial control: principle conferral principle proportionality lay article 5, require action limit essential achieve objective treaties. specifically, mean measure need suitable, necessary proportionate stricto sensu.2 for instrument suitable, need able address respective risk price stability. for instrument necessary, must lack viable alternative instrument. for instrument proportionate stricto sensu, expect benefit outweigh costs. third requirement act accord principle open market economy favour efficient allocation resources.3 all monetary policy measure allocative distributive effects. cut interest rates, example, redistributive impact saver borrowers, since encourage borrow discourage saving. moreover, certain situation – instance panic-induced freeze interbank market – central bank intermediation may critical restore market function support efficient allocation resources. but must always embed understanding, underpin treaty, general market distribute resource efficiently public authorities, hence central bank action blunt price signal overwhelm market forces. indeed, central bank marginal actors, steer marginal decisions, resource allocation mechanisms. that reflect design implementation monetary policy tools. in pre-crisis period, use conventional measures, i.e. interest rate policy, nobody doubt straightforward u respect three operate principle set treaty: • by mainly implement policy refinance operation commercial banks, accuse monetary financing. • our track record show raise low rate effective maintain price stability. • and though monetary policy, include interest rate policy, allocative distributive effects, effect contain predictable. our recent monetary policy measure respect law since onset crisis, however, adopt new, unconventional tool fulfil mandate – naturally bring question scope limit monetary policy fore. clearly, restrict instrument use normal time would breach mandate. it could disastrous consequence euro area economy, threaten ability achieve price stability. but imply reverse – i.e. every conceivable tool would justified. 2 article 5 (4), treaty european union. 3 article 127.1, tfeu. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in line mandate, use broad range instrument independence confront downside risk inflation achieve price stability. but equally, deploy tool line legal framework. and possible specifically design instrument exceed three limit i outlined. take asset purchase programme (app) – include public private sector bond – example. first, app respect prohibition monetary financing, since place number safeguard interventions. we buy government bond primary market, explicitly forbid article 123. and neither act secondary market way could perceive equivalent act primary market. the eurosystem put place blackout period, buy period around date new issuance. purchase also subject issue share limit issuer limit. these limit ensure would constitute block minority collective action clause clause ever triggered. the european court justice explicitly highlight limit decide upon lawfulness actions. second, proportionate, sense necessary suitable secure price stability objective. a short-term interest rate move close effective low bound, inevitably become hard central bank steer economy mean conventional policy. so inflation low long – risk euro area today – tool become necessary. two year ago, govern council introduce several non-standard measure unclog transmission mechanism avoid credit crunch. we coin measure “credit ease package”. in january last year, finally opt large-scale asset purchase face period weak growth, already low inflation rate fall saw risk inflation expectation destabilising. like previous measures, purchase belong category credit easing. to fulfil mandate need make use instrument disposal. the app suitable tool act directly finance cost real economy. rather attempt boost economy short end curve, directly low yield long maturities, decrease compress term premium, turn influence cost credit firm households. third, design programme limit distortion relative price might unwanted allocative distributional consequences. with government bond purchase “mirror market”, mean intervention spread across issuer various euro area country basis ecb’s capital key. together issuer limits, ensure breathe space within across market efficient price discovery. indeed, even though yield low certain sovereign issuers, issuer able place new security market large volumes, suggest liquidity materially affect actions. thus difficult part programme corporate bond purchases, since extend le liquid market increase risk distortion relative price – particular large small firms. but activity cannot evaluate separation; must judge holistic manner. indeed, decline bank lend rate small loan euro area company – mainly small medium-sized enterprise (smes) – strong large loan big companies. this suggest bank lend condition improve disproportionately euro area smes since announcement credit ease measure two year ago. a result, few smes report credit limit factor businesses. this continue measure fully roll reach maximum 4 bi central bankers’ speech impact. in words, app, couple credit ease measures, reduce distortion cause market fragmentation euro area. still, know long unconventional policy lasts, great risk distortion appear diminish effectiveness time. the principle proportionality also imply use measure short time necessary fulfil mandate. that why, economy improve inflation return objective, reassess, adjust ultimately phase purchase programme non-standard measures. but sure way reach point stay true course now. if change speed direction soon, would set back recovery inflation delay day interest rate normalisation happen. we decide upon full independence, interest price stability, impervious wish interest group partial agenda. other policy support speed inflation return 2% can policy help endeavour? in inflationary day 1970s, central banker hesitant scope responsibility let price stability depend others. for example, late 1970s feed chairman report fomc “inflation go leave federal reserve that’s go bad news. an effective program reduce rate inflation extend beyond monetary policy need complement program design enhance competition correct structural problems”.4 but central bank come long way past half century. today central bank take ownership mandate depend others. for example, run headwind create policies, necessary fiscal consolidation, could increase policy stimulus compensate. but policy undermine effectiveness policy disrupt slow monetary transmission mechanism, respond scenario would difficult. in situation repeat support policy would speed return inflation 2%. but must see call ex ante policy mix monetisation public debt mutualisation debt via eurobonds present treaty. this would mean give monetary dominance. rather, economic institutional policy help accelerate impact measures. structural reform reduce transmission lag policy, since flexible, responsive economy likely transmit monetary impulse faster. and institutional reform reduce uncertainty future setup euro area, weigh expectation hold back investment. indeed, see increasingly europe today, strengthen confidence future trajectory union perhaps decisive contribution could make growth. conclusion let conclude. the eurosystem broad discretion tool use deliver primary objective price stability. that objective guide decision tool use, use them, define boundary set legal framework. 4 federal open market committee meeting, transcript, 21 march 1978. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the use additional tool recent time reflect ecb’s commitment deliver mandate. such tool suitable achieve objective necessary combat deflationary headwinds. still, aware – justify – late non-standard measure significant scale. this non-standard measure cannot last forever. they define unconventional design long term. the goal measure make redundant. bi central bankers’ speech 1 vítor constâncio: introductory remark fifth ecb conference accounting, financial report corporate governance central bank introductory remark mr vítor constâncio, vice-president european central bank, fifth ecb conference accounting, financial report corporate governance central banks, frankfurt main, 21 june 2016. * * * good morning, lady gentlemen, welcome fifth ecb conference accounting, financial report corporate governance central banks. this two-day conference dedicate memory niall merriman, head ecb’s financial report policy division, unexpectedly pass away september 2015. a special welcome thank distinguish speaker share think topic cover today tomorrow. this conference well established, demonstrate great interest among central bank around globe, ever increase participation. 1. the conference organise along four main themes: 2. development international account standards; 3. impact account financial regulation supervisory reporting; 4. manage risk central bank balance sheets; 5. governance financial report issue central banks. on first topic, ecb step effort monitor international account development last two years. there two reason underlie this. first, certainly remember, single supervisory mechanism (ssm) become operational november 2014. account information form basis various element prudential regulation supervision. a already highlight ecb report publish december 2006, harmonise comparable account framework important element consistent supervision.1 after eruption financial crisis 2008, g20 call single set high quality global account standard order strengthen credibility comparability financial information. the main aim request alleviate risk financial sector help prevent future financial crises. therefore, ecb support recent activity iasb gear towards achieve objective. second, ecb recently become directly involve european process adopt international financial report standard (ifrs). this major consequence maystadt report reinforce eu’s contribution ifrs standard improve governance european institution develop standards.2 since january 2015, ecb observer status new board european financial report advisory group (efrag) relate technical expert group (teg). 1 ecb (2006), assessment account standard financial stability perspective. 2 maystadt, p. ( 2013), should ifrs standard “european”? 2 bi central bankers’ speech the efrag private association provide technical advice european commission endorsement ifrs standards, well relate interpretation issue international financial report interpretation committee (ifric). the ecb also participate number committee deal ifrs standards, ifrs advisory council, account expert group basel committee bank supervision account subgroup european bank authority. our aim ensure coordinate position ecb relevant account matter duly consider account standard-setting process. the colleague session one provide insight current challenge relation international account standard-setting, role international account standard eu well formal adoption implementation single market. with respect second topic, impact account financial regulation supervisory reporting, i already touch upon mount relevance interaction international account standard prudential regulation supervision follow creation single supervisory mechanism. i confine remark two relate matters: • issue non-performing exposure (npes);3 • regulatory guidance new expect credit loss model interaction prudential capital requirements. the year 2015 first full operational year ssm. one first item ssm’s task list follow result 2014 comprehensive assessment. the comprehensive assessment help u identify problem balance sheet significant banks. one important outcome scale npes classify use harmonise definition. a aware, euro area bank still high level npes balance sheets. in euro area, average ratio npes significant institution stand 7.1% end 2015, high international standards.4 for instance, proxy ratio npes u continue decline recent year amount 1.5% end 2015. a comprehensive policy response high level npes europe necessary, part that, ssm work take stock supervisory best practices. more action need address shortcoming insolvency, collateral taxation frameworks. account standard also important address issue. in us, account standard require u bank reduce, six months, npes market value collateral, any. balance sheet therefore clean bad loan rather swiftly. this illustrate account standard interact supervisory concerns. until now, incur loss model apply ifrs impose timely treatment npes banks. a consequence, npes accumulate banks’ balance sheets, consume capital contribute banks’ profitability. the introduction ifrs 9 2018 change situation. the ecb already publicly express support swift endorsement ifrs 9. in view, new requirement classification, measurement impairment financial instruments, well new general hedge account model, constitute improvement previous requirement ia 39. moreover, believe aspect 3 non-performing exposure (npes) define impair exposure past due (> 90 days) exposures. 4 the ratio non-performing loan refer ratio non-performing loan total gross loans. bi central bankers’ speech 3 new standard may improvement financial stability perspective. the merit new expect credit loss model clearly depend proper consistent implementation financial sector. in perspective, important granular instruction give standard-setters regulatory authority order ensure implementation new standard subject different interpretation would respect proper level play field. at time, crucial monitor application ifrs 9 order ensure unintended cyclical consequence implementation. in us, fasb announce approval similar standard nevertheless start apply 2020. u bank critical major change frontloading provision credit risk. the introduction new standard substantial change affect banks, already subject demand regulation new feature continue add year-end, albeit promise lead “significant increase capital requirements”, state group governor head supervision (ghos). in vein, regulator monitor carefully consequence new standard and, need be, consider appropriate transition period prudential point view. one must forget interaction new account rule ifrs 9 solvency requirement banks. the basel committee currently work area, ecb contribute ongoing basis. against background, ecb also welcome basel committee’s supervisory guidance sound credit risk practice application account impairment model base expect credit losses.5 european bank need consider possible impact guidance plan implementation ifrs 9. hence, confident guidance achieve state objective contribute consistent implementation expect credit loss model across european banks. the second day conference devote “traditional” central bank topic – risk management governance. proper risk management remain high agenda central bank therefore “guiding theme” session three. due extraordinary circumstances, persist low inflation potential effect investment behaviour, central bank worldwide force take extraordinary measures. for example, last year attempt secure return inflation level close 2% medium term, govern council decide expand asset purchase programme. under programme, target level combine monthly purchase public private sector security €80 billion. all measure continue transform central bank balance sheets. in particular, central bank balance sheet expand considerably require risk manager pay special attention possible medium- long-term risks. for reason, risk management become even critical component ecb’s central banks’ daily activities. against background, i happy welcome speaker around globe provide first-hand information extraordinary measure may affect risk exposure risk management central bank worldwide. session four dedicate “governance financial report issue central banks”. discussion credibility central bank intensify last couple 5 bcbs (2015), guidance credit risk account expect credit losses. 4 bi central bankers’ speech years. i leave speaker tomorrow highlight late development areas. i describe specific element recent internal reorganisation ecb gear towards improve quality governance function. firstly, ecb create new position 2015, chief service officer (cso), responsible matter pertain administrative services, it services, human resource finance. secondly, executive board ecb decide create independent finance department, report cso responsible budget controlling, financial cost accounting, financial report procurement. finally, also 2015, ecb decide establish dedicate compliance governance office (cgo) key risk management control function strengthen ecb’s governance framework. the purpose office support executive board protect integrity reputation ecb, promote ethical standard behaviour strengthen ecb’s accountability transparency. to end, new cgo perform activity relate ecb’s revise ethic framework governance activities. lady gentlemen, four session today tomorrow provide representative sample current key topic challenge central bank worldwide. i therefore wish productive inspire conference. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement mr mario draghi, president european central bank, hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament, brussels, 21 june 2016. * * * mr chairman, honourable member economic monetary affair committee, lady gentlemen, i grateful back speak committee second hear year. let first say ecb take note today’s judgement federal german constitutional court. this judgement confirm rule court justice european union conclude omt programme compatible eu law fall within mandate. in remark today, i review state euro area recovery recent monetary policy measure adopt ecb. then, request committee, i discus investment outlook, outline particular action need boost investment demand euro area. economic outlook ecb’s monetary policy a regard economic developments, recovery euro area economy gain momentum start year. it expect proceed moderate steady pace, support solid domestic demand effective pass-through monetary policy measure real economy. consumer benefit still relatively low oil price improve employment prospects. likewise, investment edge up, support high corporate profit favourable finance conditions. look forwards, accord june 2016 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection euro area, annual real gdp expect increase 1.6% year 1.7% next two years. at time, inflation dynamic euro area remain rather subdued. the rate headline inflation slightly negative may expect hover low level come months. while low oil price continue act drag annual headline inflation, domestic price pressures, notably wage growth, also remain muted, reflect persistent economic slack. accord eurosystem staff projections, inflation pick towards end 2016. thereafter, inflation expect increase 1.3% 2017 1.6% 2018, strengthen economic recovery mobilise unused resources. since start credit ease measure june 2014, bank lend rate firm household fall 90 80 basis point respectively, reach historical low april 2016. the growth rate bank credit euro area corporation turn positive 2015. at time, source external finance – net issuance debt security share non-financial corporation – benefit favourable capital market conditions, improve corporate profit increase retain earnings. the ease especially felt small medium-sized company (smes), heavily reliant bank credit. in recent survey access finance enterprise euro area, smes continue report improvement access credit increase willingness bank provide credit low interest rates. new bank credit company increasingly use finance investment projects. 2 bi central bankers’ speech further monetary policy stimulus pipeline. we start corporate bond purchase early month part asset purchase programme. the programme start smoothly, ample purchase volumes. since start 2016, even evidently since corporate bond purchase programme announce march, borrow condition company direct access bond market improve materially. for example, first half 2016 cost market-based debt euro area non-financial corporation decline around 75 basis points. we expect firms, include mid-sized companies, able access source external finance near future market companies’ debt expand deepens. tomorrow start conduct first operation new series target longer-term refinance operation (tltro ii). tltro ii allow bank secure long-term fund attractive condition low deposit facility rate. this ease borrow cost private sector provide additional impulse credit creation. overall, measure instrumental put recovery solid foot thereby secure condition inflation rise towards level close 2% not-too-distant horizon. they underpin revival consumption durable good observe since 2014, finally show robust pick-up non-construction investment. without policy stimulus, growth inflation would significantly lower. our march package, particular, mitigate downside risk euro area economic outlook. additional impetus come measure still early stage implementation. at time, uncertainty remain high downside risk still significant due continue fragile state global economy geopolitical developments. we closely monitor evolution outlook price stability. we stand ready act use instrument available within mandate, necessary, achieve objective. in particular, ecb ready contingency follow uk’s eu referendum. investment euro area after sharp downturn observe financial crisis 2008 renew decline european sovereign debt crisis, real investment euro area begin recover. in particular, business investment undergo welcome recovery since 2013 public house investment recently broadly stabilised. despite positive trends, current level investment still unsatisfactory. the level total real investment euro area remain 10% pre-crisis levels. therefore, action needed, include eu level. the investment plan europe welcome example. while would support extend beyond 2018, success current plan also rest capacity improve investment environment, european national level. only reform area guarantee long-term effects. at eu level – european parliament important role play co-legislator – deepen single market, notably area energy, transport digital economy. we also make full use potential exist single market legislation ensure complete consistent enforcement. strengthen european dimension regulatory enforcement would help lessen complexity, enhance level play field reduce fragmentation product markets. in addition, act decisively make channel save productive investment efficient. the bank union, include ecb micro- bi central bankers’ speech 3 macroprudential role, important role play ensure bank market efficiently allocate resource productive investment opportunity across euro area. progress capital market union also essential develop favourable environment productive investment eu. it help diversify source fund need spur investment – notably smes long-term project – complement bank finance deeper, develop capital markets. the legislative act regard simple, transparent standardise securitisation discuss tangible example eu legislation broaden finance opportunity

central bankers’ speech 1 carolyn wilkins: fintech financial ecosystem – evolution revolution? remark m carolyn wilkins, senior deputy governor bank canada, payment canada, calgary, alberta, 17 june 2016. * * * i would like thank scott hendry, grahame johnson, ron morrow stephen murchison help prepare speech. introduction it exaggeration say midst define moment innovation financial services. some expect new technology cause complete disruption traditional financial institutions, give business household access convenient customize services. entrepreneur also find application well beyond finance, new technology could transform fields, humanitarian aid.1 fintech, term people use refer innovation financial services, create lot excitement, also quite lot hype, depend perspective. google search “fintech” increase 30 time past six years. fintech also attract real money: period, around 100 fintech start-ups canada raise $1 billion funding.2 at global level, almost $20 billion pour fintech last year alone.3 there vast array service deploy canada elsewhere. many may use apple pay google wallet. you may also get investment advice “robo advisors.” there peer-to-peer lending, lend club, even service works. i opportunity participate number fascinate discussion fintech recent month – colleague financial stability board international organizations, well fintech entrepreneur traditional financial institution around world. i tell that, despite hype, one know yet social economic payoff investment be. and early days, one know sure fintech development ultimately mean business model financial system generally. but try figure out. i know interest extend u payment business, undergo transformation. this conference great set offer central banker’s perspective fintech. so i want thank payment canada invitation speak today. the bank canada lot work area. today i explore three point frame think issues. first, fintech potential transform financial system across broad range services. and good thing, lot inefficiency shed. second, although technology may revolutionary, overall effect financial system likely evolutionary. financial institution adapt survive, 1 see, example, d. tapscott a. tapscott, blockchain revolution: how technology behind bitcoin be change money, business, world (new york: portfolio, 2016); mark walport, distribute ledger technology: beyond block chain (london: government office science, 2016). 2 omers ventures, “canadian next-gen financial technology & services,” september 2015. 3 this five time $4 billion invest two year earlier. see r. ghose et al., “digital disruption – how fintech be force bank tip point,” citigroup inc., march 2016. 2 bi central bankers’ speech new service provider become part financial ecosystem. in areas, evolution happen fast, others, transformative technology still developmental hurdle clear. finally, time financial institutions, new entrant policy-makers work together. that best way create right environment modernize financial sector sensibly manage risk arise. this apply many areas. for bank, focus preserve financial stability maintain safe sound operation core payment system canada. change air my first point change definitely air. in many cases, financial innovation simply interest twist exist technology business models. they promise low costs, improve service broaden access. peer-to-peer lend one example. a already see taxi hotel industries, peer-to-peer service challenge traditional intermediaries. this new competition could fundamentally change relationship traditional financial institution customers. from regulatory perspective, main issue relate consumer protection, market integrity rule guard money launder terrorism financing. authority work close significant gap area monitor implication financial stability. then financial service enable fundamentally new technology. a prime example distribute ledger technology (dlt). this technology potential replace entire transaction systems, include core payment systems, offer new products, smart contracts. smart contract agreement write computer code need human intervention executed. this strand fintech could take u uncharted territory. a i explain minute, regulator could face issue relate governance, legal environment financial stability. one might argue financial sector always change fintech case déjà vu. we see important innovation past – credit cards, automate bank machine online bank – revolutionize financial landscape, even provide huge advance convenience consumers. that financial institution remain dominant player adapt changes, often buy emerge competitors, adopt technology reduce access legacy service compel customer adapt.4 i see combination factor point potential great change time. first, customer demand past. they look convenient cheap access financial service well integrate rest online activities. customer expect service personalized, faster, part widespread use smartphones speed new apps push out.5 give accustom people become instant access good services, surprise expect instant access money. that see push 4 j. allen, r. clark j.-f. houde, “market structure diffusion e-commerce: evidence retail bank industry,” staff work paper no. 2008–32, bank canada, 2008. 5 accord millennial disruption index produce scratch, third american age 15 34 believe need bank within next five years. available http://www.millennialdisruptionindex.com. bi central bankers’ speech 3 implement real-time retail payment system nearly major jurisdictions.6 this important point consider modernization canadian payment system. second, see large, well-funded company outside financial space, apple google, start offer financial services. one main advantage traditional financial institution trust build customers. tech giant also wide customer base brand loyalty could help drive adoption. these company use customers’ information exist platform offer attractive cost-competitive service pick away profitable business line financial institutions. the range service offer could grow time. finally, exist financial institution infrastructure become relatively inefficient, new technology reduce barrier entry space. support system date back several decade often interoperable, even within institution. so door competition open. talk evolution this bring second point, kind change expect. traditional player adapt survive, new players. and new technology could truly transformative way go ready prime time. so i expect evolution revolution. since talk distribute ledger – blockchain – let use technology illustrate point. ledger may sound incredibly dull, innovation space game changer past. indeed, invention double-entry bookkeeping credit one factor enable capitalism.7 it make wonder people say distribute ledger 100 year now. let u first remind technology bring table. the exact feature dlt vary, depend need fulfills. at core, computer protocol allow many participant record information single ledger share among users, one see data. a consensus mechanism modern cryptography ensure stakeholder agree entry ledger authentic. the ledger’s key benefit need trust third party guard double-spending expensive process reconcile information ledgers. the best-known application dlt bitcoin, decentralize digital currency. the ledger use currency “permissionless,” mean anyone computer download software, see ledger start authorize transactions. the decentralize aspect technology predict widespread application dlt could revolutionize entire industries. they contemplate alternative futures, one complete disintermediation bank even central banks, state currency replace decentralize digital currencies. i see highly unlikely. people widely embrace digital currency like bitcoin currency cannot outshine competition come serve store value medium exchange. national authority want run monetary policy, could happen national currency digital 6 m. tompkins a. olivares, “clearing settlement system around world: a qualitative analysis,” staff discussion paper no. 2016–14, bank canada, 2016. 7 max weber, one founder modern sociology, describe double-entry bookkeeping essential element modern economy 1904 book, the protestant ethic spirit capitalism (london: routledge, 2001). the economist joseph schumpeter make similar claim 1942 book, capitalism, socialism democracy (new york: harper perennial, 1975). 4 bi central bankers’ speech currency coexist. the bank canada study digital currency closely role issue nation’s currency implication currency could monetary policy financial stability. like many central banks, also research conceptual merit issue electronic money ourselves.8 in fact, potential dlt actually strong application outside digital currencies. we see test case relate payment post-trade processes, include clear settlement financial instrument repos, bonds, derivative equities.9 one interest application syndicate loan market, loan take 20 day go clear settlement process. dlt could reduce seven day provide secure database participant share across distribute private network.10 look single source information would help reduce disagreement make easy comply legal requirements, speed process every stage. we may also see application area trade finance supply chains, information cut across jurisdiction difficult centralize. one estimate suggest dlt could enable bank save much $20 billion year global back-office cost apply cross-border payments, security trade regulatory compliance.11 so easy see private enterprise invest lot money type technology. if venture deliver promises, improvement could extend beyond efficiency cheap processing. transaction could settle almost immediately, would reduce counterparty risk free capital uses. transparency would enhance distribute ledger let participant see entire history transactions. that said, several important issue dlt must resolve benefit realized. first list technical issue relate scalability, consensus mechanism, data privacy cyber security. second, proponent agree governance, challenge stakeholder divergent interests. bitcoin’s recent struggle clear illustration this.12 finally, standard protocols, well solid legal foundation, must establish allow interoperability. protocol may area government contribute. in early day internet, government help develop first network protocols. like internet, many application dlt require global view. application dlt also need become widely adopted. this mean get user move away current network switch dlt networks. usually, people join network, good network becomes, turn entice even people adopt it. a social network like facebook good example network effect – people 8 bank research useful information e-money feature dedicate webpage. 9 for example, digital asset hold one company project way explore use distribute ledger australian security exchange (asx) australian equity market depository trust & clear corporation clear repo transaction unite states. 10 see j. schneider et al., “blockchain: put theory practice,” goldman sachs, 24 may 2016. 11 see santander innoventures, oliver wyman anthemis group, “the fintech 2.0 paper: reboot financial services,” 2015. 12 a bitcoin usage increased, developer propose modify protocol support technology make easy process large volume transactions, bitcoin’s decentralize governance system make difficult agree propose changes. see r. waters, “bitcoin’s future threaten software schism,” financial times, 11 february 2016. bi central bankers’ speech 5 flock service friend use – small challenge compete system already established.13 the final hurdle dlt overcome gain regulatory acceptance comply domestic cross-border law regulations. authority support innovation, bar high, especially core financial services, appropriately so. financial institutions, include canadian banks, work hard test adopt new technology adjust new trends. so bank may look different future, still play major role financial system. it true change could seem revolutionary incumbents. to customers, however, likely seem evolutionary, change visible all. in dimensions, dlt reminiscent voice ip: revolutionary advancement technology cause evolutionary change we, end-users, use phone system. now’s time this bring final point. now time financial institutions, new entrant policy-makers work together. the opportunity cost sit back wait dust settle great. financial institution infrastructure operator make important strategic decision part business want defend grow one want scale back. this urgency come fintech contenders. bank also deal demand regulatory environment exceptionally low interest rate around world squeeze profit margins. bank already spend close $200 billion year it globally, replace legacy system mean difficult critical investment decisions. for bank canada, priority see upgrade make core payment system financial system rely bank oversees: large value transfer system (lvts) automate clear settlement system (acss). these system serve u well, require investment need fully meet oversight requirements. investment also help system good meet modern need participant customers. take acss, example, still handle retail transaction today. it implement 30 year ago, everyone want commodore 64. the ac may forefront 1984, far efficient frontier now.14 cheque take four day clear, information need re-enter manually. now time make core system efficient competitive. for consumer business users, need move close real-time access funds. in ac lvts, need collect rich data transaction and, ideally, make interoperable avoid manually re-enter information. this effort change change’s sake. if leverage exist infrastructure still achieve goals, better. for part, policy-makers regulator need address innovation financial service proactive ways. 13 in recent book, hanna halaburda miklos sarvary illustrate network effect show come play competition cryptocurrencies state-issued fiat currencies. see h. halaburda m. sarvary, beyond bitcoin: the economics digital currency (new york: palgrave macmillan, 2016). 14 j. chapman, j. chiu, s. jafri, h. pérez saiz, “public policy objective next generation cpa systems: an analytical framework,” staff discussion paper no. 2015–6, bank canada, 2015. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the first develop solid analytical framework understand ass benefit challenge something new. this something financial stability board work on. authority make assessment many lenses, include consumer protection, financial inclusion, market integrity, competition policy financial stability. that international group committee payment market infrastructures, basel committee bank supervision, international organization security commission also involved. the bank canada, together domestic colleagues, actively contribute efforts. since fintech global phenomenon, critical regulatory effort global. we must also learn emerging-market economy along areas. while fintech innovation promise solve current problems, could also create new ones. let give example: i worry network effects, underpin success many payment applications, could lead excessive concentration payment service providers. if happens, household business may benefit cost savings. this clearly issue competition authorities. it also issue financial stability “too big fail” could emerge new form outside current regulatory perimeter. once again, payment great example. i worry player cover currently regulation could become important system even never take bank-like risks, maturity transformation leverage, become big enough consider systemically important. the move increase direct access mean even small player could well create critical dependency within financial system, particularly connect directly core payment infrastructure. this could give rise moral hazard. at minimum, authority need put large enough weight operational dependency look systemic importance, particularly light cyber risk. when payment system grow prominent systemically important, bank canada’s job oversee it. even reach point, regulatory measure consider address specific issues, operational resilience consumer protection.15 i also wonder dlt-based infrastructure could affect financial ecosystem. ever-increasing automation through, say, smart contracts, could increase efficiency certainty could also increase financial volatility. would volatility short-term, flash crashes? or would entail procyclical dynamic new channel contagion? there also question whether regulatory perimeter adequate, give new entrant risk regulatory arbitrage. in view, field inquiry include inherent risk systemic importance activity, regardless entity perform it. even strive implement regulatory response proportionate risk, need keep mind maintain level play field important. some issue different authority face work shadow banking, another area new entrant challenge traditional players.16 and, big small, operational risk deserve much great attention. the second way address innovation financial service active engagement authority private sector. some countries, unite kingdom, australia singapore, create official regulatory “sandboxes.”17 these sandbox allow start-ups experiment service without jump usual regulatory hoops. 15 the federal government conduct consultation issue 2015. see “balancing oversight innovation way we pay: a consultation paper,” department finance canada, 13 april 2015. 16 for discussion issue shadow bank sector, see t. lane, “shedding light shadow banking” (speech cfa society toronto, toronto, 26 june 2013). 17 see “consultation paper fintech regulatory sandbox guidelines,” monetary authority singapore, 6 june 2016. bi central bankers’ speech 7 here canada, consult fintech entrepreneurs. the bank canada also partner payment canada, canadian bank r3 – lead consortium financial institution – test drive distribute ledgers. our goal stage understand mechanics, limit possibility technology. the plan build rudimentary wholesale payment system run experiment lab environment. our experiment include simulate settlement asset use medium exchange within system. it much like settlement balance lvts, except use dlt. because cannot use anywhere else, different animal altogether digital currency widespread use. this experiment true sense word. i cannot think good way understand technology work it. other framework need investigated, many hurdle need clear system would ever ready prime time. the third way address innovation proactively fundamental research effect new technology.18 the bank canada’s research past year focus new payment methods, adoption competitiveness digital currencies, essential benefit private e-money.19 we continue work broaden include developments, peer-to-peer lend us dlt. we also want understand new financial technology address underlie force create need financial intermediation first place. in theory, new technology could enable different framework address frictions, potentially one require financial intermediary all. the name face may change, i see technology change need maturity transformation, loan monitoring, intermediation borrower lenders, trust. this good question academics. conclusion let wrap up. while important filter hype surround fintech, i convince could net positive impact financial system, provide risk adequately managed. fintech likely entail evolution revolution. this incumbent financial institution adapt, new player join financial ecosystem strong business model survive. and fundamentally transformative technology far – dlt – still important hurdle clear. innovation may solve current problems, could also create new ones. the regulatory framework need adapt door open unmanaged financial operational risks, unchecked critical dependency within financial system moral hazard. promote financial stability core function bank canada, take system-wide perspective monitor risks. there lot hard work ahead, need get it. by work together, unlock full promise fintech ensure smooth evolution tomorrow’s financial system – safe, sound serve people rely it. 18 for discussion possible effects, see d. andolfatto, “monetary policy implication blockchain technology,” 1 may 2016. 19 see, example, w.e. weber, “a bitcoin standard: lesson gold standard,” staff work paper no. 2016–14, bank canada, 2016; n. gandal h. halaburda “competition cryptocurrency market,” staff work paper no. 2014–33, bank canada, 2014; j. chiu t.-n. wong, “on essentiality e-money,” staff work paper no. 2015–43, bank canada, 2015. bi central bankers’ speech 1 philip r lane: technological innovation financial service address mr philip r lane, governor central bank ireland, financial service ireland ibec annual lunch, dublin, 16 june 2016. * * * the long-term economic social implication technological innovation widely debated. the international central bank community devote considerable effort assess future productivity trends, opinion divide techno-optimists consider current wave technological innovation generate limit macroeconomic gain compare previous wave innovation nineteenth twentieth centuries. today, i wish focus narrowly opportunity risk pose technological innovation financial service industry. a financial regulator, central bank ireland must try anticipate shift financial service landscape, view implication regulate firm industry and, indeed, implication capacity deliver mandate relation preservation financial stability protection consumers. while recognise posse crystal ball, bank consider effect risk potential innovations. to end, seek understand: (i) driver technological innovation; (ii) possible outcomes; (iii) associate risks; (iv) preparedness financial firms. i consider area little detail. 1. driver technological innovation financial sector several force work drive technological innovation financial sector. first, challenge face exist business model identification opportunity associate new technology push pull factor build momentum technological innovation. second, consumer increasingly move online relation wide range personal retail activities, market financial service naturally evolve direction, incumbent provider financial service possibly face competition online firm build strong relationship consumer areas. the ongoing digital revolution pose fundamental trade off incumbent firms, give burden legacy infrastructure cost bases. however, perspective consumers, potential increase competition new entrant may help reduce cost increase choice provision financial services. individual firm sector grapple technological innovation different way different perspectives, many welcome associate challenge opportunities. it inevitable winner loser associate technological innovation, among incumbent firm new entrants. 2. potential outcome financial sector i strike conflict force work reshape structure financial sector. in one direction, economy scale scope may result high degree consolidation across financial service providers. for bank sector, would reverse retreat domestic market follow onset financial crisis 2007 / 2008. in addition scalability successful new technologies, another factor support consolidation significant fix cost meet contemporary international regulatory requirements. whether next wave consolidation require cross-border m&a activity 2 bi central bankers’ speech questionable, since need acquire national franchise operate cross-border basis significantly reduce freedom service legislation, move single supervisory mechanism bank euro area increase harmonisation regulation non-bank financial firms. in direction, force may lead increase fragmentation provision financial services, specialist provider increase level competition individual market segment threaten integrate model universal banking. in particular, possible envisage increase role specialist firm target particular niche service cherry pick higher-margin business lines. a third pathway development partnership large incumbent new financial technology providers, partnership focus complement exist service offer develop entirely new category financial services. it possible outcome occur simultaneously. consolidation may drive big player across europe seek drive cost continue low-interest environment, move fee-based business model compete across border freedom services. at time, new entrant may grow offer niche service offerings, different newly-conceived delivery channels. whatever outcomes, resolution plan throw sharp relief, view potential financial stability risk associate failure larger, establish firm elevate likelihood failure smaller, newly-formed, mono-line enterprises. orderly resolution regime enable financial system absorb failure individual firms: especially period innovation, “zero failures” objective appropriate. 3. risk this bring myriad associate risks. i start financial stability perspective, need consider risk incumbents. an increase competition across sector may result reduce income (for example, squeeze margin reduce fee income) result profitable business line target new competitors. at best, respond threat effectively, include back wrong horses, may reduce role utilities, low income high cost due legacy infrastructure capability issues; worst, incumbent may fail altogether. these risk may well result demise certain type business model category financial service providers. a byproduct may loss access critical financial service cohort society. the former may acceptable even desirable, externality failure managed. the latter may highly problematic relation consumer welfare implication social cohesion. technological innovation may also generate new risk consumer relation innovation market delivery financial service result new category mis-information mis-selling. risk exposure handle storage customer data also pose challenge new entrant exist firms. accordingly, technological change present multiple operational risks, relation intrinsic characteristic new technology term implementation risk. high probability low impact human risk replace low probability high impact technology risk associate operational failure threat devastate cyber crimes. bi central bankers’ speech 3 4. preparedness it difficult manage mitigate diverse risk associate uncertain environment. a regulator, experience regard awareness preparedness regulate firm change environment mixed. it clear firm consider risk coherent, consider appropriate way embrace technological opportunity calibrate manner. however, many firms, include entity damage crisis still deal legacy issue past, le well prepared, perhaps le able invest new technology improve process reduce cost and, consequently, le able cope. the fundamental run business well prudent manner remain critically important financial service sector continue evolve. strong governance, clear strategic planning, effective embed risk management, careful shepherd resource vitally important time innovation time great stability. regardless future shape financial service sector, lesson recent financial crisis remain critical must inform policy framework policy action future. role central bank ireland a regulator, bank also ensure keep abreast change technological environment able ass level preparedness regulate firms, authorisation process ongoing supervisory engagement. this quite challenging, particularly give uncertainty future structure financial sector. in many respects, challenge firm authorise, regulate supervise: also need adapt evolve ensure continue effective capacity understand benefit risk financial innovation. regulator also embrace technological advance contribute positive regulatory outcome develop good tools, undertake good analysis “big data” identification financial risk allocation regulatory resources, incorporate improvement key risk management tools, use identity verification technique provide assurance implementation anti-money launder processes. to end, bank commit significant resource improve data architecture establish quantitative analytical team banking, insurance market directorates. let highlight four primary challenge regulatory treatment financial innovations. first, relation authorisation new firms, regulator must strike appropriate balance encourage innovation-related entry ensure new firm sufficiently ready fulfill regulatory obligation relation financial stability consumer protection. second, supervise exist firms, regulator must make measure judgement call relation shift business model appropriate level capital require provide buff vis-à-vis associate risks. third, note earlier, credible effective resolution regime necessary manage failure establish new firms. fourth, increase scope cross-border delivery financial service reinforce importance international regulatory harmonisation cooperation, especially home host regulatory authority different supervisory responsibilities. furthermore, technological innovation may also alter role central bank manage money supply act lender last resort. at one level, growth various type electronic payment technology look set reduce traditional role note coin monetary system. at another level, much discussion relative merit widespread adoption private-sector digital currency versus new role central bank direct issuance management publicly-backed digital currencies. alas, beyond scope today’s speech pursue fascinate topic detail. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in conclusion, challenge policy maker understand attempt appropriately regulate evolve financial service landscape, time balance often-competing objective competition choice, financial stability, effectiveness macroeconomic policies. we remain vigilant alive challenges, expect similar attitude regulate firms. to state easy, deliver difficult. i wish well endeavour navigate phase technological innovation financial services. acknowledgements: i thank anna lalor, anne-marie mckiernan ed sibley input speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 mark carney: enable fintech transformation – revolution, restoration, reformation? speech mr mark carney, governor bank england chairman financial stability board, lord mayor’s banquet banker merchant city london, mansion house, london, 16 june 2016. * * * give tragic murder jo cox mp 16 june, mansion house dinner lieu speech, governor pay tribute m cox high standard public service represent throughout life. 1. introduction my lord mayor, chancellor, my lords, lady gentlemen. let begin thank andrew bailey outstanding record public service 31 year bank england. andrew extraordinary public servant devote entire professional life serve people unite kingdom. during career, work across bank’s policy areas, combine leadership innovation deliver consistently bank’s policy objectives. his work help manage crisis develop post-crisis regulatory framework exemplary. he make prudential regulation authority (pra) highly respect effective regulator build team exceptionally dedicate colleagues. i would like thank andrew counsel support since i join bank wish every success steer financial conduct authority (fca) vital time history. i admire commitment ensure uk’s financial system serf real economy i look forward continue work closely future. although bank place purdah, duty never cease. the people unite kingdom, via parliament, confer tremendous responsibility bank. these remit must pursue continuously, independently transparently. the independence bank england heart integrity financial system. and bank’s independent conduct monetary policy vital ensure price stability support strong, sustainable balance growth across unite kingdom. transparency hallmark modern central bank democratic accountability. today, consistent statutory responsibilities, nine-member independent monetary policy committee (mpc) announce late monetary policy decision. the publish minute meet contain, should, carefully calibrate precisely word description mpc’s deliberations, adjustment outlook, include assessment major risk economy. the minute also note wide range contingency plan bank put place support market function financial stability around referendum. if already do so, i recommend read them. let move short term medium term. for whiff revolution air. 2. the promise fintech bliss dawn alive; young heaven! 2 bi central bankers’ speech to advocates, wave innovation sweep world financial technology promise nothing short revolution. ‘fintech’ herald dawn narrow bank portfolio optimisation. it change nature money,1 shake foundation central bank deliver nothing le democratic revolution use financial services. revolution always abrupt, sometimes origin remain obscure. in note possibility start twentieth century, keynes remark “the inhabitant london could order telephone, sip morning tea bed … various product whole earth … adventure wealth natural resource new enterprise quarter world…; [or] decide couple security fortune good faith townspeople substantial municipality continent fancy information might recommend…” such global portfolio management make possible technological development stretch back decades, range ‘pantelegraph’ 1860s – capable transmit signature verify bank deposit – cable bury deep beneath atlantic could transmit eight word minute. such remote trade confirmation low latency make flash boy day possible. the financial globalisation innovation enable build much earlier, simpler, profoundly transformational development: ledger. for finance without ability record transactions, balances, obligations. money credit, universal instrument commerce, could exist without fundamental financial technologies, allow debit credit net off; debt circulate currency; money replace memory; it, trade expand exponentially. how much progress since keynes’ bed-ridden globalisation? replace “telephone” “tablet” “tea” “soy latteccino” start twentieth century twenty first, century opportunity long limit men denizen city. nonetheless, finance continue arrange around series hub like brokers, clear house exchanges; whereas, domains, people form connection directly, instantaneously openly, revolutionise consume, work, communicate. the extent finance continue democratise transform depend superficially arcane, fundamentally vital, enable technologies. the emergence mobile telephony, ubiquity internet, availability high-speed computing, advance cryptography, innovation machine learn could combine enable rapid change finance – area economy. the ledger, stone, wood, paper – always centralise – digital may become distributed. fintech potential deliver resilient financial infrastructure, effective trade settlement, new way encode, share analyse data. for financial sector, could offer shorter, speedy transaction chains; great capital efficiency; strong operational resilience. for consumers, could mean choice; better-targeted services; keen pricing. for everyone, fintech may deliver inclusive financial system, domestically globally; people good connected, inform increasingly empowered.2 1 especially balance inside money (created commercial banks) outside money (created central banks). 2 fintech could play role help address worry decline provision correspondent bank service support cross-border payment settlement. half emerge market develop economy jurisdictions, three quarter large bank majority local regional respondent bank recently report decline services. know-your-customer utility potentially distribute ledger technology bi central bankers’ speech 3 these benefit spring fintech’s potential deliver great unbundling bank core function settle payments, perform maturity transformation, share risk allocate capital. this would mean revolution, fundamentally re-shaping financial system. at time, financial technology could make incumbent bank efficient profitable, reinforce exist economy scale scope banking. this would mean restoration, reinforce incumbents’ power. the balance force may yield third alternative – reformation – diverse, resilient effective system consumers. one large bank exist alongside new entrant compete across value chain. tonight, i want discus fintech could affect bank england’s policy objective role enable fintech meet promise people serve. i begin former. 3. the potential impact fintech financial monetary stability fintech potential affect monetary policy transmission, safety soundness firm supervise, resilience financial system, nature shock might face. it could also profound implication bank’s secondary objective, supervisors, facilitate effective competition firm regulate. the impact firms’ safety soundness depend several factors. by make wholesale retail settlement fast capital allocation efficient, fintech could boost banks’ return therefore viability. already, fintech spur new entrant include payment providers, peer-to-peer lenders, robo advisors, innovative trade platforms, foreign exchange agents. this could, time, unbundle traditional bank model deny bank traditional economy scale scope. the systemic consequence fintech even complex. more diverse business model alternative provider positive financial stability. by allow good credit screen le adverse selection, fintech could improve risk assessment, credit allocation, capital efficiency. but encourage herd common information, trade position could become correlated. and switch cost fund market fall, liquidity risk could rise systemic risk grow. indeed, sometimes i hear democratise finance, spread risk capital-light originate-to-distribute models, i think i haven’t excite since advent sub-prime. fintech could also affect conduct monetary policy. unbundled bank would change role bank capital fund cost credit channel monetary policy. if fintech enhance participation financial markets, wealth channel monetary policy could strengthen. more broadly, big data technique could tell u state economy accurately promptly. forecast performance could improve, akin forecast improvement good measurement atmospheric condition has, time, deliver meteorologists. may help low compliance cost major bank say factor decision withdraw correspondent banking. and time, fintech may broaden pool non-banks able provide individual company viable alternatives, bank continue act gatekeeper payment settlement central bank money. 4 bi central bankers’ speech my forecast fintech’s consequence bank’s objective become fully apparent time. many technology need deliver transformation nascent – scalability compatibility untested beyond proof concept. moreover, bar displace incumbent technology high. nor bank england take risk resilience core system. disruption won’t come either easy cheap. 4. enable fintech transformation we actively explore new financial technology could support policy objectives. there five way bank enable fintech transformation. the first widen access central bank money non-bank payment service providers, know psps. 3 a internet revolutionise commerce, make trade fast market competitive, payment technology lag many countries, although worth remember uk global leader real-time retail payments. fast payment (fps) one early real-time retail system introduced, 2008. now, new entrant establish player seek provide payment service instantaneous, secure, reliable accessible anytime anywhere.4 retail consumer firm increasingly demand payment complete seconds, hour days. they expect payment seamless, reliable cheap whether recipient overseas street. and expect make payment without visit bank branch even log onto desktop computer. similarly, companies, financial intermediary government want process ever large complex bulk payment cover multiple systems, country currencies. central bank lie heart payment systems, give household firm assurance transaction settle secure form payment: central bank money. to fulfil role, payment infrastructure need remain fit purpose: reliable, resilient robust. but must also responsive change payment demands. so early year bank announce would draw blueprint replace current real-time gross settlement (rtgs) system, twenty year old. 48 institution currently settlement account rtgs. all user system settle across rtgs access settlement via one four agent banks.5 these user include 1000 non-bank psps serve customers’ increasingly demand standards, many rely major uk payment schemes, particularly fast payment (fps). a grow, psps want reduce reliance systems, service levels, risk appetite goodwill bank competing. re-selling service ultimately provide bank limit firms’ growth, potential innovate, competitive impact. 3 these psps include firm grant status either e-money payment institution uk. 4 example include from stripe square, paypal ripple, applepay zapp. 5 indirect access remove need build costly payment infrastructure – potentially large fix cost young companies. bi central bankers’ speech 5 that i announce even bank intend extend direct access rtgs beyond current set firms, allow range non-bank psps compete level play field banks. 6 by increase proportion settlement central bank money, diversify number settlement firms, drive great innovation risk-reducing payment technologies, expand access bring financial stability benefits. it also enable efficient, effective inclusive payments, include way cannot fully anticipate. it one-way street, however. a extend access, safeguard resilience three ways: hold settlement account holder appropriate standards; remove legislative barrier non-bank access; design right account arrangement new entrants. i please fca hmrc, together supervise institutions, commit develop strengthen supervisory regime apply rtgs settlement account, give assurance non-bank psps safely take place heart payment system. and i welcome chancellor’s commitment tonight make necessary legislative change ensure new entrant access rtgs safely efficiently.7 by extend rtgs access, objective increase competition innovation market payment services. to ensure psps disadvantage relative bank offer equivalent payment services, bank intend give appropriate remuneration balance psps require hold overnight support payment activities.8 the second way bank enable fintech transformation open provide access central bank money new form wholesale security settlement. security settlement lifeblood modern wholesale financial market – associate payment account fully half rtgs’s daily settlement flows. however, retail payments, security settlement ripe innovation. a typical settlement chain involve many different intermediaries, mean security settlement comparatively slow. transaction take nanosecond execute settle days. this also mean large cost

real issue face u policymakers, together valuable ‘first client’ reference come it. with time, accelerator build network firm work space benefit u alike. how help us? consider bank monitor risk threaten operational resilience uk financial system. at financial policy committee’s instigation, work authority encourage firm improve cyber defences. over past two years, twenty-three firm undergo

trend systemic risk economy. much data collect rightly subject strict limit confidentiality sharing. for example, regulatory mortgage contract data come strict control guarantee personal data protection. we can’t share private data access external researchers, foreign authority even across bank. but mean that, simply put, people unite kingdom get data bank collects. 11 for discussion see broadbent (2016), “central bank digital currencies”, available at: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/pages/speeches/2016/886.aspx. 12 this allow efficient check firm’s cyber defence akin way policeman could walk house observe, outside, security feature – whether gate locked; whether alarm; whether window leave open; route intruder might use gain access property; on. 8 bi central bankers’ speech that’s investigate way anonymising de-sensitising data – fully respect privacy law without lose analytical content – allow wide sharing. progress encourage create prospect good inform policy making.13 these two example big programme collaboration bank technology innovators. we open collaboration tomorrow provide detail next steps. finally, bank calibrate regulatory approach fintech developments. fintech neither wild west strangle birth. the bank devote considerable resource ensure whatever develop sustainable, ephemeral. if fintech enable great unbundling financial services, risk change tandem. our interest ensure safety soundness banks, protection insurance policy holder resilience financial ecosystem whole change risks. it activity labels. that bank engage fintech firm understand good financial stability risk could emerge bank re-shaped. we monitor arise along transition path could endure. where firm activity become systemic risk real economy grow, come within purview bank’s responsibility stability system whole. the financial policy committee continue monitor scope regulatory perimeter. adjustment follow necessary. when fintech company fall within remits, monitor proportionate way approach firm – back analytics judgement, take action appropriate. we build system allow orderly failures. not end blatant unfairness too big fail, also foster industry dynamism good outcome consumers. after all, ease exit promote ease entry. we won’t discourage avatar preserve dinosaurs. 5. conclusion will fintech mean restoration, reformation, revolution finance? through regulatory approach, widen access rtgs, facilitate technological development, bank help enable sustainable fintech reformation. this promote uk’s monetary financial stability mean good financial service firm households. with time, fintech could mean open, transparent, democratic global financial system. a host world’s great financial centre, room, city, country stand gain tremendously. the bank play role enable blissful dawn unfold; set bud rise rise full blown. 13 more broadly, sir charlie bean’s independent review economic statistic highlight impact economic data

role central bank pre-requisites sustainable growth europe keynote speech mr yannis stournaras, governor bank greece, 33rd international financial law conference “financial stability growth: role central bank pre-requisites sustainable growth europe”, co-presented iba bank law committee iba security law committee support iba european regional forum, athens, 20 may 2016. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure today opportunity share think financial stability europe. systemic financial stability critical condition achieve common goal prosperity sustainable growth. at outbreak international financial crisis 2008, central bank regulatory mechanism lack well-tried toolbox contain systemic instability prevent build-up. with measure take mechanism establish subsequent years, picture change substantially, market participants, regulators, supervisors, macroprudential authority others quickly deal challenges. not see transformation bank supervision creation european bank union three pillars, single supervisory mechanism, single resolution mechanism still-to-be-implemented common deposit guarantee scheme, also see increase recognition importance systemic stability role macro-prudential policy play foster it. traditional bank supervision focus individual institution prevention management isolate instance bank failures. macro-prudential regulation, contrast, focus system whole largely seek prevent systemic instability limit consequence systemic distress macro economy. but financial stability crucial growth, crisis also teach u growth crucial financial stability. sluggish growth euro area, spite unprecedented monetary policy loosening, weaken european banks, least rise npls, thus hamper ability finance real economy. in order explore ideas, i initially examine new role central bank tool – indeed, still – develop attempt strengthen resilience financial system. development eu regulatory framework area discussed. i outline challenge ahead and, finally, provide think euro area growth. a. central bank macro-prudential policy the challenge face eu financial sector recent year significantly increase responsibility central bank area crisis prevention. mandate amend explicitly refer financial stability core central bank task. thus central bank charge limit system-wide distress and, ultimately, avoid negative consequence real economy. in past, think necessary separate monetary policy task provide financial stability. it think price stability market good service would sufficient ensure financial stability asset markets. experience dispel belief show business cycle financial cycle necessarily synchronized; long period disconnect two cycle 2 bi central bankers’ speech materialize. in particular, financial cycle tend large amplitude low frequency normal business cycle. macro-prudential policy bridge gap traditional micro-prudential supervision individual bank monetary policy. it objective are, first, enhance resilience financial institution entire financial system, and, second, smooth financial cycle. in regard, macro-prudential policy allow monetary policy focus maintain price stability, micro-prudential supervision focus individual institutions. in way, macro-prudential policy enhance institutional separation one principle architecture euro area. whilst separation important, usefulness coordinate policy forget – whether coordination specific policy across different country (as happen wake failure lehman brother simultaneous cut policy rates) coordination policy within one jurisdiction. respect independence various authority involve secure financial stability imply separation lack coordination. b. the macro-prudential toolbox development eu financial regulatory framework if macro-prudential policy effectively curb financial cycle, essential tool deal credit-real estate (or whatever asset) relationship. there two way deal relationship. the first impose restriction credit institution – example, capital-based measures. the second limit degree household non-financial corporation take leverage. with regard credit institutions, capital requirement regulation (crr) directive (crd iv) play prominent role set prudential standard eu. implementation ongoing expect complete 2019. from january 2016, countercyclical capital buff (ccb), systemic risk buff (srb) systemically important institution (osii) buffer, three important macro-prudential tools, operational. however, give need diversify available tool beyond regulation base capital, tool base liquidity, leverage fund source also introduced. with regard borrower’s side, instrument loan-to-value (ltv), loan-to-income (lti) debt-service-to-income (dsti) limit consider among effective macro-prudential instrument curtail excessive credit growth build-up unsustainable debt positions. in order effectively moderate financial cycle, time-varying dimension crucial design various ratios. for example, loan-to-value ratio low expansionary phase financial cycle raise contractionary phase, respect mandate financial stability avoid build-up systemic risk. otherwise, risk pro-cyclicality since leverage constraint decline asset price rise. it imperative, however, macro-prudential toolbox enhance innovative tool beyond outline above. cyclical systemic risk arise result excessive credit expansion (an issue address countercyclical capital buff along limit borrowing) also inadequate channel credit keep real economy under-financed extend periods. a lesson draw crisis focus rather narrow area financial activity. nowadays, important focus risk might miss interlinkages sectors, thus explore financial system influence, influenced, wide economy. in euro area, evidence limit finance real economy, consequence euro-area investment recover pre-2008 level despite ecb policy directly aim increase lend bank sector. bi central bankers’ speech 3 c. challenge ahead way forward challenges, course, remain. let point relevant macro-prudential supervision systemic stability. 1. a first challenge relate issue increase burden comply new regulatory framework assess cumulative impact. i refer additional capital adequacy requirement rather plethora new measure apply one institution. in pursuit make bank robust, liquid, responsible transparent, huge progress regulate supervision operation achieved. however, estimate cumulative impact regulations. i welcome look forward report impact capital requirement economy; however, impact regulation also examined. we need keep mind principle proportionality, general principle eu law. a new regulation accumulate, come cost well benefits. policymakers need watchful that, attempt limit externalities, inadvertently create new externalities. the financial sector ultimately exist serve real economy. it likely trade-off ensure financial stability impose burden financial sector cease able job, namely intermediate surplus deficit unit economy order encourage long-term investment growth. thus develop method judge appropriateness indicator tools. since many regulation apply last years, is, period acute financial stress, i expect come year need reassess regulation perhaps conduct fine-tuning. similar argument apply national option discretion new regulatory framework. 2. closely relate previous challenge degree regulatory development front-loaded. the regulation often long phase-in period new version regulation develop previous version fully implemented. supervisor tend compensate long phase-in period front-loading prudential requirements, situation sometimes consider excessively harsh. of course long phase-in period often reaction expect impact regulation bank behaviour and, particular, lend real economy. some middle road found. 3. a third challenge need reduce reliance models. recently conduct stress-tests, core macro-prudential tool, follow “single-model-fits-all” methodology, leave little room idiosyncratic specific national characteristics. moreover, accord analysts, risk stress test become le effective tool. instead, may increasingly see conduct simply calm financial markets. ideally, stress test implement benign time accordance old wisdom attribute john f. kennedy, “the time repair roof sun shining”. in crisis times, risk crucial input macroeconomic variable over-estimated adverse scenario become unrealistic – either benign severe. in consequence, outcome become ambiguous difficult interpret. additionally, potential pro-cyclical effect stress test explored. stress test place emphasis solvency, explore impact assume shock bank liquidity, implication apply bail-in tool, fund need meet demand deposit guarantee funds, etc. we focus harmonize processes, model enrich constrain judgement standard practice macroeconomic forecasting. 4. fourth, need widen scope regulation. systemic fragility may arise source traditional bank sector. a crucial challenge ahead relate recent disintermediation development “shadow” bank alternative mean financial intermediation. the need macro-prudential regulation certain financial activity become clear consider bank non-banks closely tie 4 bi central bankers’ speech market-based intermediation activities. these include broad array service relate securitization transactions, security finance transactions, repos, collateral management derivatives. the consequence poorly-monitored risk area unknown risk new crisis could lurking, spill-over effect difficult assess. moreover, policymakers effective use macro-prudential tool constrain excessive credit growth bank sector, likely become excessive adjustment non-bank sector leakages. fortunately, “shadow banking” high agenda relevant forum clear need extend regulatory toolkit. 5. a fifth challenge, role central bank lender last resort bank system, need address light mandate preserve financial stability. the lender last resort function crucial macro-prudential tool manage financial distress. the principle develop thornton bagehot well-known. central bank lend freely solvent illiquid bank good collateral high rate interest. how try test principle make operational today’s environment much large bank balance sheet few liquid assets? in past, government bond automatically consider good collateral. today, central bank accept wide pool collateral. by criterion collateral judged? we know liquidity problem become solvency problem liquidity deny provide generously enough. thus seemingly simple principle develop thornton bagehot open various interpretations. there need, i think, revisit question. mervyn king’s pawnbroker concept (2016) provide new idea issue. the ultimate aim meet challenge make finance europe resilient enhance safeguard financial stability. the role supervisor financial system enhance harmonization respect proportionality. they safeguard level-playing field among participant protect depositor strike right balance “strictness” “fairness”. their mandate set clear boundary within financial intermediation prosper financial stability maintained. d. beyond policy towards financial sector a i state outset presentation, financial stability crucial growth; growth also crucial financial stability. so let close remark growth euro area completeness economic monetary union (emu). despite progress make past years, emu remain incomplete. divergence across euro area significant crisis highlight exist shortcoming important difference need bridged. to end, europe build upon proposal outline five presidents’ report (2015). a argue report, emu complete appropriate mechanism share fiscal sovereignty place. monetary union develop mechanism risk sharing. mark carney (2015) recently highlight stylize fact that, whatever happen asset prices, debt endures. reduce debt level difficult note unlikely high debt one sector region reduce without least temporarily increase another. fiscal integration help respect. allow remind keynes’s view bretton wood system – needed, believed, provide mechanism promote symmetric adjustment within fix exchange rate area would bias towards deficient demand across system. a more-fiscally-integrated monetary union would help address problem asymmetric adjustment deflationary bias monetary union. sustainable economic growth contribute financial stability. failure maintain sustainable growth big threat long-term stability eu since onset 2007 crisis. an appropriate balance manage risk enable investment need struck. in connection, crucial regulatory framework impede, provide suitable environment, sustainable growth. bi central bankers’ speech 5 lady gentlemen, ultimately, sustainable recovery need underpin high investment. yet, euro area presently face significant investment gap. the financial system stability crucial role play close gap. central banker supervisory authority bear enormous responsibility shape system deliver prosperity citizen europe. we make important progress secure financial stability need deliver prosperity, yet complete job. a ancient greek mathematician, archimedes, said, “give place stand i move earth, first i need place stand, foundation.” the completion financial-stability

laudatio theo waigel speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, honour dr theodor waigel, signsawards, munich, 17 june 2016. * * * jam freeman clarke, 19th century theologian, observe “a politician man think next election, statesman think next generation”. this capture well honour theo waigel today. theo waigel’s political career cannot define election won, however many 30 year bundestag. nor define time head csu finance minister germany. it define legacy: legacy still shape europe today. he become finance minister 1989 turning-point post-war european history – iron curtain divide europe lifted; wall barb wire divide germany removed. it time great hope expectations. but also time anxiety. it clear successful reunification germany would tremendous undertaking. and many wonder change would mean european community – whether would upset balance power prevail nation since war. in uncertain setting, theo waigel’s leadership pivotal – german european. he one strong advocate german reunification, instrumental get germany’s federal state government finance reconstruction modernisation east germany. and influence, german government take fundamental decision europe: reunification make germany strong make europe weaker. free threat soviet union, germany choose go path making. instead, renew commitment europe. and demonstrate strength commitment share currency neighbours. a theo waigel said, germany bring deutsche mark europe, bring euro being. this historic sequence event speak three character trait define theo waigel: vision, resolve statesmanship. he person take long view follow conviction rather zeitgeist. he discourage obstacle stand way, however high were. and crucial quality great statesman – ability take others him. he bring three quality bear design economic monetary union year later. his voice carry particular weight decision add stability growth pact architecture monetary union. against considerable resistance corners, advocacy ensure euro bear within framework fiscal discipline. this visionary, pact set rules. what theo waigel understand union separate nations, different histories, tradition cultures, bind together common interest common needs, could build mutual trust. 2 bi central bankers’ speech trust key ingredient country take step towards integration without fear moral hazard. but trust earned. first, country show accept share responsibility monetary union creates. and second, converge towards similar level income, would assuage fear future “transfer union”. theo waigel’s insight see stability pact could achieve both. responsibility would demonstrate compliance rule agree all. and compliance would lead great stability, high growth ultimately fast convergence. when pact agree late 1990s, climate optimism prudence expectation seem feasible. fiscal discipline spread euro area country prepare membership. and addition single currency single market expect lead rapid narrow difference rich poor members. but reality course different, convergence slow think – least sustainable convergence unwind bust. this part due lack conviction among euro area country compliance rule would generate job growth. it part due lack determination apply rules. and part due external factors, namely global financial crisis. fundamentally, culture underpin trust – responsibility lead solidarity – need stronger. and without that, theo waigel foresaw, monetary union fragile been. so today face choice – leave thing move forward. and choice without costs. we see price inaction high. we see leaf economy vulnerable instability. we see perceive impotence public authority meet need people fee frustration rejection. and see risk undermine trust support institution – even european union itself. so mind one way ahead, complete vision theo waigel leave us. but progress today must different past. we find new way build trust among member state people europe – way build exist institution good ensure common need people met. the need share common, safely deliver common, must identify explain clearly. they include economic interests, benefit provide large fully integrate financial area. they include defence, generally security internal external threats, capacity address global migration challenge protection intellectual property – european union help deliver, way individual government may necessarily able do. and include environmental protection fight climate change. it demonstration why, how, interest good protect common gradually complement compliance convergence basis trust cement union. and i think many case evidence already see. but move forward, i believe interest so, require u draw quality make theo waigel leader. bi central bankers’ speech 3 his focus long horizon rather demand day. his courage conviction resilience see through. and mastery convince build consensus. that would best way honour theo waigel’s legacy, deliver stability prosperity union build for. bi central bankers’ speech 1 fritz zurbrügg: presentation swiss national bank’s financial stability report introductory remark mr fritz zurbrügg, member govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 16 june 2016. * * * in remarks, i start look key point address financial stability report, publish today. i finish review launch new banknote series, commence april. big banks: capital situation improve – snb welcome regulatory reform let begin situation swiss big banks. over past year, improve capital situation further, regard risk-weighted capital ratio leverage ratios. both big bank already almost fully compliant requirement current swiss ‘too big fail’ regulation (tbtf1), apply full begin 2019. the swiss national bank acknowledge progress make area. these regulation revise course last year. the revise regulation (tbtf2) envisage significant increase requirement loss-absorbing capacity big bank come effect little two week now. with phase-in period end-2019, requirement gradually increase definitive level. both big bank already fully compliant revise requirement come effect 1 july. however, meet requirement applicable begin 2020 – i.e. phase-in period – action need taken. this particularly case regard meet leverage ratio requirements, also regard gone-concern instruments. the latter use recapitalise bank event imminent insolvency without recourse government support. this achieve write designate debt instrument convert equity. in addition reform national level, reform also underway basel committee bank supervision’s international capital framework. it likely risk-weighted asset increase result international reforms. this expect increase has, far possible, factor calibration revise swiss ‘too big fail’ regulations. all reform – especially high leverage ratio requirement – result strengthen swiss big banks’ resilience. in light fact that, international comparison, two institution particularly large relative economy, strengthen necessary two reasons. first, big banks’ loss potential relative capitalisation substantial. give significance swiss economy, important big bank remain adequately capitalised, even event loss occurring. second, leverage ratio swiss big bank improve international standards, still average large globally active banks. the snb welcome support reforms. we continue actively involve finalisation international reforms. the combine package national international reform represent decisive step process resolve ‘too big fail’ issue switzerland. 2 bi central bankers’ speech domestically focus banks: adequate resilience, despite substantial increase mortgage exposure this bring domestically focus banks. for banks, whose activity centre swiss lend deposit-taking business, i would like highlight three developments. first, banks’ risk exposure swiss mortgage residential real estate market rise markedly 2015, mortgage lend volume grow similarly robust pace previous year. in addition, increase affordability risk interest rate risk exposure maturity transformation, background slightly high imbalance mortgage residential real estate markets. second, 2015, banks’ interest rate margin stabilise low level, fall steadily significantly since start low interest rate period end-2008. this stabilisation remarkable, give pressure interest rate margin continue last year. swiss money capital market rate fell 2015. at time, interest pay bank customer deposit remain largely unchanged. thus, difference two interest rate – liability margin – narrow further. the reduction liability margin offset increase asset margin, take great interest rate risk. third, domestically focus bank able maintain level resilience compare previous year, despite increase risk exposure. overall, capitalisation well regulatory minimum requirements, also adequate accord snb stress tests. the currently available capital surplus bank would sufficient cover loss project stress tests. give level prevail risks, positive. however, risk financial stability could increase further. a saw 2015, even low momentum swiss mortgage residential real estate market cause imbalance market increase. this happen, instance, combine comparatively weak development fundamental gdp growth. moreover, sustain period low interest rates, real estate price remain subject upward pressure. another rise price decline yield could occur particularly residential investment property segment. this would increase risk substantial correction event interest rate rise, would put pressure leverage investor bank finance investments. at time, environment persistently low interest rates, pressure interest rate margin would continue. such pressure create powerful incentive bank take risks. the focus maturity transformation affordability risk mortgage lending. in short term, may allow bank increase profitability, flip side also make vulnerable interest rate shock correction mortgage residential real estate markets. domestically focus bank would particularly expose major interest rate shock. a explain financial stability report, event normalisation interest rates, bank would initially benefit restoration liability margin. however, major interest rate shock would cause net interest income fall significantly many banks, potentially result losses. the great bank’s maturity transformation is, high loss be. even current low interest rate period continue interest rate rise gradually, possibility major interest rate shock rule out. experience show interest rate correction sometimes sudden sharp. it also bear mind interest rate money capital market currently 300 basis point low begin 2008. in words, bi central bankers’ speech 3 even interest rate return level previously consider normal, would still constitute major correction. in view fact risk financial stability could increase short medium term, capital surplus domestically focus bank particular significance. when define appetite risk capital plans, bank continue ensure also able absorb loss associate highly unfavourable possible scenario future. even scenario kind, able perform core function swiss economy – particular, supply credit. the snb continue monitor situation swiss mortgage real estate market closely, pay particular attention development residential investment property segment well banks’ risk-taking mortgage lending. a hitherto, snb regularly reassess need adjust countercyclical capital buffer. new banknote series: successful launch i would like finish presentation today word new 50-franc note, release 12 april 2016 first denomination ninth banknote series. from snb’s perspective, launch new banknote series all-round success. first, changeover bank counter atm go planned. accord information, general public also encounter major problem withdraw pay money cash machines. second, reaction new banknote predominantly positive among public expert alike. use nationwide information campaign, able inform public new 50-franc note’s design security feature short time. this campaign help member public across country familiarise quickly new banknote. when new banknote series issued, demand information always great launch first denomination. third, return rate old 50-franc note within expect range. we anticipate that, six month launch date, around two-thirds old note circulation exchange bi central bankers’ speech 1 veerathai santiprabhob: monetary financial sector policy – move forward speech dr veerathai santiprabhob, governor bank thailand, foreign correspondents’ club thailand (fcct), bangkok, 1 june 2016. * * * member fcct executive committee, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, good even all, it pleasure tonight. although first time speak fcct, i feel vibe active journalism, underpin club’s foundation long history community journalist thailand. a one old press club southeast asia, i would like thank continue commitment contribution thai economy thai society. public perception expectation indeed play large part establish credibility effectiveness economic policy. a public opinion influencers, journalist greatly contribute achieve desire policy outcome. a progress half way year, today i would like share monetary policy committee’s late economic assessment monetary policy stance support current economic recovery safeguard stability thai financial system. after that, i turn bank thailand’s financial sector development policy, view facilitate thailand’s economic transition towards strong, sustainable inclusive growth. let start talk recent development global financial markets. we start year heighten volatility global financial markets, mainly due concern china’s economic slowdown, decline oil commodity price monetary policy divergence among major central banks. lately, global volatility subside chinese government show strong commitment limit possibility hard land additional fiscal credit stimulus restructure economy. commodity price also begin edge higher. financial market participant expect monetary policy major country remain highly accommodative, despite increase possibility another rate hike u federal reserve next months. while relative calm return global financial markets, i must stress global financial environment remain fragile. development china’s economic restructure concern corporate debt, possibility brexit, major central banks’ policy divergence among significant factor trigger new bout volatility. investors’ sensitivity unexpected news event could also amplify volatility. amid fragile global financial climate, thai financial market relatively resilient compare emerge markets, thank thailand’s strong external position. current account position last year register surplus 9 percent gdp, project remain level 2016. our international reserve healthy level, stand around three time short-term external debt 1.3 time total external debt. foreign hold thai government bank thailand bond outstanding le 9 percent, compare 30 percent emerge market region. external debt corporate sector relatively low, mostly belong large companies, manage exchange rate risk sufficiently well. 2 bi central bankers’ speech while thailand’s financial strength serf buff external shocks, important private sector complacent continue prudent financial risk management. global financial volatility definitely trigger two-way movement currency asset prices. a small open economy, thailand cannot escape, find effective way live global volatility. on bank thailand’s part, flexible exchange rate regime, currency movement serf first line defense unexpected external events. we continue prudent use appropriate mix policy tool help prevent excessive volatility currency asset prices. in addition, build market resilience long run, embrace financial market developments, deep liquid market would good absorb large swing capital flows. we also plan relax capital flow regulation allow balance flow country, would enhance stability short-term speculative flows. lady gentlemen, move financial side real side, let share monetary policy committee’s late assessment summarize thai economy stand moment. this year, thai economy project gradually recover, drive mainly government spend tourism sector. government spending, mainly small investment projects, lend support recent economic recovery. contribution large-scale infrastructure project expect become evident latter half year. meanwhile, tourism important growth driver, broad-based improvement number tourist china regions. in 2016, estimate 32 million foreign tourists, improve 30 million last year, choose thailand one destinations. in addition, thai economy benefit expansion investment certain sectors, notably relate telecommunication alternative energy. export good clmv countries, account around 10 percent total exports, support economic growth potential grow further, despite decline export volume oil recent month due temporary factors. overall, monetary policy committee forecast economy grow 3.1 percent 2016, pick growth rate 2.8 percent 2015 0.9 percent 2014. however, i must admit overall momentum thai economic recovery remain slow stage. export goods, exclude gold, continue contract, largely attributable weak external demand, notably china asian trade partners, well structural constraint thai industry change global trade structure. weak export mainly weigh private investment saw modest expansion. private consumption, particularly rural agricultural households, drag high indebtedness, low income growth severe drought. amid gradual economic recovery, employment condition remain intact. flexibility labor market allow worker move agricultural sector sectors. there extensive layoffs, despite reduce number work hours. in recognition lower-than-potential growth low inflationary pressure, monetary policy committee maintain accommodative policy stance support economic recovery. at late meet week ago, committee decide maintain policy interest rate 1.50 percent. in committee’s view, current monetary condition ease bond yield remain low, commercial bank lend rate declined. therefore, policy interest rate keep hold preserve limit policy space, deploy unforeseen event emerge future. moreover, maintain policy interest rate would add risk financial stability. under prolong period low interest rate environment, tentative sign search-for-yield bi central bankers’ speech 3 behavior, high demand risker financial instruments, emerge thus warrant close monitor go forward. lady gentlemen, a thai economy gradually recover inflationary pressure remain subdued, monetary policy ensure monetary condition adequately supportive growth. at time, must forget chart course towards country’s long-term economic development. a thai economy need upgrade growth potential increase competitiveness, bank thailand contribute process economic transformation take proactive role financial sector development policy. ongoing sphere, least three development plan implementation, namely, financial sector master plan, payment system roadmap, capital account liberalization master plan. although three plan different objectives, complement together form strong foundation country’s financial sector development. i highlight key element hope get plans. the first one financial sector master plan (fsmp) phase iii. approve cabinet march year set strategic direction next five year (2016 – 2020), fsmp iii aim promote competitive thai financial sector, support diverse need fair undistorted prices, well promote regional trade investments, proper supervision ensure macroeconomic financial stability. in short, plan’s motto promote “competitive, inclusive, connected,

new segment customer gain access financial service new channels. smes entrepreneurs, example, could pitch idea wide group investors, crowd fund peer-to-peer lend platforms. new idea would high chance translate businesses, thus promote innovative spirit among thai entrepreneurs. financial innovation also promote competition drive high efficiency bank sector. at time, expect thai individual access basic financial service fair price appropriate level financial literacy. financially deserve enterprise receive adequate funding, use proper financial instruments. we expect improve households’ financial literacy, lead prudent financial management low households’ indebtedness. for financial institutions, encourage improve level consumer protection quality financial professionals, incorporate sustainability practice core business operation. on road enhance regional connectivity, asean bank integration framework, encourage bank extend regional presence support expand economic activities, use thailand springboard expand business regional countries, leverage thailand’s establish legal framework, finance facility, infrastructure, logistics it capability. in addition, use local currency regional trade investment promote low business transaction cost mitigate volatility major currencies. we hope policy strengthen financial connectivity neighbor facilitate close economic integration share benefit region. the second plan payment system roadmap. the plan aim promote safe efficient electronic payment service new technology innovation, view reduce transaction costs, improve governance standards, supportive expand economic activities. in particular, 4 bi central bankers’ speech integrate payment channels, mobile phones, internet, debit/ credit cards, e-money along competitive fee structure, support e-commerce/ m-commerce benefit business consumer alike. the bank thailand also continue work regional regulator advance payment system connectivity support international trades, labor movements, tourisms. under roadmap, bank thailand work closely government advocate idea digital economy take lead national e-payment plan promote any id infrastructure debit card usage. development new payment infrastructure “open architecture” allow network interoperability among various type player low payment fee discourage use cash, thus result much low operate cost high efficiency corporate bank sectors. a fundamental part infrastructure development, adopt international best practice security prudential standard ensure confidence country move cash-based economy towards digital economy. the third area financial sector development policy capital account liberalization master plan, phase ii. the plan aim deepen thailand’s financial market allow great flexibility diversification product service offer resident non-residents, support growth development thai economy. so far, number regulation foreign-exchange management relax great flexibility low transaction costs. this year, bank thailand plan relax foreign-exchange regulation allow qualify investor invest security abroad directly within certain limit without need go local intermediaries. we also plan allow security company buy sell foreign currency client within scope brokerage business. lastly, foreign corporation locate neighbor country permit borrow direct loan thai baht domestic financial institution invest great mekong subregion (gms). we also start see result increase flexibility, help multi-national company establish treasury center (tc) international headquarter (ihq) thailand. a now, 13 company hold treasury center licenses, 4 grant past 3 months, one await approval ministry finance. many also make inquiry i glad see. lady gentlemen, let turn conclude part talk tonight. amid volatile global financial climate, thailand’s strong external position serve buff financial shocks. the private sector’s prudent financial management policymakers’ credible policy allow u successfully ride global tides. in real sector, thai economy expect maintain gradual recovery path, drive mainly government spend tourism. export goods, hand, subject slowdown trade partners’ economy structural constraint thai industries. inflationary pressure remain subdued, headline inflation gradually rise line recent pick oil prices. against backdrop, monetary policy stance remain adequately accommodative support economic activities, safeguard financial stability. over long horizon, bank thailand commit create financial infrastructure nurture financial eco-system help lift growth potential thai economy. we aim promote financial innovation, financial inclusion bi central bankers’ speech 5 financial literacy, strong foundation sustainable economic development. with regard payment systems, new infrastructure build support transition towards digital economy. rule regulation exchange-rate management relax great flexibility investor multinational companies. we believe policy would put thailand strong foothold serve regional connector support close economic integration. last least, let thank fcct organize forum. the road ahead thai economy indeed bring new opportunity well challenges, urge u adjust ahead change conditions. be among policymakers, businesses, journalist gather tonight, i hope continue work together route enhance competitiveness sustainable development thailand. kob khun krub. muhammad bin ibrahim: some think new economyspeech mr muhammad bin ibrahim, governor central bank malaysia (bank negaramalaysia), malaysian institute

think “new world economy” in, along way, sharesome policy insight research idea many economist policy thinker thisroom.global macroeconomic environment become increasingly challengingthe period strong global growth become something distant memory us. globalgrowth past 5 year average 3.5%, well pre-crisis average 5.1%. tradeactivity, catalyst growth lacklustre. this evidence theslower growth global

geopolitical tension compoundedthe uncertainty surround global economy. although baseline growth forecast arealready relatively low, materialisation downside risk could nudge growth even lower.unconventional policy challenge time fast reach limitsat onset global financial crisis, immediate policy response largely targetedtowards stabilise financial markets. a volatility begin subside, financialinstitutions market stabilised, policy focus subsequently shift rejuvenatinggrowth raise employment. an immediate policy challenge face crisis-affected countrieswas conventional policy response expansionary monetary fiscal policy fastreached significant constraints. let elaborate. 1 / 8bis central banker's speech in aftermath crisis, public debt crisis-affected country reach high levels, inlarge part due high cost bail financial institutions. in advance economies,public debt grow almost half within span 5 year 2007 2012. for europe, evenculminated european sovereign debt

stimulus tool, call ‘theonly game town’. however, substantial ease major central bank lead global policyrates reach historically low levels. in fact, zero low bind theoreticalconstraint norm last 8 years. unconventional policy measures, asquantitative ease adopted. next come introduction negative interest rate policy,particularly advance economies. first adopt danish national bank 2012, fiveother central bank low key policy rate negative territory. the outcome ofthese unprecedented policy measure remain uncertain, possibility unintendedconsequences emergence yet risks.fiscal monetary policy, two important macroeconomic policy tools, reachinga point limit room influence desire growth employmentoutcomes. this raise question – reach point macro economybecomes dismal science? have reach macro-policy trap? what miss thedesign policy tools? these important questions. they warrant deep re-thinking underlie basis discipline, re-examination many principle thatwe rely while. to apply solution iscertainly viable option.the international monetary system foster imbalance volatility capital flow andexchange ratessince departure bretton wood system, international monetary system

misperception malaysia’sreliance commodity position net oil exporter. despite malaysia’s low 2 / 8bis central banker's speech dependency commodities, magnitude ringgit depreciation disproportionately

provide policy insight may spur research idea many economist andpolicy thinker room.a world define paradoxessince global financial crisis almost decade ago, world continue reshape bycomplex challenge force far-reaching implications, economically politically.some force foresee cause many unintended consequences.so it’s surprise circumstance seemingly contradictory yet senseexpresses possible truth. in words, paradoxes. these paradox pose challenge usall; policy-makers, businesses, academic , provoke u question ourunderstanding world works, force u rethink approach need toformulate response force shape global economy. i threeparadoxes mind.the first paradox this; globalisation drive world grow closertogether, simultaneously drift apart. by many measures, nation andpeople close ever term trade, investment, information exchange physicalmobility. despite weakness growth trade activities, global flow goods, service andfinance still one-third global gdp, 150% level 1990. yet, social disparities,most noticeably inequality distribution income, worsen considerably. incomeinequality rise many oecd country since 1980s; asia fare welleither, average gini coefficient high rest world. the distancebetween reality live idea ideal construct society thus onceboth close parents’ generation.the issue underlie paradox complex different every nation. in many ways, is12 3 / 8bis central banker's speech drive force globalisation bring economy close together, atthe time undermine welfare middle-class advance economy driventhe ‘haves have-nots’ apart emerge economies. the problem confront ustoday different past. the implication policymakers social thinker aretherefore, immense. these new challenge require nuanced understand andapproaches, this, framework need adjust accordingly. for start, isimportant recognise new challenge arise by-product genuinely positivedevelopment. indeed argue rise income inequality direct unavoidableconsequence advent technological revolution expand process ofglobalisation. thus, new economy, one press challenge may come toreconciling benefactor technology globalisation excluded, theintention keep inequality bay.this bring second paradox. despite technological advancement wehave experience recent years, labour productivity rise tandem. the worldis cusp path-breaking fundamental technological change – area ofartificial intelligence, bio-technology, advance analytics ‘big data’, fintech, name afew.but time, labour productivity anaemic major economy since globalfinancial crisis, us, currently experience long run decline workerproductivity since 1970s. tangible slowdown productivity also prevalent manyemerging economy since global financial crisis.this disconcert trend, productivity growth bedrock sustain improvement instandards live income. to borrow paul krugman’s quote, “productivity isn’t everything,but long-run it’s almost everything”. it’s real challenge, truly understand ishappening. advocate secular stagnation hypothesis argue result under-investment capital; others point decline business dynamism, excessive household debtthat lead misallocation resources, attribute measurement error

comprehend rapidlychanging complex system operate in, let alone diagnose it. we need humblyrecognise boundary understand now, time relentlessly expandthe frontier think conduct robust deliberation implication public policyformulations.the last paradox, one familiar many policymakers, disquiet calmness. in thefinancial markets, vix – standard indicator measure volatility global financialmarkets – low last two years. in fact, close all-time low 10,last see global financial crisis. yet, quick scan financial news would revealsignificant uncertainty global economy, amid ongoing series policy adjustment inmajor economies, volatile commodity price movement geopolitical tensions. to largeextent, paradox outcome combine policy effort central bank andgovernments worldwide maintain stability since global financial crisis.but beneath sense calmness tense undercurrent. there underlie anxiety thatprevails beyond realm economics, example relation issue internationalsecurity, environmental change, global spread disease. despite tremendousprogress achieve many area international treaty andinstitutional effort globally, anxiety remain. extreme view become prevalent inboth side aisle, manifest form backlash conventional wisdom, andthe establishments. we ought circumspect express views. a individual andinstitutions influence mould public think perception, added3 4 / 8bis central

issue confront field ofeconomics indeed reinvigorating. new rule made. old rule revisited. thecontradictory force i mention earlier, cause great policy tensions. the policy thathave implement

unconventional monetary policy need ‘balance’ that,with preserve financial stability, continue reemphasis fiscal structural policy inboth advance emerge economies.but face world paradoxes, perhaps need take full advantage strongfoundations convention build past, yet remain sufficiently nimble andunafraid rethink reconstruct face uncertain future. error inevitable, themore important point ability correct remain commit achieve rightoutcomes. this true policy central bank well.bank negara malaysia’s approach monetary policywithin context, please allow share approach monetary policy thatbank negara malaysia takes. bank negara malaysia’s decision-making process andgovernance framework today reflect combination effort progress since theestablishment monetary policy committee (mpc) decade half ago.not many might aware, mpc first meet 2002. in fact, upcomingmpc meet november would mark 100th mpc meet since 2002. before that,monetary policy formulation conduct absence establish

ever-challenging policy environment. for instance, establishment joint policycommittee 2010, combine member mpc financial stabilitycommittee, do recognition need effective coordination monetary andfinancial stability policy give increase interdependence. the year 2015 also markedanother significant milestone bank. we appoint first time two external membersto mpc, progress reflect ongoing

prospect itsimplications domestic economy.bnm recognise upside risk inflation originate mainly supply-driven factors, inwhich member opine monetary policy appropriate tool alleviate theimpact. in situation, raise rate achieve stable inflation cost would ourphilosophy public interest.during time, monetary policy inaction criticise behind rate-hike curverelative action take regional central banks. but retrospect, wereattempting right thing base prevail data assessment. we would liketo think departure convention stand test time, eventuallyproven right malaysia able withstand crisis.staying commit decisions, however, imply inflexibility approach. whenglobal condition deteriorate rapidly, monetary stimulus swiftly significantly front-loadedbetween november 2008 february 2009, cushion domestic economy adversespillovers. conversely, recovery become firmly entrenched, malaysia first inthe region normalise interest rate march 2009 record-low level, well ahead theregional counterparts.we shall continue strive make monetary policy decision base prevail data theassessment best ability, even might conventional wisdom nomatter unpopular decision might be.in manage exchange rate, similar philosophy pragmatism applied. we shouldrecognise today’s world great interconnectivity, susceptible vagariesof global financial markets. but distance global financial market notan option.in regard, despite extreme volatility experience recent years, think 6 / 8bis central banker's speech remain – market force ought determine direction level exchangerate. the central bank’s role

instrument drive growth. in regard, bank’s policy toolkit rely broad set ofinstruments achieve overall macroeconomic stability. this include consideration macro-prudential pro-growth policies, well advice fiscal policy government. suchan approach key ensure single tool overburdened.reawakening growth, reignite productivity restore inclusivenessbefore i conclude, let suggest successfully navigate global landscape withcontradictory force hold tension. i precise answer. but i highlight three importantoutcomes need achieve jointly order secure continue sustainable progressin global economy.first, need reawaken growth. have sub-par growth nearly decade now,policy-makers need relook learn rethink approaches; fiscal tomonetary policy structural issue need addressed, enable u remove anyimpediments growth. we need enact policy enable private-sector revive theirdynamism explore new strategy enable engage uncover productiveinvestment opportunities.the second reignite productivity. to end, technology globalisation hasresulted many paradox outline earlier, also avenue could provideanswers challenges. policy-makers private sector need automate adopttechnology increase productivity dispense easy way depend low costlabour model competitiveness.third, perhaps important – restore inclusiveness. the socio- geo-political paralysis splice centre towards far-left far-right many part ofthe world trace back unequal share global economic progress pastdecades. this underscore importance broader-based economic growth urgency 7 / 8bis central banker's speech close inequality gap. leader public private sector must help boost labour-market participation; across genders, creed nationality cushion negative socialcosts may arise by-product growth.only reawaken growth, reignite productivity restore inclusiveness, reclaim apositive sustainable future.on note, i would like congratulate mier commitment research past 30 years.it hope mier continue produce quality

participant counterpart international system eerily calm atmosphere immediate risk fear – thankfully – materialise. that say nothing do. have raise countercyclical capital buff march, fpc welcome position able reduce thus send strong signal bank would expect support lend real economy. and already make clear would allow insurer use flexibility build transition solvency ii, pra able re-iterate publicly firm could apply approval re-calculate transitional measure technical provision end june – thus reduce impact sharp decline risk free interest rate solvency positions. give responsibility bank england’s market operations, one success story i draw particular attention resilience banks’ liquidity positions. by way context, period since financial crisis bank increase liquid asset buff fourfold, increase fourfold lendable value collateral pre-positioned use bank england’s normal liquidity facilities. in recent year make much facility overhaul since crisis provide access broad range counterparties, provide liquidity broad range collateral. but truth one first time new facility truly put test, i please say perform admirably. the flexibility able show increase frequency regular

use moderate size prove effective form insurance – month june bank borrow £9bn central bank reserve u regular operation exchange pre-positioned collateral prudently maintain high level liquidity around referendum result. navigate uncertainty once become clear immediate financial stability risk either materialise effectively mitigated, attention turn macroeconomy. in set monetary policy referendum result, face two challenges. the first little data base assessment outlook changed; second bi central bankers’ speech 3 start unusual position bank rate already record low. i’ll take challenge turn. it vital monetary policy set forward look manner, give lag transmission mechanism, mean take decision even data cycle early stage. that much case august. although little hard economic data cover period since referendum, forward look survey lead indicator gdp growth disposal. now lead indicator vary quality – high predictive content gdp growth, others little, difficult know signal take. one simple way organise information illustrate “radar” economic indicator i find helpful navigate data (chart 2). it cell colour green indicator long run average; amber below, cause concern; red well below, even worrying. the cell centre represent data historically high correlation gdp growth, out circle low correlation gdp growth le reliable. the first radar date early 2014, year gdp growth 3.5%, surprise cell predominantly green. the intervene year remain mostly green, though amber spot begin appear initial recovery slow normal rate expansion. in wake referendum result, time decision august, reliable indicator – centre – part flash amber red (chart 3). since then, course, data turn positively expected, radar become little le red, little amber, though mostly remain average level (chart 4). now, way organise data. formally extract signal require much way econometrics – rich literature devote data uncertainty nowcasting, bank contribute significantly1. forward look indicator prone overreaction case outright misleading. moreover, predictive power limit near term outlook. give monetary policy great effect one two year ahead, mean must combine assessment near term indicator view underlie shock drive economy come years. there doubt mind uk experience sizeable economic shock wake referendum. any reduction openness need reallocate resource necessarily imply slow rate potential growth economy. moreover, reality protract process withdraw eu mean still know little nature future trade arrangements, uncertainty weigh prospect business investment. our agent around country report new project scale back defer outlook become clearer. there sign foreign company become cautious invest unite kingdom, know rely european union destination export begin make contingency plan case move business elsewhere. all reflect unavoidable economic reality period transition. the depreciation sterling exchange rate certainly help economy find new equilibrium. while 1 the bank currently us several nowcasting model predict current rate gdp growth. detail model find here: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/documents/quarterly bulletin/2014/qb14q106.pdf. initial estimate gdp growth get revise time, bank make distinct prediction “preliminary” “mature” estimate gdp growth. more detail find here: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/documents/quarterlybulletin/qb070301.pdf. 4 bi central bankers’ speech flexible nature uk economy mean ultimately adjust new circumstances, process adjustment sometimes painful. that’s monetary policy help, seem likely monetary stimulus require point order help ensure slowdown economic activity doesn’t turn something pernicious. however, likely time stimulus depend continue evolution data come week months. thus far, welcome improvement forward look indicator suggest slowdown may sharp sudden might feared. for example, bank staff revise forecast mature estimate gdp growth q3 0.3% 0.1% time august inflation report. but learn lot arrival official data post-referendum period, allow u navigate look window well radar. a package tailor start point what unusual particular loosen relative previous cycle start point. despite many real economic variable return around normal level follow financial crisis absence sign overheat inflationary pressure mean time referendum bank rate already all-time low 0.5% hold stock £375bn gild balance sheet. the global decline market-based measure long run real interest rate – fall 5 percentage point since 1980s (chart 5) – suggest neutral rate interest far low time past.2 the driver behind move deep structural shift trend growth rates, demographic risk appetite. take together, change global balance save investment, thus depress level interest rate bring economy equilibrium. these structural factor beyond influence monetary policy. we respond set bank rate low past economic cycle – otherwise would result unwarranted slow economy. it mean must consider carefully think effective low bind policy rate – take account financial stability considerations. it also mean must ready use monetary policy instrument bank rate – unconventional increasingly become conventional. with mind, mpc actively consider run referendum would go loosen necessary. work closely supervisor pra confirm room low bank rate small positive number without endanger bank system. base continuous dialogue debt management office market participants, know scope buy gilts. we also confirm number additional tool could use generate economic stimulus. in fact creativity limit number combination calibration nine member mpc could come – make vote process bite like try solve rubik’s cube. the package mpc ultimately choose five elements: cut bank rate 0.25%; launch term fund scheme (tfs) reinforce pas cut; purchase £10bn corporate bonds; purchase additional £60bn gilts; forward guidance data prove broadly consistent august inflation report forecast, majority member expect support cut bank rate course year. a sixth element add fpc, parallel 2 carney (2013) haldane (2015), rachel smith (2015), shafik (2015a). bi central bankers’ speech 5 approve change definition leverage ratio exclude central bank reserves, thus make monetary policy package effective. this package involve several piece innovation bank england. it bring official policy rate new record low bank’s 322 year history. it bring stock government bond balance sheet £435bn, represent 23% nominal gdp, new high. for first time, purchase private sector asset monetary policy purposes3. and lend central bank reserve bank system, rate close bank rate, long term ever before. mindful step the reason mpc take action benefit economy and, deliver monetary stability, contribute prosperity. our initial assessment impact far positive. but aware monetary policy spillover side effects, duty minimise possible without jeopardise overall beneficial impact. with mind, i would like discus three criticism frequently level monetary policy kind, illustrate mpc try take account. 1. ultra low interest rate self-defeating bank unable pas customers. this criticism genesis fact household business deposit rate reach low level, become difficult bank reduce further. they face choice pass change bank rate borrowers, net interest margin squeezed. in light mix experience pass-through low level policy rate central banks, something mpc acutely aware decide far reduce bank rate. use intelligence analysis bank supervisor pra, able establish net interest margin banks’ uk retail business sufficient comfortably withstand cut policy rate small positive number. uk banks’ net interest margin around 230bps 2015 average (chart 6). however, still face risk bank would choose preserve exist margins, dampen pas change rate face household consumers. the tfs explicitly design counter risk transmission mechanism tether bank term fund cost closely policy rate. it give ability borrow u four year bank rate long maintain lend real economy. the initial sign good – standard variable rate already or, expect, shortly reduce vast majority exist mortgages, rate available new lifetime tracker mortgage average 25bps lower.4, 5 though course difficult say much directly attributable tfs. 3 the bank previously purchase private sector assets, via asset purchase facility, order help improve market liquidity credit market function normally. for example, corporate bond secondary market scheme offer make regular small purchase sale corporate bond 2009 2013, move operate warrant market demand. since indication demand intervene period, scheme close august 2016. more information available http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/pages/apf/withdrawnschemes/default.aspx. 4 base announce change supervisory intelligence change standard variable rate 19 lender represent 90% stock monetary financial institutions’ lending, weight share value outstanding mortgages. 5 base bank’s quote rate data new lifetime tracker mortgages. 6 bi central bankers’ speech 2. quantitative ease adverse consequence pension fund insurance companies. the mpc aware marginal impact low long term risk free interest rate – else equal – increase present value pension fund liabilities, increase margin insurer must set aside cover present value otherwise unhedgeable risks. this something hear frequently market intelligence, business meet, conversation pension regulator, course pra’s prudential supervision insurers. it also international concern since long rate low globally. ultimately, way mpc effectively contribute generate stable return asset investor need meet long term liability support stable economic growth pursue inflation target. the boost economic activity come low interest rate increase profit company across country, boost value financial asset generally. indeed pension scheme start balance, increase value asset expect offset increase liabilities.6 the problem arise pension fund already start deficit, find costly acquire asset match future liabilities. in make policy decision must bear mind uncertain magnitude impact qe economy side effects. indeed one key motivation work develop broad range tools. at margin, determination use range ease option – rather rely solely purchase gild – likely reduce marginal impact long term risk free rates. our package spread transmission monetary policy evenly across short-term interest rates, corporate credit bank fund markets, well long rates. conscious structural change market liquidity recent years7, also purchase slow pace compare previous round quantitative ease minimise impact market liquidity (chart 7). 3. the central bank take place private market allocate credit. the need avoid unduly affect allocation credit paramount design corporate bond purchase scheme. a result, deliberately choose criterion purchase give u broad representative range issuer sectors. those company investment grade rating, subject assessment risk management staff, make material contribution uk economy expect bond eligible.8 purchase begin yesterday, end month publish hold 9 sectors, compare correspond market share. over time, adjust purchase aim achieve sectoral balance across portfolio match market whole. 6 see bean (2012) illustrative scenario impact pension fund different initial positions. 7 shafik (2015b), cunliffe (2015). 8 eligibility decision make risk management staff, take account number different factors. eligible company may incorporate uk jurisdictions. company significant employment uk headquarter uk normally regard make material contribution uk economy. we also consider whether company generate significant revenue uk, serf large number customer uk number operate site uk. for example, company headquarter outside uk employ hundred people uk generate sale £20m uk would consider make material contribution uk economy. bi central bankers’ speech 7 thing central bank cannot i hope i convince three things: (i) benefit gather broad range responsibility one roof allow u practice effective join plan policymaking (ii) expand size bank england’s balance sheet necessary response circumstance find (iii) make decision conscious spillover actions. let end note humility. if i grant one wish central banker would increase neutral rate interest toward historically normal level. that would hasten return simple world bank rate would monetary policy tool, allow u reduce footprint financial market accordingly return “small beautiful” world. however, despite broaden responsibility increase tool disposal, bank england set neutral rate interest – set economy. over long run, determine deep structural forces, include demography, flexibility labour product markets, quality institution infrastructure, balance save investment world economy. policy affect force increase potential growth rate economy, lead general improvement underlie appetite investment, thereby drive interest rates. so monetary policy one part story alongside government’s fiscal structural policy degree international policy co-ordination. a good balance put u prosperous stable path. but now, even might wish time small beautiful, big necessary. reference bean (2012) “pension fund quantitative

mundra, deputy governor reserve bank india, brics workshop financial inclusion, mumbai, 19 september 2016. * * * shri santhosh kumar gangwarji, honorable minister state finance, government india; shri ashwani kumar, chairman, iba & cmd, dena bank; shri rajiv rishi, deputy chairman, iba & cmd, central bank india; dr. madnesh kumar mishra, js(dfs) & mission director-financial inclusion, goi; delegate workshop; lady gentleman! at outset, i would like compliment department financial services, goi iba organize workshop financial inclusion brics forum. it indeed pleasure speak forum today. 2. financial inclusion much cherish policy objective u india economic policy always drive underlie intent sustainable inclusive growth. although i would dwell length virtue financial inclusion learn audience, i would still like draw reference profound ilo declaration philadelphia (1944) state “poverty anywhere threat prosperity everywhere.” the policy maker india i.e. government india rbi, early realisation implication poverty financial stability endeavor ensure poverty tackle manifestation benefit economic growth reach poor exclude section society. 3. i wish use forum brief journey towards goal universal financial inclusion india, challenge encounter way forward. but before, i get subject proper; let benefit international participants, state definition financial inclusion. “financial inclusion process ensure access appropriate financial product service need section society general vulnerable group weak section low income group particular affordable cost fair transparent manner mainstream institutional players”. role rbi financial inclusion 4. a i say earlier, rbi pursue goal financial inclusion long time. rbi’s financial inclusion effort trace back 1960s focus channelize credit neglect sector economy weak section population. while government india nationalize bank operation commercial bank two tranche 1969 1980; rbi also take initiative like lay priority sector lend requirement banks, lead bank scheme, establishment regional rural bank (rrbs-1975–76), service area approach (1989), self-help group-bank linkage programme (1989–90), set local area bank etc., aim make available benefit bank service masses. 5. although measure result impressive gain enhance outreach bank service extent credit population, certain structural challenge impede progress financial inclusion. on supply side, absence technology major impediment restrict expansion bank service far-flung area country comprise 600 thousand plus villages. in absence technology, develop cost-effective delivery model also remain challenge. 6. since 2006, rbi adopt plan structure approach address issue financial inclusion. rbi’s approach focus demand well 2 bi central bankers’ speech supply side. this large way possible due availability technology gradual adoption within bank processes. let elaborate measure consequent achievements. 7. institutionalization framework bank correspondent (bcs) major step towards enhance access bank services. rbi advocate combination “brick mortar” structure “mouse click” technology extend financial inclusion geographically disperse areas. 8. on regulatory side, bank mandate open least 25 per cent new branch unbanked rural centers. take account difficulty encounter common people meet “know your customer (kyc)” requirement open bank accounts, several measure taken. for example, rbi allow bank accept self-certification open basic service bank accounts. rbi encourage bank open aadhaar1 enable bank account link aadhaar number individuals, wherever available, basic save bank account open them, credit history also build time. 9. co-terminus efforts, rbi also encourage bank adopt structure plan approach financial inclusion commitment high level preparation board-approved financial inclusion plan (fips). the first two phase fips implement 2010–13 2013–16 intersperse implementation pmjdy government india 2014–15, whereby supply side effort receive extra push. snapshot progress 10. let quote numbers. i) the number bank outlet village go 67,694 march 2010 5,86,307 march 2016 rbi permit appointment bcs lay roadmap spread bank service rural india mix bank branch bc outlets. in addition, number urban location cover bcs also surge 447 march 2010 1,02,552 march 2016. ii) the basic save bank deposit account (bsbdas) go 73 million march 2010 469 million march 31, 2016. under pmjdy alone, june 1, 2016t, 220 mn account open approximate balance rs. 384 bn. iii) there 47.31 million small farm sector credit account 11.3 million small non-farm sector credit account outstanding rs. 5130.7 billion rs. 1493.3 billion outstanding respectively march 31, 2016. the number small farm non-farm sector credit account stand 24.3 million 1.4 mn respectively march 2010. iv) the total number transaction bc-ict account around 26 million 2010–11 increase 826.81 million march 31, 2016. 11. for country number may appear overwhelming, however, still long way go india extremely mindful that. there plenty challenge – low volume transaction basic bank accounts, inactive bc outlets, inaccessibility, poor connectivity etc. last year, rbi set expert committee medium term path financial inclusion ed (deepak mohanty) task 1 aadhaar unique identifier individual country. bi central bankers’ speech 3 draw medium term long term roadmap fi. the committee make 80 actionable recommendation pursue rbi. 12. follow paradigm shift financial inclusion landscape, need felt convergence fi effort various stakeholders. accordingly, rbi reconstitute high-level inter-institutional financial inclusion advisory committee (fiac) undertake continuous review policy fi; monitor progress financial inclusion financial literacy; evaluation impact conduct study/surveys preparation national strategy financial inclusion. other recent measure new bank entity permit financial inclusion space 13. rbi grant in-principle approval entity set differentiate bank namely “small finance banks” (sfbs) “payments banks” cause financial inclusion country. other serve vehicle savings, sfbs payment bank expect enhance supply credit small business units, small marginal farmers, micro small industry entity unorganized sector enable provision cost-efficient remittance service secure technology drive environment respectively. role payment system promote financial inclusion 14. consider strong linkage financial inclusion payment systems, rbi take several steps. some include encourage use mobile banking, pre-paid instrument form digital wallet mobile wallets, operationalization aadhaar bridge payment system (abps) aadhaar-enabled payment system (aeps) etc. increase brick mortar presence 15. while considerable improvement access bank service mix physical virtual mode, believe fair balance number bcs brick mortar branch good alignment inclusion efforts. accordingly, mandate open physical bank branch village population 5000 phase manner. we feel would also enable bank provide quality financial service also timely support bc network. creation bc registry certification 16. the bc model critical lynchpin financial inclusion initiative. we believe support bc structure, vital first step develop bc registry. this would ensure great oversight function bcs would also provide confidence end customers. a scheme grade certification/ train programme bcs also introduce enable bcs good track record advance train handle complex task beyond deposit remittances. financial inclusion plan bank (2016–19) 17. to sustain momentum achieve financial inclusion objective set fip target banks, third phase financial inclusion plan next three year 2016–19 initiated. under third phase, focus granular monitor progress make bank fips district level. 4 bi central bankers’ speech demand side intervention 18. have speak progress recent measure take rbi supply side, let talk equally important, le focussed, demand side aspect financial inclusion. a i mention earlier, bank open 440 million account push rbi pmjdy hence, right time focus demand side focus enhance capability individual position merely avail offer services, also capable demand prefer product service suitable need/choice. our belief unless demand side measure adequately supplement supply side measures, goal financial inclusion would remain proverbial “wild goose chase”. financial literacy centre (flcs) / rural self employment train institute 19. bank india mandate set flcs extend financial literacy. currently, 1380 flcs across india functional adopt tailor approach conduct camps. special focus give people newly induct bank system. besides this, tailor camp conduct five different target group i.e. farmers, small entrepreneurs, shgs, school student senior citizens. go forward, give challenge skew distribution exist flcs states, limit outreach exclusive focus financial literacy grind level, encourage bank set cfls (centres financial literacy) block level pilot basis states. 20. the rural self employment train institute (rsetis) set various bank country district level. the key objective rseti “short term train long term hand hold assistance credit linkage trainees”. direct benefit transfer aadhaar seed account 21. an important driver enhance demand side financial inclusion direct benefit transfer (dbt). it potential game changer. if entitlement various state sponsor scheme start directly flow bank account individual dbt mode, act catalyst encourage save habit lead build investment seed capital avail productive credit. let come way forward. way forward 22. i feel order motivate nudge consumer begin seek formal financial services, need focus i name 3 ps- products, process people. let elaborate. a) suitable products. the traditional approach “take leave it” go work people new financial system. many continuous income stream. their income generally seasonal hence erratic. also, many meagre amount save need widely different regular consumers. all necessitate customer centric product design take consideration lifecycle need customer every stage. simultaneously, also important prevent mis-selling financial product newly induct customer without due consideration around suitability. i also notice overzealousness quarter provide credit new entrant fold financial sector. it important ensure overzealousness result over-indebtedness. we must mindful fact individual enter formal financial system lot push prod would difficult bring back formal financial sector, leave feel cheated/dejected. bi central bankers’ speech 5 b) transparent processes. another area concern transparency processes. by transparency, i mean objective communication products, procedures, documentation necessary formality complete make financial transaction. transparent process result great trust confidence financial system. c) commit people. both suitable products, transparent process need complement commit people will listen keenly, empathize consumer will walk little extra welcome customer formal financial system. the 3x3x3matrix 23. i believe 3 p place, focus 3x3x3 matrix would important enhance financial capability individual achieve financial inclusion. the 3x3x3 matrix refer three section society need great focus, pitch product base three kind surplus people generate three type institution central role play. the three section approach – improve credit absorption capacity 24. firstly, india, talk inclusive growth, three section would warrant special focus. i) small marginal farmers, share croppers, ii) micro small industry iii) low salary earner unorganized sectors. collectively, section make significant part population need enhancement financial capabilities. also, section extremely important contributor country’s gdp labour force. 25. the credit absorption capacity farmer enhance consolidation fragment landholding usher land reform pool land hold shg format. effort enhance credit absorption capacity must also supplement financial literacy vocational train initiatives, comprehensive insurance cover failure crop & innovative practice farming. farmer also need sensitize concept finance warehouse receipt avoid distress sale produce low prices. 26. enhance financial capability mainly micro small entrepreneur amongst large msme fold would help entrepreneur move away informal formal source finance. micro small entity typically enterprise little credit history inadequate expertise prepare financial statement etc. they would, hence, need serve relevant product low cost employ innovative credit score models. 27. there also press need scale skill low salary earner unorganized sector train inputs. integrate skill development initiative secondary intermediate level education would address challenge low education level also provide school dropout employability skills. dearth formal vocational education, high school dropout rates, inadequate skill train capacity, negative perception towards skilling, lack industry ready skill even professional courses, continue stand major cause poor skill level workforce. it hearten note government’s commitment encourage entrepreneurship country new national skill development mission. the three surplus approach – suitability product service let u look i call 3 surpluses. 6 bi central bankers’ speech 28. the first group one generate adequate surpluses. these people sensitize different avenue invest reach financial goal ease. these may include invest capital market shares, mutual funds, gold bond etc. the second category people generate meagre surpluses. they people suit product like recur deposits, sip etc. the third category comprise people recently come financial system, live subsistence income generate meaningful surpluses. our role far group encourage use basic bouquet financial product like bsbda daily transaction well introduce electronic remittance channels. similarly, customise basic term insurance pension product currently make available target group government india initiative also go long way provide financial security long term. the three institution approach – endless opportunity 29. the first category institution i would call “existing & included”. it refer bank traditionally leader bring people formal financial system. these “included” institution must look deliver promise ensure 3 ps. under second category institution i refer “existing, included” fi grand plan structure way. they financial intermediary like nbfcs mfis good last mile reach leverage upon. the third type new institution start operation soon. three sfbs already start operations. seven entity hold in-principle approvals. we believe able bring technology back innovative last mile practice serve customers. the bottom-line coherent approach must work relative strength three type institution leverage upon. conclusion 30. the vision financial inclusion envisage committee medium term path financial inclusion 2021, empower formal finance, 90 per cent hitherto underserved section society would become active stakeholder economic progress. this much possible would require focus effort supply side well demand side. there strong business case cater underserved section society, give vast development frontier digital technology. 31. in conclusion, i would say cherish goal universal financial inclusion achieve synergistic effort mainstream financial entity fringe player like rural co-operatives, nbfcs, mfis, credit societies, ngo ,etc. all play complementary role champion cause financial inclusion. time ripe weave financial inclusion tapestry institution fit manner bring contribution efficient manner. this effort government rbi currently focussed. i hope draw useful lesson experience country within brics forum build upon continue journey towards attainment universal financial inclusion. thank you! bi central bankers’ speech 1 daniel k tarullo: next step evolution stress test speech mr daniel k tarullo, member board governor federal reserve system, yale university school management leader forum, new haven, connecticut, 26 september 2016. * * * supervisory stress test become cornerstone post-crisis prudential regulation. stress testing, unlike traditional capital requirements, provide forward-looking assessment loss would suffer adverse economic scenarios. the simultaneous test large firm lend perspective large part bank system facilitate identification common exposure risks. during financial crisis, success ad hoc stress test assess capital need of, restore confidence in, nation’s large financial institution encourage congress make stress test require regular feature large firm prudential regulation.1 the federal reserve has, succeed years, substantially refine supervisory stress test. moreover, stress test integrate comprehensive capital analysis review (ccar), tie result test banks’ capital distribution practice evaluate risk management capital plan capacities. today i want share result extensive review statutory stress test ccar programs, begin follow end 2015 cycle. before turn reason review idea change program arise it, i take moment summarize characteristic purpose program evolve point. stress test ccar today a implement requirement mandate dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act (dodd-frank act) stress test – federal reserve denominate dodd-frank act stress test (dfast) – exercise include four main steps.2 (1) the firm subject dfast provide federal reserve detailed, significantly standardize data loans, security holdings, trade positions, counterparty exposures, revenue, expenses, balance sheets. (2) the federal reserve specify hypothetical macroeconomic financial market scenario – include “adverse” “severely adverse” scenario. (3) the federal reserve input data firm supervisory model project firm’s losses, revenues, capital nine-quarter plan horizon specify scenarios. (4) the result exercise, include capital position firm follow hypothesize stress scenarios, disclose public. a dfast evolved, become increasingly valuable tool evaluate whether large financial firm hold sufficient capital continue provide credit event significant macroeconomic financial stress. however, dfast set capital ratio limit capital action firms. those function implement ccar program, create regulatory process 1 dodd-frank act §165(i), 12 u.s.c. §5365(i). 2 for complete description federal reserve’s dfast ccar programs, see www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/stress-tests-capital-planning.htm. a formal matter, dfast implement begin 2013. however, 2011 2012, federal reserve conduct supervisory stress test part ccar program, explain late text. 2 bi central bankers’ speech federal reserve.3 in ccar, federal reserve ass overall capital adequacy firm – include evaluation whether firm’s capital provide adequate buff loss would incur stress scenarios, whether risk management capital plan process appropriately well-developed governed, plan distribute capital dividend share repurchase could affect ability remain viable financial intermediary hypothesize scenarios. give central consideration effective risk management soundness firms, progressively integrate qualitative element ccar year-round supervisory program large bank organizations. under ccar, federal reserve may object firm’s capital plan either quantitative qualitative grounds. a quantitative objection make stress test reveal firm would able maintain post-stress capital ratio regulatory minimum level plan horizon, take account plan capital distributions. we take plan distribution account because, run-up financial crisis revealed, firm may reluctant cut distribution – particularly dividend – even period grow stress. thus, ccar include call “pre-funding” requirement. the federal reserve may object qualitative grind find firm’s capital plan process sufficiently reliable. the qualitative assessment include assumption analysis underlie firm’s capital plan, control governance processes, whether previously identify weakness management operation corrected. if federal reserve object quantitative qualitative grounds, firm may make capital distribution without permission. in practice, case qualitative objection, generally permit distribution previous year’s level increases. this practice, however, context distribution rise generally low level come crisis; guarantee similar practice would prevail distribution continue rising. the quantitative component ccar, base dfast stress tests, contribute continue strengthen capital level large financial institution begin original stress test winter 2009.4 while, understandably, many focus quantitative side implication capital distributions, importance qualitative component perhaps underappreciated. we saw 2009 stress test many large financial institution unable marshal data necessary gauge exposure accurately project adverse effect would suffer tail event, oppose ordinary cyclical downturn. ccar require firm steadily improve risk management capital plan processes. indeed, firm – particularly le complex bank within ccar cohort – meeting, close meeting, supervisory expectation across range risk management capital plan processes. the ccar review clearly, then, regard stress test ccar program make substantial contribution protect safety soundness nation’s large financial firm promote stability financial system whole. but, equally clearly, 3 12 cfr 225.8. 4 the common equity capital ratio – compare high-quality capital risk-weighted asset – 33 bank hold company 2016 ccar double 5.5 percent first quarter 2009 12.2 percent first quarter 2016. this reflect increase $700 billion common equity capital total $1.2 trillion period. www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/ press/bcreg/20160629a.htm. bi central bankers’ speech 3 stress test regime continue play role, must dynamic. the hypothesize scenario must change take account new economic financial risks. the supervisory model may, circumstances, need change take account evolve economic condition bank portfolio characteristics. additionally, refine stress test ccar process is, course, still relatively new regulatory supervisory tool. change kind been, continue be, make year year. after five year post-crisis stress testing, however, believe important u conduct thorough assessment program. take advantage shift time annual stress test follow 2015 cycle, undertake overall review.5 we know several area attention needed. these include imperfect alignment ccar regulatory capital requirement evolve since begin stress testing, desire additional macroprudential element stress test, qualitative component ccar apply le complex firms. but also want hear others thought. accordingly, meet bank officials, debt equity-side market analysts, public interest groups, academic – solicit view topic i note moment ago hear overall evaluation of, recommendation for, stress test ccar exercises. a imagine, receive wide range suggestions, least inconsistent one another. in main, though, discussion reflect strong support stress testing, reinforce going-in view key issue consideration, present u area possible change. before describe package potential change emerge review, let explain bite key topics. first fact ccar adjust align some, all, important change make regulatory capital rule past six years.6 one might decide regulatory capital rule ccar different, complementary capital measures, roughly way leverage ratio requirement risk-weighted capital requirement complementary. in particulars, though, ccar sit bite uneasily alongside ongoing capital requirements. the notable example ccar assume firm continue make plan capital distribution stress period even though regulatory capital rule include capital conservation buff limit distributions. another that, point, ccar reflect firm-specific capital surcharge adopt global systemically important bank (gsibs). our second key topic macroprudential dimension stress test ccar regimes. one important lesson financial crisis prudential regulation, include capital regulation, dominantly microprudential nature, even large firms. that is, regulation design apply view mostly idiosyncratic risk face bank isolation, without regard interaction bank financial system whole. thus, example, capital regulation take account fire sale effect – reduction portfolio value one bank bank sell certain type asset order enhance solvency counter reduction fund availability. similarly, microprudential capital regulation allow bank meet capital ratio reduce lend – is, reduce denominator ratio – 5 the 2016 ccar cycle start one quarter late past years’ ccar cycles. 6 for example, regulatory capital rule include minimum requirement base common equity, reflect fact common equity provide best buff losses. a result, similar common equity requirement include early year ccar, meet additional post-stress target ratio tier 1 common equity, remove ccar 2015. other change integrate stress test include modification risk-weighted asset calculation methodology revise definition capital. 4 bi central bankers’ speech well increase capital. if many bank follow strategy, even creditworthy borrower would adversely affected, thereby exacerbate economic downturn. our stress test ccar regime macroprudential elements, modestly enhance past years. by conduct stress test large bank time common scenarios, evaluate collective loss may bear major part industry stress scenario. we vary scenario design take account variety risk financial system way reduce procyclical effects.7 we vary market shock time reduce incentive firm correlate

currently conceive implemented, stress test regime emphasize direct risk bank capital severe recession associate market dislocation via usual channel reduce operate revenue combine credit, market, counterparty, operational losses. however, note academic policy analysts, fully develop macroprudential dimension stress test would incorporate indirect risk bank capital channel market-wide fund liquidity disruptions, fire sales, on.8 these amplification effect obviously particularly important firm relatively large trade book rely relatively short-term funding, both. indeed, many academic discuss stress test review emphasize importance build macroprudential element stress test program. the third topic identify review nature qualitative assessment apply relatively smaller, le complex firm within ccar exercise. while always explicitly differentiate risk management capital plan expectation firms, supervisor observe many firm seem uncertain whether would nonetheless hold stringent standard intend largest, complex firms. in course review, comment smaller, le complex firm confirm observation. official bank express view ccar qualitative assessment unduly burdensome create pressure develop complex processes, extensive documentation, sophisticate stress test model mirror use largest, complex firms, order avoid possibility public objection capital plan. since intention never create incentive firm relatively small systemic footprint invest stress test process appropriate large complex firms, know need address problem. result review after year discussion analysis, develop idea change stress test ccar regime would address three key issues, along relate matter arise course review. some change would need pursue rulemakings, include usual notice-and-comment process. others implement nonregulatory changes, though need elaboration move idea concrete practice. thus, necessarily provisional character package set forth here. except relief qualitative 7 daniel k. tarullo (2013), “macroprudential regulation,” speech deliver yale law school conference challenge global financial services, new haven, ct, september 20. 8 see, example, david greenlaw, anil kashyap, kermit schoenholtz, hyun song shin (2012), “stressed out: macroprudential principle stress testing.” chicago booth research paper no. 12–08, fama-miller work paper (chicago: university chicago booth school business, february 13). bi central bankers’ speech 5 requirement smaller, le complex ccar firm – i describe bite late – contemplate propose regulation implement idea early next year. thus, change would apply come 2017 dfast/ccar cycle. good alignment ccar new regulatory capital rule a i note earlier, significant addition regulatory capital requirement since first ccar exercise begin late 2010. while – revise risk-weighted asset calculation methodology definition capital – integrate stress test program, important addition not. most significant various capital buff requirement sit atop regulatory minimum levels. these include uniform 2.5-percent capital conservation buff (ccb), gsib surcharge, countercyclical buff expand ccb broad range firm time increase financial vulnerabilities.9 firm hold capital sufficient meet exceed combine buff level subject restriction capital distribution bonus payment executives, become progressively strict capital level fall deep buffer. to good align ccar regulatory capital rule stand, consider adoption “stress capital buffer” (scb) approach set post-stress capital requirement would integrate capital rule stress test ccar frameworks. the simple way describe scb would replace exist 2.5 percent ccb component ccar firm’s point-in-time capital requirements. the scb would risk-sensitive vary across firms, base result annual stress test. specifically, would set equal maximum decline firm’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio severely adverse scenario supervisory stress test inclusion firm’s plan capital distributions, simplification current practice calculate capital position firm separately quarter scenario horizon. a case ccb applicable capital buffers, firm would subject restriction capital distribution whenever capital level fall combine regulatory minimum buffers. although likely stress test loss continue exceed 2.5 percent risk-weighted asset gsibs, scb would specify floor current ccb level avoid reduction stringency regulatory capital rules. a firm’s buff requirement would recalculate year’s stress test, capital plan would approve ccar plan indicate firm would fall buff stress test’s baseline projections. let use hypothetical example illustrate scb would work. assume firm’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio decline ccar’s severely adverse scenario 13 percent 8 percent, firm’s scb would great 2.5 percent 5 percent decline – thus, 5 percent. assume firm gsib surcharge 3 percent countercyclical buff effect, firm would constrain make capital distribution would bring common equity tier 1 capital ratio 12.5 percent. the 12.5 percent figure sum 4.5 percent minimum common equity tier 1 risk-weighted capital requirement, 3 percent surcharge, 5 percent stress loss calculate annual stress test.10 because gsib capital surcharge already exist additional buff requirement regulatory capital rules, stress capital buff approach would effectively add gsib 9 the countercyclical buff apply bank organization $250 billion asset $10 billion on-balance-sheet foreign exposure depository institution subsidiary organizations. see 12 cfr part 217, appendix a. 10 figure 1 illustrate stress capital buffer. 6 bi central bankers’ speech capital surcharge estimate amount capital need stress. this would generally result significant increase capital requirement applicable gsibs, ccar bind capital constraint. but stress loss buff capital surcharge include capital requirement wholly consistent reason capital surcharge first place. indeed, two together actually anomaly arise sequence various capital strengthen measure undertaken. the board adopt gsib surcharge requirement part implementation section 165 dodd-frank act, establish important macroprudential principle financial firm subject increasingly stringent regulation systemic importance increases. a explain detail white paper accompany board’s final gsib risk-based capital surcharge rule,11 material distress failure gsib would adverse impact financial system whole far great impact financial system distress failure non-gsib bank firm. accordingly, gsibs face capital surcharge compel internalization external costs. this reduce probability gsib’s failure enough non-gsib expect impact system gsib non-gsib failure comparable. because difference external cost distress failure gsib compare non-gsib likely least high time macroeconomic financial market stress ordinary times, reason gsib surcharge part post-stress capital regime. a complementary point extra buff require gsib surcharge also reflect fact even best-conceived annual stress scenario cannot capture tail risk financial system. the integration capital rule stress test thus advance second aim initiate ccar review – incorporation macroprudential elements. a may know, chair yellen i have, number occasion past year so, indicate publicly would consider effective incorporation surcharge post-stress capital expectations. some industry representative subsequently argue step warranted. while course address comment rulemaking process move forward, i want comment couple arguments, since seem reflect misunderstand stress test program regulatory structure establish dodd-frank act. one argument duplicative include anticipate loss stress gsib surcharge firm’s capital requirement two element current stress test, global market shock counterparty default shock, apply gsib firms. however, additional scenario component capture direct loss firm engage material trade activity exposed. the market shock measure trade mark-to-market loss associate sudden change asset prices. the large counterparty default measure loss associate repricing counterparty exposure base market shock, assume default counterparty represent large net exposure. these component stress test capture adverse impact gsib failure financial system whole – risk basis gsib surcharge. these component stress test currently apply gsibs gsibs firm currently ccar exposure material. non-gsibs currently material trade activity would suffer small direct trade loss result severely stress market condition failure major derivative 11 board governor federal reserve system (2015), “calibrating g-sib surcharge,” white paper (washington: board governor federal reserve system, july 20). bi central bankers’ speech 7 repurchase agreement (repo) counterparty. a u.s. intermediate hold company foreign bank material trade business u.s. operation add ccar, intend revisit whether global market shock counterparty default component apply firm beyond u.s. gsibs. another argument offer inclusion surcharge element post-stress capital expectation material distress failure gsib long pose significant threat financial stability due regulation supervisory program design improve gsib resolvability. these measure include, among others, propose total loss absorb capacity (tlac) rule, propose qualify financial contract early termination rule relate international swap derivative association (isda) protocols, effort ensure firm engage strong recovery resolution planning. it true effort improve gsib resolvability recent years. but effort ongoing, rather complete. more importantly, certainly relationship goal strengthen resiliency systemically important firm make readily resolvable nonetheless fail, still separate regulatory aims. the demise large financial institution would cause substantial damage economy financial system even disorderly threaten system entirely. note, regard, dodd-frank act require stringent prudential standard systemically important firm process promote orderly resolution firms. while complementarity element regulatory program always warrant consideration, adjustment aspect program make condition practice evolve, current work orderly resolution surely argument promotion systemic stability macroprudential aim integrate surcharge requirement ccar. change treatment plan dividend share repurchase the shift stress capital buff approach would provide mechanism address two issue relate capital distribution limitation ccar. the first arguable inconsistency between, one hand, exist ccar assumption plan dividend share repurchase would proceed two-year plan horizon, regardless much stress bank and, other, concept capital conservation buff minimum capital requirement add capital rules. the second soft limitation dividend put place board inception ccar. both feature ccar reflect supervisory concern fact that, even financial crisis clearly unfolding, large bank continue repurchase share pay dividend shareholder and, thereby, deplete capital prove need later.12 the scb approach address first issue provide continuous constraint plan distribution would bring capital level sum minimum 4.5 percent risk-weighted asset plus firm-specific scb, plus applicable gsib surcharge.13 however, decline observe report capital level usually occur lag, historical evidence dividend le likely curtail share repurchases,14 would assume firm maintain dividend one year 12 see beverly hirtle (2014), “bank hold company dividend repurchase financial crisis (pdf),” staff report no. 666 (new york: federal reserve bank new york, march). 13 be countercyclical capital buff imposed, would add buff 4.5 percent minimum capital requirement. 14 during financial crisis, firm begin curtail share repurchase begin 2007 generally cut dividend late 2008. see hirtle (2014). 8 bi central bankers’ speech reduce repurchases. this would effect require firm hold capital meet stress loss fund plan dividend next year. the switch scb approach would also give u opportunity address second issue, soft limit dividend ccar. since inception, policy statement ccar indicate capital plan plan dividend payout ratio 30 percent would subject particularly close scrutiny. when policy adopt late 2010, expect would useful guideline period ccar bank would need continue increase capital level time also recognize point would need revisit it. since new approach add one year’s plan dividend firm’s capital buff act disincentive imprudent unsustainable level dividends, notion extra scrutiny plan dividend may long useful. and would, case, reluctant substitute high payout ratio original 30 percent ratio may end implicit target bank try reach. however, firm plan high dividend aware operation scb that, firm plan pay earn form dividend thing go well expect firm, could end cut dividend. balance sheet risk-weighted asset assumption beyond require large bank resiliency weather period serious financial stress, important macroprudential aim stress test ensure provide credit household business remain creditworthy even period. if bank maintain capital ratio stress reduce balance sheet asset sales, reduction new lending, crucial intermediation function compromise across economy. the result could credit crunch, likely result severe longer-lasting recession. in first year ccar, use banks’ projection many bank plan balance sheet decline part strategy remain sufficiently capitalized.15 in 2014 ccar cycle, replace banks’ projection model, add requirement bank would restrict supply loan severely adverse scenario. to date, model actually operate project increase balance sheet ccar bank severely adverse scenario, vary impact different portfolios. this assumption, somewhat complicate implementation, design fairly conservative, manner dissimilar assumption capital distributions. numerous bank attempt show portfolio business line would increase reasonable assumptions, thus even macroprudential goal justify ignore likelihood portfolio would decline. during review ccar, bank propose way distinguish among business line relax argue unrealistic assumption, even one macroprudential purpose. the complexity try differentiate across idiosyncratic business line seem u considerable. we instead consider replace feature model simple assumption balance sheet risk-weighted asset remain constant severely adverse scenario horizon. give decline demand creditworthy borrower loan inevitable serious recession, simple assumption would still achieve macroprudential policy objective decline lend recession attributable impact recession, rather capital constraint large 15 the original stress test undertake crisis allow assumption, precisely aim large bank group well-positioned meet need creditworthy borrower time great stress. bi central bankers’ speech 9 banks. this change would also make treatment balance sheet risk-weighted asset simple transparent. toward macroprudential stress test regime the second major objective stress test review integrate macroprudential element program. of course, combine gsib surcharge scb approach promote important macroprudential aim, since surcharge calibrate force large, interconnect bank internalize additional cost distress would impose financial system. the surcharge thus least partial surrogate inclusion various macroprudential feature stress test. we also consider couple relatively modest revision consider board’s “policy statement scenario design framework stress testing”16 motivate macroprudential consideration reduce procyclicality. the first would make severity change unemployment rate le severe downturns. the second would replace current judgmental approach set hypothesize path house price tie variable disposable personal income. the result would countercyclical path house price increase transparency determine severity important element scenario. beyond steps, hear many idea review might pursue macroprudential objective add new feature stress test, especially official sector representative academics. we also review grow academic literature topic. we conclude that, point, even conceptually promise idea good way realize specific well-supported element economic models. many macroprudential risk involve spread stress one firm market others. a such, macroprudential element stress test often must estimate first-round losses, also knock-on effects, depend significantly vulnerability response major actor financial system, include many regulate. model effect require information behavior actor may observable either firm us. notwithstanding practical challenges, many suggestion receive focus important potential risk bear inquiry regulators. hence undertake research program pursue idea order good understand quantitative consequence new risk business activities, potential amplification channel fire sale stress could migrate large bank rest financial system, important dynamic capital liquidity positions. at minimum, research inform scenario design overall regulatory financial stability function board. and least idea might eventually translate feature stress test regime. over medium term view three relate area high priorities: fund shocks, liquidity shocks, spillover default common counterparties. fund shock fund stress natural start point. a bank incur loss capital base erodes, creditor demand additional compensation bank fund cost increase. this kind “direct” fund shock really microprudential result loss depend largely bank’s decision capital base, asset risk, reliance short-term wholesale funding. a such, straightforward integrate direct fund shock main stress test framework 16 see 12 cfr part 252, appendix a. 10 bi central bankers’ speech integrate systemwide effects, consider whether, how, relatively near term. in “systemic” fund shock, contrast, bank’s cost fund depend capital position system whole. by take overall solvency system account, element capture key amplification channel evident last financial crisis. a bank system experience capital losses, cost fund increase wholesale fund market shut even relatively healthy banks. the potential kind fund shock mean presence poorly capitalize bank might increase fund cost bank – classic kind macroprudential concern. liquidity shock fire sale dynamic a saw last financial crisis, repo fund market simply close distress institutions, unable access certain kind fund price. such firm may force make fund shortfall turn market source liquidity sell asset – high-quality liquid asset like treasury security le liquid assets. during financial crisis, distress firm sell large amount security quickly possible. the fire sale price discount require rapid execution turn impose mark-to-market loss firm similar holdings. to understand good channel financial contagion, intend continue work ability market handle large quantity asset sale stress, capacity willingness firm tap buff high-quality assets, susceptibility bank capital mark-to-market loss fire sales. many commentator draw attention concerns, advocate integrate approach capital liquidity stress testing. we may may able achieve end point. at minimum, though, research area allow u move direction, perhaps use conclusion reach annual stress test start point annual comprehensive liquidity analysis review (clar), vice versa. the result could also shed light current calibration liquidity rules. default common counterparty reaction central counterparties currently, annual stress test incorporate counterparty default scenario component eight g-sibs measure direct credit loss. however, component consider potentially large second-round effect default major financial institution, include increase probability default counterparties result initial default requirement large margin derivative counterparties. of particular interest role central counterparties (ccps) alleviate transmit stress default one members. by regulatory design, ccps increase prominence post-crisis environment lead great efficiency transparency trading. but increase role make important understand impact may stress conditions. for example, ccps collect prefunded resource mitigate impact default, also call survive clear member additional financial resource pre-funded resource exhausted. promote transparency transparency play important role make stress test key part post-crisis prudential regulation. transparency scenario result give investor analyst valuable information condition test banks, thereby contribute market discipline. it also allow public evaluate job federal reserve doing. for example, analyst compare loss estimate specify portfolio specify stress condition evaluation – exercise inform analyst us. bi central bankers’ speech 11 there three area transparency consideration need applied. first set scenario apply annual exercise. we release essentially detail scenario and, further, publish policy statement explore aim factor relevant development scenarios.17 second set result dfast ccar exercise themselves. right start – supervisory capital assessment program (scap) 2009 – adopt controversial practice publish post-stress capital ratio result participate firm, along breakdown project loss loan type. since then, substantially increase breadth disclose results, include summary reason qualitative objection conditional non-objection firms’ capital plans. during course review, suggestion make granular disclosures, provide detail different component project net revenues. we make change, possibly others, course next cycle two stress testing.18 the third area transparency involve supervisory model use stress tests. bank involve dfast/ccar regularly request disclosure good understand likely impact firms. one argument bank difficult time capital plan cannot predict loss function model feature affect stress losses. in part remove possibility bank would receive quantitative objection capital plan large gap loss estimate produce supervisory model, year ago begin allow bank revise capital distribution request follow receipt dfast results. under scb approach, bank could also adjust plan capital distribution receive stress test result avoid baseline capital distribution projection fall buffer. we already take number step respond requests. we currently publish description model use stress test, include key risk driver scenario variable key model area. we host annual conference model practices. we disclose description material change stress test model stress test. we consider steps, disclose description change well advance stress test, phase material model change two years, smooth somewhat effect change project loss revenues. finally, bite tentatively, assess feasibility publish data represent typical bank portfolio loan security loss would project portfolio various stress scenarios. this kind information could also help public trace change risk driver alter loss projections. have say this, let say intend publish full computer code supervisory model use project revenue losses. full disclosure would permit firm game system – is, optimize portfolio characteristic base parameter model take risk area well-captured stress test minimize estimate stress losses. in part reason, full disclosure could promote “model monoculture” supervisor firm use model evaluate 17 see 12 cfr part 252, appendix a. see 12 cfr 252, appendix a; board governor federal reserve system (2013), “policy statement scenario design framework stress test (pdf),” final rule; policy statement, november 29. 18 quite recently bank also suggest disclose version supervisory letter send follow annual ccar participate firm detail assessment capital plan processes. these bank believe analyst investor could benefit know detail concern supervisors. we already consider increase information provide around qualitative objection conditional non-objections factor late observation decision. 12 bi central bankers’ speech risks. a critical part dfast/ccar process firm use model ass risks. we want simply copy supervisory model thereby increase vulnerability financial system inevitable blind spot even best models. in short, like use model develop regulation that, example, limit emission pollute substances. in case, adherence precise model output would achieve regulatory purpose. here, contrast, purpose regulatory regime would undermined. remember, stress test. the shift activity bank economy create dynamic set risks. effective prudential regulation must equally dynamic try avoid push major financial firm toward measure risk position exactly way. there is, however, one additional consideration. because stress test would undermine give model banks, course limit opportunity external party ass models. to promote integrity model circumstances, establish model validation group, compose model expert involve design application stress test models. they make regular assessment offer suggestion improvement. we expect provide public great information internal validation processes. eliminate qualitative ccar exercise small firm a already tell, response need good alignment stress test capital rule desirability macroprudential emphasis require good bite explanation. in contrast, response issue unnecessary burden smaller, le complex ccar firm simply state simply achieved. in notice propose rulemaking board release today propose bank le $250 billion asset significant international nonbank activity would long include annual ccar qualitative review. a note earlier, many firm already meet supervisory expectations. we intend le complex firm invest stress test capability par complex firm and, give profile, feel firm maintain progress make normal supervisory process, supplement target horizontal review discrete aspect capital planning. this shift reduce intensity supervision capital plan processes, remove uncertainty supervisory expectation firm relative large firms, eliminate possibility public objection capital plan qualitative grounds. they would still include quantitative side stress test propose stress capital buffer. but also propose reduce amount data firm require submit purpose run stress test, call y-14 regulatory reports. unlike substantial change contemplate ccar stress test, propose change would effective next year, ccar 2017. conclusion this set change consider stress test regime motivate somewhat different considerations, backdrop intend remain dynamic regulatory instrument whose procedure regularly refine whose substance regularly adapt change economic condition industry practices. still, pull package modification together, consciously shape accordance principle financial regulation progressively stringent firm great importance, thus potential risk, financial system. two feature package reflect principle. bi central bankers’ speech 13 first, course, elimination qualitative portion ccar nearly firm le $250 billion assets, along record keep report requirements. the second key feature differential impact good alignment ccar capital regulation roughly 30 firm covered. let note outset precise effect capital requirement individual firm cannot determine nature stress test regime. the scenario vary year year, result project effect loss revenue may also vary materially depend composition firm’s balance sheet activities. however, provide idea impact may be, assess various change i mention would affect capital requirement two recent ccar cycles. on average eight gsibs, integration surcharge post-stress requirement would somewhat le half offset simplify change prefunding capital distribution balance sheet assumptions. the impact capital requirement likely great firm large gsib surcharges. for ccar firms, capital surcharges, simplify assumption result reduction post-stress capital requirements. we estimate aggregate impact change ccar firm whole modest increase total amount require capital. but increase totally due impact eight gsib firms, whose increase capital requirement offset reduction firms. in short, gsibs see capital requirement rise. all ccar firm see reduction capital requirements. and firm le $250 billion asset extensive international nontraditional bank activity also transition tailor set capital plan expectation outside ccar process. speech page 1/6 embargo 26 september 2016, 11:30 financial market

would like thank giuseppe d’alelio andreas wehrli valuable support prepare speech. he also thank simone auer, petra gerlach, sébastien kraenzlin snb language service assistance. page 2/6 introduction i delight open sibos 2016 welcome warmly geneva. sibos annual gather financial market service providers. this sector, responsible nothing le backbone financial system, currently experience surge innovation. it therefore great honour switzerland host important conference time transformational change. around world, switzerland often see stability continuity. the highly international swiss financial sector benefit exceptional stability country’s political legal structures. at time, switzerland manage innovative; regularly among top performer global innovation rankings.1 the swiss financial industry play important role here. you find ‘crypto valley’ map, financial technology (fintech) cluster go name spring canton zug. the city zug recently even launch pilot project allow certain public service pay use crypto-currency. but even u prefer traditional payment method benefit many innovation switzerland. for instance, cash withdraw atm without bank card – simply use smartphone. like switzerland, central bank associate stability continuity. and yet, since financial crisis, adopt ever inventive policy shield respective economy serious harm. the swiss national bank likewise mobilise innovative resources. we develop deploy new monetary policy instruments, enable u carry mandate fully possible. when come implement monetary policy, financial market infrastructure vital. in switzerland, infrastructure run six group snb actively involve shape strategic direction certain functions. without safe efficient infrastructure would unable fulfil mandate. this fact alone explain keen interest ensure smooth operation. but interest go beyond monetary policy implementation. the infrastructure also play major role enable snb perform statutory duties, facilitate secure operation cashless payment system contribute stability financial system. a mentioned, financial sector experience surge innovation. the financial market infrastructures, hence central banks, stand affect changes. a process unfolds, snb’s task strike right balance maintain stable condition promote useful innovation. in speech i outline likely achieve safe efficient outcome balance interest market participants, regulator central banks. 1 switzerland top global innovation index (www.wipo.int) last six years. page 3/6 financial industry – core functions, evolve technology the theme year’s sibos conference ‘transforming landscape’. new technology pave way new financial services. while certainly interest innovation offing, important recognise many financial industry’s core function remain largely unchanged. the role financial intermediary is, first, help client fund new investment and, second, offer investment opportunity asset protection strategies. their third role facilitate security safekeeping, fourth execute payment behalf clients. customer long require basic services, continue need future. in short, economic function financial industry changed. however, technology channel financial service request deliver changing. the digitalisation payment transactions, instance, help make cashless payment cheap simple customer – even efficiency could still improved, especially cross-border payment concerned. the advent dematerialise security year ago another example innovation within financial industry; change greatly increase efficiency security settlement safekeeping. the digital transformation also add value another way: enable bank customer execute transaction great temporal flexibility geographical independence. these days, traditional bank counter morph apps live smartphones. such useful innovation potential improve aggregate economic welfare. the challenge regulator central bank make sure fully understand effect – side-effects – new mechanism early stage. the go innovation affect financial market infrastructure – especially systemically important. such assessment new technology base set internationally accept guideline call ‘principles financial market infrastructures’.2 these principle define criterion infrastructure must meet, thereby set standard innovation field. central bank regulator duty pas legislation guarantee safety financial market infrastructure – protect stability, resilience availability, irrespective technological change; must also take board efficiency goal infrastructure provider participants. regulatory adjustment may need catalyse positive effect certain innovations.3 2 cf. committee payment settlement system (now committee payment market infrastructures, cpmi) technical committee international organization security commission (iosco), ‘principles financial market infrastructures’, april 2012. 3 the federal intermediate security act (fisa) introduce switzerland 2008 good example regulatory change – case design manage transition dematerialise security central depositories. dematerialisation associate regulatory change also significantly improve efficiency safety repo settlement hence monetary policy implementation. page 4/6 from centralisation decentralisation – far go? until recently, safety efficiency consider function centralisation. this trend reflect evolution central security depositories4 emergence cashless payment transactions. in switzerland, centralise clear house 1940s centralise data process 1970s waypoints journey convergence. this development culminate creation centralise ‘swiss interbank clearing’ (sic) payment system 1987.5 another – recent – example settlement otc derivative via central counterparties.6 this centralisation process relate economy scale reduce cost improve safety. however, arrival late technologies, third-party clear settlement service increasingly see superfluous cost factors; keywords ‘distributed ledger’ ‘blockchain’.7 the underlie technology promise first foremost reduce costs. for instance, system would render reconciliation transaction balance data bank third-party system obsolete. the paradigm seem turn head: decentralisation – centralisation – appear promise great efficiency gains. i not, however, believe decentralisation become ‘new normal’ financial market function infrastructures. many exist financial market infrastructure already highly competitive, barrier entry new technology correspondingly high. the conventional, centralise model build already low-cost meet high safety standards. and improvement make time. distribute ledger technology, meanwhile, yet prove outperform exist set-up respect safety efficiency. have say this, may scope deploy distribute ledger certain complex financial market function infrastructures. the settlement safekeeping security one example. in end, may well see conventional new technology co-existing blending. stay security example: conceivable see hybrid scenario. this could entail security-specific information settle via distribute ledger, payment leg could continue effect via traditional, centralise payment system. 4 cf. diana chan, florence fontan,

ongoing debate central bank money potentially issue via distribute ledger. this idea raise host central bank-specific question need examine detail. the snb follow analyse development arena closely actively involve discussion market participants, regulator central banks. recent development sic system amid longer-term visions, careful overlook change around corner – indeed, already introduced. so let return present talk development cashless payment transaction already tangible effect central bank around world. for obvious reasons, remark base situation switzerland. a i already mentioned, one

problem germany? no, all. we legally accountable european parliament always will exchange view informally national parliaments. it useful exercise us. the president first exchange four year ago midst financial crisis europe. now make headway, growth return overall economic situation improve lot, partially thank decisions. this make good time explain doing, show result action respond concern might voiced. the ecb accuse german politician fuel populist party like alternative für deutschland (afd). how would react remarks? the ecb political institution. our mandate maintain price stability. political issue must handle politician monetary issue central bankers. we mix two things. for many politician ecb see bogeyman… there temptation everywhere, also outside europe, drag central bank political discussions. some expect much u want solution high unemployment long-term growth problems, others blame u political outcome. politics monetary policy don’t belong together. the ecb continue give advice governments. be legitimate? in europe, long tradition central bank give economic policy advice. the deutsche bundesbank always do european central banks. the ecb give advice, insofar relate monetary policy. price stability rely economic social stability. we duty speak mind tell citizen see right condition u fulfil mandate properly. however, line cross certainly role tell national

recovery hand american chinese consumers. we need strong consumption investment euro area. the good news start happen. internal demand pick euro area whole, also germany. so germany export le import more? strong export sign competitiveness. they asset germany therefore europe. nevertheless, increase investment germany would make economy even strong prepare future. in france italy, prepare future mean give priority reform labour market reduce debt. in germany, debt already greatly reduce make possible increase investment future. this would also help foster long-term growth address demographic challenges. 2 bi central bankers’ speech you say politically left. what mean you? we come different background govern council influence conduct monetary policy. i personally believe need strong social system protect poor people societies, also imply system reform make sustainable. but, give challenge see today globally europe, define question leave right. it protect society keep open role europe play so. europe need reformed. it need demonstrate convince way cope inequality create globalisation new technology keep economy society open, still protect people. but ecb’s monetary policy make rich people europe even richer. a recent study deutsche bundesbank point accommodative monetary policy help unemployed people find new jobs. try imagine situation if, 2007 onwards, ecb do nothing response crisis. would poor people good now? i don’t think so, crisis would far worse. the ecb pump money financial system years. be also plan buy share bank bond even distribute helicopter money? we haven’t discuss option govern council. and i favour buy bank bonds. it would create wrong incentive bank reform, get rid non-performing loan identify new business models. a helicopter money, clearly blur line monetary fiscal policy. will ecb take action end monthly asset purchase programme march 2017 planned? when govern council meet 8 september 2016, economic monetary data justify change plans. there downside risk economic recovery resilient. we continue purchase asset monthly basis march 2017 beyond necessary; case see sustain adjustment inflation towards 2%. do think possible exit zero interest rate strategy without cause turbulence financial markets? it long time even start think exit accommodative monetary policy. when reach point, essential financial sector robust enough adapt high interest rates. we won’t stand monetary policy reign result concern could pose problem bank sector. before financial crisis central bank closely follow specialist – nowadays central bank always spotlight. do find helpful? sometimes spotlight order fulfil mandate. in first year crisis maintain monetary financial stability. we natural role play context forefront alongside major central banks. now challenge create long-term growth job sustainable way. the ecb cannot much areas. it high time focus shift away central banks. what politics fails? we live democracy i can’t simply assume democracy able deliver good solution problem face. it take time problem society face today exceptionally complex interrelated. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the ecb consider hero 2012. now people frown upon ecb’s zero interest rate policy. how feel? we don’t want hero, decisive whether popular. people trust fact achieve price stability. that treaty make ecb independent. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: work together growth europe introductory remark mr mario draghi, president european central bank, deutscher bundestag, berlin, 28 september 2016. * * * introduction mr chairman, honourable member bundestag, lady gentlemen, thank invitation. it pleasure speak hall committee affair european union, bring debate european integration bundestag, heart german democracy. a president ecb, i today explain policy discus ecb act fulfil mandate democratically confer upon u treaty. a member bundestag, know concern german people are. i look forward hear concern address today. when i come bundestag four year ago, height crisis. today, euro area good shape. to protect price stability, ecb use instrument manner do develop new tool – within mandate. we reduce interest rate low levels, provide target finance support banks’ lend firm households, start large-scale asset purchase programme. in introductory remark i want make three points. first, i want explain pursue policies. i want show monetary policy maintain price stability counter threat new “great depression”. our measure working: contribute keep recovery track, thus create job ensure recovery ultimately also benefit saver pensioner germany euro area whole. but i understand people concerns. we take concern seriously. i therefore discus detail – second point – measure affect people’s finance welfare. a monetary policy decision, measure distributional effect citizens. but, balance, savers, employees, entrepreneurs, pensioner taxpayer across euro area, include germany, good action – today tomorrow. finally, i talk else needed. the ecb operate vacuum: economic policy essential complement monetary policy. without strong sustainable recovery. these policy precondition interest rate rise again. the ecb’s action safeguard price stability let start reason actions. the ecb act inflation drift away aim below, close to, 2% medium term. the eu treaty give ecb primary objective maintain price stability euro area whole. this objective bind colleague ecb govern council, decision result collegial debate. we hold accountable decision european parliament, i attend four regular hear per year. furthermore, decision subject judicial review. this i mean i say: measures, follow law. 2 bi central bankers’ speech sometimes people wonder whether price stability doesn’t mean inflation 0%. it not, inflation high inflation low long damage economy. a steady, measure rate inflation below, close to, 2% medium term act like cushion protect economy drift dangerous territory negative inflation even minor economic shock.1 once expectation fall price become ingrained, consumer postpone purchase anticipation even low prices, firm hold make investment know whether pay off. this downward spiral continue economy collapses. there therefore good reason central bank careful avoid inflation either high low. you would rightly expect u act inflation significantly objective price stability. we also need act inflation close 0%. how achieve price stability objective? when inflation high, central bank raise interest rate break upward trend; inflation low, low interest rate achieve opposite. low interest rate ease overall finance condition economy. this turn stimulate investment consumption, induce inflation pick up. but low interest rate alone may sufficient return inflation rate line price stability, central bank may need use instrument ease monetary financial conditions. this launch measures, asset purchase programmes. and mean unique this. around globe, central bank major advance economy like us, uk japan embark large-scale sovereign bond purchase programme fulfil mandate. our measure delivered. we estimate raise inflation rate half percentage point, average, 2016 2017. they also contribute increase real euro area gdp growth one half percentage point cumulatively 2015 2018, support job creation. the effect policy low rate symptom underlie economic situation. they reflect weak long-term growth trend protract macroeconomic slump result crisis. and ecb’s monetary policy provide significant accommodation limit negative effect global euro area-specific shock economy, thereby mitigate disinflationary impact. but low rate innocuous. they affect people’s finance welfare. let start effect policy savers. yes, current low interest rate environment reduce nominal return save accounts. but count saver nominal interest rate real interest rate, nominal interest rate minus inflation. real rate also low, many episode low, even negative real interest rate germany well introduction euro, recent bundesbank study shown.2 moreover, saver average still earn satisfactory rate return diversify assets, even interest rate deposit save account low. this also case germany accord another recent bundesbank study.3 but 1 see praet, p., “the ecb’s fight low inflation: reason consequences”, speech peter praet, member executive board ecb, luiss school european political economy, rome, 4 april 2016. 2 see deutsche bundesbank , “nothing new negative real interest rate deposits”, 30 june 2014, https://www.bundesbank.de/redaktion/en/topics/2014/2014_06_30_nothing_new_negative_interest_rates.html. 3 see deutsche bundesbank , “german households’ save investment behaviour light low interest rate environment”, monthly report october 2015. bi central bankers’ speech 3 importantly, whatever financial asset saver hold, benefit recovery economy. so interest us, include german savers, high possible sustainable growth germany euro area. through effort bring inflation back towards 2%, contribute high growth creation jobs. in germany, export benefit recovery euro area, unemployment low level since reunification, people’s take-home pay increase noticeably, venture capital pour berlin’s silicon alley. we also forget people constituency affect different way measures. they affect savers, borrower taxpayers, many case three. what household may lose term little interest bank account, might save low mortgage payment home. and might benefit rise bond stock price retirement fund. in fact, evidence show 2008 2015 interest payment household germany, percentage gross disposable income, fell sharply interest earnings.4 and low finance cost government bond help balance budget reduce debt considerable speed. this good news finance ministry – thus taxpayer – save 2015 alone approximately eur 28 billion low expect interest payments. we also consider full effect low interest rate banks. those blame ecb policy mix performance certain german financial firm vocal. but forget many bank able offset decline interest revenue high lend volumes, improve loan performance low interest expenses, beneficial bank customers.5 the ecb’s monetary policy main factor low profitability banks. while banks’ business model may indeed need adapt current low interest rate environment, also need address structural issues, overcapacity, stock non-performing loan potential impact technological innovation. low profitability closely link low operational efficiency. in germany cost income ratio average relatively high compare jurisdictions. let u clear, however, one size fit bank model different type bank successfully operate germany euro area. of course, low interest rate long period might carry risk overvaluation asset market result search yield. this closely monitor potential risk financial stability might emanate instance local real estate markets. but moment see overheat euro area german economy whole. while observe somewhat strong increase residential real estate prices, notably large city germany, increase reflection bubble, lend grow moderately. moreover, overall household debt-to-income level comparatively low stable. where sign excessive risk-taking emerge, macroprudential measure national level instrument choice. they allow exuberant financial development address target way, monetary policy contribute stability euro area whole. so far i discuss reason measure effects. to summarise, policy allow recovery take hold able raise interest rate again. after all, interest earn saver understandably crave need generate first real economy. in stagnant economy little share out. it also 4 see ecb, “low interest rate households’ net interest income”, box 3, economic bulletin, issue 4/2016. and without take account positive impact households’ income wealth rise stock bond price result low interest rates. 5 see cœuré, b., “assessing implication negative interest rates”, speech yale financial crisis forum, yale school management, new haven, 28 july 2016. 4 bi central bankers’ speech note level real interest rate eventually return economy strengthen determine monetary policy. instead, depend economy’s long-term growth prospects. productivity demographic play decisive role this, development factor favourable europe recent years. this phenomenon also see germany. for long-term interest rate rise future therefore need investment structural reform lift growth productivity. a wolfgang schäuble say house couple week ago present budget 2017: get phase low interest rate sustainable growth europe. the need decisive action national european level this lead final point: policy-makers across euro area, need seize opportunity deliver reforms. at height crisis, member state citizen show enormous commitment keep euro area together critic already talk euro’s demise. but cannot stop here: need make sure euro survives, economic monetary union thrives. if want succeed, need find common solution problem face. if want preserve european social model, need bring labour product market line reality digital globalise world 21st century. if want saver benefit high interest rate future, need create investment opportunity put save productive use. this raise productivity employment.6 this structural reform necessary complement monetary policy. and member state part. i highlight many time past.7 in fact, i emphasise every six week ecb’s press conference. and face common supranational challenges, currently several challenges, alternative act jointly europeans. consider transformative power deepen single market end 1980s. this open new opportunity continue benefit european company individual alike. consider still achieve digital single market, energy union capital market union. without well-functioning single market, firm would lose access market 500 million consumers. without single market, european would little global leverage uphold values, respect right privacy internet. together immeasurably stronger.8 conclusion let conclude. the ecb vigorously counteract risk price stability use necessary tool within mandate. our monetary policy support growth employment eventually bring inflation back aim below, close to, 2%. low interest rate today 6 see cœuré, b., “structural reform way complete economic

vast potential onshore financial institution support grow finance need domestic foreign corporates operate malaysia. for example, last five years, offshore corporate borrow rise rm233 billion 19.7%

economics, howard university, washington dc, 27 september 2016. * * * i please visit today student faculty howard university economics department. first, fact know others may not: the howard university economics department producer economics ph.d.’s among nation’s historically black college universities, teach economics undergraduate nearly century.1 speak one economist group among i hope many future economists, let start say pursue degree economics bring many rewards. first, economics degree provide many possible career paths. the discipline’s logical, structure approach problem solve value many settings, include academia, banking, business, consulting, government, law. economics major typically receive salary represent good return educational investment. second, addition career prospect financial rewards, economics offer mean engage many society’s press issues. the study economics provide rigorous, analytic perspective human behavior. it command respect ability influence policy address important issues. a degree economics help understand participate policy debates, put good position change world better. next, i would like discus two current question economist actively debating: first, participation nation’s labor force declining? and, second, do improve economic mobility (the ability climb economic ladder) child group area country? by so, i hope illustrate relevance economics important, real-life issues. the proportion adult participate labor force – is, either hold job actively search employment – decline substantially past decade. the decline reflected, part, severe economic recession. million people lose jobs, many experience great difficulty find new employment. some people become discourage stop look work. in words, drop labor force. however, much decline labor force participation reflect factor precede recession.2 most significantly, population aging, old people participate labor market low rate young adults. in addition, labor force participation prime-age male – is, individual age 25 54 – decline since mid-1960s, particularly among high school degree le education, continue decline year since last recession. economist examine number reason prime-age male fall labor force. here difference among economists. some economist emphasize role public assistance programs, disability insurance. some evidence suggest public assistance income likely play role. other economist put emphasis effect reduction time demand lower- 1 i grateful andrew cohen byron lutz federal reserve board staff assistance. view express mine necessarily federal reserve board federal open market committee. 2 see stephanie aaronson, tomaz cajner, bruce fallick, felix galbis-reig, christopher smith, william wascher (2014), “labor force participation: recent development future prospect (pdf) ,” brook paper economic activity (fall), pp. 197–255. 2 bi central bankers’ speech skilled labor.3 indeed, wage high school graduate fall sharply comparison wage college graduate past 40 years. many economist believe decline demand lower-skilled worker reflect technological changes.4 for instance, introduction information technology desktop computer may boost wage highly skilled worker wage worker few skills. the slump demand lower-skilled labor likely also reflect effect globalization, include competition good produce import abroad.5 my second current question concern economic mobility: how likely child low-income family move high income level adult? over past years, economist make important find use newly available data. first, economic mobility vary substantially across unite states. for example, odds child bottom quintile income distribution reach top quintile income adult 11 percent washington, d.c., area 4 percent charlotte, north carolina, region. second, mobility significantly low area great residential segregation term race income. mobility also low area great income inequality, le family stability, lower-quality schools.6 however, need study analysis understand whether factor cause low mobility merely correlate it. thus, despite gain knowledge recent years, significant gap remain understand factor help hind economic mobility. i conclude discuss diversity economics profession. our profession currently diverse, need be. only one-fourth tenure tenure-track faculty member u.s. academic economics department women, around 5 percent african american hispanic. yet research conduct economist well social scientist suggest diversity perspective idea lead good decision increase productivity.7 in experience, economic policy decision good inform wide range view experiences. you today crucial future profession. indeed, i hope obtain degree work economic problems, help change field economics itself. a many fields, economics undergo continual redesign practitioners. we need – i mean society whole need – diverse set practitioner economics, practitioner may perceive different question important different answer persuasive. and so, join profession acquire power change field, also broad set societal institution influence work economists. 3 see john bound, stephan lindner,

promote financial stability, reduce market concentration, identify new risk-reducing technologies, increase scope electronic settlement central bank money. and survey regularly identify resilience safety top consumers’ demand payment services. so want enable innovation, do without impair stability. what make, then, two alternative model payment convergence i mention moment ago? an all-encompassing payment platform host single it system clear appeal point view simplicity clarity purpose. and important case study globally – include mexico, whose central bank represent panel today. but would big change model unite kingdom today, pose least three significant risks. first, would involve put egg one basket operationally: system backup go down, reason, payment uk would stop. so, would unwise try channel 100m passenger year euston, king’s cross st pancras single train platform, diversity operational merits! second, would potentially complex ensure different function currently offer various payment system replicate single system. in probability would end impossible, compromise would make – start everything everyone could end much less. third, someone would need pay – good chance large project might fall public authorities. that model develop uk retail payment – single dominant infrastructure could well negative implication innovation competition. over medium- long-term, possible challenge may overcome new technology – include distribute ledger – mature. central bank could role play operation underpin system, issuance central bank digital currency otherwise. but many big bi central bankers’ speech 3 question around scheme – policy, legal, technological, even social – still much realm research rather implementation1. in near term, uk therefore embrace second convergence concept – join separate system together around common backbone, embrace so-called “interoperability”. underpin that, i would pick two key driver – first wholesale payments, second retail. the first driver bank england’s consultation new medium-term vision high-value rtgs service, publish day ago2. rtgs deliver extend period stability sterling payments, range risk-mitigation feature least equal system globally, generally well think users. but, two decade operation, capacity deal accelerate pace change payment i describe early limited. that pose three risk achievement bank’s mission medium term. first, could see reversal proportion payment settle central bank money system develop outside rtgs net, harm financial stability. “ubering” central banks, like. second, may end impede stability-enhancing innovation competition. and, third, risk future diminution service quality, whether term meet user need operational continuity. our consultation paper set vision respond change – retain core risk-mitigating function current generation rtgs, fundamentally refresh technological base service deliver strategic change four key areas: broad access (including small banks, non-banks); even great resilience (in particular cyber-threats); strong inter-operability (including adoption iso 20022); good user functionality (including true near-24x7 operate capability, good liquidity management tool rich data provision). further detail give table a. take together, change aim safeguard stability rapidly-changing payment ecosystem whilst enable innovation take place: put modern responsive rtgs service heart. we seek feedback proposal 7 november, publish final blueprint early 2017. alongside change rtgs, reform also underway sterling retail payment systems. in many respects, uk start good position: instance, high rate mobile internet bank access, real time retail payment available 24/7/365 basis since 2008, fast payment introduced. but, i note start, landscape quite fracture one, use different message standard technology platforms, relatively high level tiering. last year saw establishment payment strategy forum, draw together wide range industry user participant plot new vision retail payments. the forum’s consultation future strategy concluded, include number recommendation simplification streamline governance technology underpin retail payments. this touch theme bank’s proposals, include particular recommendation move common interoperable message standard. an important yet fully answer question whether interoperability retail payment mean adoption common message standards, governance access criterion otherwise-separate retail technology – whether also mean limit technological convergence, example multiple “overlay” service use common “pipe” receive transmit payments. such model would consistent increase use application program interface (or apis) regulation second payment 1 the bank england actively engage work digital

enough way accommodate multiple different payment services, would pay operate it. a high-volume retail payment pipe would number characteristic public utility – but, unlike countries, would envisage bank england would build operate type infrastructure. these type challenge eminently solvable – way unique payments. to return i began, uk railway explore way combine common ownership track network timetable compete rail service provider whilst make use old, eccentrically-located stations. and energy telecommunication find solution similar problems, include across national borders. but history industry suggest entirely plain sailing: stake payment particularly high. that bank england payment system regulator work closely together ensure twin statutory objective systemic stability enhance competition meet whatever structure end proposed. i say early i think genuinely single technology platform uk unlikely feasible near term, draw analogy single platform three train stations. if spread platforms, draw together common set standard norms, plausible target, rtgs fit in? those particularly familiar london’s king’s cross station know spot (ironically platform 8 9), half-submerged luggage

potentially unyielding wall gain entry. if may parallel fictional construct role rtgs past – vital role plays, relative obscurity – firm intention future. the vision publish design underscore throw new light special role rtgs has, maintain stability provide final settlement central bank money payments, real-time gross basis systemically important. but also recognise need broaden access rtgs

draghi: research macroeconomic policy future welcome address mr mario draghi, president european central bank, first ecb annual research conference, frankfurt main, 28 september 2016. * * * let welcome european central bank’s first annual research conference (arc). this course first gather discus research ecb hold 18-year history. but arc deliberately great scale many small workshop hold past, cover whole range research relevant central banks. our aim bring together academia central bank work cut edge economics. the arc flagship research event year, make today’s conference first many come. the ecb commit significant resource research good research foundation good policy. it strengthen theoretical underpinnings policy framework, lay groundwork model use conjunctural analysis, help battle terrible twin empirical macroeconomics: endogeneity identification. the ability research identify counterfactuals allow u analyse ex post effect measures, understand ex ante impact new policy prior launch. a crisis euro area progress various phases, need research evidently increase sharply. to meet inflation objective deploy wide array new measures, precedent recent monetary history, least track record euro area. in so, draw heavily body academic research unconventional monetary policy build crisis. but time also act fast academia able follow. we depend crucially internal research ecb staff design, ass recalibrate monetary policy. the fragmentation euro area financial system 2011–12, example, require u fundamentally deepen understand monetary transmission mechanism. a decline real equilibrium rate cause u adopt negative interest rate policy provide right degree monetary stimulus, turn require close study effect break zero bound. we learn asset purchase programme work special condition euro area, characterise segment asset market bank-based transmission. we little choice conduct policy research real time. in many case operate largely unchartered waters. but important point that, case, able design effective monetary policy cope unprecedented series shocks. and base best insight research could provide time. but internal analysis inevitably move ahead academia crisis, eager academia catch up. we depend internal external research help u evaluate done, scrutinise various measure taken, offer insight analysis equip u future. good policymaking benefit scrutiny, welcome it. and look forward, depend research help u ways, too. perhaps salient today theme interaction monetary policy policy – i elsewhere call “independence interdependence”.1 1 draghi, m (2016), “on importance policy alignment fulfil economic potential”, 5th annual tommaso padoa-schioppa lecture brussels economic forum 2016, brussels, 9 june 2016. 2 bi central bankers’ speech to mind increasingly evident that, operate near low bound, interaction heightened. properly align policy help buttress other, misalign policy produce great side effects. to ensure monetary policy implement maximum effectiveness minimum side effect need understand interaction better. for instance, know interest rate rise safely away low bound, need structural reform raise potential output euro area boost long-run interest rates. but term structural reform remain somewhat vague. what key reform need lift total factor productivity growth, ensure optimal rate innovation re-allocation resource productive? how differ among country different stage cycle? structural reform politically difficult, need base rigorous research optimally sequence yield quick tangible result bolster momentum continue reform. along vein, need robust policy prescription optimal composition fiscal policy promote growth. we also need understand good monetary policy work new post-crisis financial landscape. since crisis, much research focus role financial intermediation macroeconomic dynamics. but give ecb’s newly acquire powers, research need interaction macroprudential regulation, microprudential supervision monetary policy help guide policymakers optimal mix. research also underpin policy require complete capital market bank union key safeguard monetary transmission face shocks. finally, need understand optimal balance policy tool term efficiency equity. we know failure central bank act crisis would distributional consequence asset debt holders, also vulnerable society disproportionately affect unemployment. but little know date distributional consequence unconventional tool used, either respect impact medium term. of range tool effective deliver inflation objective, least redistributive effects? and combine tool policy yield benefit mitigate costs? the complex interlinkages monetary policy policy aftermath crisis challenge central banker academic alike. set policy effectively new global environment require solid foundation high-quality research. conference first arc provide excellent opportunity strengthen link policymakers academic help create solid foundation. i look forward new insight next two day bring. and, identify key area research require strong stable growth euro area share all, i look forward hear idea analysis next year’s second arc. bi central bankers’ speech 1 janet l yellen: supervision regulation testimony m janet l yellen, chair board governor federal reserve system, committee financial services, u house representatives, washington dc, 28 september 2016. * * * chairman hensarling, rank member waters, member committee, i appreciate opportunity testify federal reserve’s regulation supervision financial institutions. one federal reserve’s fundamental goal make sure regulatory supervisory program tailor risk different financial institution pose system whole. a saw 2007–08, failure systemically important financial institution destabilize financial system undermine real economy. the largest, complicate firm must therefore subject prudential standard stringent standard apply firms. small medium-sized bank organization – whose failure would generally pose much le risk system – subject standard materially le stringent. the federal reserve make substantial progress build regulatory supervisory program consistent principles. we implement key standard design limit financial stability risk pose largest, complex bank firms. we continue work remain standard ass adequacy package measures. with respect small medium-sized banks, must build step already take ensure face undue regulatory burdens. look forward, must continue monitor emergence new risks, since another key lesson crisis financial stability threat change time. strengthen regulation supervision large financial institution the federal reserve’s post-crisis effort strengthen regulation supervision large bank focus promote safety soundness firm limit adverse effect distress failure could financial system broad economy. this orientation consistent section 165 dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act (dodd-frank act), direct board impose enhance prudential standard large bank organization “in order prevent mitigate risk financial stability.” our effort mitigate financial stability risk pose large financial institution generally fall one two categories. first, aim make large financial institution resilient order reduce likelihood failure distress. and second, aim make large financial institution resolvable limit damage failure would rest financial system broad economy. resiliency to increase resiliency large bank organizations, federal reserve establish broad set enhance prudential standard large domestic foreign bank organizations. together federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) office comptroller currency, implement capital rule require large bank organization hold substantially large amount high-quality capital require hold 2007–08 crisis, adopt liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) require organization hold buff high-quality, liquid asset sufficient meet liquidity outflow 30-day period severe fund stress. we also propose single-counterparty credit limit design guard build-up excessive concentration credit risk and, along federal 2 bi central bankers’ speech bank agencies, propose net stable fund ratio would require bank maintain minimum level stable fund relative liquidity asset one-year horizon. in addition strengthen regulation largest, complex financial institutions, also transform supervision firm pose elevate risk u.s. financial stability creation large institution supervision coordinate committee (liscc).1 the liscc distinguish several characteristics. first, liscc implement centralized, multidisciplinary approach supervision bring together expert around federal reserve system area supervision, research, legal counsel, financial markets, payment systems. second, major area focus supervision firm liscc portfolio capital liquidity resiliency normal potentially adverse condition future, well recovery resolution preparedness. and third, liscc complement traditional, firm-specific supervisory work annual “horizontal” program examine firm time set issue order promote good monitor trend consistency assessment across liscc firms. with regard capital adequacy, introduction capital stress test large bank organization one signature innovation since financial crisis. a event financial crisis demonstrated, capital buff seem adequate benign environment may turn far le adequate period stress. for reason, consistent stress-testing mandate dodd-frank act, federal reserve conduct supervisory stress test year bank organization $50 billion total asset determine whether sufficient capital continue operation period economic stress market turbulence, whether capital plan framework adequate risk profiles. the expectation embody stress test program large bank organization maintain sufficient capital buff withstand period significant stress promote resilience firm financial system generally. while stress test program successful since first introduce 2009, crisis reinforce need regulator supervisor continually revisit effectiveness tool adjust need time. we therefore launch review comprehensive capital analysis review (ccar) program last year aim re-assessing stress test practice comprehensive basis. a part process, meet wide range stakeholders, include academics, analysts, bankers, public interest groups, others. we consider make several change stress test methodology process. the lead idea emerge comprehensive ccar review integrate ccar regulatory capital framework. more specifically, regulatory capital rule include firm-specific, risk-based capital surcharge global systemically important bank (gsib) uniform capital conservation buff requirement regulatory capital minimum firms. under approach considering, exist capital conservation buff would replace risk-sensitive, firm-specific buff size base stress test results. each firm’s buff requirement would set equal decline common equity tier 1 capital ratio supervisory stress test. the buff requirement would floor 2.5 percent risk-weighted assets, current level 1 the firm currently liscc portfolio american international group, inc.; bank america corporation; the bank new york mellon corporation; barclays plc; citigroup inc.; credit suisse group ag; deutsche bank ag; the goldman sachs group, inc.; jpmorgan chase & co.; morgan stanley; prudential financial, inc.; state street corporation; ubs ag; well fargo & company. further information liscc available board’s website www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-supervision.htm. bi central bankers’ speech 3 capital conservation buffer, avoid reduction stringency regulatory capital rules. we call idea “stress capital buffer,” would effectively move stress test center regulatory capital framework. for eight u.s. gsibs, move stress loss buff – would similar effect include gsib capital surcharge ccar post-stress minimum – would result significant aggregate increase capital requirements. thus, addition simplify capital framework integrate ccar regulatory capital rules, stress loss buff would advance macroprudential goal make gsibs resilient. in contrast, move stress loss buff approach generally would entail toughen requirement 25 large bank firm subject ccar gsibs. nor would move impact community bank firm le $50 billion assets. we also consider make certain change stress test assumption use ccar. for example, current ccar program, firm’s capital adequacy assess assume firm continue make baseline capital distribution stress test’s two-year plan horizon. we consider change conservative assumption, significant part advent capital conservation buff regulatory capital rules, limit ability firm make capital distribution capital ratio low buff requirement. instead, propose firm simply add one year plan dividend stress capital buff requirement recognition fact firm generally reluctant reduce dividend share buybacks. on change ccar considering, course seek public input move adopt them. resolvability during crisis, fear systemic consequence would result bankruptcy systemically important firm motivate extraordinary government actions. the fear prove well-founded: the bankruptcy lehman brother significantly exacerbate crisis. to reduce potential resolution large financial firm bankruptcy disorderly, section 165(d) dodd-frank act require large bank organization produce live will help firm prepare resolve orderly way bankruptcy code. although bankruptcy code provide default legal framework resolve fail bank hold company, dodd-frank act also create backup resolution authority use resolution fail financial company bankruptcy code would serious adverse effect u.s. financial stability. the orderly liquidation authority title ii dodd-frank act several feature could reduce systemic impact firm’s resolution, include orderly liquidation fund provision prevent chaotic unwind firm’s derivatives, security finance transactions, qualify financial contracts. in unlikely event orderly liquidation fund incur losses, loss would cover assessment major financial firm would pass taxpayers. the federal reserve recently propose important new rule increase prospect orderly resolution gsib. last october, board propose require eight u.s. gsibs meet total loss-absorbing capacity (tlac) long-term debt requirements. the proposal would require systemically important firm maintain outstanding large quantity long-term debt could use absorb loss recapitalize firm resolution. because, definition, actual equity bank substantially deplete – totally eliminate – time fails, separate long-term debt requirement essential ensure resolution authority raw material manufacture new equity resolution recapitalize stabilize fail firm. for reason, propose long-term debt requirement would assuredly enhance prospect successful resolution – thereby contribute solve too-big-to-fail problem – would tlac requirement own. the proposal would also restrict 4 bi central bankers’ speech operation gsib hold companies, legal entity could go resolution without set short-term wholesale fund run otherwise jeopardize financial stability. in may year, board issue another proposal make gsibs resolvable. this second propose rule would impose restriction gsibs’ qualify financial contract – include derivative repurchase agreement (repos) – guard rapid, mass unwind contract resolution gsib. the propose restriction key step toward gsib resolvability rapidly unwind contract could destabilize financial system cause asset fire sale topple firms. act conjunction fdic, board also seek increase gsib resolvability live will process. in april year, board fdic announce result review eight u.s. gsibs’ 2015 resolution plans. during review, agency evaluate plan base firms’ capital, liquidity, governance mechanisms, operational capabilities, legal entity rationalization, derivative trade activities, responsiveness prior agency feedback. the agency find five gsibs’ plan fell short resolvability standard set dodd-frank act require firm fix deficiency plan october year potentially face stringent prudential requirements. if agency jointly determine firm fail adequately remedy note deficiencies, agency may jointly determine company subsidiary subject stringent capital, leverage, liquidity requirement restriction growth, activities, operation firm. the agency also identify less-severe shortcoming plan eight u.s. gsibs, expect address next round resolution plan submissions, due july 2017. the resolution plan process require firm demonstrate adequately assess challenge structure business activity would pose resolution take action address issues. firm must also confront resolution consequence day-to-day management decision continual basis, particularly relate structure, business activities, capital liquidity allocation, governance. firm also expect create meaningful set option sell operation business line generate resource allow restructure stress, include sale wind-down discrete business could minimize direct impact firm’s distress failure broad financial system. the deficiency shortcoming issue recent plan review focus step necessary ensure objective meet gsib ongoing basis. in addition provide firm feedback resolution plans, agency take several step april improve transparency resolution plan exercise. these step include publicly release firm feedback letters, paper outline resolution plan assessment framework firm determinations, document detail expectation agency regard firms’ 2017 resolution plan submissions. the expectation articulate 2017 plan content build detail guidance previously provide gsibs 2014 2015. while five firm receive joint deficiency require fix deficiency october 2016, firm receive agency feedback april require submit full resolution plan july 1, 2017. in plans, firm require address identify shortcomings, follow guidance provide agencies, meet statutory regulatory requirement resolution plans. in meet expectations, action firm need take substantially complete july 2017, previously communicate agencies. regulation supervision large regional bank organization in supervise bank organization $50 billion asset outside liscc program, board focus ensure company well managed, bi central bankers’ speech 5 appropriately capitalized, prepare withstand potential adverse development business environment. however, distress failure non-liscc firm unlikely effect financial system broad economy liscc firm, apply full range rule apply liscc portfolio. for example, board’s risk-based leverage capital surcharges, well recently propose long-term debt tlac requirements, apply gsibs. similarly, advance approach capital rules, countercyclical capital buffer, supplementary leverage ratio, full lcr apply large internationally active bank organizations. we also scale examination procedure reflect low level systemic risk present bank $50 billion asset liscc companies. a result comprehensive ccar review i describe earlier, also consider exempt qualitative portion ccar bank le $250 billion total asset significant international nonbank activity. while strongly believe ccar qualitative review produce significant safety soundness benefit large firms, achieve supervisory goal medium-sized bank firm use normal supervisory program combine target horizontal assessment particular aspect capital planning, many firm meet close meet supervisory expectation capital plan processes. a require statute, firm would still subject quantitative portion stress test program. but even respect quantitative portion ccar, consider reduce amount data firm require submit stress test purposes. regulatory supervisory requirement tailor regional bank organizations, define total asset $10 billion $50 billion. for example, regional bank organization must comply capital rules, subject supervisory stress test ccar. rather, require dodd-frank act, regional bank organization perform stress tests. similarly, company subject enhance prudential standard establish section 165 dodd-frank act, lcr, relate requirements. instead, conduct regular inspection regional bank organization evaluate safety soundness base company’s individual circumstances, addition horizontal exam conduct regional bank organizations. because many regional bank organization concentrate asset activity bank subsidiary supervise federal bank agencies, coordinate supervisory activity closely u.s. bank agency rely significantly result examinations, focus inspection parent company ability serve source strength subsidiary banks. community bank supervision i know community bank play vital role many districts. let say experience challenge community bank new me. before i become chair board governor vice chair that, i spend six year president federal reserve bank san francisco. in role, i involve supervision substantial number community bank organization nine state san francisco district. among lesson experience reinforce come bank regulation supervision, one size fit all. to effectively promote safety soundness ensure institution comply applicable consumer protection law without create undue regulatory burden, rule supervisory approach tailor different type institution community banks. the federal reserve supervise 800 community bank 4,000 hold company control small depository institutions. these bank organization total asset $10 billion less. in supervise community banks, follow risk-focused approach aim target examination resource higher-risk area 6 bi central bankers’ speech bank’s operation ensure bank maintain risk-management capability appropriate size complexity. in wake crisis, take step refine process use financial data collect bank calibrate examination procedure base risk. we believe help u identify address emerge risk ensure community bank examiner specialize expertise allocate institution exhibit high risks. we also implement risk-focused consumer compliance examination framework community bank 2014 intend allow examiner spend le time low-risk compliance issue issue likely result harm consumer get attention. the federal reserve bank agency currently process complete economic growth regulatory paperwork reduction act (egrpra) review. under egrpra, federal bank agency require conduct joint review regulation every 10 year identify provision outdated, unnecessary, unduly burdensome. the federal reserve view review timely opportunity step back identify way reduce regulatory burden, particularly small le complex bank pose le risk u.s. financial system. in carry review, agency seek public comment regulation hold several roundtable discussion banker interest party gather additional feedback source burden. theme emerge comment include streamline call report, reduce examination frequency, raise long-standing dollar-based threshold appraisals, reduce complexity capital requirement small banks. in response public comment examination frequency, agency already approve interim rule implement provision fix america’s surface transportation act (fast act), raise asset threshold insure depository institution eligible 18-month examination cycle $500 million $1 billion. a result raise threshold, eligible institution subject few safety soundness bank secrecy act exams. the agency also explore potential option alleviate burden appraisal requirement actively consider proposal simplify regulatory capital requirement community banks. in addition, bank agencies, auspex federal financial institution examination council, recently issue proposal new streamline call report community banks. the proposal would eliminate certain data item reduce report frequency many data items. a result, bank le $1 billion total asset would submit call report 40 percent few data item exist call report. the proposal incorporate comment bank agency receive community bank several outreach event use gather information challenge face community bank prepare call reports. congress may also wish consider carve community bank two set dodd-frank act requirements: volcker rule incentive compensation limit section 956. the risk address statutory provision far significant large institution community banks. in event community bank engage practice either area raise heighten concerns, would able address concern part normal safety-and-soundness supervisory process. while bank agency tailor volcker rule propose significant tailor incentive compensation rules, community bank supervisor would benefit focus regulatory compliance matter unlikely pose problem small banks. current condition have review major element regulatory supervisory programs, let offer brief remark current state firm regulate. bi central bankers’ speech 7 in response regulatory supervisory pressures, financial condition u.s. gsibs strengthen considerably since crisis. common equity capital eight u.s. gsibs alone double since 2008, represent increase almost $800 billion. moreover, firm generally develop much stable fund positions. the large bank organization increase hold high-quality liquid asset $1 trillion past five years, time substantially reduce reliance run-prone source funding. reduce run-risk central goal post-crisis regulation supervision. our examination find large regional bank well capitalized. both large regional bank organization show improve profitability since depth financial crisis, although bank also face challenge recent year weak growth interest noninterest income. both large regional institution see robust growth commercial industrial lending, support sustainable job creation. finally, community bank significantly healthier. more 95 percent profitable, capital lose crisis largely replenished. loan growth pick up, problem loan level last see early financial crisis. conclusion in conclusion, post-crisis approach regulation supervision forward-looking tailor level risk firm pose financial stability broad economy. standard largest, complex bank organization significantly stringent standard small medium-sized banks, appropriate give impact failure distress firm could economy. a i discussed, anticipate take additional action near term tailor regulatory supervisory framework. yet even finalize major element post-crisis reform, work complete. we must carefully monitor impact regulatory change make remain vigilant regard potential emergence new risk financial stability. we must stand ready adjust regulatory approach change warranted. the work ensure financial system remain strong stable design protect support real economy sustain business job american household rely. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: have confidence europe keynote speech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, conference organise istituto affari internazionali, rome, 26 september 2016. * * * i would like thank stephanie bergbauer florian walch assistance prepare speech. all view express herein remain mine. the european union go difficult phase. the economic crisis, threat terrorism arrival unprecedented number migrant pose challenge europeans. the eu’s response challenge remove doubt ability act coherently effectively common solution needed. follow uk’s referendum eu membership, europe become embroil wide-ranging discussion raison d’être. this discussion however successful merely diplomatic exercise: europe bring european close together, need relate citizen listen civil society. in words, re publica need discuss various part forum, curia, senator meet rome, also comitium, citizen could openly debate matter time. i thus grateful invitation opportunity speak istituto affari internazionali today engage discussion you. what i present observation assessment perspective european central banker analyse provide suggestions. but, see, quite number issue i discus today lie outside realm central bank fact come political debate ultimately political leadership. in view, european union today lack confidence two important ways: first, lack confidence europe; is, ability european policy address today’s challenges, reap benefit globalisation control costs, increase europe’s economic potential. this lack confidence reflect low level public trust eu institutions, rise support eurosceptic parties, evident outcome uk referendum june year. second, also lack confidence europeans. this compound perceive lack strong unify bond joint identity eu citizens. the divergence national public discourse economic governance reach disturbingly high level euro area. sometimes, even common analysis go wrong. policymakers increasingly speak other. let’s therefore set aside preconception ask restore confidence europe europeans. first, i argue, need resolute action national level. second, need provide clarity ensure consistency european integration. and, third, overcome political fragmentation, need reinforce common forum debate future europe. 2 bi central bankers’ speech there good reason confidence europe first, i believe fact good reason confidence europe i want mention them1. alongside unite state china, european union currently one three big economic bloc world, roughly equal size term purchase power parity. europe protect citizen external economic disruption offer unique social model. a social model proud inspire world, provide make sustainable. furthermore, manage largely mitigate recent financial economic crisis, many country eu serious crisis since second world war. it four year ago euro area look abyss. but today, find significantly good environment. in summer 2012, financial fragmentation peak since strongly receded. five member state economic adjustment programmes, four stand feet. unemployment, although still unacceptably high countries, decline 2016 third consecutive year, employment growth euro area beat expectations. the euro, despite deficiency architecture, tangible benefit people europe. it second important currency world, deliver measurable economic benefit european since introduction2. investment competition likewise benefit reduction currency risk transaction costs. the euro protect single market eliminate possibility competitive exchange rate devaluations. and without euro, unlikely small medium-sized economy would good weather global financial turmoil. during crisis, euro arguably great bond hold european together: commitment protect single currency integrity euro area determine key decision take european institution member states. it force common bond also reflect public opinion: popular support euro remain high throughout crisis. in spring 2016, support single currency stand 68% euro area3 majority citizen favour euro euro area member states. the ecb institution task safeguard price stability euro prove able act decisively within mandate, even difficult situations, adapt policy tool change economic environment. we estimate thing equal measure take since 2014 raise inflation rate half percentage point, average, 2016 2017. and help increase real euro area gdp growth one half percentage point cumulate 2015–2018. finally, establishment european bank supervision bring important improvement financial architecture economic monetary union (emu). for almost two year ecb supervise around 130 significant bank euro area indirectly supervise banks. and bank substantially strengthen capital position time: since 2012, cet1 ratio significant banks, instance, move 9% 13% today. moreover, 1 see also cœuré, b., “the

currency back single, credible effective institution establishment single supervisor good reason confidence europe. nevertheless, i won’t deny need much good number areas. a mention previously, monetary policy effective support output inflation. but i say elsewhere4, monetary policy measure take implicit assumption would transient: one hand, monetary stimulus would ultimately help counter cyclical force depress real equilibrium rate hand economic fiscal policy would provide cyclical support tackle structural driver low real rates. but fiscal economic policy fact play role, risk trap low growth, low interest rate equilibrium. move interest rate “low long” “low forever” would severely limit room manoeuvre conventional monetary policy tools, even worryingly, would threaten contract generation well risk tear social fabric. today, build confidence europe also mean show together national governments, steer u away outcome. there two way need improve economic fiscal policies. on one hand national government need live responsibility policy areas. on hand, need strengthen economic fiscal policy tool european level. let explain detail. national government need live responsibility the solution situation must start national level. one important cornerstone current set-up principle responsibility economic fiscal policy lie largely national governments. there coordination tool

governor, continue tradition productive engagement committee andthe reserve bank. you assure i best answer questionsconstructively i look forward regular hear come years.in open remarks, i would like cover three set issues. the first monetary policyframework. the second recent economic development australia elsewhere. and thethird major project reserve bank currently undertaking.the monetary policy frameworkearlier week, treasurer i release update statement conduct ofmonetary policy. these statement – first release 1996 – record thecommon understand reserve bank government key aspect ofaustralia’s monetary central bank policy framework. they also set agreedarrangements promote transparency accountability bank.over recent times, quite lot public commentary australia elsewhereabout monetary policy frameworks. a would expect, always study variousarguments follow recent debate carefully.our view flexible medium-term inflation target remain right monetary policyframework australia. this reaffirm new statement conduct monetarypolicy, also endorse reserve bank board. the goal remain cpiinflation average 2 3 per cent time.the current framework introduce early 1990s serve australia well. itprovides community reasonable degree certainty average level ofprices likely change medium term. this help people make decision abouttheir save investments. low stable inflation remain important precondition forstrong sustainable growth employment incomes.it worth emphasise ever since adoption current framework, reserve bankhas proponent know flexible inflation targeting. we see jobas always keep inflation tightly narrow range. we called‘inflation nutters’. we balance perspective, recognise degree ofvariability inflation year year inevitable appropriate.in particular, flexible medium-term target best way u deliver low stable inflationin way contribute broad responsibilities, include employment preservingfinancial stability. we want ensure deliver average rate inflation australia ofbetween 2 3 per cent time. it public interest this. it also thepublic interest pursue objective way promote good employment outcomesfor country preserve financial stability. in way, best contribute 1 / 5bis central banker's speech economic prosperity welfare australian people require reserve bank act.our judgement, then, flexible medium-term inflation target remain right monetarypolicy framework australia. while argument type arrangements, noneof sufficiently strong move away current framework, helpedpromote stability confidence australian economy.so new statement conduct monetary policy represent continuity thepreviousstatement. the main draft change make link monetary policy andfinancial stability little direct. in previous statement, monetary policy financialstability deal separate part document. yet, years, financial stabilityconsiderations factor monetary policy deliberations. recently, example,we consider quick return inflation 2 3 per cent range cost ofa material deterioration health private sector balance sheet unlikely thepublic interest. the revise draft recognise inflation target pursue contextof bank’s broad objectives, include financial stability.recent economic developmentsi would like turn recent economic data.our economy continue transition follow boom commodity price mininginvestment. accord late national account, gdp increase 3.3 per cent theyear june. this good outcome widely expect year ago. it also littleabove estimate trend growth economy. partly reflect above-trend growth,the unemployment rate decline around ½ percentage point past year. again,this good outcome think likely year ago.as always case, aggregate outcome mask significant variation across industriesand regions. those part economy benefit resource boom nowexperiencing difficult conditions, area considerably better. in otherareas, business condition improved, employment increase somesigns modest pick-up private investment.overall, economy adjust reasonably well unwind big mininginvestment boom century. this significant achievement. we managingthis adjustment partly flexibility exchange rate flexibility wagesand support provide monetary policy.the story income growth le positive, growth nominal gdp beingdisappointing. over past five years, nominal gdp increase average rate around3 per cent per year. to put number context, 2000 2007, nominal gdp grewat average rate 7½ per cent per year. this quite change. it go way toexplaining sense disappointment part community recent economicoutcomes.the main reason weak income growth recent time large fall pricesreceived exports. since september quarter 2011, export price fall aroundone-third. this fall, though, need keep perspective. export price remainconsiderably high 1990s early 2000s, relative price ourimports. and course, fall price increase production fromaustralia. so receive low price exports, sell more.the recent news commodity price bite positive while.over past couple months, price key export risen, partly inresponse production cutback high-cost producer elsewhere world. while 2 / 5bis central banker's speech difficult predict future, increase sustain could look forwardto drag national income fall commodity price come end.a second factor weigh growth nominal gdp slow rate wage increases.this common experience across industrialise country present, even withstrong employment growth. in australia, current rate wage growth slow aroundtwo decades. it part adjustment follow resource boom. importantly, mean thatmany people job would otherwise case.the low wage growth low commodity price mean cpi inflation quitelow recent times. inflation also hold increase competition part ofretailing cost reduction supply chains. slow growth rent also play role.the low inflation outcome provide scope monetary policy provide additional supportto demand. the reserve bank board decide reduce cash rate 25 basis point mayand august year. lend rate come result. deposit rate have, ofcourse, also come down. the board conscious mean low interest income forsavers. overall though, judgement ease monetary policy support jobsand economic activity australia, thus improve prospect sustainable growth andinflation outcome consistent medium-term target.looking forward, expect economy continue support low interest rate andthe depreciation exchange rate since early 2013. importantly, drag fall inmining investment also come end. while mine investment still way fall,our estimate around three-quarters total decline behind us.inflation expect remain low time, gradually pick labour marketconditions strengthen further.one issue attract lot attention late house market. the constructioncycle bite momentum expect earlier. this add supply ofhousing country, partly explain slow growth rents. the rate whichestablished house price increase also moderated, although remain somepockets price increase briskly. credit growth turnover house marketare also low year ago. under apra’s guidance, lend standard alsobeen tightened. overall, then, situation somewhat comfortable yearago, although continue watch thing carefully.if i could turn international environment.the overall picture time. the global economy continue expand,but rate little average. growth global trade investment subdued. inflation isalso generally low central bank targets. and interest rate many country arestill low.one issue continue attract lot attention global monetary environment.as talk previous occasions, global level heavyreliance monetary policy stimulate growth. some central bank take extraordinaryactions, include large-scale money creation set negative policy interest rates. this hashad global ramifications. while action generally take directintention influence exchange rates, have, inevitably, affect international capital flowsand exchange rates. we see effect australia. the monetary expansionelsewhere low rate offer overseas mean foreign investor

economy,focusing sharp fall commodity price past years.in 2012, take current role, colleague i look theaustralian economy adjust unprecedented boom commodity prices. bythe time i present work, price australia’s key commodity begin turn andmining investment peak record level.since then, commodity price fall much australia’s term trade (theprice export relative imports) fall significantly. the fall we, andmost others, expected. more recently, though, commodity price risen. and thanthree-quarters anticipate decline mine investment behind us.the adjustment economy decline term trade large fall mininginvestment draw process, adversely affect range industry regions.but growth economy overall close trend, unemployment raterose, reach little 6 per cent 2015. more recently, inflation declined.before talk period boom, i want set scene. first, i’ll briefly review theboom years. second, i’ll describe anticipate four year ago would likely happenafter boom.the boom yearsthe rapid industrialisation urbanisation chinese economy underpin strong risein commodity price around mid 2000s. a global demand commodity begin tooutstrip supply, price australia’s key commodity export rise dramatically.australia’s term trade rise 85 per cent average early 2000s peak inlate 2011 (graph 1). that imply significant boost real purchase power domesticproduction. some gain retain foreign owner mine assets, shareof gain stay home form high wages, tax revenue profit australianowners mine firm support mine activity.123 1 / 16bis central banker's speech the rise australia’s term trade associate large appreciation nominalexchange rate (see table 1 appendix). while low return australiancommodity exporter (and australian exporter broadly), allow real income gain toflow rest economy via associate decline price imports.the resource sector abroad respond commodity price boom expandingproductive capacity. this occur gradually, reflect unforeseen magnitude theboom, unexpected persistence, time require plan for, approve completelarge resource projects. in mid 2012, investment australian resource sector peak atjust 8 per cent gdp, compare average around 2 per cent prior boom.in lead-up investment peak, growth output, employment wage resourcesector (broadly define include industry service it) relatively strong. the boom inthose industry lead strong economic condition resource-rich state westernaustralia queensland.the significant appreciation exchange rate provide signal labour capital beredistributed ‘other tradable’ sector towards resource sector. a result, growthin investment, output, employment wage weak ‘other tradable’ sector.the large nominal exchange rate appreciation also help contain inflationary pressure anenvironment strong growth domestic demand decline unemployment rate torelatively low levels. notwithstanding assistance, overall inflation pick little above4 2 / 16bis central banker's speech inflation-targeting average. non-tradable inflation elevate boom year andgrowth nominal unit labour cost relatively strong period. in response tothese inflationary pressures, reserve bank raise cash rate (inflation-targeting) average.after boom – what we have think might happenin previous analysis, note commodity price boom economy hadbehaved, many respects, theory suggested. we also discuss economy mightadjust term trade declined.it clear mine investment would fall, time, resource export wouldincrease additional productive capacity come line. however, overall demand labour inthe mine sector (and mining-related activity) would decline investment phase inthat sector relatively labour intensive production phase.with global supply commodity catch global demand, think commodityprices and, therefore, australia’s term trade would decline (but remain high pre-boom levels). that would normally associate depreciation australian dollar.we anticipate demand non-mining sector would pick labour capitalwould draw back part economy. any depreciation nominal exchange ratewould facilitate transition improve competitiveness ‘other tradable’ sector. themovement labour would also facilitate decline wage growth, labourshed company undertake mine investment look move back non-mining sectors. in words, think requisite real exchange rate depreciationwould occur largely via nominal exchange rate, might also assist decline indomestic cost pressures.these development expected, least part, reverse effect consumerprice inflation see investment phase boom. in particular, gradual depreciationof exchange rate would put upward pressure tradable inflation time, reductionin wage growth domestic cost generally would put downward pressure non-tradable inflation. these oppose effect could potentially result little net change overallinflation, give inflation average boom, would besurprising see inflation average boom.but make prediction direction key variables, also note theconsiderable degree uncertainty, include relate global economic outlook.after boom – what actually happened?many prediction bear out. mine investment decline significantly andresource export grow strongly. mine investment fall, although large drag ongdp growth source likely come go financial year passed.the decline mine investment 2012 lead low growth overall mine activity (mininginvestment plus resource exports; graph 2). more recently, growth

inflation declined, drive low inflation non-tradable item consistent witha significant decline growth labour costs. at time, inflation tradable itemshas increase follow exchange rate depreciation.in short, pattern behaviour key macroeconomic variable quiteconsistent initially think might happen. however, magnitude speedof adjustment surprise us. in part, reflect external developments, mostnotably:the larger-than-expected decline commodity price term trade; andthe extent persistence low growth low inflation much world theassociated easy monetary policy major central banks.despite challenges, australian economy display degree flexibility hashelped process adjustment.commodity price term tradeaustralia’s term trade decline expect year ago (graph 4).around time previous analysis, forecast decline term oftrade come years. but 2012 2015, repeatedly revise ourforecasts. 5 / 16bis central banker's speech the larger-than-expected decline australia’s term trade reflect demand- andsupply-side factors. growth demand commodity asia, china particular,declined noticeably. in large part, response excess capacity manufacture aswell decline real estate investment china. among things, see thegrowth global steel production stall, hence low growth demand iron ore andcoking coal.on supply side, commodity producer able reduce cost thaninitially think possible, higher-cost supplier sustain production level forlonger anticipated.the larger-than-expected decline term trade weigh growth economicactivity, employment, profits, wage fiscal revenues, well inflation. the effect hasbeen large mine sector key mine states, evident across theeconomy broadly.the exchange ratethe depreciation australian dollar recent year improve australia’scompetiveness thereby support production tradable sector. however, thedepreciation didn’t start earnest 18 month term trade peaked. and whileit hard precise, model suggest exchange rate (the real trade weighted7 6 / 16bis central banker's

larger-than-expected decline term trade past year mean nominal outcomeshave significantly weak early forecast. from 2013 2015, nominal gdp increasedby around 8 per cent, half initial forecast 17 per

everyindustry states. it currently low western australia queensland, inindustries expose end mine investment boom (graph 9). some decline wagegrowth response decline mine investment term trade beexpected, decline wage growth great imply historical relationshipswith unemployment rate. that could reflect several factors:workers engage mining-related activity move low pay jobsoutside resource

significant adjustmentin range market ‘prices’ – include wage nominal exchange rate, although theexchange rate depreciate little le otherwise give global developments. monetarypolicy also responded, interest rate reduce low levels. so mine investmentand nominal gdp growth weak forecast year ago and,more recently, inflation bite weak expected, growth non-mining economyhas pick bite good early anticipated. indeed, late, real gdp growth hasbeen bite strong unemployment rate little low early forecast.in many respects, adjustment decline mine investment term trade hasproceeded relatively smoothly. the australian economy perform well compare otheradvanced economy (graph 11). moreover, drag growth decline mininginvestment wan term trade forecast remain around currentlevels. 13 / 16bis central banker's speech of course forecast subject usual range uncertainty. but, give commodityprices increase substantially course year, stability term oftrade seem plausible time. development china

reasonable prospect sustaininggrowth economic activity, would support gradual decline unemploymentrate. there also good prospect growth wage rate inflation graduallylift period ahead. that’s what’s

insurance supervision bank england, general insurance research organisation conference, dublin, 21 september 2016. * * * good morning. this first speech bank’s executive director insurance supervision. since i take role july, i try meet many chief executive chairman uk insurer possible. i strike variety business model strategy one theme dominate discussion risk face insurers: current low rate environment. for life insurers, create direct solvency pressure extent fully match increase value future liability discount rate fall. that also issue general insurer long tail liabilities. more generally, low investment return mean earn “float” long cushion poor underwrite performance. the margin error run general insurance firm reduce – firm underwrite profitably. on positive side, emphasis importance underwrite discipline. the soft market but course current soft market make profitable underwrite difficult achieve. i go focus remark today wholesale london markets. although i tell tentative sign premium rate stabilise recently, fall across wholesale line around decade now. for example, guy carpenter’s global property catastrophe rate-on-line index reduce third since peak 2006. our market survey early year find year-on-year decline (chart 1). look possible cause current soft market, surely part another manifestation wide low return environment. the obvious evidence inflow capital market institutional investors. perhaps great extent historically, insurance interconnect wide capital market market force drive expect return line investment opportunities. these wide pressure may explain squeeze profits. but insurer still price cover view risk. at begin 2016 carry survey capture view rate adequacy new renew business. the result suggest estimate rate adequacy new business is, cases, high renew business. whist may reflect many insurer tell u – want grow segment believe adequately priced; another interpretation insurer overly optimistic risk limit historical claim data previous risk carrier decline long believe adequately priced. despite fall premium rates, general insurer profit past year sustain benign catastrophe experience level prior year reserve release high thirty year (chart 2). natural catastrophe major component many gi firms’ risk profiles. catastrophe loss return normal level historical standard first half year. but low incidence catastrophic event recent year may give support idea component way diminished, whether due trend nature effective management risk policyholder insurers. i also hear speculation man-made risk may decreased: example, plane ship build good previously, company good manage risks. mindful impact uncertainty involve consider this, would expect firm seek 2 bi central bankers’ speech best available evidence take prudent comprehensive view assessment risks. put simply, would expect handful recent data point lead mark reduction firm’s assessment best estimate liability “1 200” risk. turn reserve releases, obvious concern reflect genuine reserve redundancy decision take risk manager actuary use best professional judgement way influence desire sustain report profits. for long tail lines, casualty, key assumption set reserve expectation future claim inflation. in case assumption derive implicitly use recent actual data trend forward. give recent past see fall inflation many sector obvious question – reasonable assume trend continue? it seem plausible claim inflation often low expect background current low inflation environment. but calculation suggest reserve release case get point imply future claim inflation look low. in extreme case, estimate past claim inflation class business 5% per annum, whereas obtain particular insurer’s book reserve would imply future claim inflation assumption –2%. if future trend fact line past inflation, book reserve would need 25% high currently assumed. insurer seek diversify grow business longer-tail liability insurance class critical question answer future direction claim inflation. manage risk soft market speak firm approach market, often talk prioritise margin growth, focus profitable line business – example, establish strong market position particular niche, make active use reinsurance. these seem sensible approach individual firm but, aggregate, risk must end someone. one indicator competitive pressure insurer source new business wholesale market brokerage commission increase share gross write premium despite common desire low cost line low premium rates. look forward, key challenge insurer preserve even

angelovska-bezoska: statistical implication new financial landscape remark m anita angelovska-bezoska, vice-governor national bank republic macedonia, panel discussion 8th ifc conference “statistical implication new financial landscape”, bank international settlements, basel, 8–9 september 2016. * * * contributor note: ana mitreska maja andreevska. since burst crisis, central bank community provide unprecedented monetary stimulus view influence financial condition thus revive growth. the measure go far beyond pre-crisis mode operation. if conduct monetary policy pre-crisis period seem like steer ship rudder enough powerful protect waves, wave emerge 2007–2008 strong reliance traditional instrument pose risk sinking. thus, central bank approached/reached zero-lower bound, compel start experiment new policy tool balance sheet policies, forward guidance recent period, even extremely, negative policy interest rate. ha monetary accommodation serve purpose influence financial economic conditions? while ample evidence measure succeed influence finance conditions, far strong empirical evidence impact output inflation. in fact, despite ample liquid ultra-low interest rates, output growth remain weak inflation stubbornly low point weak monetary transmission mechanism. this new puzzle reality trigger profound discussion monetary policy framework academia policy make community. be main traditional monetary policy principle -price stability main objective, form flexible it adequate strategy, policy rate main instrument- still valid? a crisis clearly demonstrate price stability guarantee financial stability financial instability long last effect output inflation, discussion focus need take account financial stability monetary policy frameworks. thus, question: be call “flexible it” enough flexible deal current future challenge maybe observer suggested, think give alternative strategy target price level nominal gdp. the discussion even touch upon question add explicit financial stability objective. for example, borio (2016) claim ”if mandate (of central banks) see overly constrain room maneuver, revisit taboo. after all, mandate mean end.” concern instruments, current debate focus whether unconventional tool kit temporary, initially considered, become conventional tool supplement traditional monetary instrument. this is, particular, context ultra-low interest rate environment still anemic recovery. some instrument (balance sheet policies) even blur clear line fiscal monetary policy, challenge notion central bank independence. give importance good statistic monetary policy decision making, new financial landscape imply statistics? the crisis usually tend provide impetus reshape think statistical concepts/frameworks proper policymaking. thus, great depression shift focus development national accounts, growth euro-dollar market 1960 1970s development international bank statistics, asian financial crisis shift focus strong linkage financial external stability conducive development data standard initiative (gdds, sdds, roscs). the emergence late crisis 2 bi central bankers’ speech put spotlight financial sector, reveal devastate impact lax regulation financial sector advance economy global economy accentuate need tight surveillance financial stability. the cross-border linkages, internationalization integration financial market institution underestimated, global economic consequences. this time international dimension financial system emphasize importantly, macro-financial linkages. both major implication production statistic regular set require data, need make informative decision monetary policy micro macro prudential area. while crisis result lack proper data quality statistic pre-crisis period deem satisfactory, still crisis bring surface area rather poorly cover statistics. highly globalize world mark high rise trade especially financial interconnectedness among economies, well strong interlinkages different sector within economies, particular financial sector (including non-regulated segment) non-financial corporation due strong macro-financial linkage ask enhance data sets. broad data set help good understand development economic financial sector, cross-sectoral cross-border linkage subsequently, adopt timely measure prevent build-up imbalances, well deal effectively unfold effect crisis. this time, international effort reexamine statistical framework data gap reflect g20 data gap initiative. it contain 20 recommendation four key segments: build-up risk financial sector, cross-border financial linkages, vulnerability domestic economy shocks, improve communication official statistics. the initiative serve guideline progress area statistics, ever since. fill statistical gap set medium long-term objective concentrate along couple dimensions: availability data – especially availability granular data data relate unconventional instruments, international comparability, quality improvement timeliness data. at current juncture, need data granularity pertinent aspect policymaking, include monetary policymaking, monetary analysis research area. the recent crisis question need usefulness traditional aggregate economic financial statistic (gdp components, aggregate credit growth, employment, total external public debt, budget deficit etc.,), surely reveal enough. if want increase effectiveness monetary policy measures, accept granular micro data, regular analytical underpin monetary policy decision nowadays. of course, idea act selectively monetary policy measures. i still believe monetary policy tackle aggregates. it wide understand aggregate behave manner do, importantly, good understand heterogeneous behavior different economic agent economy. the ultimate outcome good understand monetary policy transmission functions, main constraint effective transmission do overcome obstacles. hence, micro granular data supplement aggregate statistics, allow u timely detection good understand “financial innovation, regulatory change behavioral reaction change economic environment”. also, granular data imply high flexibility statistician respond urgent ad-hoc request policy makers. at point, i would like pinpoint several example clearly demonstrate value add data granularity policy perspective. how explain phenomenon slow credit growth despite massive monetary policy accommodation? obviously need dive individual/ granular data understand cause impair transmission – demand supply side? in case, scrutinize individual balance sheet point different obstacle different bi central bankers’ speech 3 bank – although case liquidity issue, mostly capital constraint context deleveraging, new basel regulation, well relatively high level npls. it raise question effectiveness monetary policy transmission factor hind it. in respect, aggregate data informative enough, micro bank-by-bank data need detect constraint proper manner. the scrutinization balance sheet individual bank reveal main obstacle vary different banks. for limit capital main constrain factor expansion activities. give point time space increase capital profit retention injection additional capital limited, bank position expand more, without jeopardize capital adequacy ratios. in banks, quality current credit portfolio large amount npls obstacle provide credit economy. for banks, source finance credit activity limited, act drag credit activity. hence, exploration individual bank data indicate various reason monetary measure yield expect result different solution relevant different banks. lend survey widely recognize important source relevant data credit market. in midstream crisis, particular, central banks, also international institution start conduct lend survey tackle potential structural rigidities, preclude rapid credit growth. in case macedonia, run lend survey since 2006. ever since alternative “soft” data auxiliary, time important information source allow u detect path demand supply credits, main determinant drive two, also banks’ vision future developments. very often, policymakers, go beyond aggregate result screen result survey either observe individual bank data, data group bank (large, medium, small), behavior might differ significantly “be lose mask average”. this help good understand monetary policy shock different type financial institution (small/large, foreign/domestic, across different business models). credit registry establish 1998 provide loan–by-loan data appear useful tool financial stability monetary policy purposes. the recent crisis emphasize despite fact vast data credit available, still granular, frequent flexible credit data needed. though mainly purpose credit risk assessment financial stability issues, i refer later, availability loan-by-loan data characteristic allow profound monetary policy research. in particular, individual loan-by-loan data utilize instance, explore risk-taking monetary policy channel, margin research. further, data credit registry allow u investigate credit flow channel – extent support sme segment, key segment revive growth boost employment, extent channel non-tradable sector create possible bubble road. of course, bank system one sequence monetary policy transmission mechanism. the corporates household important part, whose behavior affect outcome undertake monetary policy measures. a first line policymaking, surely still rely stylize macro models, strive estimate calibrate average behavior economy, behavior representative agents. of course, reality much different heterogeneity much pronounce envisaged. this recent period, central bank, strive gather much possible micro information, corporate sector particular. one important step launch first survey wage price dynamics, similar survey convey euro area, provide one comprehensive overview behavior corporates term wage price adjustments. the result survey, subsequent research, give valuable information. it pertain information nominal real wage rigidities, way corporate sector adjust 4 bi central bankers’ speech balance sheet response different shocks. all support understand monetary policy transmission calibrate economic model incorporate heterogeneous agents. one lesson crisis many central bank enough granular data corporate sector. a mentioned, granular data serve important analytical tool assess potential vulnerability economy, thus important input monetary financial analysis central bank. we recognize importance corporate sector data quite early, context detect financial stability risk particular. aggregate balance sheet macedonian corporate sector transmit macedonia’s central registry central bank since. yet again, recognize aggregation lose information, disaggregated approach employed. since 2014, central bank, access individual balance sheet corporate entity economy. the granularity data allow close look behavior firm different sectors, performances, leverage, structure source financing, potential vulnerability might cumulate different sectors, different implication economy general. all valuable information, affordable use aggregate only. i would still like emphasize small economies, macedonian, usage micro data regular basis monetary policy purpose unknown practice. give that, small open economy, strategy de facto fix exchange rate, depth scrutinization external sector data practice long tradition. the incoming data external sector analyze aggregate sectoral level, also micro data individual company monitor monthly basis. this pertain mainly traditional sector relatively large weight total export, like metal industry. give importance, time large exposure external shocks, regular monitor individual data provide first signal potential vulnerabilities. even more, economy undergo major structural changes, particularly export sector, regular monitor newcomer provide clear vision impact economy general. even more, aggregate official statistical data, weight structure different sector revise predefined time interval, cannot capture impact structural reforms, satellite individual data

complementary analysis aggregate level. when discuss monetary policy data requirements, crisis, one important area course implementation unconventional monetary policy measures. doe unconventional monetary policy ask unconventional statistics? unconventional measure vary across country depend many country specific factor include real financial sector imbalance built-in run-up crisis fiscal monetary policy buffers. still, give many unconventional instrument target specific segment markets/economy, principle traditional data set may fully fit purpose entail need additional information make good diagnosis, prescribe proper medicine finally evaluate success treatment. this especially case unconventional measure become conventional new unconventional tool emerge along horizon, excluded. thus, move traditional aggregate-based statistic granular multi-purpose statistic bi central bankers’ speech 5 seem way forward. go back experience non-standard measures, give shallow underdevelop financial market, face data challenge central bank advance economies. yet, term unconventionality, effort make affect distribution already solid credit growth, support credit corporate sector, net-exporters energy producer particular. these identify segment long term support external position economy. in addition, measure undertaken, supportive finance corporate sector issuance longer-term debt securities, alternative source financing. in general, innovation monetary framework instrument go hand hand innovation statistics. the non-standard measure underline need devise specific dataset, produce regular basis, monitor effectiveness measure undertaken. the financial crisis underpin importance financial stability, force many central bank place much high priority financial stability concerns. the focus shift stability risk pertain individual financial institution systemic risk concept. in words, matter evenly potential instability financial system whole, risk adverse loop real sector. more importantly, crisis stress time dimension systemic risk procyclicality financial behavior structural dimension, arise interconnectedness among financial institution possible contagion effects. hence, macro prudential analysis measure gain weight, new datasets requirement pursue macro prudential role. i think even prior global crisis, central bank well equip wide range macroeconomic, monetary financial data. what probably miss well-established platform pursue strong macro-financial analysis, high frequency indicators, uniformity way indicator calculated. even more, usage granular, micro data individual financial institution weak link, preclude identification potential interlinkages contagion effect need macro prudential analysis. the exploration micro data borrower also miss element, certain point could important tool assess potential risk financial stability stability economy general. the g20 data gap initiative probably one systematic approaches, could provide general stocktaking monitor progress term “missing data” financial stability purposes. the build-up risk financial sector area, crisis pinpoint need create enhance data coverage. it acknowledge effort need area capture enough wide spectrum indicator location leverage excessive-risk taking, unregulated part particular (“the shadow system”), also liquidity, credit tail risk within regulate sector. an attention also draw need country produce soft data lend standards, run lend surveys, factor in, analysis, aggregate figure averages, also range distribution data. be specific, special focus put financial soundness indicator (fsis), encompass several dimension potential risk financial stability. the imf manage set-up template core encourage indicators, dramatically increase number country report fsis fund. probably countries, push-up mechanism rethink quality availability indicators. a experience, compile publish entire core encourage indicators, apart relate real estate

screen collateralize loan within central bank do permanent basis. yet, comprehensive data statistic area, house commercial property segments, challenge forthcoming period. one important financial stability consideration inclusion monitor system – wide macro prudential risk, mean inclusion regulate financial institutions, well shadow – unregulated ones. the lesson learn financial crisis point fact systemic risk arise part financial system. that also need data monitor financial institutions, supervise regulated, unregulated, well. in context, macedonia start collect detail data financial institution (ofis) since 2012. late on, regulator express interest data share data national bank. our experience, worldwide, confirm cooperation central bank regulatory body become necessity, even so, good statistic inter-agency exchange information data share become priority. let point macedonia experience significant damage crisis period, since structure financial system traditional (the mfi subsector hold almost 90% total assets), well conservative term financial instrument employ (mainly deposit credits). nevertheless, financial stability analysis scrutinize risk financial institutions, convey inter-sectoral contagion analysis ass possible spillover effect case shock. the central bank cooperate closely regulatory body financial stability committee, cooperation intensify last couple years, spread statistical data collection well. in 2014, bilateral agreement regulatory body ofis amend encompass security statistics, arrange data share streamline data collection need national bank regulators, enable parallel access data, well increase quality control process data collection, overcome confidentiality issues. the side coin enhance data set pose challenges. more frequent granular data increase report burden industry, also burden statisticians. this underline need “merit cost” procedure reinvestigating potential data share among domestic international institutions, bring u issue comparability possibility use similar data set different purposes. good cooperation among regulatory agency may help regard. the switch “aggregate statistics” granular multi-purpose static require adequate statistical resource include it infrastructure tool process present data meaningful form policymakers, able see wood lose among trees. the extensive production usage individual, micro data raise important question data security data confidentiality issues. so far, see important constraint statistics, also analytical work. know data available system, restrict use, often reality

large economy world old society write story new mandate. it’s indeed great pleasure associate chinese delegation morning launch bank. the bank get moment sun jurisdiction today. let extend warm welcome bank china. establish 1912, bank china successively serve china’s central bank, international exchange bank specialize international trade bank 1949. the bank eventually rise lead position chinese financial industry develop good stand international financial community. it’s reckon global systemically-important bank rank 4th worldwide 3rd china term tier 1 capital 2015. the bank, largely own government china, wish open branch oppose subsidiary mauritius. but bank mauritius require bank china go subsidiary branch imperatively demand prudential standards. the bank respectfully complied. the bank china’s state capital stand nearly rs2.0 billion – almost ten time amount require per bank act – reflect determination use presence mauritius strong powerful conduit facilitate expand

jurisdiction. low level state capital convey perception requirement obtain bank license lax, even though may stringent condition need satisfy open bank. most bank jurisdiction state capital well bank act prescribes. lately, bank mauritius tax inflexible, even arrogant, regard issue regulation supervision deposit-taking institutions. this rightly occasion share concerns. 2 bi central bankers’ speech under post-world war ii gold standard, never financial crisis thrust systemic risk world economy. since 1971, bretton wood system break down, international monetary financial system experience 13 major crises: • 1973 oil price shock international monetary crisis • 1979 oil price shock u dollar crisis • 1982 latin american debt crisis • 1984 bank crisis effective nationalization continental

crises. on average, every 4-year period world economy suffer major currency financial crisis last 45 years, let alone occasional political disturbance rivalry country wreak mayhem financial markets. the high frequency crisis increasingly last character keep regulator toes. every crisis know give minister finance governor central bank troublesome time taxpayer bear brunt regulatory mistake regulatory forbearance. from trust life-savers turn potential drown victims. there bad sin business regulate supervise financial institution fall “behind curve”. the consequence usually dire economy. insouciance costly society. the exigency universally accept rules, law by-laws business bank allow u adopt relax unperturbed attitude towards regulatory supervisory issues. to use shakespearean lexicon, responsible regulator often “cruel kind” financial system, economy and, extension, society whole. under appear arrogance central banking, lie unspoiled humility central banker. a damocles’ sword hanging, since quite time, neck bank number jurisdictions, particularly small ones. bank small jurisdiction operate penalize environment. many already sanction large correspondent bank overseas.

two choices: either sound like cassandra get lay back multiple dose congenital optimism take lightly another speed bump road imaginary perfect world. it’s amuse cassandra. but remember, cassandra end right. and trojan, blissfully disregard warnings, end wrong dead. with due regard business person seek bank license, i must say humility central banker regulator cannot afford embrace crude populism way professional life. effective enforcement prudential norm require strong regulatory supervisory framework. in light many regulatory challenge bank face several years, various attempt make consolidate legal framework. the attempt vain. this year, follow 2016–17 government budget, quite good number amendment bank act bank mauritius act proposed. this occasion thank honourable minister finance take amendment national assembly, defend conviction get through. regulator need authority; need discretion use authority evolve situation demand. but bank also recognize inherent complexity unpredictability market and, importantly, human behaviour necessitate flexibility. the bank does, however, keep mind basic principle use discretion. the authority thus grant bank mauritius use responsibly vainly. mauritius long history banking. the old mauritian bank mauritius commercial bank ltd, establish 1838. quite bank operational long 1838. and mauritius use regional financial hub

thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 malcolm edey: card payment retail sector speech mr malcolm edey, assistant governor (financial system) reserve bank australia, australian financial review retail summit, melbourne, 28 september 2016. * * * i thank darren flood extensive assistance prepare speech. introductory remark this conference retail industry, payment industry. however, retail business business retailer cannot get paid. and retailer won’t competitive payment cost high be. this issue staff reserve bank think every day, one i hope retailer take close interest well. today i’ll talk way pay changing, mean retail businesses. i’ll also talk reserve bank’s role payment regulator thing around corner payments. the change nature payment a good place start observation lose anyone here. that nature payment use changing, change quite rapidly moment. probably clear example people take-up contactless, tap-and-go, card payments. these take extraordinarily quickly australia, point australia think lead contactless market world. this technology offer benefit consumer merchant term time take process payment, result embrace – many merchant might also notice payment cost rise result change payment mix. this good example complex dynamic competition retail payment system. but rise contactless payment one range change occur payment system time – might noticed, probably never think about. possibly important trend see steady decline use traditionally paper-based payments. think last time write receive cheque. in 2000 average australian write around 35 cheque per year. in 2015/16 six. what more, cheque use decline two decades, decline anything accelerating; fall average 13 per cent per year precede five years, number cheque write fell 17 per cent 2015/16 (graph 1). we observe decline cheque many years, recently decline use traditionally paper instrument – cash – attract attention.1 the real way adequately measure use cash survey user – something reserve bank via consumer diary every three years. we run first survey 2007, large majority consumer payment – 69 per cent – make cash. by 2010, percentage fall 62 per cent 2013, 47 per cent, decline occur across payment value (graph 2). we run survey 1 the replacement paper polymer banknote change essential point here. 2 bi central bankers’ speech year, seem safe bet further, probably quite large, decline cash use.2 this trend people fall love cash; significant factor rapid rise online commerce, course cash option. so fill gap leave paper instruments? in retail space largely cards, grow average 11 per cent per year past five year (graph 3). this reflect cards’ large share online commerce, well gain grind retail point sale. base bank’s consumer survey, card payment make 43 per cent consumer payment 2013, 55 per cent 50 dollars. the ubiquity card payment one reason care lot system operate, i discus bite later. it also worth note period measure survey, bpay also gain increase share market, relative newcomer, paypal show strong growth low base. i speak little late type payment might start register radar come years. the cost payment of equal interest broad trend payment usage cost payments. the retail sector clearly strong interest cost payment merchants, reserve bank also interest this, principal focus evaluate efficiency payment system resource cost payment – is, much cost economy total produce payment – abstract various fee determine cost single party sector. determine resource cost large job, require detail information financial institutions’ cost thing like cost process time merchants. the reserve bank last go exercise 2014. the comfort news study resource cost consumer business payment decline percentage gdp since previous cost study 2006, 0.80 per cent 0.54 per cent, even though number transaction risen. despite favourable trend overall, mix payment within total act direction increase costs. look across main non-cash retail systems, see that, unsurprisingly, high per-transaction resource cost generate cheque system, cheque write cost economy $5.12, account overhead ignore (graph 4). this surprise give cost ship process physical cheques, although efficiency improvement cheque system since time study. perhaps current interest retail sector cost card systems. credit card quite costly around 94 cent average size transaction, mastercard visa debit le costly eftpos us few resource card systems, around 45 cent per transaction. the broad relativity resource cost system similar face merchants. another way think merchant who, large, bear cost payments. this largely achieve way fee use systems. i think tell illustration compare actual cost face merchant cost face consumer fee benefit consumers, like interest-free period reward points, take account. what see that, despite expensive produce costly merchants, average credit card transaction cost 2 at time, note absolute value number banknote circulation still increasing, even though relative use declining. bi central bankers’ speech 3 consumer slightly le debit card transaction (graph 5). these incentive shape payment choice consumers. payment business the arrangement incentive i show define feature card payment systems, one reserve bank devote great deal attention many years. the principal reason relative cost card consumer look different resource cost card payment interchange fee systems. an interchange fee fee pay merchant’s bank cardholder’s bank every time card payment made. while cardholder merchant little visibility fees, effect nonetheless substantial. they place floor fee merchant charge bank accept card help fund rewards, interest free period benefit encourage consumer use particular card. in large part, occur many merchant feel cannot refuse accept type card payments. this turn mean competition, financial institution card schemes, direct towards influence card consumer take wallet make payment. the effect interchange fee well understand australia many years, reserve bank first require interchange fee reduce 2003 follow early joint work australian competition consumer commission. a number regulator internationally subsequently follow reserve bank’s lead. the role interchange fee affect payment choice powerful that, even interchange fee cap apply australia, card scheme see benefit set high interchange rate category card – encourage growth segment – offset much low rate transaction “preferred” merchants. the unfortunate effect “preferred” merchant pay low fee transactions, merchant pay much high rate support generous reward program super-premium cards. such card might cost large merchant around 0.2 per cent transaction value, whereas small merchant “preferred” rate, might pay 2 per cent. the reserve bank estimate 2015, non-preferred merchant average face interchange fee half per cent high prefer merchants. this one several factor lead reserve bank conclude 2015 review card regulation warranted. the rba payment regulator before i get onto detail review, i would like revisit reserve bank come involve area regulation. legislative reform 1998 follow wallis committee’s final report enshrine long-understood central bank responsibility stability payment system reserve bank act. they also give bank first time explicit mandate promote competition efficiency payment system new power would allow pursue mandate. the wallis inquiry also provide guidance area new mandate could applied, include card interchange fees. these development set scene period fact finding, analysis eventually regulation cap interchange fee force removal “no-surcharge” rules. interchange fee mastercard visa card reduce 2003 around one per cent transaction value 0.5 per cent. fee mastercard visa debit card reduce 2006 12 cent per transaction. 4 bi central bankers’ speech while time prediction quarter regulate interchange fee would catastrophic card systems, seen, thrived. regulator number country follow australia’s lead area regulation indeed – notably european union – go further. nonetheless, think card regulation successful, know time element could improve upon – either payment system evolve since regulation come force, affect regulation adjust behaviour time. this lead u initiate review card regulation 2015, complete may year. some change regulation already occur result, remainder come force come year. there three key element reform package bank announce may. first, bank consider whether current regulate level interchange fee remain appropriate, particularly give that, i mentioned, example low interchange fee cap part world. the bank decide leave credit card interchange fee unchanged, reduce level debit card interchange fee – 12 cent 8 cents. this decision reflect fact average size mastercard visa debit card transaction fall 43 per cent since 2008, mean interchange fee rise percentage transaction value. i mention early specify interchange cap average result – typically small medium-sized merchant – bear much burden high-cost card “preferred” merchants. the bank decide limit effect place absolute limit level interchange fee card transaction addition cap average. a limit 0.8 per cent apply credit card 15 cent (or 0.2 per cent) debit cards. the current 2 per cent interchange fee apply super-premium card long possible july 2017. this benefit non-preferred merchants. some technical change cap apply reduce average interchange fee reduce upward drift average time. the second element may reform package place refer american express companion card regulatory foot mastercard visa cards. traditional american express card issue company itself, amex also arrange acceptance card merchant. however mid 2000s, bank begin issue american express card license. under arrangements, american express pay fee incentive card issuers, similar effect interchange fee – fund reward point influence payment choice consumers. but payment unregulated, reward tend significantly high offer mastercard visa cards. this raise question whether regulatory regime fully competitively neutral. from july 2017 bank cap interchange fee payment issuer equivalent fashion across american express companion, mastercard visa cards. traditional american express cards, equivalent interchange fees, subject fee regulation. finally, may package strengthen regulation card surcharging. give merchant ability signal consumer surcharge payment method costly accept others important element payment regulation australia. the overwhelm majority merchant take option surcharge do level recover under-recovers card acceptance costs. however community concern small number case card surcharge exceed card acceptance cost – least transactions. the lightning rod concern airline fix dollar surcharges, clearly over-recover card acceptance cost low value airfares. in addition, bank place regulatory framework could cap card surcharge merchants’ card acceptance costs, bi central bankers’ speech 5 concern cap could enforced, give limit reserve bank’s powers. the may package reform provide simple measure allowable surcharge, already force large merchant take effect merchant september next year. in order make simple possible understand payment costs, bank organisation provide card acceptance service require give merchant clear statement acceptance cost card scheme. a merchant able use set surcharge, could include limit cost support receipt statements. one implication revise framework merchant generally long able apply fix dollar surcharges. the key change previous framework government pass legislation ban excessive surcharging. this step give australian competition consumer commission power enforce ban. the ban excessive surcharge large merchant place weeks. the airline responded. qantas, instance, move $7 fix fee domestic flight credit card payment 1.3 per cent, cap $11 high cost fares. for debit card payment surcharge 0.6 per cent. that mean $200 fare would surcharge $2.60 credit card payment, compare $7 previously. we also know large event ticket agent remove card surcharges, seem appropriate industry alternative pay card case limited. this already ease broad community’s concern excessive surcharge extent. by time next year framework place merchant give consumer confidence surcharge pay reasonable, time provide merchant much clear understand payment costs. the future i begin talk decline last century’s payment systems. i would like turn briefly future, important development around corner. one trend seem likely near term migration contactless card transaction mobile phones. not everyone see appeal this, late generation mobile wallet secure convenient rely widespread contactless acceptance network australia. there little doubt prospect able leave home mobile phone appeal circles. mobile wallet bring new player new process payment flows, bank expect remain closely engage development period ahead. it would unfortunate perception bank’s contribution efficiency payment system regulation card systems. we fact high ambitions. in view significant contribution future payment system bank make recent time – certainly time assistant governor area – regulation, play role catalyst major industry project create new payment system – new payment platform, npp. the creation npp flow strategic review innovation payment system undertake bank 2010 2012. in finalise review, bank identify number important feature electronic payment system able provide australia challenge payment industry look solution. to industry’s great credit take challenge focus large industry effort fill gap delivery npp second half next year. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the npp allow individual business make account-to-account fund transfers, recipient access fund case matter seconds. that possible hour day night, seven day week, regardless financial institution sender receiver bank with. the sender need know bsb account number recipient; able use phone number, email address abn address payment. and importantly, possible send much large amount information payment 18 character permit current system. that potentially represent enormous benefit business user system particular. finally, eye rapid pace innovation, structure npp allow new type third party commercial service deliver system, initial service, offer bpay, running. conclusion this last opportunity speak official capacity payment system issues. i proud thing reserve bank able achieve area, world-leading regulation play catalyst role i speak of. efficiency payment system always high-profile topic, tremendously important one consider 28 million non-cash payment make every day australia. it certainly interest people room take deep interest payments, i would encourage continue so. i think retailer understand reform work reduce payment costs, i thank retail organisation participate policy consultation support direction reform. bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 bi central bankers’ speech 1 r gandhi: challenge develop bond market brics special address mr r gandhi, deputy governor reserve bank india, seminar “challenges develop bond market brics”, conduct jointly cii mof, government india, mumbai, 27 september 2016. * * * assistance provide s/shri t. rabishankar, cgm, manoj kumar, dgm, siddhartha mishra, dgm vivek singh, agm gratefully acknowledged. i. introduction i notice seminar develop bond market brics. though bond market include government security market corporate bond market, i would dwell upon corporate debt market. the reason simple. the government security market brics country attain definite positions, whereas corporate bond market nascent stage. 2.for example, india’s government security market – whatever criterion – developedas emerge market. it compare favourably many ae market well; despite thin investor base (on need work more), term instruments, transparency, trade settlement system liquidity, government security market grow big way. so, i clear mind stage development, focus corporate bond markets. 3.we well develop corporate bond market, fact widely recognized.not well recognize fact even develop economies, corporate bond market develop liquid government bond markets. it uncommon advance economy corporates’ primary source fund corporate bond market, credit market. many european country include germany, japan china achieve economic success base largely bank finance model. so talk develop corporate bond market must realistic goals. more importantly, must blinker squeeze bank finance force-feed corporate bond market. we would well act wisely keep effort perspective. 4.with caveat way, let u get back issue hand. what happen inthe global space? in era negative interest rate unconventional monetary policies, substantial amount global debt offer sub-zero yields, focus back emerge market (including brics) investor search yields. 5.emerging economy produce 39% global output, yet account 14% theglobal corporate bond market value. this suggest emerge economy may able good utilize corporate bond finance private sector and, consequently, growth. furthermore, landscape bank-intermediated finance transform regulatory reform technological advances, need opportunity domestic corporate bond market development apparent. 6.an imf study increase corporate leverage indicate period 2004–2014,non-financial corporate debt emerge market grow $4 tn $18 tn. over period share bond corporate debt grow 9% 17%. the shift bank finance bond finance slow steady. 7.is trend likely sustain? more generally, would rise corporate borrow survivea reversal decade-and-a-half long accommodative liquidity advance economies? of $3 tn corporate bond ems, $0.8 tn foreign currency borrowing. if take indicator international capital flow em bond last decade, indicative answer question em corporate bond market could still continue grow, 2 bi central bankers’ speech albeit slower. the outflow international capital em bond markets, aes tighten policy, would trend reversing. 8. now, important question. what ail corporate bond market? i try answer context india. broadly speaking, high government borrow crowd private debt, excessive regulatory restriction investment mandate financial institutions, corporate preference bank finance historically idiosyncratic reason (e.g. cash credit system), tepid investor interest whatever reason best rat instruments, absence well-functioning bankruptcy code, etc. key factors. however, issue deal breaker far market development concern tackle government regulators. 9. let touch upon current scenario bond market brics india particular, major challenge way forward. ii. overview bond market 10. in term govt debt gdp ratio, indicator maturity debt market, bar russia, brics nation relatively deep sovereign debt market. it range 66% brazil 18% russia. india govt. debt gdp ratio 66%. 11. china’s bond market see rapid growth recent time make third large bond market world u japan. china’s bond market size $ 6.2 trillion. india’s bond market estimate $ 1.1 trillion (dec 2015: source adb). unlike us, corporate debt market big govt debt market, india china big sovereign debt segment sovereign debt corporate debt ratio 2.7 2.1 respectively. bi central bankers’ speech 3 12. a snapshot india’s debt market give table below: fpi investment debt 13. india take calibrate approach let foreign portfolio flow debt market. over time, fpi debt portfolio get stable steady inflow long-term investors. obviously, would preferable point view financial stability fpi investor base consist largely category investor rather speculative capital arbitrage funds. we would need work towards outcome. iii. corporate bond market 14. indian corporate bond market see growth recent years, term number issue amount. the outstanding issue 12,155 end march 2011 increase 22,374 end march 2016. during period, amount outstanding increase ₹ 8,895 billion ₹ 20,193 billion. while type issue include fix rate 4 bi central bankers’ speech bonds, float rate bonds, structure note types, fix rate bond predominant number value. another characteristic issuance almost issuance financial sector entities. yet another peculiar feature corporate bond market private placement norm. the public issuance ₹ 94.51 billion 2010–11 increase ₹ 338 billion 2015–16. the private placement ₹ 2187.85 billion 2010–11, ₹ 4580.73 billion year 2015–16. the secondary market trade ₹ 6053 billion 2010–11, ₹ 10224 billion 2015–16. 15. i elaborate i consider major tendency market, give u idea reform effort need directed. 16. the primary issuance corporate bond dominate private placements. more 95% total issue privately placed. this not, per se, shortcoming long transparency regard issues. a long information issue life-cycle performance (particularly default history) publicly available, investor able take inform decisions. what require public database freely accessible. effort authority towards build trade repository primary secondary activities. 17. another significant character india’s corporate debt market dominance financial institutions. bulk issuance so-called bfsi sector (banking, financial service insurance). bank financial service account 74% primary issue fy 2015 (nse, ismr 2015). non-financial corporates account 19% outstanding issuance. clearly, access non-financial corporates limit need encouraged. it context rbi’s recent announcement push large borrower bond market assume significance. 18. but would enough. most corporate issuance india top credit quality, aa– good account 80% issuance bbb bad account 14% fy 2016 (crisil idm 2015). what show corporate bond market largely accessible top rat borrowers. effort respect focus facilitate access low credit (high yield sound better) borrower market. for happen, loosen investment guideline insurance pension fund would enough, require create investor category distribute risk widely. risk take culture assume importance achieve objective. 19. thin secondary market activity affect transparency market, also make process price discovery suspect. trade volume increasing, ₹ 5 bn (average daily) fy 2009 ₹ 45 bn fy 2015 (crisil idm 2015). but le tenth volume g-sec market. it unrealistic expect corporate bond trade much g-secs. yet must continue effort achieve reasonable degree transparency market. 20. several measure take goi, rbi sebi aid growth corporate debt market india. the impact development measure evident grow primary issuance also growth secondary market volumes. measure rationalise list norms, simplification issuance procedure processes, standardisation market conventions, set report platform, implementation dvp settlement corporate bond trades, allow bank hold corporate bond infrastructure sector balance sheet htm asset issue long term bond without requirement maintain reserve encourage impact market. 21. some major bottleneck thus list below: i. indian market traditionally bank dominate system corporates rely loan finance compare bond financing. wean corporates away bank prove difficult task. bi central bankers’ speech 5 ii. internationally insurance company among large participant corporate bond market. however, india, institutional investor like insurance companies, pfs, epfo large asset management still several constraint nature investment mandate result limit participation entities. pension fund insurance company prefer government security provide safe guarantee returns. iii. unavailability credit risk transfer mechanism corporate bond market also work deterrent. though cd introduce india, activity market. one major constraint restriction net mtm position counterparty capital adequacy exposure norms. iv. the absence robust bankruptcy law also reckon one major reason lack investor interest corporate bonds. v. lack centralise database enable investor get complete information corporate debt market one place. vi. lack functional trade platform ccp facility. 22. to address issues, recently khan committee make various recommendation examine implement regulator goi. some recommendation implement are: i. enhance credit supply large borrower market mechanism – exposure beyond threshold. ii. allow bank provide partial credit enhancement (pce) 50% bond issue size subject pce provide single bank exceed 20% bond issue size. iii. issuance rupee denominate bond overseas (masala bonds) bank at1 t2 capital. iv. permit broke repo corporate bonds. v. allow fpis trade directly corporate bonds. vi. initiate process accept corporate bond liquidity adjustment facility (laf) rbi. vii. set electronic book platform issuance privately place bond size ₹ 500 cr above. viii. set centralize database corporate bonds. iv. challenge way forward development bond market 23. i would able tell anything new way need proceed tell many learn committee study market depth, recently khan committee aegis fsdc. what i would try highlight i feel important action need take. a. tackle problem “original sin” hypothesis 24. one challenge improve depth debt market ability tackle “original sin” hypothesis – strong form allude inconsequential bond market eme due inability raise money currency outside border. india start “masala bonds” pick process still way go. 6 bi central bankers’ speech b. manage transfer risk – credit default swap 25. another important challenge emerge economy face development vibrant robust bond market issue manage risk. take example, chinese treasury yield generally low signify investor confidence. in corporate debt, default low far. however, borrower enter market, default rate go higher. while borrow cost highly rat company low, bond market risky borrower become expensive. from investor’s perspective, credit derivative market like cd available give confidence investor fund risky borrowers. experience cd india poor deal reported. it paramount importance active credit derivative market accurately price risk take bond market next stage. c. market infrastructure 26. one prerequisite prosper bond market economy efficient safe market infrastructure place make easy investor buy sell bonds. with dvp already place, concern safety large addressed. effort go ccp guarantee settlement need weigh advantage likely high cost guarantee. similarly, electronic platform trade need developed, one must keep mind large number bonds, compare g-secs, would hindrance order match systems. would quote-driven system preferable? d. issuer diversity 27. in india, currently 85% corporate bond issuance undertake high rat (a above) issuer. our attention credit enhancement mechanism would go way channel demand entity like insurance pension fund need protect credit exposure. but also require create condition attract new investor bi central bankers’ speech 7 market. retail investor could absorb credit risk wide dissipation. we might also look le risk averse external investors. e. municipal bond 28. unlike india, brics nation especially south africa well develop municipal bond market. 29. with stellar rise urban population, india’s infrastructure fail keep pace urbanization situation ripe municipal corporation look beyond conventional source fund (like grants, tax, etc). munis explore option infrastructure finance address various supply demand side constraints. 30. to end talk, i would like emphasize market evolve lot thing need fall place – investor interest, issuer preference, development economy, legal conditions, etc. what government regulator create enable conditions, issuer investor enthusiasm coincide discourage impede regulation poor infrastructure. 31. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 amando m tetangco, jr: macro-financial linkage – look back look ahead speech mr amando m tetangco, jr, governor bangko sentral ng pilipinas (bsp, central bank philippines), open ceremony 6th bsp international research conference, manila, 21 september 2016. * * * good morning welcome 6th international research conference bangko sentral ng pilipinas (bsp). the theme year’s conference “revisiting macro-financial linkages: look back look ahead,” highlight grow attention place importance interaction financial condition real economy. a look back: the traditional view transmission macro-financial linkage body economic work extensive turn century. to help illustrate, i ask staff advance search google scholar article macro-financial linkages. the result quite revealing. if take period 1980–1999, search yield 82 article subject. but search make period 2000–2016, number article increase dramatically 2,700. the review literature do formal research work confirm find well. research model macroeconomics financial sector traditionally proceed isolation one another. previously, model economic growth process largely drive “real” factor — productivity workforce, quality entrepreneurs, quantity quality capital stock, availability resources, state technical knowledge. and, financial market assume frictionless. but work asymmetric information principal-agent theory afford economist new way think role financial market play real economy. for instance, asymmetric information, bank would need “screen” borrower either carefully look firm’s value require collateral. now, value asset increases, value firm’s balance sheet, include collateral, also increases. at time, upward valuation asset raise bank’s capital, allow increase lending. in words, increase asset price lead increase loan raise economic activity. by contrast, fall asset price result slow economic activity. weak macroeconomic conditions, turn, reduce profit business income households, push borrowers’ default probability may weaken balance sheet bank financial institutions. this cycle reversal mechanism last long result may pervasive – affect investment decisions, investor confidence, consumption, savings, risk aversion, among others. in literature, vicious feedback loop refer financial accelerator . the feedback loop – real cost the concept feedback loop become even pronounce post-2008 global financial crisis (gfc), create need reassess review monetary transmission mechanism know then. the gfc teach policy maker academia, could long deal monetary impulse “assume away” financial market. a clear lesson gfc friction financial market friction increase cost economy significantly. 2 bi central bankers’ speech empirical estimate 2008 gfc (that 1980–2007) show output loss financial crisis could result loss 25 percent gdp. in cases, financial crisis could last effect low trend growth gdp. for us, estimate u federal reserve bank dallas show relative 2007 output, 40 90 percent output forego result financial crisis 2008. not crisis associate huge loss economic output financial wealth, also psychological consequence extend unemployment, homelessness, university drop-outs, defer deny retirements, among others. thus, real total cost crisis likely exceed value one year’s output. domestic turbulence spill but output loss go beyond boundary single economy. a witness last two decades, progress globalization financial market accompany frequent occurrence financial crisis. what might, past, consider domestic problem, could quickly “spillover” become global problem. moreover, consider spillovers, imf warn could also spillbacks. imf manage director lagarde refer spillover spillbacks “two-way street unintended knock-on effects.” let cite fairly recent development magnify spillovers, particularly emes. first, global presence asset managers. a 2014 study bi conclude asset manager emerge market economy tend behave correlate manner. in particular, bi study find global asset manager use common/similar portfolio benchmarks, strategies/recommendations institutional client tend also similar, ultimately fan “herding behavior” investor flows. investment flow asset manager asset price amplify other’s fluctuations, reinforce other’s directional movements. second, co-movements among non-financial corporates emerge market economies. chui, fender shusko (2014) find non-financial eme corporates borrow internationally domestically take advantage global low interest rate strong local currencies. while “cheap” fund could boost economic performance support viable investment projects, also increase borrower’s rollover interest currency risks, especially revenue local currency. furthermore, corporation may use borrow fund purely financial (i.e., speculative) purposes. third, asynchronous monetary policy advance economies, recently, uncertainty regard time pace monetary policy tighten u federal reserve. these development lead heighten interest rate volatility rise spreads, add pressure emerge market currencies. look forward: macrofinancial stability clearly, give interlinkages, policy maker long view macrostability “either” monetary/macroeconomics “or” financial sector. there increase discussion development macro-financial stability framework would embody policy – whether monetary, fiscal prudential – systematically incorporate financial stability consideration traditional macroeconomic analysis – effectively address financial boom bust so-called financial cycles. moreover, work borio zhu (2012) point “risk take channel” monetary policy transmission, monetary policy affect way economic agent perceive, tolerate ultimately price risk. in consider risk take channel policy transmission, quite evident policy maker need closely examine market behavior phase — uncharacteristic calm, market herding, reversal panic. when one stop think bi central bankers’ speech 3 it, phase really lead u great moderation great global financial crisis. policy macro-financial linkage this risk-taking behavior agent necessitate new set tools. to address financial stability concern arise financial cycles, policymakers advance develop economy increasingly use macroprudential policy forms. we see credit-related measure cap loan-to-value ratio debt-to-income ratio, cap foreign currency lending, ceiling credit credit growth; liquidity-related measure limit net open currency position currency maturity mismatch, reserve requirements; capital-related measure countercyclical capital requirement dynamic provisioning. while specific measure prove effective others, policy intend change constraint incentive face financial market participants. in asia, evidence credit-related sector-specific macroprudential policy instrument effective address imbalances, help contain severity economic downturn prevent occurrence major economic crisis. even fiscal policy significant impact financial stability. the structure tax subsidy influence private sector decision leverage. study show corporate income tax system generally encourage use debt rather equity finance. this interest payment allow deduction calculate taxable profits, return equity not. the favorable tax treatment corporate debt create debt bias, which, turn, lead highly leverage banks. likewise, underprice implicit government guarantee corporate debt liability often encourage debt equity financing. today’s conference - contribution discussion lady gentlemen, macro-financial linkage continue evolve. there many move part therefore many possible outcomes. the risk analysis evolve development well risk policy tool may responsive enough change present. in two-day conference, re-examine know macro-financial linkages, hope reduce know, possibly reduce risk unknown outcomes. we bring together expert wide range backgrounds, include policymakers, work international research institution academia, exchange idea issues. i thank author discussants, respective institution valuable contribution research conference. the bsp also grateful session chair accept invitation facilitate discussions. this morning’s session focus international aspect macro-financial linkage paper dwell financial globalization, monetary financial spillovers, financial contagion. the afternoon session focus macro-financial linkage within domestic economy paper touch liquidity, sovereign bond markets, credit conditions, interbank markets. in tomorrow’s morning session, discussion implication different policy financial business cycles, include possible use macroprudential, monetary, fiscal measure different stage cycle. we shall conclude conference panel discussion comprise distinguish economist organization cover globe. the experience expertise gentleman research policy make promise provide insightful discussion 4 bi central bankers’ speech macro-financial linkage transmission mechanism monetary policy. thank grace year’s bsp international research conference. final think lady gentlemen, apparent enter era intensify uncertain macro-financial linkages. the challenge era bring demand scrutiny linkages, may even require alter policy perspectives. i confident session conference provide good opportunity share idea take stock different dimension macro-financial linkages. i wish well conference. and i look forward productive interest exchange. thank much again, welcome good morning. bi central bankers’ speech 1 s s mundra: financial stability weak global environment address mr s s mundra, deputy governor reserve bank india, 7th seacen high level seminar deputy governor in–charge financial stability supervision, mumbai, 22 september 2016. * * * assistance provide ms. rekha salilkumar shri sanjeev prakash gratefully acknowledged. at outset, i extend warm welcome dr. han genberg, executive director, seacen centre participant 7th seacen high level seminar deputy governors, financial stability supervision [dg (fss)] delegate 7th annual seacen dg meet (fss). it is, indeed, matter great honour privilege reserve bank india host seminar annual meet. the theme seminar, “financial stability weaken global economic environment”, topical befitting, give volatile recovery world economy experiencing. even almost eight year since resort extraordinary monetary fiscal measure counter after-effects global financial crisis, authority still leave wonder relationship key parameter unemployment inflation, time-tested tool kit discernibly failed. the recent speech feed chair colleague testimony.1 against backdrop, important remain mindful uncertainties, stay vigilant prepare ex-ante institutional framework, policy measure decision one be, tide possible force destabilisation. global environment 1. to state world economy fragile state would understatement. whatever parameter one may look - growth, inflation, employment, trade, etc., point weakness one geography other. what, however, really confound growth inflation advance economy continue remain elusive despite sustain easy money policy relentless bond buy programme pursue monetary authorities. the underlie premise make abundant liquidity available low interest rate incentivise investment consequently, spur real economic activity trigger virtuous cycle growth, employment income generation subsequent reversal interest rate cycle, failed. however, would imprudent completely dismissive accommodative monetary policy stance monetary authority initially measure help calm financial market revive confidence. the flatten observe phillips curve make case relooking imply relationship full employment inflation. for instance, us, though unemployment rate declined, inflation continue target level 2%. 2. the vast hoard liquidity make available due continue accommodative policy stance drum yield negative terrain. market investor appear respond prospect continue low interest rate environment renew search yield move risky assets, support elevate valuations. that case, strong possibility reversal rate stance feed reserve 1 the federal reserve's monetary policy toolkit: past, present, future – speech dr. janet yellen, chair board governor federal reserve system symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, jackson hole, wyoming august 26, 2016. the "new normal" what it mean monetary policy – speech governor lael brainard, member board governor federal reserve system chicago council global affairs, chicago, illinois september 12, 2016. 2 bi central bankers’ speech would reverse flow away risky asset classes, trigger sell-offs cause market disruption much witness taper tantrum summer 2013. in globally integrate world, sell-offs would remain restrict advance economy alone, thus make reversal policy rate federal reserve one important risk event world look anxiously. 3. similarly, japan continue trap decade long vicious cycle “low-growth -low inflation -low inflation expectations”. grow sovereign corporate debt level well rise valuation commercial real estate many jurisdiction raise concern amid grow sign downturn credit cycle. the recent run several large uk commercial property fund illustrate risk associate deteriorate real estate value entity structural vulnerabilities. further, also concern around asset quality profitability large bank many advance economies, include euro area. the prospect increase non-performing corporate real estate loan potential erode valuation impede raise capital banks. the protract low interest rate environment would also deleterious consequence pension fund asset manager significantly erode capability defined-benefit fund meet future liabilities. though, world survive brexit risk event, manifest trade relations, investment business sentiment go forward would keenly observed. state emerge economy 4. emerge economy present heterogeneous ecosystem, though growth also relatively weak long term average. the interest rate high due persistently high inflation, time high yield help attract much need capital flow advance economies. high capital flow strengthen currency resultant weaken export trigger sort race competitive depreciation among economies. ‘beggar thy neighbour’ mantra seem following. one, however, need mindful risk quick reversal capital flow economy strong fundamental commitment structural reforms. china try retrace growth path, however, excessive corporate leverage, fuel excess capacity, cast doubt sustainability. the moderate economic growth rise corporate debt level begin put pressure banks’ asset quality may force chinese authority take appropriate measure repair fragile bank balance sheets. any adverse development chinese economy hold potential send shock wave across jurisdictions. 5. brazil russia also see downturn due sharp fall commodity prices, especially oil. the uncertainty regard oil price continue persist demand supply dynamic become mostly non-existent, lead supply glut plummet prices. impact financial stability 6. it uncertain backdrop discuss financial stability. the co-existence low interest rate still low economic activity advance economy make strong case revisit theory around transmission ability policy rate efficacy transmission channels. financial stability characterise condition, financial system function normally, allocate resource judiciously undertake intermediation financial sector real sector uninterruptedly. most importantly, financial stability portend situation system would resilient shocks, any, self –correcting mechanism. a central banker direct/indirect mandate preserve financial stability, efforts, therefore, must aim strengthen financial institution market ability transmit intermediate effectively robust capital position, improve profitability resilient system control. bi central bankers’ speech 3 7. the monetary ease pursue authority worldwide aftermath crisis ostensibly objective tackle freeze credit markets, drive growth tackle unemployment. nevertheless, near- zero/negative policy rate help achieve desire outcome steroid effect financial markets, reversal stance seem inevitable. under circumstances, time quantum reversal must non-disruptive possible. 8. the immediate reaction reversal rate cycle advance world would realignment capital flow strengthen dollar impact already delicate export global trade, give current political penchant towards protectionism. a yield harden, rise debt burden would fiscal implications. the resultant high cost credit high cost intermediation would adversely impact overall growth push economy back disinflationary mode. indian experience 9. a i say earlier, emerge market different dynamic play rather disperse across spectrum homogeneous group. therefore, bite difficult discus class. let me, however, use opportunity talk india- place current environment specific issues/challenges face with. 10. while generally share problem high corporate leverage emerge market well develop world, india present exceptions. these exception form moderately high growth, favourable demographic persistent inflation. the accommodative policy stance conventional unconventional monetary fiscal measure take immediate aftermath global financial crisis long unwound. we fight battle high inflation tight monetary policy regime time. you may aware move cpi-based inflation target regime sometime back monetary stance liquidity management calibrate accordingly. india also enjoy demographic dividend form young, grow population hence, domestic demand likely continue grow foreseeable future. in fact, need grow high pace consistently demographic advantage fritter away. india beneficiary capital flow see promise investment destination government reserve bank india commit continue press advantage usher necessary reform measures. 11. while economic fundamental country much sound foot three year ago, like rest world also wary impend market volatility could emerge crystallisation risk event i allude earlier. a significant area concern emes, especially u india, slowdown inward remittance non-residents. the depress oil price create stress oil-exporting country middle east significant population migrant indians. already feeble trend decline remittance establish oil price remain depress extend period time, immigrant population may lose jobs, face retrenchment consequent repatriation may lead social tension back home. 12. the key goal set restore order normalcy soon possible financial system could continue subserve need real economy on-going basis. the gdp growth 7.1% (q1 2016–17), current level oil price measure contain gold import help u move towards current account surplus , rupee reasonably stable macro le comforting. 13. in dynamic environment, relatively safe zone cannot reason enough complacency. a i mention earlier, hold potential achieve still high rate sustainable economic growth. we mindful need structural reform address issue relate capital formation, infrastructure creation, low capacity utilisation, 4 bi central bankers’ speech fiscal consolidation, subsidy management etc. a bank dominate financial system, important u bank ability undertake intermediation productive efficient manner. hence, efficient transmission cut policy rate end borrower also active agenda. but stress bank balance sheet hurdle provision bad debt take toll bottom line. this mainly account rbi drive balance

public sector banks, closely engage government. several measure take u deal asset quality issue bank system. a centralise repository large credit operationalised enable correct picture indebtedness large corporate houses. several tool like jlf/ sdr/ 5:25/ s4a2 etc. bring help bank revitalization stress asset books. a framework enhance credit supply large borrower market mechanism also unveil recently underlie aim limit concentration risk large borrower facilitate access borrower fund bond market. in order curtail exposure bank large corporates, single group exposure norm make strict make expensive beyond limit. these measure mean implicitly facilitate good credit flow micro, small medium enterprise (msmes) retail sector. 15. in sum, realisation bank sector need declogged multitude option must make available good efficient credit dispensation. measure also take enhance resolution mechanisms, strengthen exist payment settlement system leverage technology achieve great financial inclusiveness. a set differentiate bank already license good penetration financial service meet requirement specific sectors. the framework non-bank financial company strengthen work currently

another item rbi’s active agenda, potentially bring complementarity bank services. conclusion 16. before i conclude, let raise couple issue worthy debate course seminar. a. while assiduously pursue implementation regulatory reform set wake gfc, convince fully unintended consequence emerge market eg. availability cost credit small entities, contraction operation foreign bank implication specialise high end product like derivatives, withdrawal correspondent bank relationship etc.? b. how far impose risk weight sovereign exposure bank currently discuss standard set body actually justify jurisdiction large part bank sector publicly own require statute hold government security investment portfolio? it also important note sovereign debt jurisdiction issue home currency. c. since reversal policy stance u potential create global market disruptions, would appropriate take decision keep global context view rather domestic context. d. pace time reform measure apparently disproportionate stage development market emes. the stiff deadline set adoption reform measure pertain otc derivative resolution ccps case point. e. some jurisdiction overlay parallel policy prescription top multilaterally agree reform measure undermine effectiveness collaborative framework. the poser lead one ask broad question: “whether reform measure plug vulnerability create stable financial system create new vulnerability fragility system?” i think time answer question. 17. to conclude, howsoever confident might feel various endeavour make u build strong system processes, ultimate test would happen time turbulence. the base build put place well-thought institutional framework policy measure provide bulwark force disruption. more importantly, irrespective global environment, must keep revisit reorient framework mechanic periodic interval risk event manage minimal damage. i welcome india wish enjoyable stay mumbai fruitful deliberation seminar. thank you! bi central bankers’ speech 1 hiroshi nakaso: toward “comprehensive assessment” monetary ease speech mr hiroshi nakaso, deputy governor bank japan, meet host american chamber commerce japan (accj), tokyo, 8 september 2016. * * * accompany chart find end speech. introduction it great pleasure opportunity today speak business luncheon host american chamber commerce japan. all eye seem comprehensive assessment conduct bank japan’s september 2016 monetary policy meet (mpm). this is, course, main topic speech today. before address issue, however, i would like touch response take central bank unite kingdom’s vote leave european union (eu) –the so-called brexit – decision make bank’s mpm hold july 2016. for me, topic appetizer serve main dishes. i believe important policy own. response brexit on june 23, 2016, contrary general consensus, majority voter unite kingdom support leave eu, lead global financial market destabilizing, manifest development rapid depreciation pound sterling. a japan’s market first expose unfold result referendum, react violently. the yen’s exchange rate appreciate rapidly stock price fell sharply. the authority around world, include g7 countries, respond quickly effectively. the g7 central bank express intention ensure adequate liquidity support function markets. in japanese context, judge necessary ensure accessibility globally operate japanese firm financial institution fund liquidity foreign currencies, particular u.s. dollar fund liquidity, end, reinforce backstop facility instal global financial crisis. enhancement monetary ease july in light heighten uncertainty surround overseas economies, stem unite kingdom’s vote leave eu, bank decide july 2016 mpm enhance monetary easing. specifically, measure take bank threefold (chart 1). the first increase bank’s purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs). specifically, amount purchase almost double annual pace 3.3 trillion yen annual pace 6 trillion yen. this measure aim prevent deterioration business confidence consumer sentiment promote proactive risk-taking. i think amount significantly large give fact foreign investors’ cumulative net purchase stock amount 16 trillion yen first three year abenomics (chart 2). the second double size bank’s lend program u.s. dollar support economic growth (the special rule u.s. dollar lend arrangement enhance fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth conduct loan support program). under lend program, bank provide back-to-back finance u.s. dollar financial institution use u.s. dollar reserve fund case financial institution make foreign currency- 2 bi central bankers’ speech denominate investment loan firms, contribute strengthen foundation economic growth. the duration bank’s lend 4 year rollovers. the loan program enable firm receive stable fund u.s. dollar long term, program actively use fund firms, include local one regional banks. the size program double raise 24 billion u.s. dollars. the third expansion amount collateral pledge bank’s u.s. dollar funds-supplying operations. the bank conduct u.s. dollar funds-supplying operation regularly u.s. dollar fund raise network bilateral swap line among central banks. with operation, financial institution raise u.s. dollar fund full allotment basis. nevertheless, condition amount fund provide eligible collateral pledge institution principle, transaction bank back collateral. under current monetary policy, many financial institution sell japanese government security (jgss) bank hold substantial amount current account balance it. under circumstances, bank decide establish new security lend facility lend jgss counterparties operation current account balance bank. this enable financial institution raise u.s. dollar fund jgss borrow bank. the new facility design provide rainy day preclude concern lack collateral hold. in way, expect enhance effectiveness u.s. dollar funds-supplying operation backstop. these measures, despite technical nature, contribute meaningfully ensure access fund liquidity foreign currency thus economic stability. i want reiterate technocratic endeavor le important big policy move negative interest rate massive purchase japanese government bond (jgbs), tend attract attention. i. background comprehensive assessment i would like turn broad framework monetary policy. against backdrop heighten uncertainty outlook prices, view achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time, bank decide conduct next mpm, hold late september, comprehensive assessment development economic activity prices, well policy effects, past three year since introduction quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe). the background twofold. first, since introduction qqe, japan’s economic activity price improve substantially, japan’s economy long deflation. however, price stability target 2 percent achieve yet, despite unprecedented large-scale monetary easing. the bank analyze monetary policy function year factor possibly hamper achievement 2 percent target. second, “qqe negative interest rate,” introduce half year ago, various interest rates, include jgb yield well rate lend corporate bonds, decline substantially; thus, policy already exert remarkable effects. at time, however, impact financial markets’ liquidity financial institutions’ profits. the bank also ass effect impact policy. ii. mechanism qqe natural rate interest real interest rate regard first point, i would like start basic monetary policy transmission mechanism. in fact, main transmission mechanism monetary policy, conventional unconventional, same. that is, real interest rate effects; words, drive real interest rate high low “natural rate interest,” level real bi central bankers’ speech 3 interest rate neutral economic activity prices. the big difference rates, effective monetary ease tighten be. the potential growth rate expect growth rate consider proxy “natural rate interest.” a japan continue struggle trend decline potential growth rate since bubble burst, bank low policy rate ensure monetary ease effect (chart 3). in 1999, introduce zero interest rate policy. start 2001, bank conduct unconventional monetary policy measure quantitative ease comprehensive monetary easing. nevertheless, monetary ease provide policy prove insufficient overcome deflation. mechanism qqe base experience, 2013, bank set price stability target 2 percent, view achieve target early possible time, launch qqe. the transmission mechanism qqe also expect operate real interest rate effects. qqe aim raise inflation expectation bank’s strong clear commitment achieve price stability target 2 percent large-scale monetary ease underpin commitment. at time, bank exert downward pressure nominal interest rate across entire yield curve purchase jgbs. the compound effect channel compress real interest rates. this decline real interest rate boost firms’ households’ economic activity, turn lead high inflation rates, support high inflation expectation. it assume that, people actually experience inflation, inflation expectation correspondingly would rise (chart 4). this last point call “adaptive formation mechanism” inflation expectations, key concept i talk later. the innovative quality might stand comparison measure previously take bank japan central bank qqe focus inflation expectations. specifically, base fisher equation, state nominal interest rate equal sum inflation expectation real interest rate, qqe aim low real interest rate raise inflation expectation compress nominal interest rates. economic activity price qqe this mechanism work produce intend effects. qqe bring decline real interest rate raise inflation expectation low nominal interest rate. a i mention earlier, “natural rate interest” trend decline. despite that, level real interest rate push significantly low “natural rate interest” financial condition improved. specifically, moderate increase lend couple decline interest rates, rise stock prices, depreciation yen observed, boost economic activity. a result, regard economic activity, corporate profit mark record high level unemployment rate, release last week, decline remarkably low level 3.0 percent. a wages, annual labor-management wage negotiation 2014 result base pay rise first time two decades; base pay rise continue three consecutive year since then. look economy whole, output gap improve close long-term average 0 percent. on inflation front, basis exclude fresh food energy, year-on-year rate change cpi, around minus 0.5 percent introduction qqe, turn positive, thereafter remain positive territory two year ten month (chart 5). this first time since late 1990s, japan’s economy fell deflation, cpi inflation rate remain positive territory protract period. i think japan’s economy long deflation, commonly define situation price decline sustain basis. 4 bi central bankers’ speech reason miss 2 percent price stability target however, true price stability target 2 percent achieved. this also development inflation expectations, key factor real interest rate effect operate. look back, mechanism work expect good expect first year introduction qqe. thereafter, however, exogenous factor emerge decline crude oil price weakness demand follow consumption tax hike begin fiscal 2014. this compound slowdown emerge economy summer 2015 accompany volatile development global financial markets. a result, observe inflation rate declined, inflation expectations, form adaptive manner, stalled. this seem main factor hamper achieve price stability target 2 percent (chart 6). it widely accept people’s inflation expectation form two factors: “forward-looking formation mechanism” “adaptive formation mechanism.” in japan, effect “adaptive formation mechanism” seem dominated. this seem partly price stability target miss prolong deflation. in addition, wage negotiation japan, so-called spring offensive shunto japanese, wage decide basis actual price development previous fiscal year. this may one factor behind “adaptive formation mechanism.” the bank, continue qqe, try enhance “forward-looking formation mechanism” thereby raise people’s inflation expectation anchor price stability target 2 percent. a result, perhaps manage deanchor deflationary expectation price would never rise. but inflation expectation still transition reanchored 2 percent. look ahead, observe inflation rate expect revert gradual rise trend, inflation expectation push “adaptive formation mechanism.” however, give observe inflation rate likely hover slightly negative 0 percent time being, uncertainty persist point. for reason, i think important bank firmly maintain commitment achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time viewpoint enhance “forward-looking formation mechanism.” the comprehensive assessment conduct aim achieve 2 percent target early possible time. to avoid possible misunderstanding, explicitly refer statement release mpm july 2016. at forthcoming mpm, discus need do achieve 2 percent target early possible time. mean toward reduce level monetary policy accommodation agenda. iii. effect impact “qqe negative interest rate” issue comprehensive assessment let move topic negative interest rate policy. in term transmission mechanism policy effects, “qqe negative interest rate” extension aforementioned policies. namely, bank consider real interest rate effect basic mechanism. against backdrop weak inflation expectation start descend further, bank decide keep real interest rate low reduce nominal interest rate beyond zero bound. by apply negative interest rate portion financial institutions’ current account balance bank, combination jgb purchases, bank intend compress interest rate jgbs across entire yield curve. this expect affect various interest rates, include lending, corporate bonds, cp, spread effect decline real interest rate economic activity prices. on hand, inception negative interest rate policy, single important issue policy avoid excessively negative impact financial institutions’ profits, thus impair financial intermediation. bi central bankers’ speech 5 base experience past six months, bank also ass effect impact policy. this second pillar comprehensive assessment. what learn last six month in opinion, six point learn last six month since introduction “qqe negative interest rate.” let elaborate. first, combination negative interest rate policy jgb purchase prove extremely powerful exert downward pressure across entire yield curve. this seem operate mechanism (a) negative interest rate apply financial institutions’ current account balance bank result decline short-term interest rates, (b) financial institution discourage hold current account balance jgb sales, this, together decline risk premium cause jgb purchases, low long-term interest rates. moreover, so-called search positive yield investor boost demand asset positive yields, substantially low yield super-long-term jgbs. such mechanism exert downward pressure flatten yield curve, particularly toward long end. this first point prove effectiveness “qqe negative interest rate” monetary policy tool (chart 7). second, concern low risk-free rates, jgb yields, might lead decline banks’ lend rate interest rate corporate bond cp, room limit decline rate deposits, main source fund financial institutions. i also consider concern deserve attention, banks’ lend rates, well interest rate corporate bond cp, fall significantly thus far, mark historical low (chart 8). third, new development relate corporate finance emerge recently; example, issuance corporate bond maturity ten year firms’ borrow subordinate loan increased. super-long-term fund observe mainly infrastructure firm relate electricity transportation, increasingly share wide range industry (chart 9). fourth, accord result survey short-term economic survey enterprise japan (tankan) senior loan officer opinion survey bank lend practice large japanese bank (often dub loan survey), financial institutions’ lend attitude remain proactive. thus far, see little evidence profit squeeze cause negative interest rate adversely affect intermediary function (chart 10). fifth, however, flipside positive development grow pressure financial institutions’ profits. this see large fall lend rate relative marginal decline rate deposits. for japan, impact negative interest rate policy profit financial institution tend relatively large. this due factor amount outstanding deposit far exceed lending, interest margin already extremely small follow prolong competition among financial institutions. give profitability affect soundness financial institution cumulative manner, fully aware fact impact vary depend duration policy. the view bank might disregard intermediary function perform financial sector totally unfounded. in fact, ever since homegrown financial crisis 1990s, commit maintain financial system stability, mandate give u bank japan act. besides, bank system key transmission channel monetary policy. sixth, long-term super-long-term rate decline significantly, rate return investment insurance pension product declined, sale saving-type product suspended, net present value retirement benefit obligation increased. although direct impact development entire economy may substantial, take account possibility development affect 6 bi central bankers’ speech people’s confidence cause concern sustainability financial function broad sense, thereby negatively affect economic activity. think monetary policy management “qqe negative interest rate” must pursue appropriate macroeconomic policy, strike right balance powerful policy effect describe first four point i mention possible adverse effect financial intermediation i list fifth sixth points. there usually trade-off two aspects, way balance must dynamic. for example, static uniform judgment rule cut negative interest rate view financial institutions’ profit would right approach. depend situation economic activity, prices, financial conditions, measure may still deem necessary weigh policy effect cost financial intermediation. through numerous discussion i leader financial institutions, i think i fully recognize effect large-scale monetary policy financial institution financial markets, likely impact policy continue. base recognition, take measure judge necessary japan’s economy. it standpoint i participate discussion comprehensive assessment next mpm. base candid assessment, decide whether necessary make adjustment current policy framework, judge necessary, way adjusted. close remark lastly, let talk relationship bank’s monetary policy government’s fiscal management growth strategy. the first relationship government’s fiscal management. usually, government increase fiscal expenditure issue government bonds, interest rate government bond rise, discourage private-sector investment. this effect call “crowding out.” in regard, “policy mix” central bank pursue monetary ease time, rise interest rate contained, thereby prevent “crowding out” effects. in current japanese context, exactly take place. market interest rate japan negative territory across wide range maturity due effect bank’s “qqe negative interest rate.” in situation, economic stimulus government’s fiscal expenditure, couple monetary expansion, bind prove powerful due synergy effects. this type powerful “policy mix” place japan last three year likely reinforce new large-scale fiscal “stimulus package” combination “qqe negative interest rate.” the second relationship growth strategy. a i say earlier, important bank low real interest rate time government raise natural rate interest promote growth strategy. in regard, emphasis “at time.” structural reform raise potential growth reduce uncertainty future, firm household spend today anticipation high profit income future, thus raise current demand. on hand, demand stimulus monetary ease raise potential output increase capital stock well labor input. thus, i believe monetary policy overcome deflation supply-side reform raise growth potential must pursue tandem, “at time,” bring japan’s economy back track toward sustain growth. the bank continue monetary ease successfully reshape japan’s economy may describe long deflation, move terminate deflation, achieve 2 percent target. meanwhile, i think worth note government’s recent economic measure focus “investment future.” bi central bankers’ speech 7 it thirty-eight year since i join bank japan. during period, economic financial environment surround japan change dramatically policy agenda central bank shift accordingly. a freshman, i could hardly imagine central bank traditionally renowned inflation fighter go engage difficult struggle overcome deflation. such change never lose steam. more recently, collapse lehman brothers, active discussion take place around world policy response slow growth trend framework monetary policy situation, ignite larry summers’ secular stagnation hypothesis. i already express opinion new york early year, i repeat today. however, i impression topic formerly confine academic circle today openly discuss practical policy challenge need address medium- long-term perspective. i really feel attend international meet conferences. the answer vary country country, straightforward provide textbooks. for policy maker around world, i sense become common challenge underlie contemporary policy discussion practices. i remind that, order policy maker central bank government appropriately keep abreast speed dynamism environment changes, adhere simply past common sense. recently, i often think central banker must courage evolve time adapt environment cherish central bank’s dna; is, “the policy action base theory research.” this last point somewhat superfluous clearly outside scope upcoming comprehensive assessment, i would like finish speech remind thought. thank attention. 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: reform financial sector benchmark welcome remark mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, annual meet money market contact group, frankfurt main, 27 september 2016. * * * lady gentlemen, i please much appreciate opportunity discus issue importance money market. there topic last year draw attention regulators, legislators, market participant also general public, namely financial benchmarks. i hardly need convince relevance benchmark euribor, libor eonia. indeed, i need quote european commission, recently declare euribor “critical” benchmark light vast number contract use reference – €180 trillion derivative contract €1 trillion retail mortgages. indeed, benchmark year become essential part infrastructure economy. they index use determine level payment financial contract, whereby neither party contract control setting. their value credibility derive fact consider impartial, representative, therefore fair. if impartiality benchmark compromised, confidence contractual relationship base benchmark be, result, seriously undermined. therefore, follow scandal involve big benchmarks, regulator legislators, coordination private sector, identify market shortcoming design framework would guarantee integrity reference rates. and lot achieve far: 1. the private sector play important role improve benchmark-setting process design new code conduct, enhance transparency visibility, launch private initiative reflect market needs, identify alternative benchmarks. 2. the public sector contribute process well. since 2013 fsb international organization security commission work reform benchmarks, support steer effort private market participant define robust reliable benchmark relate “best practices”. in addition, public sector adopt dedicate regulation. a benchmark important part global financial system essential tool transmission mechanism monetary policy, matter ecb well. we commit improve relevant benchmark euro, central bank respect currencies. while ecb always stress financial benchmark private initiative tailor private needs, also help private sector shape benchmark reform initiatives. for example, follow closely reform euribor quote-based transaction-based index. moreover, together euribor administrator, launch data collection back 2013 analyse feasibility transaction-based alternatives. and indeed group, money market contact group ask participate least 100%. and delivered. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the euribor reform reach important stage. the transition transaction-based methodology foresee 2017 administrator plan pre-live verification exercise ascertain feasibility propose methodology current market conditions. for pre-live verification – eventually euribor reform – success, broad market representation achieved. therefore, current panel member participate also bank euro money market. a lack participant might seriously threaten completion pre-live verification ultimately reference rate itself. therefore, view tremendous importance benchmark euribor, ecb would like see bank take responsibility benchmark two ways. firstly, participate pre-live verification secondly, eventually join panel contributor euribor launch new calculation methodology. bank among big user euribor. a such, would also incur big cost loss come abrupt end. it therefore bank industry whole support benchmark. but burden cannot shoulder current panel banks, indeed show sense responsibility. despite relate cost perceive risks, remain panel help prevent disorderly dismantle euribor. but examples. in cases, bank among large institution jurisdiction, therefore rely hugely benchmark price products, choose leave panel. this worrisome development. some member leave perceive elevate risk relate usage expert judgement contribute euribor. since departure, however, couple important changes. firstly, new regulation adopt europe, establish rule guide process set benchmark therefore contribute great regulatory certainty. secondly, envisage reform euribor, aim anchor benchmark transactions, eventually remove expert judgement therefore subjective element contribute euribor. some bank also saw impediment participation envisage transaction- base index cost incur transaction reporting. but incremental cost join euribor pre-live verification contribute benchmark transaction data may actually limit banks, already report ecb money market statistical report regulation. this bank already set system order extract report transaction data. in conclusion, i hope bank indeed take opportunity create better, robust representative benchmarks, good suit need end users. and i also hope bank continue participate panel – decide join re-join – ensure euribor well reference rate continue play critical role european economy. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 peter praet: interview l’opinion interview mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, l’opinion, conduct mr luc de barochez 15 september 2016, publish 20 september 2016. * * * growth flat, unemployment high, deficit large, reform stalled... to extent france concern european central bank? unlike many eu countries, france come financial crisis relatively unscathed. it also experience sovereign debt crisis. yet, despite condition bad, french economy remain surprisingly subdue gloomy mood persists. successive government show will introduce structural reforms. and reform indeed implemented. but see significant difficulty push through. the big concern job market, particular youth unemployment. the government clearly realise hard business france countries, germany belgium. this due labour relations, among things. which reform labour law, facilitate company-wide agreements, step right direction. what important solution country like france? policy increase competitiveness prioritise reduction government deficit? both important. our message debt must remain sustainable. but isn’t question absolute value debt. the quality public finance key. take healthcare spending. a country spend le area sometimes offer higher-quality care country spend far more. on hand, debt sustainability improve certain reform, perhaps small measure budget flexibility might give facilitate implementation reform. this sort flexibility accept european commission. but often budget flexibility grant there’s problem follow reform! the president commission, jean-claude juncker, want double size investment plan, €630 billion. be crucial growth? it’s good policy direction, it’s still difficult ass concrete effect investment plan be. for now, investment dynamic euro area whole, member country, remain weak. speak germany, wolfgang schäuble reject ecb president mario draghi’s call country put surplus service recovery. do feel like you’re preach wilderness? germany respect criterion stability growth pact - thank budgetary surplus despite high level immigration, optimistic bring debt 60% gdp, limit set maastricht treaty, sooner expected. however, country’s enormous current account surplus anomaly almost 9% gdp. growth drive external demand. germany fiscal space develop internal demand. berlin accuse ecb responsible imbalance, monetary policy weaken euro boost exports. our monetary policy extremely accommodative since spring 2014, response inflation figure outlook weak long. it’s single monetary policy euro area whole. it isn’t necessarily optimal country times. every country should, therefore, develop way correct tension imbalances. in case germany, country decide want develop internal market, whether raise wages, increase investment reduce taxes. for example, germany 2 bi central bankers’ speech need structural reform certain sectors, like services. the good environment provide unique opportunity won’t necessarily last, germany face substantial industrial challenge year come, example car industry. the ecb go €1 trillion threshold security purchase quantitative ease programme, impact inflation growth seem negligible. we can’t say would inflation without policy? let’s underestimate critical situation find in. our monetary policy essential avoid severe recession. at start crisis 2007-2008, huge gap open long-term expectations, base assumption high growth rates, harsh reality. exaggerate expectation lead excessive indebtedness. we experience correction overborrowing. thank standard non-standard monetary policy measures, public debt purchases, situation start return normal. this ultra-accommodative policy end principle march 2017. will stop deadline? our monetary policy objective return inflation level below, close to, 2% medium term. we maintain substantial amount monetary support necessary fulfil mandate. our monthly asset purchase tune €80 billion continue end march 2017 beyond, necessary, case see sustainable adjustment inflation line objective. when consider potential risk growth, include possible election donald trump unite state protectionist programme? it’s important distinguish election speech actual policies. speech today tend increasingly national protectionist, unite states. currently, people see negative side globalisation positive. this erosion trust importance international trade worry may hind spread idea know-how essential growth. for years, consequence globalisation segment population underestimate – support policy necessary. another potential risk growth – matteo renzi lose referendum autumn italy, fear new euro area crisis? in italy, like france countries, problem convince population reform vital prosperity, implement reforms. the italian government undertake major reforms. pension reform, example, greatly improve sustainability pensions. european bank complain negative deposit rates. can reassure won’t go negative territory? we aware interest rate configuration may difficult banks. but part environment adjust. we also remember large part problem arise unrestrained financial system indulge excess. the favourable finance conditions, support accommodative monetary policy, greatly facilitate balance sheet adjustment various sector economy, include financial sector. banker must carefully consider business models. some bank adopt good attitude – realise difficult environment manage it. how long situation last? some market participant fear rate configuration could remain unchanged long time, e.g. ten years. personally, i think shouldn’t overly pessimistic. bi central bankers’ speech 3 don’t believe secular stagnation? no. we face serious adjustment difficulties, stem slowdown productivity, slowdown manage structural reforms. secular stagnation inevitable. bi central bankers’ speech 1

dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank chairman board director bank international settlements, institut ökonomie d zukunft, karlsruhe, 15 september 2016. * * * 1. introduction professor weibel professor sloterdijk professor puppe lady gentleman linguist tell u name “europe” come ancient greek word “erebos” mean “dark”. europe therefore denote occident ‒ place sun sets. and sun indeed seem shin brightly europe present. accord investor george soros, european union find “existential crisis” follow uk vote leave eu. the political scientist herfried münkler, too, declare wake debate refugee crisis “this time deal crisis understand aristotle medical profession: patient either recover – die.” up now, say münkler, hold eu grow every crisis thank crisis progress make all. a münkler see it, jean monnet’s claim “europe forge crises,” long valid. in view, two thing say that: talk end eu somehow remind mark twain, respond newspaper report pass away word “the report death exaggeration.” nevertheless, mode operation european integration indeed seem come close scrutiny. jean monnet, one found father european union, describe mode operation chain reaction. a envisage it, integration one area economy, specifically coal steel industry, would entail ever strong economic and, subsequently, also political integration. the launch euro base quite similar ideas. on occasion adoption maastricht treaty, example, helmut kohl state “it cannot say often enough: political union indispensable counterpart economic monetary union.” for him, too, euro catalyst ongoing process european unification. the merge european currency ultimately design unify country europe politically. the theory european integration self-reinforcing process integration individual sub-sectors necessitate integration area become know “locomotive theory”. but theory call question even time. the bundesbank – example – proponent know “coronation theory”. the idea monetary union stand end european integration process because, economy integrate converge sufficiently, single monetary policy would suitable country monetary union would prone crisis. the fact fear entirely unrealistic show euro-area crisis. 2 bi central bankers’ speech proponent locomotive theory see crisis le threat opportunity. that because, accord locomotive theory, crises, first foremost, open possibility implement step integration yet taken. accordingly, even lack proposal appropriate response ‒ brexit vote also euro-area financial sovereign crisis ‒ even integration. give design monetary union present state evidently fragile, view inconsiderably diverge idea fundamental policy stance – think almost irreconcilable position communitising liability – knee-jerk call integration make many people anxious. survey show many citizen eu doubt whether exist process integration still sustainable. in follow remarks, i intend address undoubtedly important question policymakers might reignite enthusiasm europe project create sense common identity interest measures. instead, i shall concentrate focus central banker, le important general public. essentially, i discus do make monetary union, particular, work good everyone well role single monetary policy context. 2. europe promise prosperity, convergence integration look country europe, jean monnet conclude long ago 1954 country europe “become small today’s world.” give possibility modern technology, felt primarily economy. but also believe true foreign policy. in respect, think mainly major role play unite state america soviet union, well grow importance china india. in sense, eu indeed see political response increase globalisation ‒ attempt establish strong regional pole increasingly multipolar world. in economic terms, member eu were, among things, “to achieve strengthen convergence economies” “advances economic integration”.1 the eu thereby give threefold promise citizens: increase prosperity, achieve convergence standard living, deepen integration. and, actual fact, numerous study come conclusion single european market lead prosperity europe.2, 3, 4 look big picture, real economic output eu country go one-third since 1995 despite financial sovereign debt crisis. the fact increase usa, canada japan strong average eu country look per caput growth work population show, however, factor also play part economic growth eu. in large single market, differ preference skill mean opportunity specialisation – firm thus, ultimately, also employees. in large market, 1 lisbon treaty, preamble. 2 h badinger (2005), growth effect economic integration: evidence eu member states, review world economics 141, 50–78. 3 n f campos, f coricelli l moretti (2014), economic growth political integration: estimate benefit membership european union use synthetic counterfactuals method, iza discussion paper no 8162. 4 a boltho b eichengreen (2008), the economic impact european integration, cepr discussion paper no 6820. bi central bankers’ speech 3 easy one best. at time, range good offer become diverse. all potentially benefit all. admittedly, mean everyone benefit equally strong economic integration europe worldwide. technological advances, especially information technology, enable highly-skilled make even effective use capability demand high wage accordingly. and globalisation economy make competition intense precisely medium low-skilled. that dampen wage growth segment labour market. take long view, wage differentiation – words, ratio high low gross wage – therefore increased; however, trend come standstill past years. this flipside globalisation undoubtedly also play part brexit vote uk. the eu become target voter vent frustration downside globalisation migration. and many see monetary union drain country’s economy rather guarantor growth. after all, country euro area long use exchange rate cushion economic shocks. give disappointment europe institutions, often overlook that, exist institutional structure eu, responsibility release force growth mean economic reform still lie primarily individual member states. in so, pursue different approach past years, also reflect vary rate economic growth. along sustainable economic policy national level, however, also vital strengthen force growth community level. i think here, example, completion single market service single market digital services. study suggest digital market alone could raise economic output eu 4%.5 not would mean prosperity, would also create additional job ‒ 400,000 germany alone. and job best antidote economic anxiety integration. 3. the liability principle: cornerstone market economy lady gentleman one area domestic market, however, reveal serious weakness recently: i mean financial service market, bank market particular. this rule existed, either europe economic region usa, guarantee shareholder creditor large, interconnect bank would hook potential losses. these institution could count bail taxpayer, since failure bank would inevitably entail severe economic disruptions. the bank bailout cost billions, also fuel perception market economy change character, benefit expense many: “privatising gain socialise losses.” however, liability principle absolutely central market economy, prominent ordoliberal walter eucken already knew: describe “market economy constitution” aptly, saying: “those benefit must also carry loss.” 5 copenhagen economics (2010), the economic impact european digital single market, final report. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in order market economy function, also preserve trust rule game therefore eu whole, essential shareholder creditor actually bear future loss bank investments, rather taxpayer. this precisely aim stringent capital rule introduce summarise basel iii framework, particularly european bank union single supervisory mechanism rule bail shareholder creditor event bank failures. however, attain goal joint rule recovery liquidation bank consistently applied. only banks’ shareholder creditor adjust future behaviour appropriately avoid excessive risk-taking. strict application principle ownership absolutely essential, reason fairness, also concrete economic reasons. if economic player bear consequence actions, flaw incentive set. they take excessive risks, precisely lead last financial crisis – similar crisis past. 4. enhance monetary union action liability go hand hand – important future financial sector, also pivotal enhance entire monetary union. the construction european monetary union unique world. a single monetary policy set 19 largely autonomous economic fiscal policies. this construction make monetary union potentially vulnerable, since crisis show that, ultimately, community may foot bill unhealthy development individual member state order prevent stability entire structure threatened. the prospect able spread consequence unsustainable policy entire monetary union weaken incentive towards sound budgetary policy. this institutional precaution take launch euro: stability growth pact, “no bail-out clause” ban monetary finance governments. unfortunately, however, safety precaution unable prevent crisis. why not, point, choose path take currency areas, usa canada, transfer economic fiscal policy european level? ultimately, berlin, paris, rome others opt go alone economic fiscal policy rather take decision together brussels; unwilling consent extensive transfer sovereignty rights. a common policy is, all, different common market. in common market, participant produce whatever best. the interplay supply demand equilibrium provide price mechanism ensure every product find buyer. a common policy price mechanism bring different interest balance. instead invisible hand market, far complex, political negotiation coordination process require provide balance. the economist enrico spolaore,6 instance, point out. 6 e spolaore (2013), what be european integration really about? a political guide economists, journal economic perspectives, american economic association, 27(3), 125–144, summer. bi central bankers’ speech 5 a result, therefore, monetary policy communitised – full knowledge certain economic adjustment problem might arise despite exist safety precaution coordination mechanisms. the monetary union likely put people mind quip, attribute woody allen, “marriage attempt solve problem together didn’t even own.” but like marriage, monetary union also potentially wonderful thing: physical manifestation single currency visible symbol process european unification. this unification process has, without doubt, contribute europe’s become continent peace human rights, eu even nobel peace prize 2012. go even further, however, monetary union concrete economic advantage union stability. eu citizen long change money travel, entrepreneur long fear exchange rate fluctuations, everyone compare price better. this increase competition, conducive growth. that worth solve exist problems. there basically two option open us. we could take path monetary union communitise economic fiscal policy well monetary policy. proponent locomotive theory look option, argue incomplete integration make necessary take step towards integration. however, come roadblock face architect monetary union founded: member state still disincline abdicate right sovereignty european level. this evident ongoing discussion enhance monetary union: example, informal meet eu finance minister central bank governor take place bratislava last weekend, where, among things, proposal go direction fiscal union discussed, aim provide fiscal instrument cushion large macroeconomic shocks. the idea discuss therefore include joint unemployment insurance european investment fund. on hand, suggestion contain little way specific measure would enable genuine joint control. on paper, strengthen fiscal rule mentioned. however, past month year show much worth. fiscal surveillance already “strengthened” before, return establishment bailout fund 2011. however, rule still interpret flexibly. the bind force budgetary rule weak ever before, also see decision make concern france, spain portugal. in case, nobody suggest genuine transfer sovereignty, example independent fiscal authority could reject national budget meet stability requirements. if political integration possible, remain option decentralise approach already provide monetary union’s exist maastricht framework. but ensure unhealthy development one part monetary union jeopardise stability whole? in nutshell, must possible future heavily indebted state default final resort without bring financial system knee force international community come rescue. this option hopefully mean capital market exercise disciplinary function fiscal policy good future, possible, government default never occurs. 6 bi central bankers’ speech in july edition monthly report, bundesbank describe need do ensure sovereign debt restructure jeopardise stability. it crucial, first all, bank hold sufficient capital able absorb loss government bonds. regulation currently require them. not that: bank allow purchase unlimited quantity government bond – something cannot investments. that, too, change. but action need that. at moment, purpose european stability mechanism (esm) bridge fund difficulty government may experience. this mean that, programme, esm step fund budget deficit also provide money enable country redeem mature bond proper manner. this would prevent situation european taxpayer pay creditors. for ultimately behind esm. but if, follow esm assistance programme, debt still high, haircut would become necessary would make expense original creditor european taxpayers. this exactly foster willingness part member state agree restructure debt. instead truly viable solution reached, push come shove, strategy muddle would win day. that bundesbank propose add clause government bond euro-area country whereby maturity bond automatically extend three year member state apply esm assistance. this would keep creditor hook. then, haircut really become necessary, esm act mediator government creditors. a procedure kind would make possible, last resort, restructure debt orderly manner without put financial stability risk. this mean would benefit ail member country euro area whole. but need clear one thing. it take possibility restructure government debt curb government debt effectively without jeopardise financial stability. it also necessary tighten fiscal policy rules. this calls, first, transparent fiscal rule and, second, rigorous enforcement. i convince independent fiscal authority would good equip european commission today effectively enforce limit ever-increasing government debt euro area. this because, one hand, commission must act guardian treaty ensure rule implemented. on hand, also political institution whose task strike balance widely vary interests. measure rein government debt effectively urgently needed. although indebted countries’ debt ratio decrease slightly next years, gradual improvement economic situation favourable fund condition mask loosen fiscal stance euro-area countries. in term guideline medium-term budgetary planning, three-quarters euro-area country still far remove sound fiscal position 2016. that fiscal consolidation look like. 5. monetary policy lady gentleman i would like close turn question monetary policy. bi central bankers’ speech 7 monetary stability good everyone – let count ways. first, price stability mean able pay one’s way tomorrow today’s income. second, also make retirement save easy plan. third, important economic perspective business reliably calculate investment cost return deliver. the money fluctuate value, uncertain investment income become low growth long run. all reason convince euro-area member state opt independent central bank system commit solely price stability model bundesbank. and inflation average 2% since system created, roughly successful maintain price stability bundesbank. but inflation outlook euro area mute quite time now. inflation discernibly ecb govern council’s inflation rate target close 2% since mid-2013. in fact, hover around zero mark good part two years. euro-area price august around 0.2% previous year’s level. price inflation germany, incidentally, stand 0.4%. in particular, sharp drop oil price push inflation last two years. this effect inflation gradually peter year-on-year decrease oil price come halt. this already become clear end year. however, low inflation rate euro area drive purely oil price developments. core inflation, say price index exclude energy food prices, likewise relatively low, hover around 1%. the late ecb staff projection indicate economic recovery euro area continue – despite unite kingdom’s decision leave eu. growth dampen comparatively minor extent; however, price pressure gradually rise. at end projection period, inflation largely consistent ecb’s definition price stability. the expansionary monetary policy undoubtedly play part that. but it’s secret economic policy measure produce desire effect: also entail side-effects risks. the monetary policy measure adopt exception. and whereas effect expansionary fiscal policy decline long lasts, associate risk side-effects rise. one side-effect highly accommodative monetary policy unviable enterprises, too, benefit favourable finance condition keep afloat. one could say, then, monetary policy play part brake structural change corporate sector. this tend harm productivity economy. a side-effect bank sector’s profitability suffer long monetary policy remain ultra-easy mode. this bank find difficult pas negative interest rate depositors. and good news depositors, detrimental effect banks’ costs. and because, all, eurosystem’s bond purchase depress long-term interest rates, income bank may generate investment decreases. of course, central banker, i concern profit bank make. from monetary policy perspective, however, crucial bank transmit monetary policy stimulus – depend partly capital base. for bank sufficient capital issue loan enterprise households. 8 bi central bankers’ speech this make important bank gear operation towards sustainable profitability even persistent low-interest-rate environment. fail this, may find difficult retain profit view strengthen capital base. particularly german bank often suffer structurally weak profitability – reason continuously review business models, get balance sheet order harness available scope consolidation order cut costs. yet another side-effect non-conventional measure – one i consider especially problematic light experience sovereign debt crisis – government bond purchase blur boundary monetary fiscal policy. that something i’ve say again. central bank become countries’ big creditors. and finance minister get use favourable finance conditions, danger monetary policy harness fiscal policy put pressure make high level debt sustainable low interest rates. that would make increasingly difficult exit ultra-easy monetary policy. monetary policy measure seek improve situation individual member state target way particularly problematic. that would case, instance, central bank buy bond issue government crisis countries, case eurosystem purchase 2010 2012. such purchase may cause redistribution fiscal risk central bank balance sheets, as, ultimately, taxpayer member state hook potential central bank losses. i already explain redistribute fiscal risk alien concept exist regulatory framework monetary union, base principle individual national responsibility, would probably counterproductive. if, however, decision redistribution taken, least take legitimacy so. those people sit government parliaments; work central banks. otherwise, independence eurosystem could call question; independence eurosystem expressly grant central prerequisite price stability euro area. let clear one thing. the current public sector purchase programme provide target purchase bond issue government individual crisis countries. all central bank buy bond issue government line size country. we maintain basic parameter exist programme avoid get eurosystem hot water. lady gentlemen, public debate expansionary monetary policy, often assert policy lead expropriation savers. i believe judge monetary policy solely inflation-adjusted return particularly safe save deposit fail capture whole picture. there have, past, frequently period save deposit yield negative short-term real interest rates; indeed, often even significantly low today. granted, situation little different term real long-term interest rates. they are, indeed, exceptionally low present. however, monetary policy; mute longer-term growth expectation euro-area country also blame. it national government conduct economic policy conducive last bi central bankers’ speech 9 increase growth. while monetary policy use instrument disposal smooth economic cycle, unable bring sustain growth. and must forget citizen generally savers, also employees, shareholders, taxpayer property owners. and perspective, low interest rate bad news. the expansionary monetary policy aim nudge rate inflation towards definition price stability stimulate economic activity. in situation characterise slack economy, secure jobs, increase tax revenue give enterprise opportunity expand. and may even odd person room happy low interest rate mortgage loan. in words, central bank perform important stabilisation function smooth business cycle attempt guide price developments. it must not, however, labour misapprehension able steer perfectly. equally, central bank must aware intervention individual market may result evasive action. however, i get impression central banker le susceptible illusion micro-manage everything analyst would like see central bank take even great responsibility demand increasingly far-reaching intervention markets. for “smoothing” even conceivable, central bank naturally require room monetary policy manoeuvre. and depends, part, long-term inflation rate target. if aim slightly positive rate, central bank rates, too, somewhat higher. this mean low sharply economy slows. that one reason govern council ecb aim keep inflation below, close to, 2 per cent medium term. there are, incidentally, argument favour slightly positive rate. potential error measure inflation one argument come mind. the consumer price index measure average price thing people buy. however, delay statistician become aware change purchase behaviour. they therefore tend overstate inflation. another reason inflation rate zero isn’t sensible target industry entire economy need claw back loss competitiveness would face daunt prospect push real wage cuts. that means, wage must rise slowly prices. but price rise all, nominal wage cut necessary. that, however, pretty much non-starter. finally, another argument slightly positive inflation rate euro area average close 2 per cent allow difference rate inflation within currency area, without price drop individual countries. difference inflation rate norm long member countries’ economy don’t move exactly parallel. if monetary policy seek hit average inflation rate 0%, would always country negative territory. there are, therefore, good reason major central bank target inflation rate around 2 per cent. there are, moreover, good reason give call raise inflation target. if academic literature optimum inflation rate show anything all, is, opinion, large degree uncertainty associate estimates. the ecb govern council’s definition price stability not, incidentally, demand inflation rate target below, close to, 2 per cent must meet times. it expressly state meet medium term. in context, medium term mean “sometime distant future”, mean “as fast possible costs”. 10 bi central bankers’ speech 6. conclusion lady gentlemen, idea name “europe” come greek word “erebos”, mean “dark”, linguists’ theory. accord another interpretation, europe come greek mythology mean “the far-sighted woman”. a optimistic interpretation, indeed. the objective reform propose bundesbank remedy deficit architecture monetary union thereby make stable. in particular, help redeem promise politician give public back euro introduced: namely euro would stable d-mark monetary union would therefore stability union. keep promise reliable credible central precondition regain political confidence europe. i look forward discussion. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ong chong tee: corporate governance – collaborative effort open address mr ong chong tee, deputy manage director (financial supervision) monetary authority singapore, 7th corporate governance week, singapore, 26 september 2016 * * * mr david gerald, president ceo security investor association singapore (sias), distinguish guests, lady gentleman thank invite deliver year’s open address. subject relate corporate governance always attract lively debate discussions, i doubt case course conference. the theme “change innovation governance” underscore dynamic nature corporate governance (or cg) issues. the direction change certainly towards great accountability, transparency responsibility directors. many agree old standard enough; good enough. boards’ composition, instance, subject great scrutiny respect independence, competence diversity. i believe overall positive trends. allow share think pertinent issues. role financial regulator our regulatory regime comprise four key elements: regulations, supervision, enforcement action well cross-border supervisory co-operation. this four-pronged approach apply area cg well. many would hear read enforcement action take ma various financial institution individual market misdemeanour spoof front running, well regulatory breach money launder rule operational incident lapses. whenever serious regulatory lapse control failures, often reflect shortcoming institution’s governance well. the ma carry enforcement action punish break law regulations. we protect integrity reputation financial sector. but enforcement action are, definition, ex-post proceed lengthy. i would much prefer rely ex-ante action minimise risk wrongdoings. this regulation supervisory work come in. but give size sophistication financial sector, neither possible realistic ma able detect prevent bad behaviour criminal acts. even assume manpower resource constraints, ma intrusive supervisory engagement carry long period on-site inspection would make hard board management operate. it also ideal desirable ma rely overly prescriptive conservative one-size-fits-all rule without inadvertently stifle legitimate business growth innovation. impetus change this good governance drive board must feature important frontline defence bad policies, poor conduct deficient risk management practices. a competent management must complement proactive board place good corporate governance priority area focus. this also area increase supervisory engagement ma financial institutions. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the singapore institute director (sid) issue series cg guidebook since august last year release board guide come months. this helpful document highlight role responsibility board, provide practical tip director internalise cg best practice discharge fiduciary duties. but impetus change continue. one notable trend even board continue engage shareholder actively understandable reasons, interest stakeholder increasingly matter well. customers, regulator government entities, environmentalists, analysts, academia, financial journalists, general public, even employee associate – stakeholder matter. the repercussion thing go terribly wrong even negative publicity easily destroy hard-won reputation franchise value ultimately erode shareholder returns. now, readily agree concept good corporate governance. but conception need do usually le obvious. to well require ”dna” board capable live mandate. in short, composition board matter effective functioning. this cg framework operate tiered approach. the company act set fundamental requirement director act honestly time use reasonable diligence discharge duties. the code corporate governance (or cg code) list company mas’ requirement board directorship local financial institutions, prescribe requirement relate independent directors, composition board committee on. one area need consider area board diversity. a diverse board require political correctness good business sense. a board good mix experiences, background technical competency result robust thorough discussion decision-making minimise blind spot information gaps. this also reduce risk “management capture”. these observation quite understandably trigger question whether time review cg code. it may indeed timely since last review back 2012. any review need carefully weigh differ perspective different stakeholders. what need balance progressive code serf enhance singapore’s cg standards, also pragmatic workable practice. corporate disclosure good cg also gain priority mind investor stakeholders. company increasingly transparent accountable stakeholders. in past year, ma work market participants, include industry associations, improve level corporate disclosure singapore. but high quality corporate disclosure continue recur concern investor see recent allegation account irregularity commodity-related energy resource firms. the bugbear investor look analyse financial information put company may feel hamper so. in study1 commission account corporate regulatory authority (acra) institute singapore charter accountant (isca), investor find usefulness company’s financial statement often limit over-aggregation information, insufficient disclosure disclosure difficult understand. these find suggest company provide simple succinct financial disclosures. in regard, audit committee director also role ensure financial disclosure company sufficient, timely meaningful. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the cg code set principle along four area on: (1) board matters; (2) remuneration matters; (3) accountability audit; (4) shareholder right responsibilities; company provide meaningful disclosures, merely adopt box-ticking mentality. two month ago, sgx issue report examine presence quality disclosure relation cg code. the find indicate disclosures, generally adequate, room improvement. one area, view, company provide good disclosure remuneration, well link remuneration performance. another area clarity regard diversity policy company’s plan them. the sgx also announce list company publish sustainability report financial year end 31 dec 2017. company disclose material environmental, social governance (esg) factors, policies, practices, performance targets. overall, mark progress voluntary report place since 2011, keep grow international interest sustainability information. market discipline: a collaborative effort all stakeholder next, let touch market discipline important place good cg practices. there trend towards great involvement engagement different stakeholder – internationally singapore. take example recent debate whether allow dual-class share sgx-listed companies. stakeholder understandably divide implication move potential impact market discipline – advocate ma weigh matter. that view, prevent thorough debate may prematurely stifle broad collective wisdom different stakeholders. the sgx still consider possible safeguard satisfy meet regulatory concerns; proceed, issue public consultation document details. for market discipline work, director embrace culture quality disclosure forthcoming engage investor timely fashion. responsible investors, hand, also practise active stewardship – question provide feedback. active involvement relevant stakeholder contribute towards vibrancy confidence singapore’s capital markets. but market discipline also require discipline market. whenever see allegation counter-allegations company marketplace, distinguish one reflect different stakeholder opinion shape good desirable outcome one create mischief corporate havoc without basis. the former embrace positive manifestation market discipline work latter see culprit take task via enforcement supervisory actions. exercise market discipline investor stewardship this bring relate area good stewardship i briefly mention earlier. internationally, grow recognition shareholders, particularly institutional investors, exercise stewardship role, engage investee company’s board management towards long-term sustainability goals. on note, ma please support ongoing effort investment community collaborate develop set best practice promote active stewardship institutional investors. the ma also support stakeholder sias. one example sias’ recent initiative issue report relate company annual report publish issue note guide retail investor participation company agms. sias issue 25 4 bi central bankers’ speech report thus far i note company take effort provide write response question raised. another worthwhile recent initiative sias garner companies’ affirmation statement support commitment uphold advance excellence cg standard enhance shareholder value. i tell already, 112 company participate support initiative – positive start. conclusion in conclusion, cg landscape evolve one fundamental tenet remain unchanged – accountability board director shareholder specifically also stakeholder large. board director set tone top, walk talk resonance tone middle tone front business units. good governance must guide “right” “good” – thereby well company long term. the ma financial regulator, one part cg eco-system, continue support collaborative effort shape corporate governance landscape. may i wish fruitful discussion week ahead. 1 “into mind investors: investors’ view financial reporting, audit corporate governance” acra, isca national university singapore business school. bi central bankers’ speech 1 haruhiko kuroda: “comprehensive assessment” monetary ease “qqe yield curve control” speech mr haruhiko kuroda, governor bank japan, meet business leaders, osaka, 26 september 2016. * * * accompany chart find end speech bank japan’s website. introduction it great pleasure opportunity today exchange view distinguish gather business leader kansai region. i would like take opportunity express sincere gratitude cooperation bank japan’s branch osaka, kobe, kyoto. at monetary policy meet (mpm) hold last week, bank conduct comprehensive assessment development economic activity price well policy effect since introduction quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe). in light find assessment, view achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time, decide introduce “qqe yield curve control” mean strengthen exist framework monetary easing. today, i would like talk main point think behind initiative bank aim achieve price stability target new framework. i. comprehensive assessment direction new policy framework in “comprehensive assessment,” bank examine development economic activity prices, well policy effects, past three year since introduction qqe objective manner, base fact theories. this detail nearly 60-page report, include main text, appendixes, charts, essence summarize broadly follow four main points. the first point that, three year since introduction qqe, japan’s economic activity prices, well financial conditions, improve substantially, japan’s economy long deflation. corporate profits, measure ratio current profit sales, record-high level (chart 1). excessive appreciation yen correct stock price surged. the employment situation significantly improve unemployment rate decline 3 percent. base pay rises, see first time two decades, continue three consecutive years. on price front, year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food energy negative introduction qqe, turn positive autumn 2013 remain positive territory two year ten month (chart 2). this first time since late 1990s, japan’s economy fell deflation, annual change cpi positive territory long period. japan’s economy long deflation, commonly define sustain decline prices. qqe bring positive turnaround economic activity prices, low real interest rate consider main transmission mechanism exert policy effects. this mechanism explain follows: (1) people’s inflation expectation – is, outlook price – would raise bank’s strong commitment achieve price stability target 2 percent large-scale monetary easing; (2) nominal interest rate across entire yield curve would push large-scale purchase japanese government bond (jgbs); (3) together, real interest rate would lowered, would stimulate economy push prices. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in “comprehensive assessment,” bank run counterfactual simulation actual development japan’s economy compare simulate development obtain assume qqe introduce (chart 3). the simulation use bank’s macroeconomic model conduct several different assumption regard (i) qqe start impact (ii) extent change stock price exchange rate regard part effect qqe. in many cases, simulation suggest japan still would deflation qqe introduced. the result various analyses, include simulations, clearly show qqe intend effect mechanism associate low real interest rates. the second point that, despite positive turnaround, price stability target 2 percent achieved. the key reason lie development inflation expectations. in japan, view price increase – so-called deflationary mindset – entrench among people prolong deflation. in situation, rational individual economic entity maintain status quo hoard cash rather take risks. a result, japan’s economy lose vibrancy. in order break situation, necessary dramatically change people’s outlook prices. specifically, essential people share view annual inflation around 2 percent, price-setting variety good service labor-management wage negotiation base view prices. for purpose, bank set price stability target 2 percent term cpi inflation launch qqe view achieve target early possible time. initially, qqe exert intend effect even effect anticipate (chart 4). the annual cpi growth rise 1.5 percent april 2014 inflation expectation also improve clearly. thereafter, however, background substantial decline crude oil price since summer 2014 weak demand consumption tax hike, observe inflation rate decreased. inflation expectation also start stall, follow course observe inflation rate. in order maintain momentum convert deflationary mindset, bank expand qqe october 2014. thank part response, inflation expectation manage stay around level despite strong headwinds. but global financial market become volatile amid slowdown emerge economies, particularly china, since summer 2015, and, since turn year, stock price decline globally yen appreciated. under environment, inflation expectation weakened. these experience suggest mechanism formation inflation expectation japan tend heavily influence course past inflation rate. it phrase adaptive mechanism weigh formation inflation expectations. the adaptive mechanism play considerably large role japan country (chart 5). this consider attributable fact price stability target miss prolong deflation, well practice wage negotiations, include annual labor-management wage negotiation spring (shunto), previous fiscal year’s inflation rate serve reference. against background, inflation expectation japan start weaken observe inflation rate declined. this main factor hamper achieve price stability target 2 percent. in order achieve price stability target, view firmly entrench among people observe inflation will, due course, converge price stability target set central bank, 2 percent, even fluctuate due variety factors. this refer “forward-looking mechanism” formation inflation expectations, contrast “adaptive mechanism” explain earlier. take account force push inflation expectation “adaptive mechanism” weakened, imperative strengthen “forward-looking mechanism,” order push inflation expectations. this one main point take account design new policy framework. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the third point bank able push entire yield curve combination large-scale purchase jgbs qqe negative interest rate policy introduce january 2016. nominal interest rate decline since introduction qqe, pace decline accelerate adopt negative interest rate policy, particularly long maturity (chart 6). in light developments, bank come conclusion facilitate formation yield curve, deem appropriate achieve price stability target 2 percent, appropriate combination negative interest rate jgb purchases. with factor mind, bank place “yield curve control” core element new policy framework. the fourth point impact monetary ease function financial intermediation. in “comprehensive assessment,” bank examine “qqe negative interest rate” translate lend rate affect profit financial institutions. when negative interest rate introduced, raise concern that, interest rate already extremely low, low jgb yield would lead decline banks’ lend rate well interest rate corporate bond cp, date, extent pass-through decline jgb yield fund rate roughly similar change previous episode interest rate cuts. at time, deposit rate also declined, small extent compare decline lend rates. this mean fall lend rate achieve expense financial institutions’ profits. thus, look ahead, policy effect decline interest rate depend impact profit financial institution lend attitude reflect impact. in fact, lend rate decline trend severely competitive environment, pace decline accelerate since introduction negative interest rate policy (chart 7). the excessive decline long-term super-long-term rate low rate return insurance pension product lead increase firms’ pension benefit obligations. although direct impact development economic activity whole unlikely substantial, possible development cause uncertainty regard sustainability financial function broad sense, could negative impact economic activity deterioration people’s confidence. in facilitate formation appropriate yield curve, bank take account points. ii. main point “qqe yield curve control” base find “comprehensive assessment,” bank decide introduce “qqe yield curve control,” new framework monetary easing, strengthen two previous policy frameworks: “qqe” “qqe negative interest rate.” the new policy framework consist two major components. the first “yield curve control” bank set short-term long-term interest rate operate target, second “inflation-overshooting commitment” bank commit maintain increase monetary base annual rate increase observe cpi exceed price stability target 2 percent stay target stable manner. now, i explain components. yield curve control a mention earlier, experience far negative interest rate policy show combination negative interest rate jgb purchase effective exert influence entire yield curve. against background, bank introduce “yield curve control.” to facilitate new framework, new market tool introduced. under new framework, bank set two key interest rate – short-term policy rate operate target long-term interest rate – guideline market operations. specifically, short-term policy rate, bank us interest rate apply policy-rate balance current account hold financial institution bank, 4 bi central bankers’ speech minus 0.1 percent, unchanged time (chart 8). for long-term interest rate, bank set level 10-year jgb yield operate target. the bank conduct purchase jgbs achieve target level. this time, operate target 10-year jgbs set “more le current level (around zero percent)”. for maturities, yield expect form market consistent guideline market operations. in words, shape location yield curve broadly remain present. in addition, order control yield curve smoothly, bank decide introduce new market operation fixed-rate jgb purchase operations; is, bank purchase jgbs price designates. the fixed-rate purchase operation intend serve cap long-term rate necessary. let elaborate difference exist policy framework. the guideline purchase jgbs specify far amount increase amount outstanding jgbs hold bank. this approach widely adopt bank central bank advance economies, include federal reserve unite states, european central bank, bank england, part clear purchase conducted. under approach, however, impact unit amount jgbs purchase long-term yield vary depend development economic activity price well financial market conditions. therefore, purchase could push yield either insufficiently excessively, comparison appropriate yield curve. under “yield curve control,” purchase jgbs conduct achieve target level interest rate specify guideline market operation time. a late guideline specify target interest rate broadly correspond current level, bank conduct purchase le line current pace – annual pace increase amount outstanding jgb hold 80 trillion yen – anticipate pace may fluctuate extent, either upward downward, order achieve yield curve control. therefore, possible change amount purchase policy implication. a i explained, “yield curve control,” bank able conduct purchase jgbs flexible effective manner before. thus, good prepare address various change circumstances, sustainability policy also enhanced. inflation-overshooting commitment next, i explain inflation-overshooting commitment. since introduction qqe, bank commit continue monetary easing, aim achieve price stability target 2 percent, long necessary maintain target stable manner. this time, addition exist commitment, bank decide commit expand monetary base year-on-year rate increase observe cpi (all item le fresh food) exceed price stability target 2 percent stay target stable manner. to clear, mean raise price stability target 2 percent. it actively debate within academia central bank circle whether price stability target high 2 percent order address downtrend growth potential, sometimes refer secular stagnation. at present, topic discuss medium- long-term issue, rather immediate policy response. i fully aware discussion. that said, let make clear inflation-overshooting commitment design base price stability target 2 percent. so, one might ask observe cpi need “exceed 2 percent.” achieve price stability target 2 percent mean attain situation observe cpi around 2 bi central bankers’ speech 5 percent average business cycle. thus, naturally assume outset would phase observe cpi stay 2 percent. even so, extremely strong commitment, link observe cpi rather outlook cpi. it widely accept monetary policy conduct forward-looking manner take time monetary policy impact economic activity prices. in light this, backward-looking commitment base observe cpi truly exceptional central bank. in fact, bank first world adopt backward-looking commitment base observe cpi quantitative ease (qe) last five year since 2001. back then, however, commitment bank would continue qe “until cpi (all item le fresh food) register stably zero percent increase year year.” by compare new commitment previous one, understand powerful new commitment be, need “exceed 2 percent.” a explain earlier, adaptive mechanism formation inflation expectation still play large role japan, legacy prolong deflation prevails. in order raise inflation expectation circumstances, bank judge necessary dare make strong commitment base observe cpi demonstrate bank’s unwavering determination achieve price stability target 2 percent. the commitment expand monetary base. it amount outstanding currently 400 trillion yen, already around 80 percent nominal gdp (chart 9). correspond ratio 20 percent unite state euro area. look ahead, ratio calculate exceed 100 percent slightly one year, assume bank continue current pace increase monetary base. you might concern risk “bold” commitment would create tighten monetary policy behind curve, lead acceleration inflation. let point couple things. first, hardly effective make commitment everyone consider “modest.” qqe lead conversion people’s mindset positive turnaround economic activity prices, everyone think “unprecedentedly bold.” second, base late current outlook, annual rate increase cpi likely accelerate gradually toward 2 percent. in scenario, even monetary ease expansion monetary base low interest rate across yield curve continues, unlikely inflation rate significantly deviate 2 percent never revert level. third, lastly, even inflation rapidly accelerate reason, bank achieve price stability target 2 percent stable manner influence short-term long-term interest rates; is, yield curve control. of course, represent just-in-case scenario, reasonably assume large-scale monetary ease place observe cpi stay 2 percent stable manner. formation yield curve option additional ease these main point new framework monetary policy: “qqe yield curve control.” the bank pursue monetary ease forceful manner new framework achieve price stability target early possible time. specifically, place yield curve control core element framework, bank facilitate formation yield curve deem appropriate view maintain momentum toward achieve price stability target 2 percent, respond development economic activity price well financial conditions. a explain earlier, factor impact function financial intermediation also take consideration. at time, however, let emphasize policy judgment base impact japan’s economy whole. the impact function financial intermediation consider extent would affect entire economy change financial conditions. to put another way, bank 6 bi central bankers’ speech make policy adjustments, without hesitation, judge necessary japan’s economy whole. with regard possible option additional easing, main policy tool cut negative short-term policy interest rate low target level long-term interest rate. expand asset purchase – “quality” dimension – also continue option. moreover, situation warrant it, acceleration expansion monetary base – “quantity” dimension – could option. in case, interest rate likely decline significantly, regardless yield curve control. there case powerful monetary ease needed, depend development economic activity price well financial market conditions. the bank stand ready use every possible policy tool, judge necessary achieve objectives. conclusion i explain find “comprehensive assessment” new framework monetary policy base assessment. i must say take time expect overcome deflation. now, i even strongly convince make sure japan’s economy never return deflation. for three year since introduction qqe, economy make substantial progress toward overcome deflation last fifteen years. there good opportunity completely get deflation. talk limit monetary policy help all. what important confront issue continue pursue best possible solutions. two major item new framework, “yield curve control” “inflation-overshooting commitment,” discuss within academia fora. the bank first world introduce actual policy tools. a i mention various occasions, limit monetary policy. “the cost monetary policy minimize benefit maximized.” “in design monetary policy, bank relentlessly pursue innovation never hesitate challenge.” with mind, bank continue make utmost effort achieve price stability target 2 percent early possible time. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement mr mario draghi, president european central bank, hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament, brussels, 26 september 2016. * * * mr chairman, honourable member economic monetary affair committee, lady gentlemen, i grateful back speak committee le week away important anniversary european parliament: 40 year ago act make direct european election possible signed, i happy speak – direct representative people europe. european call institution bring tangible benefit everyday lives. we need respond appeal action within respective competences. this i today: demonstrate importance ecb place accountable eu citizens, also discus ecb act fulfil mandate democratically confer upon us. therefore, remark today i first review state euro area recovery impact monetary policy measures. then, request committee, i discus financial market condition euro area and, particular, evolution financial market integration. the economic outlook ecb’s monetary policy the recovery euro area expect continue moderate steady pace, slightly le momentum envisage june. on positive side, incoming information continue point euro area economy resilient global political uncertainty, notably follow uk referendum outcome. the initial impact vote contain strong financial market reactions, equity price falls, largely reversed. at time, substantial weaken foreign demand outlook since june expect dampen export growth. along factors, continue pose downside risk euro area’s growth prospects. accord september ecb staff macroeconomic projections, annual real gdp growth expect increase 1.7% year, 1.6% next two years. inflation continue remain low levels, reflect past decline oil price weak wage growth. annual inflation expect 0.2% year increase 1.2% 2017 impact past oil price fall unwinds. the continue economic recovery decline level slack expect gradually push inflation 1.6% 2018. against background, comprehensive policy measure continue filter real economy. borrow condition household firm ease considerably credit creation strengthened, thus support aggregate spend across euro area. let focus description credit ease component policy measures. they act critical transmission channel monetary stimulus facilitate meaningful reduction fund cost real economy. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in june year last week conduct first two operation new series target longer-term refinance operation (tltro-ii), attract significant demand. two additional operation take place december march. these operation allow bank secure long-term fund attractive condition pas customers. likewise, credit ease component expand asset purchase programme (app), namely asset-backed security

pass-through contain banks’ fund costs, cspp directly low cost improve availability market-based fund non-financial corporations. let stress, respect, cspp benefit large companies, directly access bond market, also small companies. buoyant bond market condition large company incentivise obtain fund bond markets, thus leave space banks’ balance sheet provide loan small medium-sized enterprise (smes). overall, projection indicate accommodative monetary policy stance continue provide effective support cyclical recovery upward path inflation. but finance condition must remain supportive baseline scenario materialise. therefore, govern council continue monitor economic financial market development closely. we preserve substantial amount monetary support embed staff projection necessary secure return inflation level below, close to, 2% medium term. if warranted, act use instrument available within mandate. financial market condition euro area i grateful today decide discus state financial market fragmentation euro area. i remember almost four year ago, building, statement i comment “the impact financial monetary condition past reduction key ecb interest rate differ considerably within euro area”. compare financial market situation autumn 2012, situation largely improved. financial market fragmentation decline substantially finance condition firm household improve markedly across euro area. in particular, reduction key ecb interest rate pass vulnerable euro area country large extent, fragmentation fund cost loan condition across different country receded. to give example, october 2012 july 2016 composite cost-of-borrowing indicator new loan non-financial corporation decline almost 287 basis point portugal 200 basis point italy, compare 117 basis point euro area whole. a similar phenomenon observe smes, benefit substantially improve finance condition reduce fragmentation. a result, spread lend rate small loan large loan similar july 2016 vulnerable non-vulnerable euro area country (at 135 120 basis points, respectively), situation see since spring 2011. address new challenge while challenge financial fragmentation largely overcome, new one face. the low interest rate environment select today’s discussion indeed one them. bi central bankers’ speech 3 low rate symptom underlie economic situation. they reflect weak long-term growth trend protract macroeconomic slump result crisis. the ecb’s monetary policy provide significant accommodation limit negative effect global euro area-specific shock economy, thereby mitigate disinflationary impact. nevertheless, monetary policy cannot determine sustainable level real interest rate long run, turn depend long-term growth prospects. this mean policy actor need part, pursue fiscal structural policy contribute self-sustaining recovery increase economic growth potential euro area, i discuss june. in meantime, low interest rate environment range implication economic actor need carefully monitored. i sure part exchange today chair european supervisory authorities, i course happy continue discussion answer questions. another, recent, challenge outcome uk referendum eu membership economic implication euro area. the extent economic outlook affect depend timing, development final outcome upcoming negotiations. so far, euro area economy resilient, due uncertainty baseline scenario remain subject downside risks. regardless type relationship emerge european union unite kingdom, utmost importance integrity single market respected. any outcome ensure participant subject rules. but generally, important ensure european union meet expectation people. this require three line action. first, new common european project focus immediate concern need people. for challenge unequivocally go beyond national borders, effective solution require joint european action. from perspective, today’s priority notably include field migration, security defence. second, european integration feasible acceptable, trust among nation people essential. to bolster trust, important agree rule respected. in economic monetary union, particular, economic governance framework essential avoid imbalance would eventually risk destabilise euro area. and euro area thrive, action national government need unleash growth, reduce unemployment empower individuals, offer essential protection vulnerable. finally, economic monetary union remain vulnerable long complete integration project started. we need, particular, complete bank union develop ambitious capital market union (cmu) ensure resilience financial integration euro area support cross-border investment. the european parliament play key part set bank union important role play ensure swift progress legislative dossier discussion part bank union cmu agendas. make determine progress field would significantly strengthen economic monetary union, thus constitute important step forward line roadmap propose five presidents’ report. 4 bi central bankers’ speech conclusion in conclude remarks, i want recall word late friend colleague carlo azeglio ciampi address european parliament 2005: “the euro great demonstration unite european people, drive force political integration”. and, indeed, political commitment underpin single currency strongly reaffirm crisis. important effort made. but widespread feel insecurity, include economic insecurity, remain major concern. we cannot simply wait good times: need renew effort ensure economic monetary union offer protection prosperity. the ecb part. thank attention. i disposal questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 sharon donnery: macroprudential policy – action face uncertainty address m sharon donnery, deputy governor central bank ireland, dublin economic workshop annual economic policy conference, dublin, 23 september 2016. * * * i would like thank niamh hallissey, yvonne mccarthy mícheál o’keeffe contribution speech. introduction good evening. i delight address dublin economic workshop. this annual conference always key policy forum subject year’s conference – “policymaking uncertain future” timely. the recent vote uk leave european union lead heighten risk uncertainty euro area union generally. ireland expose european economy potential effect brexit. this uk account large percentage irish import exports.i labour flow cross-border investment linkage considerable. in addition, certain domestic irish bank large exposure uk. there considerable uncertainty regard specific political institutional construct may emerge uk decide trigger article 50 treaty. this make challenge estimate impact irish economy. this impact determine wide range factor including: condition uk’s exit – particular degree access single market; result effect uk extent transmit irish firm institution wide range potential regulatory outcome result uk’s new arrangements. sentiment hard data release point mix picture far short medium term impact ireland likely negative. in context, bank recently publish forecast revise project irish gdp growth 0.2 per cent 2016 0.6 per cent 2017.ii however, quantify potential impact protract period uncertainty risk aversion much precision difficult. small open economy like ireland especially vulnerable shocks, particularly context legacy crisis. a highlight recent macro-financial review, household debt remain high, stand 150 billion euro. this equivalent 160 per cent disposable income. such high level debt leave household vulnerable, particularly adverse movement income interest rates. iii the sme sector also remain highly indebted. this act drag economic activity, give restrict ability firm borrow invest. it also leaf sector vulnerable change finance conditions. in financial sector, despite return profitability, level provision non-performing loan domestic bank remain elevated.iv uncertainty challenge face policy makers, backdrop many decision made. frank knight seminal 1921 book formalise distinction concept risk uncertainty find common use mainstream economics. risk, suggested, refer situation distribution future outcome known, hence measurable. uncertainty, contrast definition, “not susceptible measurement” hence cannot predicted.v 2 bi central bankers’ speech this distinction capture many challenge policymakers face today. for risks, measure degree confidence, likelihood occurrence design policy accordingly. some outcome however unknown. policymaking uncertainty challenging. the central bank ireland explicit mandate protect financial stability and, designate macroprudential authority, range tool target emerge risk domestic financial system.vi in context, evening, i would like take opportunity speak bank’s framework macroprudential policymaking uncertain future. the bank’s policy framework follow four key step policy cycle. vii first, i discus assessment identification systemic risk. second, i elaborate select calibrate instruments. third, i discus policy implementation issue surround inaction bias, decision-making uncertainty, communication. the fourth final critical step cycle policy evaluation. i conclude give insight ongoing review mortgage measure – one key macroprudential instruments. *** identify assess systemic risk macroprudential action one component wide set macroeconomic financial sector policies. the underlie rationale macroprudential policy lie divergence financial business cycles. financial cycle show different frequency amplification business cycles. financial cycle self-reinforcing magnify fluctuation economy. they lead financial distress severe economic dislocations, seen.viii the ultimate objective macroprudential policy prevent mitigate systemic risk. major disturbance financial system disrupt provision financial services. this serious negative consequence real economy. there several externality give rise systemic risk. a commonly use classification group three distinct types.ix first, externality relate so-called “strategic complementarities”. these cause build-up vulnerability upswing phase financial cycle. sometimes, competitive dynamic market, bank example adopt similar strategy asset choice liquidity risk (i.e. common exposures).x this lead self-reinforcing effects, return increase, short term, bank follow suit. these dynamic affect credit standards, loss recognition, portfolio quality. it also lead additional asset price volatility. such “herding behaviour” domestic international bank well document nyberg report irish bank crisis.xi herd behaviour household also contribute systemic risk great risk taking, example mortgage markets. therefore, even systemic risk emerge financial sector, borrower-based measure may still necessary. the second set externality relate sell-offs downswing phase financial cycle. fire sales, example, amplify financial distress due loss spiral result pro-cyclical asset price effects, margin haircut spirals.xii this occur decline price asset lead erosion capital. self-reinforcing feedback effect leverage force bank shed asset repay debt restore equity. credit crunch similar effect cause deterioration balance sheet dry financing. bi central bankers’ speech 3 finally, externality relate interconnectedness result propagation shock throughout financial system. interconnectedness arise many complex transaction bilateral relationship institutions. it also result feedback real economy. these externality clearly evident ireland crisis. examination ireland’s experience since crisis provide ample justification introduction macroprudential measures.xiii however, order macroprudential policy limit systemic risks, policymakers must first able identify ass them. to must able measure risks, cross-sectional dimension (measuring distribution risk point time) temporal dimension (measuring evolution aggregate risk). this challenge pursuit number reasons, least systemic event are, nature, rare tail events. furthermore, regardless indicator identify, measure ass systemic risk, future, risk may arise different source fully capture exist indicators. the constant evolution innovation financial system, change fundamentally recent decades, complicate task measure systemic risk. thus, macroprudential policymakers face knightian uncertainty impossible predict outcome be.xiv against backdrop, vital research systemic risk indicator continue evolve financial sector developments. enhancement continually make systemic risk assessments. for example, on-going development measure key property financial cycles, length persistence, enhance ability policymakers implement counter-cyclical macroprudential policy.xv much progress already make bank make full use data model available measure systemic risk emerge various sector financial system, also draw development european level. the european systemic risk board, example, publish quarterly risk assessment european development ecb monitor systemic risk communicate via financial stability review.xvi to enhance bank’s assessment identification systemic risks, last week announce new stand-alone directorate financial stability. in line mandate strategic plan, ensure enhance analysis coverage insurance, shadow banking, fund credit union sector financial stability perspective. this complement already comprehensive body work relation bank sector. *** instrument selection calibration follow identification assessment risks, second step macroprudential policy framework select calibrate appropriate instruments.xvii the bank’s toolkit constant development since crisis include inter alia range capital buff well borrower-based measures. these use mitigate structural risk – emerge segment financial system, cyclical risk – emanate financial cycle. these combine microprudential instrument target bank specific exposure maturity mismatches, example.xviii the appropriate combination instrument depend assessment emerge risks. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the macroprudential assessment multifaceted. financial stability explicit target like often case monetary policy. therefore different instrument disposal different objective different transmission channels. for example, other systemically important institution (o-sii) buff capital buffer. it aim reduce potential impact failure systemically important financial institution domestic economy. last year, two irish bank identify domestically systemically important due particular role irish financial sector, domestic economy payment system. in context, bank decide capital surcharge rate 1.5 per cent (cet1) capital apply institutions.xix the countercyclical capital buff (ccyb) different type buff one range instrument use mitigate prevent excessive credit growth. via ccyb require bank set aside additional capital period strong credit growth grow systemic risk. this buff release economic downturn prevent undue restriction supply credit private sector. the buff therefore aim promote bank sector resilience protect potential loss ensure stable provision credit economic cycle.xx in view current condition credit market, bank decide last year set buff zero. these buff combine capital instrument target sectoral exposure deem excessive. the macroprudential toolkit broad solely focus capital. a leverage ratio also come force 2018 develop macroprudential tool. this prevent excessive leverage build bank sector upswing phase financial cycle. it also stop destabilise deleveraging downturn. liquidity charge also design target resilience fund base outflow stress periods. whilst intermediate impact instrument may differ, aim enhance resilience banks, hence protect system whole. in addition target resilience banks, central bank also power available, affect condition mortgage lend occurs. the aim protect borrower bank adverse movement credit property prices, economic shocks. i return mortgage regulation later. finally, so-called pillar 2, micro-prudential instrument also use ensure holistic approach mitigate systemic risk. therefore close collaboration need assess systemic risk, supervise individual institutions. *** implementation communication despite rich set indicators, instrument sophisticate method calibrate them, third step macroprudential policy framework – implementation – particularly challenge bank. this although cost measure immediately felt quantifiable bank borrower apply, benefit often unobservable. for example, benefit reduce probability crisis increase stability financial system difficult measure, although analytical framework develop help ass policy trade-offs.xxi this also uncertainty surround indicator use identify risks. take countercyclical capital buff i mentioned. if credit supply increase excessively, capital charge pose direct cost banks. however, ensure bank hold bi central bankers’ speech 5 extra cet1 capital upswing financial cycle, provide cushion cycle turns. similarly, mortgage regulation impact individuals’ ability access credit purchase houses. a one public submission review mortgage regulation state – “i don’t want large mortgage, i want cheap house”. this perfectly reasonable wish. however price determine complex interaction supply demand side factor instrument disposal much. we don’t aim target house prices, although impact price by-product measures. others argue caution use macroprudential instruments, give associate uncertainty impact change macro-financial environment. however, danger think also lead inaction bias part policymakers. in theory, rules-based approach, would automatically trigger action set indicator breached, would mitigate risk inaction bias.xxii however, degree judgement policymakers need calibrate efficiently, implemented, respond quickly evolve risks.xxiii thus, practice, recognise judgment need give individual indicator threshold cannot fully capture emerge risks. our policy framework therefore design operate system “guided discretion”. for example, member state european union require use standardise benchmark calculate countercyclical capital buff rate. this act common guide designate authority across jurisdictions. similarly, o-sii buff cap 2% risk weight assets, guide decisions. recent work staff bank england consider whether cautious stance macroprudential policy justify face knightian uncertainty. it find case. a macroprudential policy target resilience financial system favour action avoid large loss across scenarios, regardless likely scenario are. rather, analysis suggest lead active policy face uncertainty.xxiv experience recent crisis illustrate starkly cost inaction policymakers around world thus embrace need macroprudential instruments. in european union, sixteen member state form loan-to-value / debt-service-to-income loan-to-income measure place. learn recent past, bank also proactive use tools. communication also central element implementation. we commit transparency around measure implement. bank staff actively publish insight analysis risk biannual macro-financial review, research technical paper publications. with regard mortgage regulations, bank publish economic letter july present insight new mortgage lend 2015, follow introduction regulations.xxv furthermore, bank publish submission public call evidence impact measure time publication review november. this accompany feedback statement cover key issue raised. such move help improve dialogue impact rule include distinction operation rule wide issues, example relate supply housing. in bid foster great understand decisions, also intend publish october first account meet internal macroprudential measure committee, issue discussed. *** 6 bi central bankers’ speech macroprudential policy evaluation evidence-based policymaking central principle bank’s work. give uncertainty future evolution financial system precise impact macroprudential instruments, important measure review regular basis. the final step macroprudential policy framework – namely evaluation – therefore critical. the countercyclical capital buff review quarterly basis, o-sii buff mortgage regulation review annually. however review see indication bank intend make change measures. the first review mortgage regulation publish november. this examine effectiveness measure state objective discus potential side effects. let briefly reiterate objective measure enhance resilience borrower bank sector. a i state previously, mortgage regulation design permanent feature irish system. the evidence threshold justify material loosen tighten rule significant two reasons. first, stable rule valuable household mortgage lender eliminate avoidable uncertainty regulatory regime. second, noisy volatile nature macro-financial data mean would unwise seek adjust rule response minor temporary fluctuation state financial cycle: fine-tune approach could actually aggravate financial instability revision prove unwarranted badly timed. there much public focus late ongoing review, i would like take moment focus specifically this. a body empirical work underway inform future reviews. this include analysis cover household resilience borrower types, bank resilience bank lend practices, house price credit dynamics. in addition examine impact rental market, house supply unsecured lending. the review also inform recent international evidence public submission impact regulations. the call public submission close 31 august. the bank receive fifty submission total. these come wide range individuals, industry experts, interest party currently analysed. a number submission highlight need improve awareness calibration measure availability allowance proportionate cap system. early insight publish july economic letter capture period bank borrower transition new regulatory environment. xxvi however, number key point emerge period. a mentioned, impact price by-product measures. in context see moderation dublin house price increase since end-2014, although house price growth remain strong commuter county cities. the late data house purchase price first-time buyer nationally suggest median house price €210,000 2015.xxvii under rules, assume use make available exemptions, would imply minimum deposit requirement 10 per cent purchase price. for first-time buyer dublin, median purchase price period €270,000; deposit requirement case 11.9 per cent. bi central bankers’ speech 7 these requirement broadly line observe market first time buyer period precede introduction regulations, financial institution already adjust lend standard prudent level financial crisis. second, price expectation also moderate follow introduction measure – although survey participant continue expect house price rise short medium term. median price expectation moderated, national dublin markets. the mortgage regulation also report influence expectations. through review, also note number difference characteristic borrower data. under regulations, proportion lend allow take place excess loan-to-value loan-to-income limits.xxviii among first-time buyers, borrower allowance loan-to-value ratio had, average, high income relative borrower without allowance. couple borrower dublin also high share allowance. with regard loan-to-income ratio, borrower allowance average low income slightly younger. there also high share single borrower loan-to-income allowance. these aspect give u great understand effect regulation how, extent allowance used. this also suggest initial fear regard use allowance may unfounded. a new data insight lend development use allowance exceed parameter rule become available, release periodic basis. for example, another economic letter lend first half 2016 publish matter weeks. similarly, forthcoming quarterly bulletin include article entitle “rental markets, save accumulation mortgage down-payments” give insight dynamics. *** conclusion in year ahead, knightian uncertainty remain central feature backdrop policy maker must make difficult decisions. with regard macroprudential policy, must prepare take action face uncertainty. learn crisis, bank take clear decisive action introduction mortgage measure macroprudential instruments. these implement interest safeguard financial stability protect system whole. we still early life mortgage measure medium term focus. it would unwise seek adjust rule response minor temporary fluctuation state financial cycle. therefore, evidence threshold justify material loosen tighten rule significant. it important strive continue enhance knowledge economic financial developments, potential impact various scenario framework assessing, calibrating, implement macroprudential policies. i hope work central

speech 1 chris salmon: rebuild trust “fx global code” – reason optimism speech mr chris salmon, executive director market bank england, aci uk square mile debate, london, 21 september 2016. * * * i grateful david edmunds, grigoria christodoulou, laurie roberts, tim taylor, rebecca jackson, geoff coppins jon pyzer assistance prepare speech. good evening, i delight aci uk’s square mile debate. tonight, focus work underway develop single, global code conduct foreign exchange (fx). but i cannot help advertise bank’s late product: churchill £5 note launch week ago. it technological first us, make polymer, “cleaner, safe stronger” paper predecessor. but unquestioned discretion replace one version £5 note another rely much old concept: trust, trust “promise pay bearer…”. and trust, specifically, rebuild trust, core main subject tonight, fx global code conduct (the “code”). it secret well fx ficc market generally. the nature scope misconduct come light recent year significantly erode trust market – public trust, also trust market participants. the fair effective market review (2015)1 extensively document root cause misconduct. but short, structural weaknesses, range poorly design infrastructure guideline constitute acceptable market practice sometimes poorly understood, present opportunity misconduct occur. and “ethical drift”, whereby poor culture prioritise short-term financial gain else perpetuate normalised, mean individual will exploit opportunities. all feature present various episode fx misconduct come light. poor infrastructure clearly issue foreign exchange markets; particular manipulation 4.00pm fix facilitate weakness design2. but, demonstrated, example misconduct associate handle client stop-loss orders, breakdown market practice norm clearly important fx markets. the wholesale fx market one complex market world: operate 24 hour day across multiple centres. participant diverse: range corporates look hedge trade flows, principal trade firm seek capitalise transitory price anomaly and, time time, central bank seek affect price currency. some user access market directly; others indirectly, example sponsorship prime broker. banks, act key intermediaries, accept market risk transact principal client provide agency service others. order often complex, require bank exercise discretion execute them. there single price – concept ‘best execution’ sit neatly markets. nor single trade venue, even single method trading, bank platform compete business. 1 http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/documents/femrjun15.pdf. 2 http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_140930.pdf – final report foreign exchange benchmarks, financial stability board, 30 september 2014. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this combination factor mean information asymmetry potential conflict interest inherent ficc market also acute fx markets. this turn create particular premium establish commonly understand accept market standard guide behaviour. the global code initiative launch may 2015 bank international settlement (bis) governors, design achieve this. the initiative establish single, global code conduct wholesale fx market task develop mechanism promote great adherence3. this initiative well advanced, phase 1 material publish may 20164. the complete code launch london may 2017. a sceptic might question prospect success initiative. after all, first fx code – supersede number exist regional fx codes, end gather dust market participants’ drawers. so, code work others failed? in market information asymmetry exploit selfish motif – good voluntary code conduct really achieve? this good challenge, end time tell code initiative succeed minimise future incident misconduct. but i want set four reason optimistic discuss step i think market participant need take individually collectively support future adherence, fundamental code’s ultimate success, i believe interest take steps. the first reason optimism – perhaps important – substance code itself. it directly address complexity fx market i summarise early and, inform misconduct past, provide guidance necessary. for example, interim publication establish important principle “where acceptance order grant principal execute order discretion, exercise discretion reasonably, fairly way design intend disadvantage client”. and acknowledge pre-hedging may legitimate risk management tool clear undertake “in manner mean disadvantage client disrupt market”. during phase 2 work programme deal areas, provision use “last look” time-stamping highlight fair effective market review area market practice fx market could improved. and strike right balance set high-level principle provide concrete guidance. let illustrate point summarise phase 1 deal vex issue information sharing. the may 2016 text set out, upfront, broad, overarch principle – “market participant communicate market colour appropriately without compromise confidential information”. and set detail, principle apply different type information: example, “client groups, location strategies, refer level granularity allow market participant derive underlie confidential information”. this augment final code stylise example demonstrate guidance apply practical situation – example effective ineffective aggregation information. second, alive importance keep code date. from start finish code complete two years. a benefit compress timeline code relevant today’s market published. and importantly commit develop appropriate review mechanism code stay date 3 http://www.bis.org/press/p150511.htm – guy debelle reserve bank australia chair work, simon potter federal reserve bank new york lead work develop code lead adherence work. 4 https://www.bis.org/mktc/fxwg/gc_may16.pdf. bi central bankers’ speech 3 evolve market evolves. further detail announce next year, new code allow stagnate. third, process develop code inclusive and, knowledge, unprecedented. it development much partnership public private sectors, broad-based, senior engagement type key market participants. this help get buy-in final product. the code everyone fx market – cover buy-side, sell-side, non-bank participants, trade platform market infrastructure – therefore engagement necessarily diverse. during phase 2 broaden engagement ensure voice different market participant hear take account of. the contribution make 40 member dedicate market participant group (mpg) – chair david puth cl – current aci president marshall bailey also sit – alongside contribution regional fxc member invaluable, involve hundred individual devote thousand hour cause. fourth, code one suite important initiative launch recent year improve conduct ficc markets. initiative uk senior manager certification regime, soon extend beyond bank fca authorise firms, aim raise standard market conduct strengthen accountability senior management. this particularly pertinent fx give london account third global fx market turnover. reform remuneration structure aim reduce incentive cheat short-term profit. and uk ficc market standard board, create direct consequence fair effective market review, establish champion good conduct across whole range ficc markets. these initiatives, combine great focus conduct, create supportive environment objective code5. these four factor create reason optimistic prospect code. but, enough ensure success. that require consistent widespread adherence market participants. the code rebuild trust actively use market participant drive market-wide shift culture attitude – one embed behavioural norm consistent letter spirit code. this type cultural shift something mandated. the official private sector work together achieve this, little doubt change, fundamentally, must come firm themselves. in view least, market participants’ individual collective interest make change. individually, firm assimilate code fully likely benefit, time, great trust marketplace, strong reputation, high long term franchise value. in world competition market share remain fierce, win trust client matter financially. collectively, standard behaviour throughout market higher, easy one firm maintain high standard avoid get embroil “race bottom”; firm benefit reduction future regulatory legal risk. moreover, endure adherence code’s high standard behaviour likely lead improve function market whole: widely followed, code facilitate effective consistently appropriate information share case. an 5 there number important code develop uk, specifically security lending, repo money market code currently write market participant-led joint sub-committee bank’s money market liaison committee (mmlc) security lend repo committee (slrc); precious metal code produce lbma. these parallel initiative benefit contribute supportive environment. 4 bi central bankers’ speech efficient effective market make positive impact everyone’s bottom line – lead good volumes, few dispute good outcome market participants. so question market participant – you, collectively individually, make use code realise benefits? there three key element need place: first, code need embed firms’ practices: train education important here. second, firm right policy procedure place ensure able monitor successfully embed code. the text code provide practical suggestion ultimately firm need consider appropriate framework business level activity fx market. third, firm able demonstrate publicly behaviour practice fx market line code’s principles. the widespread use common public attestation could powerful tool respect. it would provide strong signal firm’s commitment follow good practice help focus mind firm’s senior management would ask sign attestation. embedding, monitor demonstrate adherence require concrete action. the central bank lead way, demonstrate commitment code set incentive others follow. bi central bank announce intention embed finalise code within practice – expectation fx counterparties likewise. we also work towards establish link firm’s formal commitment adhere code membership regional fxcs (the london fxjsc case). in context, develop attestation form, could adopt widely, could view public good. give breadth fxc membership – 200 fxc member within 8 major regional fxcs, represent buy-side, sell-side, infrastructure, association others – potential importance link underestimated. our action central banks, however, part broad picture. the market need consider engage code collectively individually. the process already start collective level. david puth’s mpg recently create dedicate sub-group consider market-based method support code. i sure mpg group reach industry associations, like aci, potential develop common education modules, provide train seminar facilitate workshop deepen knowledge code. we share think use attestation mpg team, i confident identify number market-based initiative support adherence. one idea group exploring, without challenge could develop time, creation industry kite-mark, firm would award public attestation code buttress threshold amount independent assurance work. individually, firms, particularly senior management, start consider step take support code. over question policy procedure train module key question senior management ask set strong positive tone ensure firm’s incentive promotion policy align responsible engagement market long-term reputation firm? part conversation involve discussion firm monitor adherence code, reward good behaviour penalise bad behaviour. in uk, senior manager may find helpful consider work conjunction responsibility senior manager certification regime. when final code release may 2017 doubt subject much scrutiny. sceptic look clear commitment firm adhere code. central bank play part catalyse commitments, really count response market participants. word alone enough i encourage ensure respond positively quickly. the code see as, indeed create be, tick-box exercise. the code write primarily compliance department bi central bankers’ speech 5 fx market – include front, middle back office senior management want adhere. it tool rebuild trust standards. if new churchill £5 “cleaner, safe stronger” predecessor, i hope global code initiative lead fx market “cleaner” “safer” user “stronger” impact behaviour forefathers. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mark carney: resolve climate paradox text arthur burn memorial lecture mr mark carney, governor bank england chairman financial stability board, berlin, 22 september 2016. * * * i grateful alice carr, carsten jung, ben nelson iain de weymarn assistance prepare remarks. i. introduction it honour give arthur burn memorial lecture. in arthur burns’ day, financial diplomacy limit weighty issue monetary policy coordination, particularly search new international monetary system follow collapse bretton woods. your invitation discus climate change sign broaden responsibility central bank include financial well monetary stability. it also demonstrate change nature international financial diplomacy. the quest renewal bretton wood treaty, associate protocol enforcement mechanisms, replace flexible governance g20 fsb. these group gather principal work together forge consensus implement global solution common problems. when i speak lloyd’s london year ago financial stability risk arise climate change, i, effect, highlight two paradoxes.1 first, future past. that is, climate change tragedy horizon impose cost future generation current one direct incentive fix. the catastrophic impact climate change felt beyond traditional horizon actor include business central banks. once climate change become clear present danger financial stability may already late stabilise atmosphere two degrees. the second paradox success failure. that is, rapid movement towards low-carbon economy could materially damage financial stability. a wholesale reassessment prospects, climate-related risk re-evaluated, could destabilise markets, spark pro-cyclical crystallisation loss lead persistent tighten financial conditions: climate minsky moment. resolve conundrum require first distinguish three channel climate change affect financial stability. the first concern physical risk arise increase frequency severity climate- weather-related event damage property disrupt trade. at present, general insurer front line.2 thus far, combination sophisticate forecasting, forward-looking european insurance capital regime business model build around short-term coverage leave insurer relatively well-placed manage physical risks.3 1 see carney (2016), “breaking tragedy horizon – climate change financial stability”, speech give lloyd’s london, september 2015. 2 while attribution increase claim specific factor complex, work do lloyd’s london estimate 20cm rise sea-level tip manhattan since 1950s, factor hold constant, increase insure loss superstorm sandy 30% new york alone. see lloyd’s london (2014), “catastrophe model climate change”. 3 a describe prudential regulation authority, (2015), “the impact climate change uk insurance sector”. 2 bi central bankers’ speech which warren buffett observe climate change threat berkshire hathaway’s insurance business.4 insurer update model constantly adjust coverage prudently. and time, grow swathe economy could become uninsurable absent public backstop – hardly prescription grow business.5 moreover, coverage maintained, broad financial system would become increasingly expose large variable physical risks. with motif global citizen sharpen commercial concerns, insurer great incentive understand tackle climate change short term. for example, lloyd’s london underwriter require consider climate change explicitly business plan underwrite models. their genius recognise past prologue catastrophic norm future tail risk today. with insights, perhaps surprise insurance sector particularly active organise address existential issues.6 the second channel concern liability risks. these stem party suffer loss effect climate change seek compensation hold responsible. such claim could arise well future, science evidence climate change hardens, though already take action company grind failure disclose risk pose business model climate change.7 the final important channel involve transition risks, could result adjustment towards lower-carbon economy. change policy, technology physical risk could prompt reassessment value large range asset cost opportunity become apparent. the speed re-pricing occur uncertain could decisive financial stability. there already high profile example jump-to-distress price shift environmental policy performance. tonight, i would like discus build new market – climate transition green finance – help resolve tragedy horizon. over past year, focus g20 leader aegis fsb spur important progress. the upcoming german presidency g20 historic chance mainstream climate finance turn risk opportunity. to add impetus, also grow macroeconomic case action. let begin imperative. 4 buffet note “insurance policy customarily write one year repriced annually reflect change exposures. increase possibility loss translate promptly increase premiums”. see:

help push global equilibrium interest rates, ultimately increase global growth. with investment long-term infrastructure asset need quadruple, green investment represent major opportunity long-term investor macroeconomic policymakers seek jump-start growth. for happen, however, green finance cannot conceivably remain niche interest medium term. that’s why, request g20 leaders, authority explore way mobilise private capital green investments. during 2016, china’s g20 presidency, green finance study group (gfsg)25, undertake stocktake institutional market barrier green finance identify way

investments. nonetheless, financial policymakers clear interest ensure financial system resilient transition hasten decisions. our role help develop framework market adjust efficiently. give uncertainty around climate, everyone agree time scale adjustment required. the right information allow sceptic evangelist alike back conviction capital. a market transition two-degree world built. it reveal valuation company produce use fossil fuel might change time. it expose likely future cost business, pay emissions, change process avoid charges, tight regulation. it help smooth price adjustment opinion change, rather concentrate single climate “minsky moment”. and would allow feedback market policymaking, make climate policy bite like monetary policy, policymakers learn markets’ reactions, market internalise policymakers’ objectives, strategy instruments. when rate low, present value future return risk greater. 28 specific issue address include: (i) ensure use proceed clearly

muhammad bin ibrahim: innovative financial inclusion open remark mr muhammad bin ibrahim, governor central bank malaysia (bank negara malaysia), global symposium innovative financial inclusion, kuala lumpur, 21 september 2016. * * * while global economy still recover global financial crisis, focus boost global growth never eclipse financial inclusion agenda. in fact, policymakers continue recognise importance financial inclusion accord global priority address widen income inequality gap, promote economic empowerment protection low income household smes unlock growth potential fast-expanding middle class population. expand opportunity save securely, invest productive activity protect unforeseen shocks, would meet need underserved. this would drive domestic demand, key engine growth many economies. between 2011 2014, world bank estimate 500 million people gain access formal financial service first time. if effort continue, way assist remain 2 billion adult remain financially excluded. a succession technology breakthrough combine ubiquity mobile device present significant opportunity scale financial inclusion unprecedented level. beyond socio-economic demands, moral obligation u help million still live abject poverty highly vulnerable financial hardship, mean change circumstances. this global symposium present opportunity u explore solution different perspectives. i see “an eye innovation”. indeed policy maker improve capability technology innovation, recruit talent, establish dedicate team intensify partnership private sector, help see thing little differently. while shortage idea new innovative way increase financial inclusion, key challenge mind ability scale achieve sustainability. the symposium’s theme refer “harnessing innovation”, one need truly understand innovation order successfully tap innovation attain dual objective scale sustainability inclusive finance. with view, remark morning focus three area eye innovation needed: a. first, put new lens spot opportunity exist innovation tailor financial inclusion; b. second, identify work blind spot drive efficiency gain technology-enabled financial inclusion; c. third, clear picture policymakers’ role promote enable environment financial innovation technology. put new lens: exploit mainstream innovation financial inclusion focus today, financial innovation penetrated, continue permeate almost every aspect financial activity. this drive fast compute speed, low cost storage fast problem-solving capabilities. 2 bi central bankers’ speech technology use financial institution improve operation – improve customer experience construct good model manage risk efficiently effectively. in many cases, strategic partnership fintech company establish achieve similar outcomes. the advent robo-advisers algorithmic underwrite examples. these development largely evolve within mainstream customer segment prove effective. clearly, opportunity exist leverage capability already place create specific application financial inclusion. with prove application, prospect achieve great scalability, fast time market increase take-up correspondingly greater. for years, financial institution invest heavily technology help improve collection mine financial non-financial data gain rich insight customer preference behaviours. these capability create immediate opportunity identify specific barrier financial inclusion different target group whose need shape different priorities, experiences, value norms. for example, cultural bias important factor fully appreciate understand factor limit high level financial inclusion among women. among low income groups, granular level analysis income pattern need structure solution address irregularity loan repayments. financial inclusion age population another critical area require understanding. it important new products, delivery channel technology also work well senior citizen financially excluded. many financial product service offer today age limit create barrier access financial services. this ought change ensure inclusive financial system age population segment. technology enable good data collection analytics support deep research fill gap mitigate risk provider financial solutions. beyond data applications, opportunity exist areas. for example, distribute ledger technology eliminate need centralise transaction validation shorten settlement chain, effectively low cost real-time remittances. by incorporate adequate know-your-customer (kyc) requirements, distribute ledger potential address de-risking. robo-advisers could potentially adapt increase financial literacy support customer le accessible locations. the adoption open application interface (api) facilitate share environment whereby improvement build exist innovation could shorten time market offerings. these hint many example examined. what need rethink today’s promise financial innovation application new gain financial inclusion. or put another way, need look innovative financial inclusion, inclusive financial innovation! identify work blind spots: drive efficiency gain promote sustainable financial inclusion the reduction poverty great social empowerment financial inclusion one endure achievement era. build momentum, ambition pursue deep financial inclusion next decade must root deep understand unique circumstance face 2 billion people remain exclude formal financial sector. this involve increase arsenal financial inclusion tool overcome geographical cultural barrier deliver meaningful financial service segment. ultimately, provision financial service underserved unbanked must economically viable providers. in aspect, smart usage technology game changer low cost financial intermediation. bi central bankers’ speech 3 this turn unlock opportunity progress single, narrowly-focused product typically offer traditional financial institution today, broad range relevant product service tailor underserved segments. the ability clearly demonstrate consistently track efficiency gain time attract provider space, drive continuous efficiency improvement deliver financial service underserved. great stride make develop good measure financial inclusion. we move beyond measure access, include measure usage quality financial inclusion services. we need go include measurement efficiently increase financial inclusion. such measure exist widely, all, yet systematically propagated. this blind spot ignore one important aspect innovative strategy financial inclusion, potential drive cost deliver financial inclusion initiatives. a framework evaluate financial inclusion efficiency provide powerful incentive harness technology optimal way. this drive low cost deliver inclusive financial service time, thereby enhance viability government private actors. sustainability also call strengthen financial institution provide service low-income vulnerable groups. the misconduct underperformance institution disproportionate impact poor simply low buffers. it also significantly set back financial inclusion effort entrench mistrust formal financial institutions. it therefore, critical institution exemplify strong socially responsible corporate governance, appropriate technical expertise enable expand product offerings, increase outreach develop alternative delivery channels. they must also adept identify manage financial operational risk inherent business models. this require investment system development talent deep knowledge within institutions. only then, financial institution expect support low income vulnerable segment community long-term partner create opportunity improve lives. a clear picture policymakers’ role promote enable environment financial innovation technology finally, policymakers play meaningful role promote enable environment innovation support financial inclusion initiatives. i shall focus three areas. first, regulation aim technology-neutral outcome-focused, proportionate risk harmonize across sectors. a technology-neutral approach allow policymakers ass merit innovation base outcomes, without fear favour underlie technology. regulation proportionate risk product institution present broad financial system. this require continue effort strengthen capacity among national regulator supervisor ass benefit cost regulation. only really move proportionality concept practice. regulation different sector also harmonise focus activity regulated, rather institution conduct activities. for example, e-commerce platform collects, pay interest mobilise deposits, bank license may necessary public interest involved. second, communicate clear expectation market incorporate feedback engagement private sector important. country australia, hong kong, uae, uk, singapore, malaysia issue discussion papers, introduce sandbox approach allow fintech solution test control environment, appropriate risk mitigation place. 4 bi central bankers’ speech dedicate resource allocate collaborate private sector innovator ass feasibility technology. jointly, effort serve build public-private consensus deploy financial technology, by: a. convey national-level support fintech innovation place customer firmly centre; b. provide clarity public applicability regulation fintech solutions; c. support regulator supervisor understand underlie technology function, well benefit risks. third, important address role government national financial inclusion strategies. this particularly relevant encourage e-payments key lever expand outreach formal financial services. a clear commitment government secure political capital need create infrastructure policy accelerate financial inclusion unique identifier mandatory electronic g2p payments. policymakers also seek opportunity promote interoperability support infrastructure new financial innovations. this preserve healthy competition strong

mr stephen s poloz, governor bank canada, association de économistes québécois, cercle finance du québec cfa québec, québec, québec, 20 september 2016. * * * i would like thank anthony landry help prepare speech. introduction it often i get speak room full economist and, believe not, i consider privilege. people say economist never agree anything, i suspect agree least one thing. what number one issue people ask economist today? it ultra-low interest rates. you probably get question sides, i do. young folk mortgage regularly thank keep interest rate low. when i think much cumulative interest i pay lifetime, wonder grateful. but i also hear people, especially retirees, unhappy save whole life get little income save today. now, natural give central bank credit – blame – ultra-low interest rates. low rate u since global financial crisis. the g7 central bank implement coordinate interest rate cut 2008 – sign serious situation was. some hardest-hit economies, unite states, europe japan, implement unconventional policy ease monetary condition further. without efforts, global economy could fall second great depression. we avoid fate. but since time, policy rate generally remain extremely low, mainly economic headwind crisis create slow fade. some central bank even go negative interest rates, bizarre concept many, bond yield across curve also ultra-low. in fact, us$10 trillion government debt currently trade negative yield. a economists, though, also agree much monetary policy. there big, long-term, global force act interest rates, people need understand better. senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins speak topic last week london, focus implication financial stability. today, i’m go focus macroeconomic monetary policy aspect ultra-low rate conclude think policy fit matter. force act a economists, naturally think nominal interest rate combination expect inflation real interest rate. under canada’s inflation-targeting regime, inflation expectation well anchored, even global financial crisis subsequent recession. it follow decline real interest rate issue hand, drop real neutral rate big part this. the real neutral rate theoretical concept can’t directly measured, central bank don’t control it. but extremely important understand: inflation-adjusted risk-free interest rate economy – real interest rate neither stimulative contractionary economy operate full capacity without cyclical force play, thus balance desire save investment. presently, bank staff estimate real neutral rate fall range 0.75–1.75 per cent, translate range 2 bi central bankers’ speech nominal neutral rate 2.75–3.75 per cent. this range 4.50–5.50 per cent pre-crisis period. the important force push neutral rate steady decline potential growth rate economy. in turn, decline drive primarily age population, slow rate growth labour force. in effect, baby boomer boost potential economic growth significantly, start 1960s. since force place 50 years, easy think boost last forever. but demographic sense, temporary. those folk enter retirement past years, potential economic growth slow direct result. there force acting, course, include rise global save rate develop country grow represent big share global gdp. at time, global investment spend moderated, part low potential economic growth; firm need invest le past sustain low potential output. technological change also play role. but combination high save low investment mean price borrow save order invest – neutral interest rate – grind even lower. today, force seem permanent people, course nothing really permanent. just 50-year boost potential growth cause baby boomer ending, force act today unwind eventually. put simply, we’re deal low longer, low forever. even so, process act slowly must adapt today. we cannot sit back wait slow-moving force reverse. people companies, investor savers, need understand force make adjustments. low long saver one group certainly affect low long savers, particularly senior plan finance retirement interest income generate life work hard build savings. i hear many canadian rightly worry ability live save seek return high interest rates. i certainly sympathize understand concerns. demographic economic changes, along low interest rate follow financial crisis, upend calculation many canadian make plan retirement. that fault. but heart discussion level real rate interest. have high nominal interest rate high inflation would help savers, high inflation would erode future purchase power savings. maintain low-inflation environment bank’s primary goal. we we’ve see best way help bring solid, sustainable economic growth. that growth benefit everyone, business owner look expand, worker look employment, saver look protect save find investment opportunities. in recent monetary policy report, july, say current policy rate set 0.5 per cent consistent economy return full capacity toward end 2017 inflation return sustainably target. we’ll update forecast next month, decision september 7, indicate risk project inflation profile tilt somewhat downside follow recent data investment unite state canada, recent data exports. it quite evident economy still face strong headwinds, need stimulative monetary policy counteract move u close full capacity. we also need watch full effect government’s fiscal stimulus unfold. bi central bankers’ speech 3 however, decline real neutral rate mean give set policy rate le stimulative today decade two ago. the current policy rate, certainly provide monetary stimulus, stimulative would crisis. by token, immediate rise policy rate back to, example, 4.25 per cent prevail financial crisis would represent extreme tighten policy would significant consequences. this another way say low interest rate actually big effect today, headwind push back stimulus remain quite powerful. for savers, ultra-low interest rate positive effects. in particular, value asset rise interest rate decline, support gain household wealth. this effect may obvious impact low rate savings. but low interest rate generally mean high stock bond prices, well increase value real estate, another important source wealth many savers, particularly seniors. i realize may cold comfort people adjust retirement plan lower-for-longer world. but difficult reality saver must adjust plans. that may mean combination put aside funds, work little long plan change mix investments. there easy answers, particularly already retired. compound challenge fact people live long – life expectancy rise 6 year since early 1980s. i hope agree unambiguously good news. but combine long life expectancy low interest rate mean person start save today would set aside much generate retirement income person begin save 25 year ago, wish retire age. low long company the group i would like talk today company and, specifically, decision business investment. across global economy, investment spend fell sharply financial crisis, recovery unexpectedly weak. the recent drop oil commodity price low investment plan even further. when investment slows, mean economy’s potential output also grow slowly, reinforce trend toward low interest rates. in contrast, raise potential output increase investment ease downward pressure global rates. with interest rate low been, cost capital certainly problem well-established businesses. but economists, know credit provision always le perfect financial system own. and risk change global bank regulation, design make system safer, could worsen imperfections. put another way, likely finance gap continue exist – could easily increase importance – new young businesses, small medium-sized enterprises, trade finance infrastructure. give importance young company growth stage business cycle, bank monitor data company formation credit flow carefully. still, see number firm canada’s non-resource sector operate close full capacity. under normal circumstances, would expect investment intention rising, far really case. research do bank canada elsewhere, include conversation business leaders, suggest main cause weak investment high level uncertainty company facing, particularly future demand prospects. 4 bi central bankers’ speech and understandable business would uncertain. company live daunt experience financial crisis great recession. on top that, sort economic geopolitical uncertainty across global economy. in atmosphere, it’s surprise business leader would reluctant commit major new investments. however, conversation canadian firm i pick another possible investment impediment – hurdle rate new investment seem adjust new reality. the hurdle rate low acceptable rate return company choose investment proceed. generally, calculate hurdle rate add together risk-free interest rate, measure inflation expectation life project premium compensate investment’s risk. because risk-free interest rate closely relate real neutral rate, real neutral rate declining, follow hurdle rate also lower, else equal. i business leader tell surprise see, example, company asia pursue investment implicit return around 3 4 per cent, well companies’ hurdle rates. my response say current prospective environment, 4 per cent probably turn pretty good return. if uncertainty main impediment investment decisions, subside time economy heal, improve investment climate. but company maintain traditional hurdle rates, unlikely invest time soon, see kind growth, productivity job creation look for. and neither companies. policy prescription so far, we’ve talk adjustment need response powerful, slow-moving global forces. we know force reduce real neutral interest rate canada keep growth potential output around 1.5 per cent next number years. in context, increase potential output growth even tenth percentage point would make important difference issue i speak today. raise potential output growth would boost real neutral rate interest long-term interest rates, would increase return investment saver company alike. so policy would boost potential output – sum labour force growth productivity growth – need pursue them. fortunately, many thing collectively do. the g20 discuss time, describe third leg policy stool – structural reform complement monetary fiscal policies. here canada, one way forward identify remove impediment business growth. for example, new young firm often one improve economy’s productivity, create new job raise potential output. so need make sure tax immigration policies, well ability finance growth young firms, enable be, nurture firm see flourish right here. one important impediment business growth widely share globally weak infrastructure. we know infrastructure project spur growth short term boost demand. more importantly, infrastructure project support long-term growth raise economy’s potential output. among economists, debate size impact potential output infrastructure project deliver. deputy governor sylvain leduc research time federal reserve bank san francisco. the research bi central bankers’ speech 5 show that, within six eight years, u government spend highway project deliver least one dollar, possibly two three dollars, increase output every dollar spent. it would helpful research fiscal multiplier infrastructure spend canada. but seem likely well-targeted infrastructure investment yield economic growth first infusion cash enable growth occur future. another key avenue share economy trade liberalization. we need encourage this, within canada internationally, since world seem enter phase doubt benefit international trade. beyond rhetoric, future trans-pacific partnership (tpp) come question, trade agreement canada european union, much advanced, still must go long ratification process. we know history slide protectionism would highly counterproductive. it important authority continually make case free trade. here home, announcement summer preliminary agreement interprovincial free trade certainly welcome. there many indication interprovincial barrier hold back growth individual company economy whole. it also important recognize understand reason behind rise anti-globalization sentiment. for example, people affect restructure bring globalization often face difficult adjustments, include retrain move long distances. policy-makers need sensitive difficulty facilitate adjustments. at time, role economist compel research remind people impact trade. increase trade positive-sum game. companies, too, could demonstrate globalization make kind good service widely available low cost, important trade employees. make infrastructure investments, defend exist trade arrangement pursue new one certainly good candidate boost canada’s economic potential. but move theory practice, big effect be? well, bear mind start analysis projection canada’s economic potential likely grow around 1.5 per cent, inspiring, need take every decimal point potential growth seriously past. now, none structural initiative i’ve mention silver bullet itself. but together, could make large difference long-term economic prospects. let’s consider possibility light exist empirical evidence. begin removal interprovincial trade barriers. conservative estimate suggest remove interprovincial trade barrier could add one- two-tenths percentage point canada’s potential output annually. some estimate far larger. a international trade, research conduct world bank elsewhere suggest tpp could add one- two-tenths potential output growth. the canada–eu trade agreement also boost potential, though estimate suggest le tpp. in low-growth world, three initiative take together could significant impact economic growth, year year. now, let’s add impact target infrastructure spending. a prudent estimate could add another tenth two percentage point potential output medium term. when consider benefit policy would add years, you’ll see every decimal point counts. a reasonable estimate policy could raise level real gdp 3 5 per cent 2025, would mean $100 billion income canadian every year. in lower-for-longer world, opportunity 6 bi central bankers’ speech simply cannot afford miss. this especially true country sit still – words, could actually lose grind country become competitive, fail take structural opportunity might still mean erosion status quo. conclusion it’s time conclude. what i’ve try today clear force bring period ultra-low interest rate help identify implications. while monetary policy action play role decline interest rates, bank set policy rate meet primary mission: return inflation sustainably target, thus help get economy back full output. in sense, ultra-low interest rate symptom condition face, condition believe improve time. but force lead low interest rate persist long time, need prepare low longer. individual need plan retirement different assumption longevity, interest rate growth. business need make sure expectation investment return reflect current likely future reality reconfigure investment plan accordingly. and policy-makers need make sure work increase economy’s potential output reduce uncertainty – whether economic, political regulatory – may hold back investment. what bank can, will, continue provide certainty future value money inflation control. together, make necessary adjustment boost confidence foster economic growth want see.

d’italia-omfif main meet rome (italy) 22 september 2016. disclaimer: view express speech personal view necessarily reflectthose institution i affiliate with.ladies gentlemen,it great honour take part distinguish panel. on importantmatter implication uk vote leave eu, i would like focus couple issues:firstly, potential effect brexit dynamic european integration indeed offera southern point view and, particularly, make five point south brexitvote. secondly, i examine implication brexit central bank term ofmonetary policy, include ecb.1. a southern view on brexit’s implication for the eu the european union currently face crisis multiple front (anaemic growth, highunemployment, persistently low inflation close deflation, debt crisis, ongoing migrantcrisis), brexit represent big medium- long-term challenge all. point number 1: a deep look european failure influence brexitvote euroscepticism strong sentiment europe. populist, authoritarian party ingovernment rule coalition nine (9) country eu. this alarm figure.referendums italy hungary, national election next year netherlands, czechrepublic, france germany, expect reinforce eurosceptic mood. eurocratsshould take note reality. beyond obvious economic concern trigger uk vote leave eu, everyoneagrees eu need address issue democratic deficit accountability. this isobviously resolve european parliament maintain two seats: real seat inbrussels symbolic seat strasbourg, cost eu, thus european taxpayers, €114million per year. the eu perceive sclerotic costly organisation fail adapt tothe change circumstance world rapid upheavals. at time, persistent austeritypolicies – quite often ill-designed – adopt southern european country increase therejection european project even country greece even italy, hadalways pro-integration public opinion always favour eu.in addition, long argue european union remain ‘market without state’.this quote perhaps summarise debate european integration last 40 year atleast. the frequent complaint regard way eu work govern anelite unelected technocrat several independent european institution body 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech (including ecb). in light issue democratic deficit accountability, european increasinglydisenchanted eu, show rise populist, authoritarian parties. support forpopulist political party eurosceptic credential rising, is, party bynature eurosceptic le orient towards reforms, course south badlyneeds. a result, major downside risk debt sustainability part euroarea. point number 2: mushroom referendum political contagion for continental europe, brexit represent shock institution norm underpinmarkets, albeit different euro break-up fear 2012, global financial crisis 2008or burst high-tech bubble 2001. the origin previous financial crisis belocated multiple factor link financial system economic cycle,respectively: imbalance trade capital flow eu member states; combination ofdecades-long excessive borrowing, risky investments, lack transparency financialsector; speculative mania around share so-called “dot-com” company thesubsequent collapse speculative bubble. the risk financial contagion, like 1998.instead, represent contagious political development. no matter whether full-blownor light brexit, political risk continent referendum may mushroom acrosseurope tug-of-war populist force political establishment elites. brexithas potential unleash centrifugal forces, lead perhaps breakup euro,especially referendum hold time major eurozone country. perhapssuch referendum likely southern eurozone country. of course, democracy foundation civilisation, sometimes even well-intentioned initiative produce unintentional consequence (as see ukvote). the public europe (but also side little pond) seem lostconfidence political economic establishment come visionary solution thatare also pragmatic improve thing people. in 2017 celebrate 60 year european integration. europe emerge astandard-bearer freedom, democracy, rule law. so complacent aboutpopulist party use refugee issue key fear factor european voter turn itinto major campaign theme tell eu keep migration human right issues. it isparticularly worry see member state government turn eu enemy fordomestic purposes. the agreed-upon migrant relocation scheme found solidarity, thevery basic principle european integration help eu become major tradingbloc around world become. point number 3: duality way forward eu the theoretical debate eu’s post-brexit future see three predominant scenarios:an eu fall apart/disappears, unchanged eu continue muddle try tocope underlie problem eu integrate further, least memberstates move forward, others choose stay back. one idea circulate lot inthe context brexit debate – i concur – balance national sovereigntyand european solidarity prosperity may find duality, i.e. two “europes” coexist abroad european construct, independently one another. one would political union(either take form federal state confederation nations) complete emu andbeyond, vision eu’s found father (jean monnet, robert schuman, altierospinelli). the would base market liberalisation, form out rim neweuropean construct, britain could obviously play lead role, wishes. 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech for southern european country course, 1-billion-dollar question following: thisdual architecture become reality eu (definitely likely german elections)will south europe part “new eurozone” [a proper fiscal union, bank union ,a defence political union], leave behind secondary, out circle countries?this something i would like speculate today, frank notever! but it’s matter wishful thinking, it’s matter tough realism. point number 4: coup d’état turkey – migrant crisis clearly, brexit issue whole europe southern europe immune theimplications brexit, instance tourism, external demand, etc. however, comingfrom one country locate eu’s external border, receive massiveinfluxes refugee war-torn country syria (we see picture ofboats wash ashore lampedusa, gibraltar, greek island northern aegean), itwould rather omission behalf discus urgent problem southerneuropean country right now, escalate next 6-12 month may affect therest eu eventually present existential threat european union itself. migrationneeds recognise major policy issue play critical role shape eu’sfuture definitely issue underestimated. we see lastfortnight’s election result berlin three week ago german chancellor’s ownconstituency (mecklenburg-vorpommern) anti-immigration, right-wing (afd) party gainingsignificant ground. it urgent tackle migrant crisis link labour mobility issue. i particularly worry recent development turkey follow attempt coup andthe impact migrant crisis, major challenge eu’s future. againstthe backdrop escalate migrant crisis, un declaration adopt two week ago newyork call equitable share burden host world’s migrant andrefugees become even relevant. take, instance, recent eu deal turkey, whichhas promise accept migrant back territory exchange financial aid. that wasbased premise turkey safe country refugees. lot international analystscast doubt late bout political instability heavy crack-down onsuspected dissident military, judiciary even higher-education neighbouringcountry.point number 5: the british reform benchmark follow south-eastern europe despite brexit, uk could use reform benchmark south-eastern european statesto emulate number ways. accord oecd, uk least regulatedlabour market second netherlands least regulate product market europe.the uk also low taxation (a corporate tax rate 20% speculation willgo 15% incentive foreign firm stay britain brexit). south european country would stand gain lot start resemble britain number ofareas, include attraction fdi, public sector accounting, transparency, rule law andstrong institution include efficient public administration plus credible government financialmanagement. this agenda whole south europe year come,with without adjustment programmes, namely use uk benchmark, except one thing:brexit! 2. implication of brexit for central banksa. le (?) monetary policy divergencethe brexit vote trigger broad-based reassessment future path monetary policyglobally. with improve headline growth still perceive fragile advance economies,and inflation still persistently low, distinct response major

president mario draghi , say recently: “[lowinterest rates]… problem. they symptom underlie problem, isinsufficient investment demand, across world, absorb save available theeconomy.” along line previous caveat president draghi, one could add, forinstance, country fiscal space, and/or eurozone-wide level, extra spend oninfrastructure investment especially today’s environment extremely low long-term rateswould clearly increase low demand eurozone, enhance potential trend growth rate,make task monetary policy much easy finally contribute public debt sustainability inmany countries. in words, time come use policy tool monetarypolicy, include fiscal structural ones. thank much attention.a detail account find haba-new york speech (october 2016).1 5 / 5bis central bankers' speech 1 bank uganda remark prof. emmanuel tumusiime-mutebile governor, bank uganda uganda banker’s association informal dinner piato restaurant 2nd december, 2016 2 good even lady gentlemen, thank come even informal uba dinner. i speak last week institute bank financial service annual bank dinner current challenge face bank industry. tonight i would like make brief remark current macroeconomic situation prospects, notably regard economic growth, exchange rate inflation. real economic growth, last five years, average five percent per annum. this likely close economy’s sustainable potential growth rate, give growth labour force, capital stock productivity. in last fiscal year, end june 2016, real gdp growth 4.8 percent, slightly potential, far recession people claimed, although i appreciate trade condition difficult many businesses. 3 there factor probably depress economic growth fy 2015/16, increase market interest rates, exchange rate volatility first half fiscal year election third quarter. without election, probably low interest rate hopefully le volatile exchange rate (although hard predict) i would expect condition current fiscal year conducive growth i would expect experience small rise real gdp growth, five percent even slightly higher. let turn exchange rate, depreciate recent weeks, long period – nearly 11 month – stability. against u dollar, shill depreciate 4.7 percent since end october. however, half depreciation attributable strengthen u dollar major currency since presidential election us, lead expectation high interest rate country. 4 my staff calculate index uganda shill weight basket uganda’s trade partners. this index – call nominal effective exchange rate index – depreciate 2.3 percent since end october. furthermore, nominal depreciation exchange rate necessary ensure uganda remain competitive trade partners. our exchange rate policy, entail flexible, market determine exchange rate, motivate need ensure balance payment sustainable. our intervention foreign exchange market, carry last week, intend dampen volatility exchange rate, impede adjustment exchange rate necessary maintain external balance. finally, i want address issue inflation. the outturn inflation 2016 good fear would time last year, inflationary pressure build up. annual core inflation decline first half 2016 last four month settle average approximately 5 percent, line policy target inflation. 5 the good expect inflation outturn 2016 attributable combination tighten monetary policy bou mid 2015, raise interest rates, relatively stable exchange rate since october last year. when look core inflation outturn long horizon, see close policy target. over last four years, annual inflation sometimes 5 percent sometimes below, average 4.9 percent. i hope agree demonstrate effectiveness inflation target monetary policy framework. to conclude, lady gentlemen, i believe prospect macroeconomic stability near medium term currently good. in 2017 look forward real gdp growth close economy’s medium term potential growth around 5 percent per annum. with inflationary pressure firmly control also confident annual core inflation continue trend around medium term target 5 percent. thank listening. collegio carlo albertouniversità degli studi di torinoeconomic challenge face europe worldpanel discussion deputy governor bank italyluigi federico signorinimoncalieri, 19 december 2016 germany italy call chair g20 g7 economically politically turbulent times, world large well common european home. several year road, legacy global financial crisis sovereign crisis euro area still apparent. sluggish growth, high private public debt, unemployment underemployment, well general sense disillusionment among broad swathe population affect many country vary extents. these fact feel also engender widespread ‘anti-globalization’ sentiment, well doubt european project. this reaction deep-rooted cause i shall spend word late first all, let point one compel reason coordination german italian presidency important. we must exploit synergy join effort reach broad possible consensus among advance emerge economies, take action stem i see potentially dangerous spiral rise disaffection protectionism. the italian presidency continue work past g7s well-known areas, combat money launder terrorist financing, foster international cooperation among tax authority enhance cyber security (the latter increasingly press issue today’s global agenda). but also intention promote open-minded broad debate two issue go way address concern i mention earlier. the first issue, financial regulation, centre agenda since outbreak global financial crisis, g20 technical body take task redesign financial sector regulation avert similar shock future. the past year see comprehensive, radical overhaul financial regulation. it seem reasonable step back moment look big picture. have do enough? or possible even much? the re-regulation bank system certainly necessary, timely, – within limit human fallibility – i believe do lot make bank safer. but need know stop, least time. we need, first, give minimum stability regulatory framework; second, take stock work do gain experience evaluate longer-term effects; third, perhaps importantly, strike balance secure financial system avoid rule would overly penalize risk-taking, without growth possible. at begin year group central bank governor head supervision g20 instruct basel committee refrain ‘significantly increase overall capital requirements’1 stage. the basel 3 package currently finalise premise. while agreement yet assured, i think close. let take opportunity say firm view agreement necessary give certainty financial world. the condition miss opportunity. assume agreement reached, field bank regulation next year devote maintain regulatory system, overhaul radically again; also need review rules, check embed procyclicality unintended consequences, rather establish capital requirements. effort limit bank risks, however, part answer. the financial landscape change apace. the growth intermediary outside bank sector point need new micro- macro-prudential tools. work begin area much remain done. furthermore, host innovation (digital currencies, distribute ledgers, peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, name few) open new frontier financial service start blur boundary financial sector itself. there great potential financial inclusion efficiency gain here, also implication monetary operation transmission, well new risk stability, integrity, end-user protection. this raise issue 1 group central bank governor head supervision (10 january 2016); stefan ingves, chairman basel committee, recently noted, must one frequently cite phrase regulation debate days. 4 perimeter financial regulation appropriate regulatory policy measures. the fsb various standard-setting body already conduct broad discussion general theme like definitions, opportunity risks; time turn discuss concrete policy questions. a key point stage decide require swift international coordination, best left, least now, jurisdiction-level experimentation. the g7 g20 key role steer process finalise post-crisis financial regulation. the second issue italian presidency intend move forward inclusive growth. here, too, need interaction g7 g20, least economic social marginalization concern advance emerge economy alike. inequality new subject acquire top priority g7 agenda, forefront political debate. it causes, trend political consequence discuss daily medium become popular topic economic research well. let first state one fact easily forgotten. globalization enormous driver growth emerge countries, include two large country world. it thus reduce overall world inequality. it lift millions, indeed hundred millions, poverty. at time, inequality within country increased. this obvious number emerge economies. but advance economy too, benefit globalisation equally distributed. growth subdue emerge economies; income median household many country stagnate past decades; middle classes’ perception future worsened. while fact le universally true, cause effect differ somewhat across countries. in italy, example, recession severe protract advance economies, young 5 generation hit hardest, high (though decreasing) rate unemployment, great risk poverty, reduce income career opportunities. in event, perception need counter rise inequality mitigate consequence widespread. policy option deal fact focus discussion propose stimulate within g7 g20. however, one aware perception economic unfairness concern diminish lifetime prospects, important, hardly whole story; dissatisfaction disillusionment societies, grow diffidence towards international supranational institutions, likely broad causes. in words, perception something go wrong extend beyond loser globalization (as analysis vote u.s u.k. suggested)2, comprise range country different trend growth inequality. this certainly right occasion, i right person, propose exhaustive analysis extremely complex phenomenon. the question ultimately ‘lies behind it’, lead, broad question, must leave future historians. many factor surely play; entail opportunity risks. let briefly allude two points. first, fact long world dominate clash oppose blocks, long-standing ideology offer general

(umberto eco, pass away early year, would put strongly). in ideology-free world, may lead uninformed policy discussions. free, unfettered debate blessing; lack reality check not. the reason i mention i want devote second part speech europe, attitude towards european project, certainly suffer result mood disaffection exacerbate localism. consensus around europe, strong country italy germany, long take granted. people start question for, them. the issue ultimate goal european integration remain much one belief identity i shall discus (though i shan’t resist confess end). regardless preferences, take give considerable degree integration already achieved, fair ask whether european institution actually serve purpose reasonably well, do improve work. while disaffection europe’s citizen may well general origins, cannot address without first answer question. there many way so, let propose institutional perspective which, i believe, implication tend go largely unnoticed far inconsequential. if look architecture european union, possible observe bear close resemblance ‘normal’ constitution far parliament judiciary concerned, executive branch. today eu elect parliament central institutional role; co-decides legislation, mostly par council; budgetary 7 oversight powers; short, though within narrow mandate, status, composition power largely comparable parliament democratic polity. the union also judicial system ensure uniform interpretation application eu law. while make-up constituent court somewhat unique, rule obviously confine matter treaty assign union, attribution actual function european court justice akin ultimate court appeal constitutional court many democracies. the executive function, extent concept apply europe, unusual. the eu unique position two institutional branch power political direction, council commission, different composition source legitimacy. moreover, branch exercise different function beyond typical governments. the european council, make head government member states, provide ‘impetus’ and, rather vaguely define practically important way, set policy agenda. it maximum influence foreign security matters. at time, national governments, represent low level council eu, also play key role legislative process. the european commission, hand, currently resemble many way government parliamentary system. the commission’s president, propose council, must survive vote parliament; commission member require parliament’s consent. this nominal: 2014 elections, parliament make clear would vote nominee except spitzenkandidat party get votes. like normal government, commission manage implement eu policy budget, represent union outside europe. but lack clear ultimate power direction. at time, certain field respect general function ‘custodian treaties’, commission play role would typically belong domain independent, quasi-judicial regulatory authorities, example enforce competition rules. a executive body, essentially political; 8 technical authority, bind objectivity independence. the two square well: make discretionary policy choice impartially enforce technical rule thing. i would also mention pass complexity heighten distinction eu euro area, latter euro summit agenda-setting eurogroup coordinate role. why i mention this? because, regardless one think move full political union, amount sovereignty already pool european level, especially economic financial matters, substantial. when europe mostly thing like fish quota agricultural prices, important matter are, one could le live suboptimal arrangement. now key role certain issue go heart political debate country, budget balance financial stability, long case. the issue proper executive must addressed. the lack conventional executive branch parallel lack instrument typically available government. on eve single currency tommaso padoa-schioppa note union’s ‘capability macroeconomic policy is, exception monetary field, embryonic unbalanced: avoid harm (excessive deficits) cannot good (a proper fiscal policy). (…) it thus right applaud yesterday’s step also underline unfinished nature, risk rashness’.4 without clear institutional framework discretionary political action, view massive transfer sovereignty, european economic governance largely base rules: budget rules, ban rescue member countries, rule bank supervision resolution, on. rule necessary, limit achieve. you cannot run large, advanced, diverse economy autopilot. 4 corriere della sera, 3 may, 1998. 9 most transfer sovereignty fiscal financial matter prompt crisis situations. since eruption sovereign debt crisis, emergency measure progressively accompany reform eu governance especially euro area, start enhance public finance rule macroeconomic surveillance. in summer 2012, ‘four presidents’ report’ envisage complement replace national intervention tool common instruments. for banks, report propose transfer supervisory responsibility euro area establish joint crisis resolution deposit guarantee mechanisms, support public fund european stability mechanism (esm). a public finance, addition implement reform already approve (the six pack fiscal compact), propose gradual step towards creation euro-area budget issuance common debt. most proposal take subsequent reports, include ‘five presidents’ report’ june 2015. restriction use national mechanism put place quickly. but introduction european instrument partial virtually non-existent fiscal side. member state constrain rule say cannot done, eu gain power decide done, tool institutional framework implement policy needed. this create situation vulnerability: danger national european authority unable react appropriately shocks. by way example, let’s consider fiscal policy detail. it go without say fiscal rule necessary monetary union. they serve coordination mechanism, ensure national fiscal policy contribute maintain financial stability area. poor compliance fiscal rule period precede crisis justify strengthened. come country high public debt, i especially conscious this. let absolutely clear: bank italy constantly remind italian authority importance fiscal discipline. at parliamentary hear budget plan i fail underline strategic nature objective debt reduction. 10 the issue realistically achieve system base mainly rules. simple rule work well practice. it would unreasonable take decision fiscal stance without consider cyclical situation economy, exceptional circumstances. in absence substantial eu budget, degree flexibility rule constrain national budget unavoidable. thus realism require introduction element flexibility, turn require safeguard fend abuses. with exception counter-exceptions, time fiscal rule application become exceedingly complex. it take specialist navigate various definition objective constraint stability growth pact. certain definitions, like ‘structural’ budget, rely statistic open interpretation debate: many possible measure output gap, instance. waiver exceptional circumstance require, definition, discretionary assessment. the system intricate transparent public, nevertheless, remain incomplete: real world, thing ‘complete contract’. this one case ambivalence commission’s political technical role apparent. there tension impartial, technical, rule-based assessment call perform, multitude real-life circumstance faces, climate discussion often reach heat political temperature. in context commission unavoidably prone accusation arbitrariness. the absence substantial european budget complication stability growth pact interconnected. with fiscal capacity european level, constraint national budget could make simpler. the commission’s recent focus appropriate fiscal stance euro area whole, attempt quantify first time, welcome developments. my point discus whether quantitative assessment correct, subject intense debate. my point stress current decentralize policy setting, implement whatever aggregate fiscal stance one think appropriate difficult, may result suboptimal distribution effort across countries. 11 automatic stabilizer embed common budget, discussion mostly focus far, would partially free national budget pressure arise adverse cyclical conditions. a common budget, however, could also use adopt discretionary measure consistent cyclical condition various economy euro area whole. discretion mean total freedom constraints: introduce national level, constitutional limit spend deficit set european level. it require acknowledge impossible govern public finance rule alone; complete contract exist public finance allow democracy dispense open, transparent debate budget decisions; that, extent spillover common good require imposition significant constraint national budgets, fiscal space must find european level. just clear, common budget future imply mutualisation past debt. that different discussion. no mechanism entail permanent transfer across member states. not would politically unfeasible. my experience regional difference italy tell structural fiscal compensation economic disparity eventually end – entrench them. so, instance, eu-wide automatic stabiliser design geographically neutral long run. the need complement rule constrain local action constitutional capacity act european level could illustrate use several different example besides fiscal budget. bank supervision resolution another obvious example. time constraint prevent go detail this; i leave another occasion. but let briefly say that, bank union progress considerably, must ultimately incorporate element envisage original design: single supervisor, single effective resolution mechanism, pool resource determination use necessary, common deposit insurance scheme, finally european public financial 12 backstop. this require effective european resource decision-making powers, institution act swiftly, boldly freely needed. build capacity act european level, rule constrain national action, require trust institutional foresight. many would say current circumstance make step politically difficult. there question try forge ahead measure many citizen prepare accept. still, i think useful point issue function european institution experience reflection tell important. a europe say ‘no’ consensus winner anyway. i may bias personal lifelong commitment europe. i often tell story two grandfather fight opposite side great war. they might well kill other. they were, however, different fronts, didn’t. that’s i say sometimes europe is, literally, dna. i understand well memory come mean progressively le young generations. but young also seem feel disaffected, estrange ‘establishment’, need clearer, bright long-term prospects. if something seem working, use refrain suggest improvements, one think of. if suggestion merit, time come become feasible. 13 peter praet: interview telegraafinterview mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, inthe telegraaf, conduct mr martin visser m

tropical institute, 10 november 2016 amsterdam, royal tropical institute – innovation finance help africa get world, especially combine strengthen institutions. this message klaas knot convey speech mark open two-day conference “africa works! see full speechl lady gentlemen, i’m delight speak today. how could i be? for one, purpose conference inform, inspire, connect catalyse dutch private sector africa’s business opportunities. this something i wholeheartedly support. for there’s one continent see many change good last two decades, africa! indeed, 16 year ago, the economist portray africa “hopeless continent”, nickname would make every businessman woman hesitant invest. in le one-and-a-half decennium, the economist change mind come pet name “hopeful continent”. what make the economist, like many others, change mind? well, basically two developments, i think. first, economic achievements. the year since turn millennium mark period sustain economic growth african continent. importantly, boom share country africa, except country arm conflict take place. admittedly, large commodity-exporting african countries, nigeria angola, boom drive largely commodity super-cycle. we, netherlands, well aware natural resource mix bless economy. it’s earn phenomenon nickname “dutch disease”!, refer possible decline competitiveness follow appreciation currency discovery natural gas resource north sea. the currently decline economic condition commodity-exporting country seem illustrate “results past guarantee future”. but doesn’t take away fact life many african start change result “african economic boom”, lift million people direct poverty gradually create rise well-educated middle class. and, outlook commodity-exporters may darkened, outlook non-commodity exporter remain bright, growth rate 6 percent country côte d’ivoire, ethiopia, kenya, senegal. the development alter many people’s view africa, political security-related improvements. while africa is, unfortunately, still continent conflict take place, absolute number conflict africa decline past 25 years. many war 1990s ended, despite ongoing intensify conflict north africa middle east, overall africa nowadays seem peaceful early 1990s. moreover, since start millennium democratic governance improve institutional reform take place many countries, low level. at time, business environment take turn better. while start point perhaps le auspicious, encourage see african country benin senegal nowadays often appear among global top 10 reformer world bank’s “ease do business” indicators. due promise developments, africa become region boast strong business opportunities, african entrepreneur foreign ones. also dutch firm increasingly aware opportunities. for instance, nowadays 2,000 dutch firm business africa, range small – mainly trade-oriented – company major dutch company heineken, unilever philips. africa also increasingly important dutch export imports. among 20 important emerge country dutch export destined, 9 situate africa, togo, ghana senegal even top 5. and, accord statistic netherlands, 70 percent import rise come africa, where, way, also dutch rise grower active. certainly, africa work dutch entrepreneurs!the second reason i delight theme conference: innovation finance. in view, well-chosen topic. new technology change life industries. also finance undergo rapid transformation, visibly field payment transfers, also lending, insurance and, importantly, remittances. the advent smart phones, instance, lead development new mobile wallets, make easy “send money home”: goodbye long unsafe travels, hello smart phones! innovation finance offer new opportunity financial sector. this may especially case africa, innovation perhaps le “threat” traditional bank sector “overbanked” europe. but even important view benefit innovation consumer businesses. new technology finance bring choice, low cost great convenience users. this hold advance country well-developed bank sectors, certainly also africa many remote area still many “unbanked” inhabitants. indeed, sustainable prudent development use new technology finance help promote financial inclusion africa. and vital importance. for relationship financial inclusion economic growth clearly establish time again. financial service lifeblood economy. access financial service allow household smooth consumption invest future. for businesses, access credit enable expand create jobs. financial inclusion, short, one key promote strong stable economic growth. innovation finance perhaps promise way advance financial inclusion. that important new technology finance exploit africa, help unlock continent’s massive “unbanked” population. for company involve supply new type service imply continuously need embrace innovative strategies. in way, able shape financial product fit consumers’ rise financial sophistication needs. recent history suggest african company able quite successfully. kenya, instance, lead world innovative financial service base mobile telephony introduce m-pesa m-pesa-derived system m-shwari m-kesho. this make several financial service available anyone mobile phone fraction cost. exploit innovation finance one. strengthen institution other. one fundamental question economic science “why country rich others”? difference quality legal, political educational institution country turn important part answer. indeed, strengthen institution often go hand hand high economic growth: country strong institution experience strong economic growth compare country weak institutions. there several reason turn case. strong institution provide protection property rights; foster contract enforcement; create healthy investment climate help development abilities. this make economic environment individual firm cooperate, everyone’s benefit. and, importantly, environment innovation finance develop thrive. therefore, strong institution enable country realize full benefit innovation finance. research imf world bank show still plenty room africa front. continue effort strengthen institution therefore highly needed. personally, economist, i consider tackle deficiency property right protection key challenge african countries. after all, several study shown, well-defined strongly protect property right go hand hand economic growth development. let conclude. i optimistic africa. innovation finance help africa get world, especially combine strengthen institutions. it go without say also create new opportunity dutch firm entrepreneurs. i hope conference contribute exploit opportunity yet further. i thank attention wish fruitful conference! tharman shanmugaratnam: enterprise technologicalinnovation - improve life

expect grow morethan three time quickly advance economies. 17 in order asia fully reap fruit favourable macro trends, need raisethe need long-term capital sustainable growth, include strengthen bondmarkets. today, i touch three areas: first, new asian bond grant support broaderbase asian issuers; second, effort encourage rat issuances; lastly, supportingsecondary market liquidity. let start first asian bond grant initiative.measures strengthen asia’s bond marketsintroducing asian bond grant18 in many ways, singapore always bridge asia rest world,whether entry point global investor look asia launchpad asiancompanies seek regionalise globalise. we success develop theasian g3 bond market, asian local currency issuance room grow. when i spokehere two year ago integrate asia’s capital markets, context themarkets fragment several dimensions: laws, currencies, market practice well asmarket infrastructure. investor need understand market set law beforeinvesting. likewise, asian company seek raise international capital, top domesticcapital, may need obtain international rat international documentation, theserequire international lawyer accountants, international roadshows. 19 singapore already offer excellent ecosystem financial institutions, professionalservices like legal accounting, credit rat agencies, market infrastructure asiancompanies issue, market, list trade bonds. to make attractive asianissuers raise international capital singapore benefit ecosystem here, willintroduce asian bond grant scheme next year. the scheme aim broaden base ofissuers bond market, add breadth diversity debt instrument the1314 4 / 7bis central bankers' speech invest community. qualify asian issuance able offset 50% one-timeissuance cost international legal fees, arranger fee credit rat fees. we haveconsulted local market participant various aspect scheme ensure smoothimplementation. i glad say industry supportive initiative, andtogether confident enhance singapore’s value proposition.encouraging rat issuances20 even draw asian issuer singapore, want encourage issuer berated. credit rat improve general market transparency provide independent andcomparable assessment credit worthiness issuers. together business andfinancial information provide offer document company announcements, creditratings assist investor good understand issuer’s business financial health. issuer rated, comparison, also gain access broad investor base, manyinstitutional mandate invest rat bonds. to encourage rat issuances, rat issuerswill eligible large grant quantum asian bond grant.21 rat also benefit bond issuers. in singapore dollar bond market, beenencouraging frequent bond issuer obtain credit ratings. the house development board(hdb) example frequent domestic issuer recently obtain rat benefitedfrom tight issuance spreads. about 40% outstanding singapore dollar bond rated,and would like see share go up. to give another boost, consider waysto nurture healthy sustainable credit rat culture bond market. for instance, underthe asian bond grant scheme, singapore dollar bonds, rat issuance would beeligible. another possibility consider help exist issuer offset cost inobtaining credit rating.22 even encourage rat issuances, i must caution base investmentdecisions solely ratings. regardless whether bond rat not, investor need tomake credit assessments. perhaps importantly, say “do put allour egg one basket” goes, key long-term invest diversification avoidingconcentrated exposure one security. this approach inherent way institutionalinvestors manage portfolio – broad diversification across asset classes, sector andsecurities. 23 individual investor build investment portfolio take special care todiversify avoid concentrate exposure one investment issuer. one way forindividual investor gain exposure diversify portfolio bond cost-efficient manneris invest bond funds. ma many year promote development indexbond fund regional markets, asian bond fund (abf) initiative lead theemeap group. today, many offerings, buy soldthrough exchange exchange-traded fund (etfs). we encourage fund manager toincrease number variety bond fund etf available individual investors.supporting secondary market liquidity24 let turn effort primary market secondary market liquidity. market participant generally agree bond market liquidity become challenging. this case globally also singapore. bank continue provide price majority ofbonds issue here, although amount will transact in, may small forweaker credit small issuances.25 a function secondary market critical sustainable growth bond market. todeepen secondary market, ma work industry several initiative overthe years. for example, improve price transparency, collaborate bank serviceproviders, bloomberg markit, make available end-of-day corporate bond price on15 5 / 7bis central bankers' speech platforms. last year, ma launch security repo facility, eligible bankscan borrow certain singapore dollar corporate bond via repo transaction facilitate theirmarket make activities. these effort take time bear fruit. we also engaginginvestors, issuer intermediary ass do facilitate active repomarket whether help deepen liquidity bond markets.26 before i conclude, i address issue default restructure exercise thedomestic bond market recently. these far mostly oil gas sector, andreflects protract weakness sector arise slump energy prices. risingdefaults late part credit cycle difficulty particular sector beexpected, mas’ stress test suggest corporates singapore remain fairly resilient,and banks’ exposure weak issuer likely manageable. the key toensure one diversify portfolio. follow recent restructure defaults, wehave also receive feedback call review regulation market practice aroundthe singapore bond market. some idea include enhance sale practices, recourse forinvestors bond defaults, need credit ratings. we consider thesefeedback respond soon.conclusion27 to sum up, asia’s capital market enjoy good run, owe confluence ofmacroeconomic fundamental policy liberalisation. asifma support journey overthe past ten year improve transparency market surveys, advocate innovativesolutions white paper roadmaps, build consensus best practice throughevents like collaboration industry bodies.28 the economic opportunity asia immense, despite cyclical slowdown, theregion’s finance need continue grow. asia need continue strengthen capitalmarkets, especially bond markets. singapore support asia’s bond market introduce anew asian bond grant scheme, encourage rat issuances, support secondary marketliquidity.29 please enjoy rest conference. thank you.imf world economic outlook, october 2014imf world economic outlook, october 2016dealogic data“learning live

baltimore 2016 midyear commencement baltimore, maryland december 19, 2016 thank you, president schmoke, award opportunity today offer congratulation member class 2016. i would also like recognize vital support student receive family, friends, others, many share great occasion. in moment, i explain i particularly proud honor speak new graduate university, first i’d like address student topic i expect mind many you, job market. the short version i say i expect worker continue face challenge come years, i believe, two reasons, job prospect career opportunity new graduate time good. first, year slow economic recovery, enter strong job market nearly decade. the unemployment rate, 4.6 percent, near recession. this level associate good job opportunities. job creation continue steady pace; layoff rate low; job open past couple years, another sign healthy job market. there also indication wage growth pick up, weekly earn young worker make strong gain past couple years. that probably one reason young worker report feel significantly optimistic job market compare 2013, accord survey publish today federal reserve.1 challenge remain. the economy grow slowly past recoveries, productivity growth, major influence wages, disappointing. 1 see board governor (2016). in survey conduct 2015, 61 percent young adult report feel optimistic job opportunities, compare 45 percent felt way 2013. - 2 - but also look like economic gain past year finally raise live standard people. median household income grow poverty fell significantly 2015, although measure still lag level recession.2 an improve economy may especially important you, new graduates. those graduate enter workforce strong economy likely find employment, remain employed, enjoy persistently high earnings.3 the second reason optimism already do one thing research show important successful stable work life: earn degree receive today. economist certain many things. but quite certain college diploma advance degree key economic success. those college degree likely find job, keep job, high job satisfaction, earn high salary. the advantage earn large. college grads’ annual earn last year were, average, 70 percent high high school diploma. back 1980, difference 20 percent. the gap earn significant year graduation--almost $18,000 year, accord recent data. beyond advantages, research also show college graduate degree typically lead happier, healthier, long life.4 one explanation great advantage recent decade confer high education reflect increase demand educate worker compare 2 for median household income adjust inflation poverty rate, see posey (2016) bishaw glassman (2016). 3 see, example, kahn (2010); oreopoulos, von wachter, heisz (2012); altonji, kahn, speer (2016). 4 for recent estimate college earn premium time, see pew research (2014) council economic adviser (2016). for discussion nonpecuniary benefit complete college, see oreopoulos salvanes (2011). - 3 - others. the driver increase demand college graduate degree likely continue important. let mention two important factors. first, technology. for decades, technological advance increasingly allow simpler, repetitive task do cheaply safely machines. this kind work factories, stores, office often require high school education. at time, technological advance increase demand worker education necessary perform ever-growing share job technology important. more recently, advance automate increasingly complex task allow worker ability flexibility use technology productive. high education also change response, one important thing many learn university baltimore learn, adapt, succeed technology-rich environment workplaces. the second major development job market globalization, allow good service produce wherever economical. offshoring trade profoundly affect u.s. economy. no one know job industry thrive globalization continue affected, i say education earn provide important advantage. like technological change, globalization reinforce shift away lower-skilled job require le education higher-skilled job require college advance degrees. the job globalization create unite states, serve global economy billion people, likely fill who, like you, secure advantage high education. - 4 - while globalization likely continue technology continue advance, don’t know fast economy grow, new technology developed, quickly consistently employment expand. what considerably certain, however, success continue tie education, part good education enhance one’s ability adapt change economy. one reason increase economic advantage college graduate degree slow growth earn last decade high school education. it concern me, concern us, many fall behind. improvement elementary secondary education help prepare people college opportunity college make available, attend college, must find way extend economic opportunity everyone america. in discuss high education, may notice i speak term complete degrees. research show large share benefit i describe high education come graduate. even complete three year college benefit much le don’t get degree.5 for example, may worry pay loan take pay education. the good news vast majority student borrower complete degree find work allow keep payment pay loans. everything i say far could apply graduate year college university. the rest i say you, 2016 graduate 5 for example, see oreopoulos petronijevic (2013) bind turner (2011). - 5 - university baltimore. i learn bite recently, help university’s staff. let tell thing classmate may know. among today full-time student find time semester volunteer non-profit organizations, include one help refugee country find place community. another fellow students, use doubt could ever afford college, become student leader. she make dean’s list every semester transfer community college. like many you, another fellow graduate take day even class balance work family demands. she force change job accommodate schedule. she late decide future lay digital communications, require switch major take require classes. today become first person family graduate college. some bear countries. one live four country come university baltimore master’s degree. many contribute sense community university baltimore actively participate student life. one even decide seek career help student student affair professional. these outstanding people join walk across stage today. let describe one more. to student, sit audience, i would say: deserve tremendous amount credit. base i learned, advantage pave way college graduate school. you overcome obstacle make - 6 - here, obstacle complete degree. one big obstacles, fact, people doubt could would succeed. but others life believe you. some today. they believe you, believe yourself, talent intelligence hard work enable earn degree receive. if sound like you, absolutely right, i describe one member university baltimore’s class 2016--i try describe every one you. in different ways, i expect overcome obstacle demonstrate resilience determination succeed. all gain knowledge use intelligence talent complete degrees. a impress i individual graduate today, i impress achieved. let tell else i learned. more student college universities, i know many deep root city county. many start careers, build lives, raise family here. the challenge overcome challenge face many people baltimore community throughout america. your success, celebrate today, also promise bright future city. the degree work hard earn opportunity open represent stubborn, earnest hope anyone everyone strive succeed still succeed. and i consider rare privilege speak today, great honor associate university baltimore member class 2016. thank you, congratulations. - 7 - reference

review situation financial markets, go talk impact negative interest money capital markets. i finish presentation comment progress make reform benchmark interest rates. situation financial market since last news conference june, movement financial market heavily influence two political events: unexpected outcome brexit vote june u presidential election november. both event generate short-term uncertainty among investors. nevertheless, positive risk sentiment prevail overall. lead equity index us, japan europe record price gain since mid-year (cf. chart 1). in us, key index hit new record high begin december. in switzerland, smi, however, lag behind general trend: currently virtually unchanged mid-year level. the reason index’s strong weight defensive equities, healthcare consumer good sector example. these securities, tend benefit le increase risk appetite among investors, come sell pressure result rise interest rates. on bond markets, high-quality government bond yield climb since mid-year (cf. chart 2a). firstly, economic data bolster investor confidence global economic recovery. secondly, inflation expectation rise steadily – albeit low level – particularly uk u (cf. chart 2b). this trend reinforce outcome u election, fuel expectation expansionary fiscal policy strong increase u government debt. the rise yield also reflect high risk premia cause generally heighten uncertainty surround future course u fiscal monetary policy. berne, 15 december 2016 andréa m. maechler news conference page 2/7 thus, increase yield particularly pronounce us. ten-year u government bond recently stand around 2.5%, 1 percentage point mid-year. by contrast, yield increase japan europe small scale. yield ten-year swiss confederation bond recently stand –0.1%, half percentage point mid-year. approximately 60% outstanding confederation bond currently still generate negative yields, compare around 95% end june. the global rise yield lead reduction share negative-yielding government bond worldwide 30% end june around 20% recently. although trend see step towards normalisation bond markets, important recognise high u yield associate appreciation u dollar could become burden emerge economies. on foreign exchange market, swiss franc come increase upward pressure brief period brexit vote. this pressure abate again, least due swiss national bank’s willingness intervene market. while pound sterling continue lose value summer months, key currencies, include swiss franc, move sideways within narrow range (cf. chart 3). heighten uncertainty run-up u presidential election reflect grow demand safe-haven currency foreign exchange market, lead slightly high swiss franc exchange rates. follow u election, u dollar appreciate broad basis. the strengthen currency occur backdrop rise u interest rate mention earlier. the dollar gain approximately 3% trade-weighted term election. the recent development u also impact currency areas. currency emerge economy particular come pressure and, group, weaken around 4% u dollar. on trade-weighted basis, swiss franc change little end-june level. nevertheless, swiss franc exchange rate move different directions. while appreciate sharply yen euro pound sterling, swiss franc weaken u dollar currency commodity-exporting countries. overall, swiss franc still significantly overvalued. the market environment remain challenge fraught global economic political risks. the snb therefore continue monitor event foreign exchange market closely. impact negative interest money capital market let turn impact negative interest sight deposit snb swiss franc money capital markets. a know, since introduction negative interest rate january 2015, key money market rate three-month libor hovered, intended, around –0.75% (cf. chart 4). the negative interest rate ensure traditional interest rate differential currency least partially restored. on secure money market – repo market – interest rate also stabilise low level. this apply particular saron, reference rate call money. activity berne, 15 december 2016 andréa m. maechler news conference page 3/7 repo market remain unaffected negative interest high level sight deposits. bank insurance company use market short-term liquidity requirement efficient management collateral holdings. the introduction negative interest rate even result increase trade volume repo market (cf. chart 5). one reason repo trade conduct order use exemption thresholds. yield confederation money market debt register claim interbank level (cf. chart 4). this mainly attributable relatively high investor demand safe swiss franc investments. on foreign exchange swap market, currency exchange temporary basis, imply interest rate swiss franc investment lie well –0.75%; apply particular u dollar swaps. the reason abundant swiss franc liquidity well structurally high demand u dollar fund international financial system. these factor lead relative oversupply swiss franc u dollar, depress imply swiss franc interest rate foreign exchange swap market. this make expensive relevant investor hold swiss francs, top negative interest rate –0.75%. yield long-term confederation bond capital market likewise fell substantially follow introduction negative interest rate. the interest rate rise observe since mid-year longer-term security switzerland take place parallel international interest rate developments. since, time, money market rate remain stable, result slightly steep yield curve swiss franc investments, also mirror international developments. overall, negative interest expect impact money capital market make le attractive investor hold swiss franc compare currencies. reform benchmark interest rate to conclude, i would like talk briefly ongoing interest rate benchmark reforms. in 2014, financial stability board (fsb) recommend strengthen exist global interest rate benchmarks, particular libor. it also call development alternative benchmark rates. the snb take active part reform efforts. it represent relevant committee play supportive role participate discussion market participants, well swiss foreign authorities. reform implement international level, particularly far libor concerned. they focus standardise interest rate calculation panel bank make transaction-based. however, volume market segment underlie libor remain low. at national level, main emphasis replacement tois fixing.1 the tois fix panel-based reference interest rate unsecured call money market use 1 tois stand tomorrow/next overnight index swap. berne, 15 december 2016 andréa m. maechler news conference page 4/7 interest rate derivatives. despite extensive reform efforts, stable long-term solution found. underlie trade volume continue low bank unwilling report interest rate conditions. for reason, tois fix abandon end-2017. saron, reference interest rate secure call money, use place. saron launch snb cooperation six 2009. we confident establish key swiss franc reference rate. further work coordinate work group comprise financial sector representatives. key information topic publicly available snb’s website.2 2

worldsummit "partners growth development", athens, 3 november 2016.* * *it great pleasure today opportunity share mythoughts prospect greek economy six year economic adjustment. i willfocus four issues: first, achievement make far difficult year economicadjustment. second, misstep delay adjustment process. third, recentdevelopments future challenge prospects. and fourth, i highlight main reasonswhy greek asset constitute prime investment opportunity. 1. economic adjustment past six yearssince begin sovereign debt crisis, six year ago, greece come long way inadjusting fiscal external imbalance implement bold programme structuralreforms. first, unprecedented fiscal consolidation. the fiscal consolidationeffort contribute improvement general government primary balance apercentage gdp 11 percentage point period 2009–2015, despitethe deepen recession. in fact, period 2013–2015 greece manage maintainsmall primary surplus (as define programme) general government budget forthe first time since 2001. adjust effect recession, improvement the“structural” primary balance period 2009–2015 reach 17 percentage point ofpotential gdp; twice much adjustment member state undereu-imf programmes.second, competitiveness restored. the cumulative loss labour costcompetitiveness vis-à-vis trade partner record 2000 2009 beenfully recovered. this development reflect effect structural reform labour market, allowfor great flexibility wage bargain process, well impact sharp risein unemployment labour costs.third, external adjustment significant. the current account pose smallsurplus 2015 (0.1% gdp). this mark significant turnaround current accountbalance 15 percentage point gdp since 2008. adjustment come primarilyfrom decline import goods, particularly 2009, world trade collapse due tothe global recession. however, since 2010, exports, exclude shipping, contributedsignificantly improvement.exports good real term actually rebound line euro area peersand share good export increase significantly vis-à-vis non-eu countries. on theother hand, export service real term underperform primarily due weaknessof ship sector. this drive domestic economic uncertainty imposition ofcapital controls, well global factors, weak growth global trade, lowercommodity price supply overhang global ship sector. 1 / 7bis central bankers' speech in detail, share export gdp increase 19% 2009 close 30% in2015, 2/3 increase stem good export 1/3 servicesexports and, particular, receipt tourism. it note good export stand atabout 14% gdp 2015 compare 7.5% gdp 2009.fourth, policy agenda include bold structural reforms. a series structuralreforms implement labour product markets, well publicadministration. these reform expect boost growth potential greekeconomy long-term high productivity employment growth. accord tothe oecd, reform implement period 2010–2014 expect raise realgdp 10-year-horizon 5.6%. add reform currently implementedor plan esm programme, overall increase real gdp come about13.4% 10-year-period. however, estimate low bind sense thatadditional reforms, example improve judiciary system, strengthen bankruptcyregulations, modernise public administration resolve issue non-performingexposures (npes) cannot easily quantified. in-house work bank greece pointsto similar estimate main effect come high total factor productivity (tfp)growth.fifth, rebalancing economy remarkable. the restructure thegreek economy towards new, extrovert, growth model base tradable good andservices high share export gdp already underway. in detail, therelative price tradable good service rise 10% period 2010–2015,making production profitable. a result, share tradable good andservices private economy rise recent years. for example, gross valueadded terms, relative size tradable sector grow approximately 12% theperiod 2010–2015 volume term 24% nominal terms, employmentterms grow around 8%. this development attribute structural reformsimplemented far fact tradable export-oriented sector go amilder recession thereby gradually gain grind term volume andemployment shares.an additional aspect worth highlight account decline domestic demand andthe scale back construction greece, great number dynamic construction companiesexpanded business abroad (middle east, balkans) transform previously think tobe non-tradable activity internationally tradable one.going forward, structural reform improve finance liquidity economy areexpected speed restructure economy favour tradable good services. sixth, bank recapitalization considerable consolidation take place. overthe past years, landscape bank system change significantly thenumber bank reduce mergers, takeover resolutions. todaythe system comprise four core bank number small ones. the bank system,following successive round recapitalization involve significant private sectorinvolvement implementation restructure plans, well-placed address themajor challenge pose high stock non-performing exposure (npes). effectivelymanaging npes key recovery credit growth restructure ofbusinesses sector real economy.2. misstep delay adjustment processhowever, despite huge effort avert default address imbalances, greece remainsunder adjustment programme, unlike cyprus, ireland portugal, alreadycompleted respective programmes, even though enter programme late thangreece did. 2 / 7bis central bankers' speech this lag behind attribute several factors, including: lack ownership thenecessary reform lack commitment, part political system, correct pasterrors, anti-bailout rhetoric, rivalry failure reach understand among politicalparties, various – small large – vest interest resist reform.meanwhile, fact european partner yet deliver commitment toprovide debt relief, state eurogroup decision make far back innovember 2012 (and iterate recently may 2016), threat default euro areaexit brandish greece partner whenever negotiation seem stall,even technical matters, weigh

introductory remark fritz zurbrügg in remark today, i start present current assessment area financial stability, look first big bank turn domestically focus banks. i end remark word new banknote series. big bank since financial stability report publish june, swiss big bank improve capital situation slightly; time, substantially increase hold bail-in bonds. bail-in bond debt instrument write convert equity event restructure resolution. they form basis crisis-hit bank resolve restructure orderly way. alongside capital requirements, qualitative quantitative requirement debt instrument key component revise ‘too big fail’ regulation come force begin july. these revise regulation envisage requirement gradually increase specify level phase-in period end begin 2020. a regard core capital (common equity tier 1, cet1), big bank already largely meet target apply end phase-in period. there still need action transition deadline expire, regard bail-in instrument high-trigger contingent convertible capital instrument – high-trigger cocos. these coco convert cet1 equity write order absorb loss current operations. when accumulate necessary bail-in instrument high-trigger cocos, bank opportunity replace exist instrument require higher-quality instruments. the strengthen resilience accumulation high-trigger cocos, foresee regulations, important necessary. one reason big banks’ loss potential, continue substantial relative capitalisation. give berne, 15 december 2016 fritz zurbrügg news conference page 2/3 significance swiss economy, important big bank remain adequately capitalised, even event loss occurring. a second reason critical assessment market regard resilience banks, switzerland worldwide. by strengthen resilience, bank convince market soundness. the likelihood share price collapse sharply increase premia credit default swaps, observe bank year, would thus reduced. in addition strengthen resilience, also essential big bank improve resolvability. this require sufficient hold bail-in instrument formulation credible emergency resolution plans. emergency plan aim ensure that, event imminent insolvency, function important switzerland maintained. this require effective cooperation foreign authority crisis, which, turn, global resolution plan important prerequisite. a regard emergency plans, swiss big bank introduce significant measure set swiss subsidiary combine systemically important function one entity. the key point swiss unit must sufficiently independent rest bank, operationally financially. both big bank implement emergency plan end-2019 latest. finma responsible definitive assessment whether plan allow systemically important function maintain practice. domestically focus bank i would like turn domestically focus banks. for banks, mortgage real estate market still represent great source risk. growth market remain fairly constant last six months, relatively low level. at time, imbalance mortgage real estate market fall slightly overall, owe development fundamentals. despite recent development, risk build swiss bank sector since begin low interest rate period 2008 remain considerable. thus, imbalance mortgage real estate market still approximately high 2014, sectoral countercyclical capital buff set 2%. moreover, risk appetite domestically focus bank still high, reflect interest rate affordability risk exposure mortgage business. stress test carry swiss national bank suggest risk currently sustainable, thank good capitalisation overall. against backdrop persistently low interest rates, welcome. in future, too, decisive factor financial system stability banks’ ability maintain risk exposure sustainable level. the current low interest rate environment create strong incentive increase interest rate affordability risk exposure lend business. for instance, public debate whether impute interest rate use ass affordability reduced. the level impute interest rate set berne, 15 december 2016 fritz zurbrügg news conference page 3/3 regulator vary banks. however, play key role affordability assessments. bank typically use rate 5%. let go topic detail. while today’s period low interest rate could well persist rise interest rate might gradual, mortgage generally influence borrowers’ financial situation banks’ balance sheet period decades. a such, assess affordability calibrate risk exposure, long-term interest rate development also relevant. despite current pressure interest rate margins, bank therefore continue take long-term view risk policy. in context long-term interest rate developments, good argument say that, future, average interest rate level could low past. but mean assume current level interest rate represent new equilibrium. even assume average interest rate level decline, prevail level interest rate recent year exceptional. for example, long-term rate currently 300 basis point low average ten year onset financial crisis. moreover, experience show that, depend economic developments, interest rate increase rapidly unexpectedly, overshoot long-term equilibrium values. a broad-based reduction impute rate increase interest rate risk exposure across board could also lead renew acceleration momentum mortgage real estate markets. the snb continue monitor development closely, regularly reassess need adjustment countercyclical capital buffer. announcement

macroeconomic shockshappen time economy adjust them. but significant financial vulnerability arepresent, effect shock economy financial system may bemagnified interaction underlie vulnerabilities. the metaphor use isthat large tree crack it—the situation may improve worsen time, there’sno immediate crisis wrong sort storm come along.within analytical framework, many possible shock could, theory, transform financialvulnerabilities financial stability risks. we offer illustrative risk scenario fsr. ofcourse, possible draw logical link almost macroeconomic shock, anywherein world, financial stability canada, like “butterfly effect.” we make attempt tocatalogue possibilities, consequence would look quite similar.instead, focus analysis underlie vulnerability canada.that said, household financial vulnerability continue rise canada. we separatethese vulnerability two areas, household indebtedness house market imbalances.this separation important, since although often go hand-in-hand, possible overtime one diminish other.this separation always present analysis, govern council seek tosharpen distinction fsr. this macroprudential measure beenintroduced recent month serve primarily mitigate potential consequence forthe financial system rise household debt. these measure relate mortgage qualifyingcriteria, raise underlie quality household indebtedness time, tofinancial

since u election. canada’s bond yield responded, typically thecase, albeit le one-for-one fashion. this lead increase canadianmortgage rates. we monitor development carefully month ahead. a madeclear recent interest rate announcement, continue follow independentmonetary policy canada, one aim return inflation 2 per cent target.finally, considerable discussion financial market possible shortage ofbond market liquidity. many point regulatory change contribute this. at thesame time, market function exceptionally well follow uk referendum leave theeuropean union u election.this issue continue draw attention international level. in fsr, bring newanalysis table, draw upon in-depth market survey conduct canadianfixed-income forum, industry group establish bank. govern councilacknowledges pocket liquidity problem evident, ascorporate bonds, off-the-run government bond certain repo markets. but also recognizethat market yet fully adapt new regulatory requirements. further,

15bis central bankers' speech although, market prove resilient number potentially disruptive political developments,questions linger whether configuration asset price accurately reflect theunderlying

believethat greek economy ability potential return sustainable upward paththrough new extroverted growth model, take advantage strong comparative advantagesand opportunity presented. in process,

the bank greece recognise importance tourism greek economy andunderstands timely objective information development tourism-relatedaggregates essential fulfil mandate. we attach great importance collection ofreliable comparable statistic time tourism sector. for reason, gobeyond require meet obligation ecb international organisations, andcollect thorough detail data regard sector. since 2002 bank greece conduct border survey, aim record inboundand outbound traveller flows, also, importantly, calculate travel expenditure ingreece. the survey incoming traveller base large sample, least 25,000inbound visitors. the border survey fully harmonise guideline internationalorganisations (imf, ecb, eurostat). in particular, relevant mirror statistics, compile anannual basis eurostat (in context travel work group), show greece’s travelexpenditure traffic data fully consistent correspond figure othereu28 countries, difference 2%. the border survey, among mostcomprehensive one eu, conduct 12 large airport country, whichcover around 95% visitors, seaport entry six main road entry points. theresulting data combine administrative information regularly cross-check againstrespective data visitors’ country origin, ensure compliance thestandards set quality check carry ecb. the border survey conduct time departure greece, visitor knowexactly much spend here. to calculate expenditure, respondent provide anestimate of: (a) total expenditure; (b) relevant amount pay homecountries (e.g. travel agency, directly airline, etc.) transport, accommodation,other service cruise

major port account 85% total cruise traffic, –starting year – enrich data target sample surveys. recent development in 2016, greek tourism face number challenge record year term arrival andreceipts 2015. let recall 2015 greece welcome 26 million tourists, 7.6% morethan 2014, tourism receipt exceed €14 billion, rise 5.5%. in addition economicweakness europe, visitor come from, refugee crisis combine 4 / 7bis central bankers' speech geopolitical development region increase fear terrorism discouragedvisitors come greece. it estimate first half year, theimpact refugee crisis stronger, road arrival decrease 15%, date flightarrivals island eastern aegean particularly reduced. the uk’s decision leavethe eu negative factor. in respect, let mention july, firstmonth british referendum, decline tourism spend uk citizen countryexceeded 35%, whereas previously british one robust category ofvisitors. without reduction, total receipt july would increase instead decreasing. tourism stakeholder country try respond external challenge redoublingefforts attract visitors. the number arrival thus remain upward trend 2016as well. to extent, however, achieve highly competitive pricing, somethingthat ultimately negative effect total travel receipts. for year whole, price arelikely show decline, slightly fast average rate decline observe last tenyears. on positive note, however, downward trend average stay country hasbottomed out, first half 2016 saw slight increase. the differentiation tourism demand the decline tourism receipt despite grow number visitor partly attribute tolower prices, note above. however, also relate part longer-term trend, namely thedecline spend per visitor per night stay, observe past years. since 2005such spend fall average 2.5% annually, come €598 per visitor julythis year, €746 2005. to extent reflect downward trend averagedays stay country, 10.7 day 2005 7.2 2015. this result change inboth income situation visitors, greece attract few high-income visitors, mixof visitors’ country origin, well long-term trend global economy, theentry new competitor country use ιnternet allow price comparison andintensifies competition. moreover, arrivals, mainly traditional market (uk, germany, etc.)are close saturation point. this mean tourism growth model adapted,aimed towards improvement product quality high specialisation. this would involve: increase number target market appropriate market policy market-specific advertise campaigns. particular emphasis place country thehighest expenditure per night. extend tourist season throughout year, develop tourism product beyondthe traditional “sun sea” model, create diversify products, focus alternativeforms tourism cultural, conference, religious medical tourism themeparks. particular emphasis place attract visitor short stay (citybreaks), typically associate high expenditure per day lessconcentrated peak summer months. establish greece homeporting last port country rather port call forcruises. reform a crucial contribution direction, i.e. towards stimulate diversify tourism demand,will come future reform undertake recent years. these reform willstrengthen

financial crisis deliver strong average growth 17.1% 2008 2011, late development show moderation pace growth average 13.8% 2011 2014, particular 10% 2013 2014. nevertheless, first half 2015 post non-annualized upswing growth 7.96% therefore, global islamic bank asset growth 2015 expect sustain double-digit rate. 7. however, subdue global macroeconomic outlook pose considerable risk global bank sector performance general. similar performance islamic bank sector, global sukuk market also experience slowdown reach record year global sukuk issuance 2012 2013. in 2014 sukuk market slow 3 usd100 billion issuances, downward trend continue 2015 issuance slide 43% around usd60 billion. 8. the development islamic commercial finance indonesia similar trend development global islamic commercial, especially 2012-2015, growth islamic bank reach low 8.8% annually 2015, compare 9.2% annually conventional counterpart. however, july 2016, growth islamic bank rebound reach 12.0% y.o.y,

microfinance institutions. although development around islamic social finance sector globally well documented, country data indicate promise potential. research islamic research train institute idb (irti-idb) shed light development global islamic social finance. 12. it estimate potential zakat collection south asian south east asian country around usd30 billion 2011, sub-saharan africa country could reach around usd24 billion 2013. on hand, process estimation potential 4 resource awqaf challenge due gross absence data countries. 13. the islamic social finance allow government reach wide segment entertain, particularly low income society neglect due inability provide low cost funds. henceforth, become real challenge good formulate define concept islamic economics reach compatibility concept implementation, integrate mainstream economic policy. in international seminar, islamic social sector become center point discussion consider potential equip government deliver prosperity society. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, 14. zakat enable consider poor extremely poor fulfill basic needs. zakat also mean empower poor capable work produce good and/or services, little access formal financing. self-employed poor empower take care family. hence, poverty could alleviated. 15. similar zakat, management awqaf also contribute socio-economic wellbeing. traditionally, charitable purpose awqaf include educational institutions, orphanages, roads, graveyards, religious establishment mosques. however, modern days, institution awqaf encourage make awqaf either cash estate productive. 16. through awqaf, charitable clinics, medical centers, shop complex commercial center established. this large social-commercial project finance raise awqaf plan manner 5 consider important instrument improve socio-economic wellbeing sustainable way. 17. unlike commercial source funds, zakat fund would never cause unnecessary burden economy since type fund commercially claimable, hence, excessive social cost occur. the also go awqaf sector, where, matter fact, people endow low cost assets. with huge potential zakat awqaf land, expect islamic social finance significant drive economic development. 18. both zakat awqaf islamic social finance become buff well economic stabilizer. zakat fund provide transfer payment hard hit poor needy people cause recession. since zakat levy income wealth, redistribution wealth always functional operative islamic economy due wealth zakat irrespective phase business cycle. 19. transfer payment needy people continue economy face recession. due simple certain collection also religious obligation involuntary tool fetch wealth, zakat always available good time (peak) bad time (recession). 20. on macroeconomic level, proportional zakat link income act automatic stabilizer. when personal disposable income decrease due recession, obligatory zakat also decreases. they pay proportional amount before, thereby provide automatic relief income earners. 21. on contrary, aggregate personal disposable income increase (boom period), zakat collect amount remain disposal government allocate transfer payments. thus zakat enable distributive allocation work independently help stabilize extreme business cycles. a 6 awqaf, since principal awqaf always increase time time, due return productive activity new awqaf collection, awqaf could act shock absorber economic shocks. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, 22. despite potential, also realize order manage zakat awqaf efficiently prudently

carry growingcontinuously. but come recession follow financial crisis never reachedthe predict economic strength. shortly afterwards come sovereign debt crisis, secondrecession rescue programme cutbacks. so expectation raise muchtoo high could fulfilled. that great disappointment many people.so everything fault financial crisis. the ecb nothing it?central bank didn’t see crisis come early stage either. in year thefinancial crisis, credit growth high, europe, benefit relatively lowinterest rate countries. we give several warn time excessiveliquidity markets. when crisis erupted, people realise europe notproperly prepare situation like this.what missing?the toolkit insufficient respond critical developments. there common bankingsupervision, institution stabilisation resolution banks, wereno macroprudential instruments. that increase effect crisis. central bank justone instrument achieve price stability – interest rate. it difficult counter complexsituation instrument alone. however, make good progress stabilise thefoundations monetary union.the european elite too. but people clearly happy that. ultimately, itcomes euro, without would problems. wa euro amistake?no. the crisis illustrate euro create within incomplete institutionalframework. however, forget owe euro. before monetary unionthere repeat economic shock owe strong fluctuation exchange rates. thatcreated trade barriers. in addition, must always consider alternative. take germany, forexample: without euro, currency would rise strongly value thefinancial crisis. for country export lot, problem. i rather doubt countrywould good – likely interest rate would 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech push strongly case too.at present everyone say elite live long filter bubble notnotice rise populism. doe apply too? do live ecb bubble?for us, diversity opinion view important basis good decisions. on ecb’sgoverning council, 19 governor national central bank apersonal capacity representative countries. that enrich debate ourperspective world. and, conversely, also able explain decision theircountries. we regularly go european parliament, occasionally nationalparliaments.for example, mario draghi speak

president bavarian build societies, among others, way. both side learnfrom events. the german critical, always polite, i find. most peopleunderstand good events. but usually still don’t think isgood.do sometimes meet tough critics? for example, member alternative germany(afd), party come quite specifically protest euro rescue policy?we open dialogue critics. and also engage dialogue regularbasis, least european parliament.at moment, interest rate rise around world. only ecb resist trendand leave interest rate low. be lose touch?the picture uniform describe. in unite states, example, theeconomic recovery far advance euro area, unemployment low therate inflation higher. that u economy cope high interest rates. wehave get far yet.why not? unemployment fall europe too,

u economy receivea boost donald trump want reduce tax increase public spending. europewould also profit could export more. 2 / 3bis central bankers' speech there sign loose fiscal policy unite state future, expect lead tohigher growth rates. but alone enough. the important thing make theeconomy productive. another outstanding question protectionism, would coursebe damaging, include europe. trump president yet. we know exactly heis planning, therefore cautious.so want continue flood world money. you already purchase bond forover trillion euro. at end programme plan far, €2.3 trillion.we flood anyone. people ever talk billion additional central bankmoney make available. but hardly anyone mention fact money creditgrowth fairly moderate. our measure thus aim stimulate weak money andcredit growth.how explain someone central banker?both central bank bank create money lend economy. if banksare hesitantly, make finance condition attractive createincentives generous lending. a long overall money supply grow veryquickly, cause concern lead excessive inflationary pressures.that mean everything right, one understands?i didn’t say that, interest rate reach zero, monetary policy become complicatedto explain. the central bank exhaust options, resort tounconventional means, purchase government bonds.here frankfurt, property price rise 20% one year. that hard tounderstand. be next crisis making?we follow development financial market closely. in region indeedseeing strong rise property prices, still europe-wide phenomenon. moreover,such boom really dangerous finance credit. however, issuance ofbuilding loan grow slowly.in event crisis, capable respond time? after all, country like italyare highly indebted might able cope high interest rates.i take worry shoulders. when time high interest rate comes, wewill increase interest rates. the country would also able cope that. many themhave use period low interest rate extend maturity loans. when interestrates rise, therefore lead immediately significant rise cost service thedebt. that mean high debt level problem, restrict theecb’s room manoeuvre.italy already cause u concern today. the big problem ail banks. the newgovernment consider state aid. doe make sense?the european rule permit that. even germany put public money bank height ofthe crisis. at time, italy not. in view, much important question

tracy luis uranga assist prepare theseremarks.it great pleasure opportunity talk u.s. economic outlook. i want thank association good new york (abny) sponsor today’s event. thisis excellent venue speak improve country’s economicperformance. a always, i say reflect view necessarily ofthe federal open market committee (fomc) federal reserve system.the u.s. economy—supported solid gain household spending—has expand amoderate rate 2016. job gain sturdy, see firm wagegrowth labor market continue tighten. moreover, effect early declinesin energy price dissipated, overall inflation rate begin move close 2percent objective. a consequence, economic condition far federalreserve’s dual mandate maximum sustainable employment price stability. and, i expectthat make progress toward goal 2017. so, cyclical perspective,the economy reasonably good shape.over long term, however, u.s. economy face significant challenges. on positiveside, economic expansion don’t die old age, appear imbalance theeconomy could lead current expansion ending. but, order remain thecase, important fiscal policy monetary policy well align go forward.it also important unite state retain sufficient fiscal capacity fiscal policy cansupport economy next cyclical downturn occur. if fiscal policy play agreater role promote macroeconomic stability, would likely reduce need monetaryauthorities take extraordinary action support economic activity.there structural issue worth noting. in particular, productivity growth beenanemic past years, income inequality increase income mobilityremains low. a consequence, gain live standard generate current businessexpansion modest compare previous expansions, gain beenwidely shared. much could do locally nationally increase economy’spotential perform good broad array citizens.the outlook growth inflationthe u.s. economy expand moderate rate. growth average 1.8percent year seem likely continue slightly pace 2017. the maindriver growth 2016 consumer, real personal

muted, begin rise rapidly labor market continue 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech tighten.another positive factor economy household finance generally good shape. the household save rate 5.9 percent, bite high one would expect base onhistorical relationship household net worth disposable income. and, longperiod deleveraging, household debt growing, slowly. over last fourquarters, household debt rise 2.4 percent. this slow pace, combine lowborrowing rate improve labor market, push ratio household debtservice income close low level since least 1980. this suggest householdshave financial capacity sustain spending.in contrast consumer spending, many area economy considerablysofter. residential investment, experience strong gain 2015 first quarter of2016, fell past two quarters. however, increase single-family house start andpermits october suggest likely see reversal trend fourth quarterand next year.business fix investment also weak time. part weakness reflect thecollapse oil gas drill activity follow plunge crude oil price secondhalf 2014. this adjustment appear over, oil gas price recoveredsomewhat. but, even outside area, business fix investment disappointing. several factor may play here—including early uncertainty surround presidentialelection outcome fact capacity utilization rate remain unusually low point inthe economic business cycle. while election uncertainty resolved, i would expectbusiness fix investment rise slowly year ahead. in contrast, trade sector perform surprisingly well 2016. this sector contendwith headwind create weak growth final demand major foreign trade partners, aswell impact early dollar strength nation’s export competitiveness. however, i’mnot sure i would take much signal performance. the improvement trade seemsto drive mainly weakness imports, particularly capital goods, someone-off factors, surge soybean export last quarter—both unlikely tocontinue.with respect inflation, make progress push toward 2 percent objective. inparticular, headline inflation rise year early decline energy price havedropped year-over-year figures. and, core inflation remain broadly steady,running 1.7 percent past year—as measure personal consumptionexpenditures deflator exclude food energy. this stability noteworthy, onemight anticipate low energy price firm dollar would push coreinflation bite lower. also, household inflation expectations—which time 2015 appear tobe risk become unanchored downside—have broadly stable. the university ofmichigan long-term inflation expectation measure generally remain 2.5-2.8 percentrange recent years. in addition, new york fed’s survey consumer expectationsmeasure 3-year median inflation expectation stabilize 2016 range 2.5-2.8percent, decline modestly course 2014 2015.implications monetary policyif economy grow pace slightly sustainable long-term rate, i expect, thelabor market gradually tighten further, result pressure resource shouldhelp push inflation toward 2 percent objective next year two. assume theeconomy stay trajectory, i would favor make monetary policy somewhat lessaccommodative time gradually push level short-term interest rates.following year’s election, see relatively large movement financial asset prices. 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech in particular, stock market firmed, bond yield rise dollar appreciated. on balance, appear financial market condition tighten modestly. my personalinterpretation development market participant anticipate fiscal policywill turn expansionary fomc likely respond tighten monetary policy abit quickly previously anticipated. assume expectation realized, recentmodest tighten financial market condition seem broadly appropriate. let emphasize i view recent shift financial market condition onethat prompt great concern. it important distinguish tighten financialconditions drive increase risk aversion one drive greaterlikelihood strong near-term aggregate demand le downside risk growth outlook.we experience former begin 2016, latter reflect current expectationsof great fiscal policy stimulus.obviously, still considerable uncertainty fiscal policy evolve nextfew years. at juncture, premature reach firm conclusion likely occur. a get great clarity come year, i update assessment economicoutlook and, that, view appropriate stance monetary policy.monetary fiscal policy low-rate environmenti also would like highlight limitation monetary policy. one important factor contributingto limit real short-term interest rate consistent long run neutralmonetary policy stance appear low, expect remain time. this help keep real inflation-adjusted interest rate low beenhistorically. in part, reflect anemic productivity growth well slow labor forcegrowth due age population. an implication environment willlikely le scope historically federal reserve cut interest rateswhen need face economic downturn. all else equal, mean great risk forshort-term interest rate pin effective low bind inflation expectationsto become unanchored downside. although forward guidance large scale assetpurchase program expand way federal reserve provideadditional accommodation, unconventional monetary policy tool also ownlimits. these limit suggest fiscal policy may need play great role stabilize theeconomy case past decades.what i mind put place stronger, robust automatic fiscal stabilizer thatwould provide income support economic downturns. by reduce fluctuation indisposable incomes, type fiscal action would stabilize aggregate demand, therebylimiting risk monetary policy get pin zero low bind extend periodand need extraordinary monetary policy measures. i favor automatic, rather discretionary, fiscal action would typically go intoeffect quickly would good anticipated. expectation matter greatly affectingeconomic behavior. for example, economy weaken, anticipation strongfiscal stabilizer would kick support income lead worker le fearful aboutlosing jobs, business le concern demand product might fallprecipitously. this, turn, would make worker confident could sustain theirspending, would make business confident could keep worker theirpayrolls. what type fiscal stabilizer would effective? i would turn first congresshas implement discretionary basis past economic downturns, extensionsof unemployment compensation cut payroll taxes. for example, theunemployment rate climbs, extension duration eligibility unemploymentcompensation could trigger automatically, help stabilize household income. similarly, 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech unemployment rate breach certain thresholds, payroll tax cut could triggered,helping support disposable income worker face reduction hours. payroll tax cutsalso advantage skew toward low- moderate-income workers, whotypically high propensity consume current income.obviously, incoming administration congress decide appropriatefiscal measures. but, point i want highlight robust automatic fiscal stabilizerswould complement monetary policy, take pressure federal reserve toundertake extraordinary measure situation little scope cut short-terminterest rates. this approach might also superior proposals—such raise thefederal reserve’s inflation objective—that design reduce risk monetary policybeing trap zero low bound. for fiscal action sustainable time, important unite state retainsufficient fiscal capacity. this would also ensure automatic fiscal stabilizer view asfully credible. on score, significant progress make recent year instabilizing country’s fiscal situation, circumstance likely grow challenge theyears ahead. there three area i would highlight. first, earn federalreserve return u.s. treasury department year likely fall future, asrising short-term interest rate narrow gap federal reserve pay itsliabilities—primarily currency bank reserves—and earn portfolio treasuriesand agency mortgage-backed securities. in recent years, federal reserve’s remittance tothe treasury average $90 billion per year, far $20–30 billion average priorto great recession. although precise trajectory future reimbursement highlyuncertain, congressional budget office (cbo) project federal reserve payment tothe treasury drop around 0.6 percent gdp fiscal 2016 0.3 percent gdp by2026.second, treasury’s debt-service cost likely grow interest rate rise amountof outstanding debt hold public continue increase. while net outstanding treasurydebt hold public rise $14.2 trillion $4.8 trillion past decade, annualdebt-service cost increase modestly. look ahead, cbo’s baselineprojection debt-service cost rise 1.4 percent gdp fiscal 2016 2.6percent gdp 2026.third, retirement baby boom generation put significant upward pressure socialsecurity medicare expenditures. although trend medicare expenditure flattenedout recent year healthcare inflation moderate utilization growth slowed, thecbo nevertheless project expenditure rise 3.2 percent gdp 2016 toabout 4.0 percent gdp 2026. consequently, significant pressure federal budget arestill much train. it important fiscal policy manage retain capacityto use macroeconomic stabilization.structural challengeswhile make steady progress past year toward twin goal maximumsustainable employment price stability, significant challenge remain economy thatlay largely beyond scope monetary policy. the three i would highlight sharpslowdown labor productivity growth, increase income inequality low rate ofincome mobility.i draw attention slowdown productivity growth two reasons. first, productivityultimately drive live standard people ass economic well-being. second,beyond ensure stable macroeconomic financial environment, monetary policy dolittle improve productivity growth. 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech annual productivity growth average 0.7 percent past five years, near thelowest 5-year pace since early 1980s. there number compete explanation theslowdown. these include weak capital investment, flatten educational attainment bynew labor market entrants, le new business formation, understatement qualityimprovements and, hence, output, few ground-breaking innovations. i suspect ofthese factor play role.what public policy address issue ensure economy operate close tothe frontier achievable. for example, effort improve job skill would provebeneficial—through retrain apprentice programs, good alignment education andtraining business needs. also, encourage small business start-ups would help—byremoving barrier entrepreneur establish new businesses, create start-upincubator programs. i also suspect well-targeted infrastructure spend would beadvantageous address logistical bottleneck enable people commute area withgood job opportunities. for example, new york city metropolitan region, mass transit isold, slow crowded. a new jersey resident, i’m still wait second set railtunnels new york city build year ago. while high productivity growth could support good live standards, benefit low- andmiddle-income household depend, part, gain distribute betweenbusiness labor, labor income distribute across workforce. moreover,income distribution shouldn’t view static concept. it important people able tomove upward income careers, regardless start point.over past several decades, three development discouraging. first, share oflabor income relative business income fallen. since 1970, labor share gdp theunited state decline 5 percentage points. similar decline evident mostdeveloped emerge market economies. second, distribution labor income hasbecome skewed. since 1970, top 1 percent household income distributionhas double share nation’s income. third, despite notion theamerican dream, income mobility unite state remain relatively low compare manyother countries. also, potential income mobility evenly distributed. research hasshown bear raise unite state still significant implication foryour future prospects. a country, need address issues. with respect labor share

fed’s dual mandate, wecan play important role here. with respect rise concentration income low level income mobility, i thinkconsiderable improvement also achievable. income distribution influence taxpolicy educational opportunities. income mobility influence local policy oneducation housing. a raj chetty’s pathbreaking work make clear, income mobilitydepends one bear lives. this suggest quite strongly improve access togood education, childcare affordable house would help.as i note recent speech, important aspect city’s vitality ability residentsto develop skill necessary successful achieve

mourmouras deputy governor, bank greece former finance minister seacen1 - omfif joint policy summit entitle “financial stability uncertain global environment”*2 sasana kijang, bank negara malaysia kuala lumpur, malaysia wednesday, 23 november 2016 lady gentlemen, it great honour back part world. it’s certainly warm here! i would like thank organiser invite give speech joint policy summit topic i revisit lately, central bank independence. my early research subject go back 20 plus years. my speech today revolve one single important question: concept independent central bank challenged, perhaps even undermined, era unconventional monetary policies, include exit strategies. quite example come mind, especially look late developments. u president-elect donald trump criticise feed chair janet yellen fed’s policy low interest rates. in particular, feed accuse bias president-elect trump. british prime minister theresa may come openly bank england’s policy governor mark carney say low interest rate deprive saver interest income. also, germany’s “five wise men” (council economic experts) german finance minister wolfgang schäuble criticise ecb president mario draghi negative interest rate policy. against background, ultimate question quite straightforward: central bank independence sufficient price stability tail risk deflation visible unconventional monetary policy last long? opinion differ i give view question minute, let make view clear 1 the south east asian central bank research train centre. * disclaimer: view express speech personal view necessarily reflect institution i affiliate with. 2 central bank independence necessary condition price stability term mitigate political business cycle, also term reduce inflationary bias inherent monetary policy. central bank independence: theory the intellectual root central bank independence (or cbi) trace back rational expectation revolution, pioneer chicago school 1970s. rational expectation play vital role break intellectual deadlock effort address stagflation phenomenon 1970s. with regard monetary policy, seminal work kydland prescott (1977) barro gordon (1983) show discretionary monetary policy interaction rational private agent equally rational government optimise non-linear loss function whose argument deviation inflation output socially desire target-levels, generate nash equilibrium involve inflation bias whose size increase degree output-gap aversion entail sustainable output gains. to address problem inflation bias, monetary policy conduct technology credible commitment low future inflation rate private inflation expectation anchor equally low levels. initially, commitment take form intermediate policy targets, target money supply growth, introduce early 1980s reagan thatcher government u uk respectively; exchange rate target implemented, among others, european country context european monetary system. intermediate target successful low inflation major industrialise economies, thus introduce great moderation era. however, instability money demand opaqueness money supply target render latter’s implementation operationally difficult (see mourmouras arghyrou, 2000). on hand, exchange rate target rarely stand test time, thus preserve question credibility, demonstrate literature currency crisis (see obstfeld, 1996). cbi, along introduction inflation targeting, largely profession’s response shortcoming intermediate targets. specifically, delegate monetary policy independent central bank, formal mandate achieve price stability grant discretion choice instrument necessary meet objective, reduce inflation-bias problem result central banker’s objective function include inflation-aversion parameter high government’s. theoretically, inflation gain may come cost high output volatility (see rogoff, 1995). empirical evidence, however, (see 3 e.g. alesina summers, 1993 cuckierman, 2008) suggest cbi may operate free-lunch, sense involve obvious gain without cause equally obvious loss. empirical measure central bank independence find negatively correlate first second moment inflation, show little, any, correlation output variability. furthermore, cbi beneficial ensure sustainable public debt dynamics, theoretically show mourmouras su (1995) dynamic game set-up. a result theoretical empirical advantages, cbi widely adopt (particularly 1990s) major industrialise economy beyond. the form independence, however, vary instrument (economic) goal (political) independence (see fischer, 1995). under former, operational goal central bank exogenously determined, either legislation another official body finance ministry. under instrument independence, central bank free choose without external interference mean (the policy instruments) best suit meet give goals: bank england example form independence. under goal independence, central bank choose independently goal policy, well instrument best suit meet self-selected goal: ecb example type independence. delegate monetary policy independent central bank raise important question democratic check balances, i.e. question transparency accountability. accountability, turn, relate least two dimensions. first, type central bank independence: close move towards independence goal, high need transparency accountability. the second dimension number goal set independent central bank. perhaps non-intuitively, accountability decline number policy goals, give set policy instruments, increase number goal result trade-off goals. a welfare order policy outcome trade-off intrinsically difficult performance-ordering single policy objective, scope accountability increase central bank focus one policy objective. this accountability enhancement, combine theoretical empirical advantage inflation-averse monetary policy, result majority country adopt central bank independence define price stability override objective monetary policy. the ecb characteristic example trend. on hand, fed, whose dual mandate include price stability maximum employment (plus moderate long-term interest rates), notable exception. 4 monetary policy post-crisis period the global financial crisis 2008/2009 ensue european sovereign debt crisis fundamentally change operational framework independent central banks. these change relate three levels. the first methodological: we appreciation potential real economic cost financial crisis previously lacked. this motivate development niche literature introduce bank sector dsge models, thus allow financial crisis (see e.g. gertler et al., 2012 boissay et al., 2013). this literature promise enhance information available policy-makers design implement monetary policy. the second change central bank give new macro-prudential tasks, supervision systemic bank emu, conduct ecb since 2014. on frontier, central bank don’t know fail late. the cost confusion policy conflict multiple objective may high, damage credibility central bank. and i refer type costs: cost take measure avoid bank failure cost nothing. the third change situation ground: rather prevent excessive inflation, price stability post-crisis era prevent deflation. under low inflation, central bank largely lose main policy instrument conventional (standard) monetary policy, namely target short-run interest rate open market operations, short-term rate restrict zero low bind limit. a result, major central bank employ non-standard monetary policy tool recent years. these include provision emergency liquidity credit support bank financial institutions, extend definition asset accept eligible collateral provide financial institution loan short- medium-term basis; introduce quantitative ease (qe) programme context central bank buy private sector sovereign bonds, corporate bond corporate assets. let quickly remind ecb’s monetary policy stance last nine year response bad financial crisis since great depression, lead negative interest rate enter practically unchartered territory. 5 table 1. ecb’s non-standard measure year non-standard measure oct-dec 2008 ecb cut base interest rate 4.25% 2.50%, provide u dollar liquidity foreign exchange swaps, expand list asset eligible collateral eurosystem fund operations, introduce 6-month longer-term refinance operation (ltros) decide main refinance operation carry fixed-rate tender procedure full allotment. 2009 ecb cut base interest rate 2.50% 1.00%, introduce first cover bond purchase programme (cbpp1). 2010 ecb activate security market programme (smp). 2011 the ecb launch second cover bond purchase programme (cbpp2) introduce 3-year ltros. 2012 the ecb announce outright monetary transaction (omts). 2013 the ecb cut base interest rate 0.25% introduce forward guidance. 2014 the ecb cut base interest rate 0.05% deposit facility rate -0.20%, bring first time negative territory introduce target longer-term refinance operation (tltro) 4-year maturity. 2015 ecb introduce expand asset purchase programme (app) cut deposit facility rate -0.30%. 2016 ecb accelerate expand asset purchase programme (app) cut main refinance operation (mro) rate 0.00% deposit facility rate -0.40%. indeed, 10 large central bank asset total $21.4 trillion, account 29% world economy, 10% end-2015, double mid-september 2008 almost half value debt bloomberg’s global bond index (as show chart 1)! 6 chart 1. the combine asset 10 large central bank finally, almost 75% world’s central bank asset control policy-makers four regions: china, us, japan eurozone. the

chart 2. central banks’ combine asset 7 chart 3. stock asset purchase four major central bank percentage national gdp source: bank greece, european central bank, fed, bank england bank japan. note: the ecb’s purchase asset context smp, cbpp1, 2 & 3, ab pspp. a result, central bank balance sheet expand considerably: since 2008 fed’s balance sheet doubled; bank england’s balance sheet trebled; ecb’s balance sheet also expand considerably, particularly since introduction ecb’s qe programme 2015. qe programme design prevent deflation mainly three distinct channel (see demertzis wolff, 2016). first, interest rate channel: operate low long-term interest rate improve investment condition disincentivise savings. second, portfolio rebalancing channel: operate purchase relatively low-risk asset long-term maturity, thus incentivising investor take long position higher-risk (and thus high expect return) assets. third, exchange rate channel, name suggest work demand-boosting weak domestic currency. the degree success qe programme active research investigation exist evidence, however, suggest successful prevent large-scale deflation conditions, announcement effect qe programme strong effect actual implementation (see e.g. demertzis wolff, 2016 altavilla et al., 2015). challenge central bank independence low-inflation period the legacy great financial crisis 2008 low inflation condition since observe bring new challenge central bank independence. these challenge fall two categories. first, instruments’ independence central bank 8 put question external parties. second, even instruments’ independence formally challenged, may effectively compromise result change conditions. the two kind challenge obviously interconnected. a formally independent central bank face effective constraint conduct policy may find hard deliver mandate may subsequently face call restrict independence. on hand, central bank whose independence threat may constrain policy (instruments) choices. all all, current circumstance pose challenge successful regime monetary dominance paradigm establish recent years. external challenge instrument’s independence mainly stem political pressure. in us, example, proposal table subject monetary policy federal open market committee (fomc) unlimited congressional policy audits; adopt specific equation set monetary policy require fomc justify, congressional hear investigations, deviation policy dictate equation; use feed source finance monetize specific government initiative (see fischer, 2015). in euro-area, hand, qe programme challenge expansive, well limited. similar criticism voice regard effect monetary policy uk. my verdict challenge concept independence, rather current economic policy mix: loose monetary policy plus tight fiscal policy. by keep interest rate negative territory long, redistribution effect monetary policy perceive degree success meet mandate objective become pronounced. start former, low interest rate redistribute wealth saver borrowers; result high asset prices. reduce real return save cause reaction circle represent savers’ constituency, within across countries, point particularly relevant within emu; distribution asset hold highly uneven among section population, benefit qe programme may also see uneven. on hand, cbi independence may question long recovery major economy remain fragile; perceive achieve equally good performance across board extend set responsibility including, example, financial stability. the independence central bank may scrutinise due concern whether central bank extend mandate objective operate transparently 9 appropriate degree accountability context democratic political economic system. all all, independent central bank subject democratic accountability need broad support public. clearly, persistent negative rate bind sooner late lose major part broad constituency need independent central banker. central bank resist challenge independence, point fact political pressure onto monetary policy, mainly stem fact political cycle short cycle face monetary policy design implementation, introduce macro-performance exactly kind pressure cbi initially mean address. for example, us, despite low inflation, survey-based measure longer-term inflation expectation remain area 2% (see fischer, 2015). in euro-area, ecb’s decision extend qe programme take full independence, view achieve medium-term price stability objective within environment decentralise national fiscal structural policy (see cœuré, 2015). similar clear statement intent recently express governor bank england wake question raise high political level regard present course uk monetary policy. central banks’ opposition call formally restrict independence ensure monetary policy may face effective restriction choice monetary policy instruments. this risk mainly come interaction monetary policy policies, namely fiscal, structural financial. separate authority charge conduct policy may formally independent, are, however, also interdependent. the risk raise interdependence one independent policy authority take appropriate action meet mandate objectives, remain independent authority may oblige over-react persistent manner order meet objectives. to provide example, direct way identify policy interdependence failure field nominal demand: e.g. eurozone, nominal demand q2/2016 7% high q2/2008 (real domestic demand 1% low abovementioned periods), much low potential increase trend rate (roughly 24% cumulatively, assume trend rate real growth 1% target inflation rate 2%). compare number (7%) one u 23% nominal demand growth period. in brief, may result regime “weak dominance” policy monetary policy, effectively destabilise regime monetary dominance cbi mean establish. another example potential weak dominance relate 10 expansion balance-sheets central bank context qe programmes. this expansion may increase result imperfection response policy negative economic shocks. such imperfection might pre-commit future monetary policy low optimal business cycle management interest rates, prevent central bank register large loss balance sheet cause increase interest rates. this may important second round effect, low-interest rate bias monetary policy could potentially render public budget constraint le binding, cause deficit bias fiscal policy, threating price stability explain fiscal theory price level. it follows, therefore, ability central bank exercise optimally instrument independence deliver mandate objective crucially depend policy co-ordination monetary policy policies, namely financial, fiscal structural (see cœuré, 2015). the importance co-ordination cannot understate present conditions. the financial crisis 2008/2009 leave legacy debt overhang bank undercapitalisation, hind ability bank system finance real economy. to extent undercapitalisation problem resolve satisfactorily, monetary authority may need take extra step increase liquidity (such as, example, ltro programmes), thus create regime financial-policy dominance monetary policy. fiscal policy may also subject financial dominance: if bank undercapitalisation problem result direct indirect bank support programme (through, example, establishment bad banks), fiscal space reduced; ability fiscal policy operate shock absorber declines, place even great pressure monetary

2. economic situation monetary policyladies gentlemenas know, year mark unusually large number political eventswith potential elevate uncertainty future outlook – notably decisionby uk voter leave european union, result presidential election u and,most recently, referendum italy. these result also interpret sign agrowing scepticism open market free trade. and indeed, call protectionistmeasures hear many country lately. 1 / 9bis central bankers' speech it fact worldwide competition present challenge individual company alike.and quite understandable might feel globalisation technical

additionally, deflation isn’t really issue longer. and honest,in view, risk deflation largely overestimate past.this conjunctural picture line late eurosystem staff economic projection, whichshows rather stable growth rate 1.6% 1.7% within projection horizon. these rate are,in case, high potential output growth would lead gradual close outputgap, increase employment high wages.the german

inflation rate pick gradually end ofthe projection horizon level broadly line govern council’s definition price stability.in context, four-fifths increase 2016 2017 attribute thedevelopment energy

thiscould lead fast close gap oil demand oil supply, stabilise oil pricesat elevate level. however, much depend oil producer react. up now, it’snot clear current level oil price set incentive resume

gradual increase inflation justify expansionary monetary policystance euro area current juncture, reasonable people disagree theappropriate degree monetary accommodation. all monetary policy becomeslooser automatically come months, even without central bank action: inflationrises forecast projections, real interest rate declines. the effect similar acentral bank rate cut.and also secret i’m quite sceptical regard eurosystem government bondpurchases. although purchase aren’t prohibit per se loosen monetarypolicy stance, blur boundary monetary fiscal policy. and isespecially problematic currency union single monetary policy largely autonomouseconomic fiscal policies.euro-area central bank large creditor member states. all governmentsultimately pay interest rate debt central banks’ balance sheets, regardless ofthe country’s creditworthiness. currently, eurosystem’s deposit rate negative, allreceive money part debt.what’s more: large part debt central bank withdraw

course, due diminishedmarket discipline, also lack rigour apply fiscal rules. i come back thislater.this fiscal environment could lead situation monetary policy come politicalpressure make high level

ofexuberance real estate market euro area whole. yet there’s deny thatsome national market risk overheating, competent financial stability authoritiesof euro-area country like ireland, netherlands

policy cannot turn blind eye rise financial stability risk could getcentral bank trouble regard safeguard price stability future. in case, iskey concern financial market volatility sustainability public finance notlead postponement exit ultra-loose monetary policy, that’s take toreach price stability target. otherwise, monetary policy would take hostage fiscalpolicy markets. lady gentlemenit responsibility member state make sure public finance able copewith increase interest rate happen one day. and also responsibility ofmember state ensure sufficient growth economic convergence. contrary somebelieve – wish – it’s central bank put economy high growth path.or put metaphorically: enough car tank full “liquidity” want tospeed up. someone still rev engine. it’s politician hold key unlockingeconomic growth. that’s govern council tireless call structuralreforms. but ambition move high gear regard reforms,there signal already shift back low gear again. “going growth2016", recent

largely rely bank debt – relation gdp, aboutfour time unite state - improve harmonise regulation could help tomake equity market good fund source enterprises. and deep integratedeuropean capital

industry specific region, loss spread widely beyondthat region. creditors, hand, expose loss – except event ofinsolvency. in words: equity shock absorber, debt shock amplifier. 3. improve institutional framework emuladies gentlemenimplementing economic reform national european level way strengthen theeuro area important improve cohesion euro area, undoubtedly sufferedfrom financial sovereign debt crises. what’s also crucial, however, make theinstitutional set emu stable restore trust, instance abide agreedrules. the financial sovereign debt crisis euro area bore one major characteristic incommon: saw core economic principle violated: liability principle. germaneconomist walter eucken, one found father germany’s social marketeconomy, say aptly: "those reap benefit must also bear costs."if bank assume big fail, tempt make implicitinsurance take excessive risks, expense society large. this exactly whathappened financial crisis. this kind implicit insurance altogether unfamiliar tothe framework emu, single monetary policy exist alongside 19 largely autonomouseconomic fiscal policies. a crisis teach us, set-up potentially expose emu tovulnerability. because end day, community may foot bill unhealthydevelopments individual member state wish prevent stability union awhole come threat.the prospect able spread consequence unsustainable policy across entiremonetary union might weaken incentive run sound policies, particular healthybudgetary policy. this institutional safeguard put place euro waslaunched: stability growth pact, bail-out clause, ban monetaryfinancing governments. unfortunately, however, safeguard unable preventpublic debt balloon euro-area countries. the crisis play role this, alsothat fiscal rule repeatedly violate capital market didn’t sanction thesebreaches bail-out clause lack credibility.when doubt debt sustainability euro-area member state surface thesovereign debt crisis, urgently-taken rescue measure help prevent crisis fromescalating. but mutualising fiscal liability substantial scale. economic andfiscal policies, hand, essentially remain national prerogative, though fiscal67 5 / 9bis central bankers' speech rule admittedly adapted. a result, balance liability control hasbeen throw kilter.however, strike even balance liability control crucial functioningof emu. theoretically, two possible way restore balance: deep integration, ormore individual national responsibility part member states.the first solution would create fiscal union centralise decision-making powers.while fiscal union would guarantee sound fiscal policymaking, could certainly mitigate thedeficit bias individual member states. and interestingly, even karl otto pöhl, formerbundesbank president member delors commission, “fiscal unionapproach” intuitive one: “in monetary union irreversibly fix exchange rates, theweak would become ever weak strong ever stronger. we would thus experience greattensions real economy europe. for reason alone, monetary union without thesimultaneous integration field like fiscal policy well regional social policy iscompletely inconceivable."but let’s honest here: recent political development show fiscal union approach noton cards: the outcome brexit referendum maybe least partly outcome theitalian constitutional referendum lay bare scepticism european project atendency reject integration steps. furthermore, survey reveal many citizen inthe eu doubt whether exist process integration still sustainable. and possiblynot unrelated fact ongoing debate right response crisis euroarea bring open persistent difference opinion fiscal economicpolicy matters. this astonish euro-area country actuallyalready establish consensus appropriate role fiscal policy, document inthe stability growth pact. so build trust rule already today paramountbefore engage major new integration steps.to cut long story short: fiscal union, would require member state surrendersubstantial national sovereignty, hardly seem feasible moment. and long there’s nowillingness transfer national sovereignty european level, basis formutualising sovereign risk – that’s proposal establish european depositinsurance scheme (edis) isn’t right institutional response restore balance betweenliability control euro area.as long action take national level, draft insolvency laws, highstocks government bond banks’ balance sheet substantial impact thehealth financial institutions, edis would allow risk national decision shift theeuropean level. this would send wrong incentive bank investor alike. themutualisation risk would go hand hand necessary mutualisation control rights– irrespective single supervisory mechanism put place.the second way restore balance liability control, meanwhile, would tostrengthen maastricht approach base individual responsibility. this would leaveeconomic fiscal policy, well ultimate liability public debt, hand theindividual member states. but could decentralise approach work good futurethan do past?only five minute away here, visit magritte museum. rené magritte oncesaid: "i saw uffizi gallery florence, it’s bad postcard better." whether ornot would agree that, impression might say fiscal rules.it enough fiscal rule euro area exist paper: principle also tobe apply reality.although rule change crisis, european commission grant 6 / 9bis central bankers' speech flexibility interpret them. and use flexibility quite time far – alwaysto interpret rule loosely. in addition, recent statement commission show thather interest enforce rule continue decline. a result, bind force ofthe budgetary rule weak ever before, see, instance, budgetarydevelopments france, spain portugal.one way ensure rule bind would install new independentauthority, fiscal council. this institution would expose political conflict ofinterest commission, ass whether national budget comply thestability growth pact hammer political compromise interest thedifferent member states. of course, european council ultimately hold key thesuccess budgetary control. it determination enforce rule support thecommission strict interpretation all-important."debt two-edged sword. use wisely moderation, clearly improve welfare. but,when use imprudently excess, result disaster.” this statement byformer bi chief economist stephen cecchetti colleague madhusudan mohanty andfabrizio zampolli direct private debt also public debt. they show thatexcessively high private public debt risk financial stability also toeconomic growth. accord estimations, euro area already dangerzone – least regard corporate debt, 105% gdp, also term public debt, at91%. and one reason effective limit government debt urgentlyneeded.binding fiscal rule institution observe adherence one component aconsistent reform agenda. additionally, important capital market resume role ofdisciplining national fiscal policy. a enterprises, deeply indebted country ought payhigher interest rates. this happen bail-out clause maastricht treaty reallyhas teeth. therefore, must possible restructure public debt without pose major risk tothe financial system.the july edition bundesbank’s monthly report describe need do makethis possible. there two reform i’d like mention following.first, need sever sovereign-bank nexus. a strong inter-linkage bank andsovereigns increase probability bail-out member state weakensincentives risk-oriented pricing. and precisely sovereign-bank nexus contributedto mutual intensification crisis euro area, bank suffer decliningprices sovereign bond balance sheet country struggle bank theirterritory.the european bank union already mark huge step towards untangle dangerousembrace. however, end, complement bank union, also crucial doaway preferential treatment sovereign debt bank regulation. this imply thatsimilar banks’ lend private sector sovereign exposure need back bycapital also part large exposure regime.a second measure concern design european stability mechanism’s (esm’s) financialassistance programmes. the esm provide resource country apply foran esm financial assistance programme. however, fund generally use tocover budget deficits, also redeem mature sovereign bonds. by implication, aprogramme activated, european taxpayer are, essence, bail respective country’screditors. if haircut end way restore country’s debt sustainability,taxpayers, rather investors, would shoulder bill. this exactly foster anywillingness part member state agree restructure programme country’s debt.instead truly viable solution reached, push come shove, strategy of8 7 / 9bis central bankers' speech muddle would win day.that’s bundesbank propose add clause government bond euro-areacountries automatically extend maturity bond three year member statein question apply esm assistance. this way, initial creditor would remain liable, ifthe government debt really need restructured, could do orderly fashionwithout jeopardise financial stability.our proposal would help sever one direction sovereign-bank nexus: bank would bebetter shield deterioration public finances. the financial crisis showed, however, thatwobbling bank lead stumble sovereigns. to cut direction nexus, financialmarket regulation already improve substantially. in euro area, common restructuringand resolution regime (the single resolution mechanism) bank supervision body theaegis ecb (the single supervisory mechanism, ssm) established.the single resolution mechanism bank recovery resolution directive (brrd),which assure harmonise implementation rule throughout member states,substantially strengthen principle individual responsibility bank sector, therebyreducing likelihood public bail-outs. however, first line defence make bankresolution le likely establishment high capital requirement bank wasalready decide principle basel committee bank supervision almost exactly sixyears ago.that’s timely implementation basel iii important. this would also reduce regulatoryuncertainty bank view grave burden them. but i want also reiterate thatfinalising basel iii - i.e. regard design banks’ internal risk-based model – shouldn’tlead additional significant increase banks’ capital requirements, outcome shouldalso regionally balanced. the fact common equity tier 1 (cet1) directlysupervised ssm bank increase financial crisis 12.8% mid-2016, thislevel well unchanged aggregate capital demand supervisory review andevaluation process (srep) 2017 around 10%, take sign improvedresilience european bank sector. 4. conclusionto sum up, i strongly convince take responsibility national circumstance andpolicy decision away member state would help neither country peoplenor european project. strengthen individual responsibility appear betterapproach.ladies

society general. 2. increase digitisation also make sector vulnerable destructive hacker attacks, danmark nationalbank sector continuously work prevent this. *** the dane go digital – much so. there mobile phone people denmark, nearly home online. in fact, digital readiness high denmark anywhere else. [chart 1] technological advance change way bank operate. new possibility pave way number initiative make financial sector efficient. this benefit sector, benefit danes. with increase digitisation, process automate customer increasingly serve themselves. this reduce need branch employee – trend see year chart shows. [chart 2] 5 december 2016 page 2 5 technology make digitisation competitive parameter, mean bank try attract customer offer best digital products. however, also open door increase competition new actors, able enter area use completely dominate banks. competition good, indication le competition future. in fact, expect fierce competition result eu's new payment service directive, psd2, could game changer financial sector. psd2 allow third party – customer's consent – gain direct access perform transaction customer's bank account. a third party could e.g. coffee chain, airline company another bank one customer deposit account. the point psd2 allow new actor offer payment service without provide deposit accounts. once get foot door, also able offer services, loans, actually source income bank – unlike payment services. the danish bank good move time develop digital products. example mobile payment solutions, become popular among danes. these solution help prevent foreign actor gain significant market share denmark now. obviously limit size danish market also play role. increase digitisation make heavy demand individual bank keep technological advance remain competitive. that expensive. typically require substantial investment, respect size bank factor. the large bank good position develop digital solutions. conversely, small bank rely collaboration e.g. data centre large bank order able offer solution request customers. digital development may increase spread small large banks, large bank typically benefit economy scale. so increase digitisation contribute downward trend number banks. [chart 3] page 3 5 *** increase digitisation also involve degree vulnerability. the financial sector rely complex it systems. every day, nearly kr. 600 billion transfer account via systems. that

modern-day threat radically different may affect society whole. in historical perspective, cybercrime new type crime, commit herning, hong kong anywhere else. we already witness many attack financial

terrorism actual state-sponsored attacks. an extensive attack affect several critical actor system e.g. payment infrastructure could potentially paralyse whole sector significant part while. hence, unauthorised access financial sector computer could constitute systemic risk ultimately threaten financial stability. even le serious attack – occur repeatedly – weaken confidence financial system. this would particularly critical happen time sector already struggle – autumn 2008, example. that systemic angle make cyber threat issue danmark nationalbank. one reason systemic risk danish bank

numerous credit institution situation non-viability. to minimise systemic risk prevent serious deterioration financial stability, substantial state aid form capital grant across eu 2008 2014. in country spain, belgium unite kingdom, figure around 5% gdp, germany netherlands 2% 3.5%, greece ireland aid excess 20% 30% gdp, respectively. give severity high public cost financial crisis, response international authority resolute. first, solvency requirement appreciably strengthened, increase resilience financial system and, therefore, reduce likelihood similar crisis future. further, measure set place mitigate effect bank crises, occur, public coffer economy general. a regard solvency requirements, reform agenda practically concluded, await basel committee’s final agreement so-called

base regulatory reform area work financial stability board (fsb) conduct behest g-20 follow lehman brother debacle. in 2011 fsb publish key attribute effective resolution regime financial

core function restructure least possible cost taxpayer. the key attribute envisage availability recovery resolution plan institution set roadmap ahead potential crisis situation. lastly, establish principle whereby bank shareholder creditor bear bulk cost crisis. use parlance profession, “bail-out” (or rescue bank public funds) disappear replace “bail-in” (generation funds, capable absorb

despite undeniable progress new resolution framework adopt europe entails, practical implementation subject major challenge i would like highlight today, draw fact brrd shortly revise basis recently submit legislative proposal european commission. accordingly, i shall first refer general aspect european resolution regulations. next, i shall look loss-absorption requirement bank creditors, one central aspect regulations. and i conclude brief comment strategic nature. 2 general aspect european regulation the european union, reflect fsb’s second peer review resolution regime publish 2016, one jurisdiction key attribute rigorously implemented. allow highlight main features. first, regulation consider resolution alternative mechanism ordinary insolvency procedure mercantile realm, applicable bank specific circumstance pertain public interest. in particular, resolution shall applicable bank whose failure may generate risk financial stability, give perform critical functions. second, use public fund support vulnerable institution severely restricted. the contribution form state aid – except receive connection stress test – understand symptom institution’s non-viability and, therefore, may precipitate resolution or, appropriate, liquidation mercantile term institution. once institution declare resolution, regulation require bail-in creditors. the ensue assumption loss must exceed minimum amount equivalent 8% bank’s liability prerequisite attain access public funds, include single resolution fund. lastly, able carry bail-in, institution liable subject resolution, i.e. which, give significance, would wind event insolvency, require hold minimum volume loss-absorbing instrument event resolution. this know mrel (minimum require eligible liabilities) requirement. 5/10 accordingly, european regulation precisely tailor new resolution principle contain provision minimise likelihood crisis result disbursement sizeable public funds. that said, challenge pose practical implementation provision manifold. for example, relative rigidity state receive public aid generally imply non-viability institution and, therefore, facilitate activation resolution (or, appropriate, winding-up) process, considerably constrain supervisor’s management financial crises. it might advisable make aspect regulation flexible, albeit maintaining, event, subjection public support prevail state aid arrangement manage european commission. yet main challenge industry supervisor stems, understanding, potential implication new resolution framework banks’ business model structure bank sector. allow expand this. the demand regulation would point, principle, configuration financial system that, simple terms, would comprise two group relatively differentiate banks. on one hand, would group make relatively small institutions, would perform function critical industry whole. in situation non-viability institution would subject liquidation ordinary insolvency procedure resolution, give bankruptcy institution would deem generate harmful effect stability financial system whole. a result, institution would oblige hold minimum loss-absorbing liability nor, naturally, would access single resolution fund. hence insolvency institution would precipitate insolvency proceed whereunder holder deposit cover deposit guarantee fund would enjoy protection beyond provide institution’s net worth. give likelihood that, future, ordinary insolvency procedure apply frequently past financial institution systemic, may advisable consider specific adjustment mercantile regulation apply cases. the formal involvement deposit guarantee fund management insolvency process might option worth considering. on hand, second group institutions, normally big size, whose potential failure would consider public importance give harmful effect stability financial system might ensue. this group would, therefore, liable pursue resolution processes. to end, regulations, resolution plan institution ensure continuity critical function circumstances. thus, general, plan envisage business reorganisation, restructure segregation measure institution reach point non-viability provide availability sufficient minimum volume fund eligible liability (the aforementioned mrel), enable loss absorb institution’s capital base shore up, necessary. 6/10 indeed, degree stringency ultimately adopt respect mrel requirement may determine relative size two group bank indicated, i.e. may wind may resolved. in particular, demand mrel requirement entail need susceptible bank subject resolution issue large volume eligible liability market might assumable certain type banks. this might case bank pursue traditional retail bank model, fund essentially capital raise deposits, little tradition participation capital markets. what involve potentially numerous group banks, necessarily small size. consider that, single supervisory mechanism (ssm), 70% significant institution list markets, almost 60% never issue convertible instrument almost one-quarter finance subordinate debt. allow focus important aspect european regulations, namely mrel, foreseeably subject discussion forthcoming passage revise directive. 3 loss-absorption requirement (mrel) the stringency mrel requirement determine nature eligible instrument minimum require volume thereof. regard nature eligible instruments, mrel fulfil objective provide orderly absorption loss creditor recapitalisation bank, eligible instrument must conceivably consistent seniority bank’s liability stipulate national insolvency regulations, must evidence sufficient degree stability bank undergo serious difficulties. that would suggest definition mrel essentially include capital instrument plus debt instrument le privilege status deposit insolvency peck order. the consideration wholesale deposit one year eligible, exclude european commission’s proposal, undoubtedly much discuss legislative proceedings, give special nature instrument debatable availability absorb loss resolution process. yet present seniority liability establish regulation differ one member state another, specifically regard status senior debt relation deposits. that hamper homogeneity mrel requirement prevent development integrate market senior debt convertible equity event resolution. accordingly, european commission’s recent proposal, introduce new category senior debt instruments, subordinate deposits, step right direction. in event, critical element mrel-setting policy determination minimum volume eligible liability funds. under current regulations, within 7/10 bank union, single resolution board (srb) determine, case case, volume significant institution (which supervise directly ssm), well non-significant institution engage cross-border activity whose supervision assume ssm, follow consultation prudential supervisor. for moment, srb publicly voice inclination stringent approach, ensure extensive availability loss-absorbing instrument bank balance sheets. indeed, way indication, advocate institution subject resolution loss-absorbing capacity volume equivalent regulatory capital requirement (the so-called loss-absorption component) ability restore immediately minimum level require (or recapitalisation component). however, mrel requirement like arise mechanistic formula indicate may entail high need respect issuance eligible instrument – subordinate debt convertible bond – numerous banks, owe above-mentioned reasons. further, issuance requirement would concentrate period time institution concerned, hamper market take-up. but, moreover, cost bank issue instrument may, many cases, prove burdensome. by way illustration consider follow example. let u take bank finance capital deposit comfortably meet – e.g. surplus 2 pp – regulatory capital requirement, place example 10% risk-weighted asset (rwas). if mrel stand twice regulatory capital, i.e. 20% rwas, bank, whose position would differ greatly present large number bank traditional business model, would need issue eligible instrument equivalent 8% rwas order meet requirement set. assuming, somewhat optimistically present, issuance cost great return equity (roe), additional financial expense compliance new mrel requirement would entail would account almost half bank’s profit tax. this example illustrate maintain excessively demand requirement would exert significant pressure profitability portion bank industry, call question business model mean negligible number institutions. hence, worthwhile rigorously adjust mrel-setting policy avoid non-desirable impact viability specific institution business models, without course distort rationale behind requirement. a reasonable approach would adjust mrel requirement – loss-absorbing recapitalisation component – take consideration least three factors. first, balance assessment volume loss bank foreseeably post time go resolution; second, ensue change level capital require bank undergo resolution process, owe change size balance sheet risk profile; and, lastly, resolution strategy bank question. 8/10 concern first point, volume mrel require absorb bank’s loss might adjust downwards take account that, generally, bank declare resolution fail meet regulatory requirement and, therefore, deplete – due loss – capital hold. secondly, restructure require resolution typically involve appreciable reduction size latent risk bank’s balance sheet. it therefore reasonable think regulatory capital subsequent resolution low require beforehand. thirdly, bail-in tool (loss absorption recapitalisation conversion debt capital) one resolution strategy banks. resolution plan may envisage measure sale business creation, segregation certain asset liabilities, so-called bridge banks, perform, resolution, bank’s critical function significantly small balance sheet. some resolution measure bail-in might potentially appropriate case commercial bank pursue traditional business model. the bank result resolution process strategy implement generally low capital requirement original institution and, therefore, low mrel might require it. i thus believe substantial leeway adjust mrel requirement basis accurate assessment capital need resolution process and, particular, strategy foresee bank’s resolution plans. 4 transition in light foregoing, even minimum volume loss-absorbing instrument bank revise downwards, new mrel demand may undeniably assume large number bank sufficiently lengthy transition period comply requirements. this transition period will, moreover, necessary market absorb large number issue limit period time. indeed, european commission’s recent proposal include possibility set bank time margin compliance mrel requirement, although margin would decide case-by-case basis resolution authority, i.e. srb, case bank union. admittedly, set relatively long transition period may add complexity resolution process manage period. a stated, current regulation require resolution fund activate institution absorb loss amount equivalent 8% liabilities. evidently, bank yet sufficient loss-absorbing debt instrument transition period over, establish requirement would meet haircut impose creditors, deposit-holders. while deposit cover national guarantee scheme would exclude loss-bearing, doubt step might prove destabilising. thus, ongoing revision directive, might wise add flexibility clause respect requirement establish use fund external bank concern 9/10 resolution processes, least duration transition period set fulfilment mrel requirements. lastly, conclude section, remark need coordination among different bank union authorities. the current regulation european commission’s proposal revision afford srb extensive discretion deciding, case case, question important objective volume mrel, nature eligible instrument transition regime. these decision interact appreciably solvency requirement set prudential supervisor give shape series regulatory demand may affect viability institution structure industry. a fruitful framework collaboration srb ssm thus need and, specifically, criterion srb develop exercise discretion afford regulation properly discuss prudential authority. 5 final remark in conclusion, i refer address intense work jurisdiction amend bank crisis management framework strengthen capacity available maintain financial stability without require massive use public funds, occur recent financial crisis. the progress make europe considerable, incorporate demand international standard regulations. the new resolution regulation pose considerable constraints, many case weighty determine factor solvency requirement financial institutions. it thus necessary harness ongoing revision european legislation subsequent re-definition policy pursue resolution authority fine-tune demand way provide orderly adjustment industry new regime. a early discussed, add flexibility requirement set transitional arrangement others may help here, also reinforce authorities’ ability manage crisis short medium term. all told, institution mindful new resolution framework require bank exceed certain size liable generate systemic risk ensure balance sheet structure allow resolution expense, essentially, shareholder creditors. they should, therefore, ensure business model compatible issuance loss-absorbing instrument capital market income statement allow remuneration supplementary risk new resolution regime entail holder bank debt. it thus seem likely several institution face objective difficulty adjust recently establish resolution framework. these new regulations, therefore, contribute reinforce perception excess capacity sector and, foreseeably, contribute promote change industry structure correct excess mean consolidation process give rise bank capable comfortably comply new demands. the supervisor’s role essentially consist set 10/10 place mean need seemingly inevitable adjustment process unfold orderly fashion possible. optimize potential, strengthen resiliencegovernor’s addressbank indonesia’sannual meetingjakarta, november 22nd 2016 table

answer question title speech. no, time scrap inflation target, case think i want to. the question course rhetorical. the reason i ask question i think focal point recent debate sweden, although usually express directly. follow financial crisis foundation monetary policy certainly discuss question around world. but feel debate drive sweden countries. monetary policy sweden often attract interest countries. one reason often among first implement change monetary policy framework thus become interest object study. a well-known, sweden one first country introduce inflation target early 1990s, many respect remain front edge since then. for instance, riksbank one central bank publish forecast policy rate possibly central bank minute state board member say monetary policy meetings.1 inflation low long sweden many country in recent years, international interest sweden object study due economic development here, measure riksbank taken, rather change monetary policy framework. despite swedish economy develop relatively well since global financial crisis 2008-2009 (see figure 1), inflation begin fall early sweden rest world. this mean inflation undershoot target low many country long time (see figure 2). this turn contribute riksbank consider necessary cut policy rate zero, * i would like thank mikael apel help write text, elizabeth nilsson translate english, goran katinic help slide björn andersson, gina bayoumi, claes berg, charlotta edler, gabriela guibourg, marianne nessén, marianne stern anders vredin valuable comments. 1 another completely fresh example riksbank’s think introduce digital currency (see skingsley, 2016). 2 [20] central bank do far.2 the long period low inflation also start debate regard grind riksbank’s monetary policy inflation target, far i tell intense countries. in sense, too, one therefore way say pioneers. what i intend today first say word debate. most often, criticism merely state “monetary policy riksbank wrong”. the reason vary: negative policy rate healthy, house price rising, krona weak economy already develop well. there usually detail reason consequence would policy shift another direction. in particular, often missing, i argue crucial, discussion advantage inflation target long apply consequence would riksbank abandon it. after discuss debate monetary policy, i intend conclude look ahead examine problem possibility monetary policy future. here, i focus particular scenario monetary policy make expansionary despite delay reach inflation target. in sweden, policy rate negative since february 2015. this uncontroversial policy. the criticism divide two types. these often express simultaneously difficult distinguish one another, i think point try keep argument separate. one sort criticism negative policy rate something unnatural unhealthy. the negative policy rate wrong policy current economic situation. let discus argument one time. negative policy rate unnatural unhealthy itself? one dispute whether negative policy rate unnatural unhealthy, certainly unusual. this apply policy rate also nominal interest rate general. prior 2015 never negative nominal interest rate sweden. on hand, negative real interest rates, is, nominal interest rate adjust inflation, occur then. the short-term real interest rate le constantly negative since 2009. if look back time, negative real interest rate unusual either (see figure 3). of course one might think rather unnatural need pay lend money someone, pay borrowing. but usually purchase power concern with, really clear, one think it, unnatural negative nominal interest rate negative real interest rate. if one lend money, one case able consume le one regain one lent, include interest. in case negative real interest rate, inflation high interest payment, one therefore unable buy much sum one receive borrower. if instead nominal interest rate negative, negative return write 2 danmark nationalbank, european central bank, bank japan swiss national bank also negative policy rate (a list central banks’ policy rate find centralbanksnews.info). it worth note almost quarter global gdp currently produce country policy rate negative. 3 [20] contract start, say, perhaps many feel go normal social economic conventions. but regard solely term purchase power, negative nominal interest rate anything special, case special negative real interest rate. general interest rate low negative moreover, fact repo rate negative mean general interest rate sweden negative. the repo rate special short-term rate riksbank's monetary policy counterparties encounter, include major swedish banks. when repo rate negative, bank pay interest riksbank, bank system whole liquidity surplus must deposit riksbank. the short-term interbank rates, interest loan banks, government rate follow repo rate zero. however, bank introduce negative deposit rate household companies. only economic agents, primarily financial institutions, large company municipalities, experience negative deposit rate, case also borrow negative interest rate. company force expend certain amount resource avoid negative return funds, appear succeed relatively well this. cut repo rate zero thus total contribute push interest rates, mean interest rate become negative general public. good profitability among bank sign decline demand another fear negative interest rate reduce banks’ profitability, could lead high lend rate low supply credit. the reason say banks’ deposit margin, is, difference interest deposit lending, would decline difficult cut deposit rate zero. however, swedish banks’ profitability good recent years, especially relation bank euro area (see figure 4). the negative repo rate contribute make extensive market fund le expensive, time lend volume increased. in low interest rate environment also tendency income fee commission rise, demand banks’ asset management increase people want invest example funds. nor appear difficult expensive adapt it system manage negative interest rates. the riksbank's overall assessment negative interest rate little perhaps even positive effect banks’ profitability.3 a negative nominal interest rate new phenomenon, nevertheless natural meet scepticism give rise various psychological reactions. one fear along line negative policy rate would perceive crisis signal would increase uncertainty among economic agents. i believe reaction kind take seriously. that reaction one reason i take question today. however, far sign decline demand result concern among household companies. on contrary, domestic demand important drive force behind 3 for detail review, see article “how low negative interest rate affect banks’ profitability?” monetary policy report april 2016. the riksbank's conclusion field share turk (2016). 4 [20] improve economic activity sweden. in addition, sentiment household corporate sector good, accord various confidence indicator (see figure 5). it also worth note context fairly intensive international discussion whether negative policy rate include central banks’ normal arsenal go forward, weapon could use special need arise. one advocate ben bernanke, former chairman federal reserve.4 he argue negative policy rate many advantage relation raise inflation target, also discuss mean create great room manoeuvre future recessions. it worth note international discussion exists, contrast picture often paint swedish debate – negative policy rate isolate strange invention riksbank central banks. negative policy rate wrong policy current economic situation? the second form criticism, i mention earlier, negative interest rate wrong policy current economic situation. one reflection one make criticism really concern repo rate low, specifically negative. low global interest rate due monetary policy there reason begin reflect interest rate low. one important observation downward trend real interest rate around world couple decade (see figure 6). it entirely clear happen global real interest rate currently low, general term due willingness save long great willingness invest. another significant factor trend growth deteriorate many country follow financial crisis. it important realise global interest rate today low factor unrelated monetary policy. and global real interest rate important determinant long-term real interest rate individual countries. monetary policy continuously relate long-term real interest rate. to put simply, monetary policy give rise interest rate long-term real interest rate, policy expansionary. correspondingly, monetary policy tight interest rate exceed long-term real interest rate. however, monetary policy neither influence deviate long run long-term real interest rate.5 these aspect important, instance regard discussion various possible negative side-effects expansionary monetary policy. one argument low interest rate constitute danger pension return pension save become low. but regard pensions, long-term return important. this mean long-term real interest rate relevant variable. the solution problem thus central bank raise policy rates, much le riksbank single-handedly. to make interest rate persistently higher, one need implement 4 bernanke (2016). rogoff (2016) reason similarly. 5 see, instance, rachel smith (2015) detail discussion quantitative estimate global real equilibrium rate. 5 [20] structural measure push long-term real interest rate. this unfortunately easy do. with reasonable estimate long-term real interest rate, riksbank's monetary policy recent year clearly expansionary. the reason riksbank conduct policy inflation undershoot target long time long-term inflation expectation fall worryingly low levels. around turn year 2014-15 situation particularly serious. expectation inflation five year ahead fall way target tendency towards acceleration decline (see figure 7). the riksbank therefore assess necessary conduct expansionary policy safeguard confidence inflation target. good reason preserve confidence inflation target there good reason safeguard confidence. when economic agent collective picture price develop future, become easy plan long term. the inflation target contribute coordinate expectation economy thereby lay foundation smoothly-functioning price-setting wage formation. a i see it, good wage formation system today perhaps great achievement inflation targeting. during 1970s 1980s, wage formation constant source disruption swedish economy. it cause considerable uncertainty many companies. one force manage cost problem poor competitiveness recur devaluation krona. the situation generally untenable eventually lead extensive economic crisis begin 1990s. an important insight credible inflation target give rise beneficial self-reinforcing cycle. if expectation line inflation target, price-setting wage formation adapt expectations, actual price development also become consistent inflation target. on hand, expectation become stick level low, one instead negative self-reinforcing effect, mean central bank struggle much hard attain inflation target. this underline significance take resolute action particularly long-term inflation expectation begin deviate fairly substantially target level. there also good reason target 2 per cent lower. perhaps important sufficient scope cut policy rate future inflation become low economic activity wanes. a low inflation target would mean reach policy rate's low bind often longer. this currently international discussion whether central banks’ inflation target raised.6 a somewhat paradoxical observation many swedish debate critical negative policy rate also critical high inflation targets, often even advocate low inflation targets. but unchanged low inflation target, become even important policy rate cut zero. a reason i believe underestimate wage formation deteriorate average inflation low. the reason practice prove difficult low nominal wages. if inflation low nominal wage cannot 6 see, example, blanchard et al. (2010), ball (2014) rosengren (2015). 6 [20] lowered, become difficult adjust real wage individual company different sectors. this ultimately bring high unemployment poor productivity growth economy. these problem mitigate certain underlie inflation rate economy. underestimate significance monetary policy exchange rate development one problem criticize monetary policy reference current economic situation one take account fact current strong swedish economy course large degree due monetary policy conducted. it little like take medicine connection illness cure draw conclusion unnecessary take medicine. on point i feel event spring 2015 good illustration. the ecb announce january intend buy security slightly year come equivalent sek 10,000 billion (around 2.5 time size swedish gdp). this indeed substantial monetary policy intervention. within course week krona exchange rate appreciate significantly euro, almost 9.65 krona per euro 9.10. this large appreciation almost 6 per cent, real danger lay fact could much worse. during 2014 spring 2015 u dollar british pound sterling appreciate 15 25 per cent euro. there agreement market difference monetary policy decisive different development path currency swedish krona euro. if swedish krona situation speak appreciate level dollar sterling, total appreciation would around 30 per cent. this would mean serious deterioration competitiveness swedish export industry would entirely change play field swedish economy (see figure 8). under circumstance would certainly growth vicinity 4 per cent 2015. my impression risk swedish economy expose stage severely underestimate many commentators. they appear assume strong performance 2015 would happen le regardless monetary policy krona exchange rate. the fact riksbank february react introduce negative repo rate begin buy government bond consider play major role. although possible outcome would quite bad i outline above, i think extremely misguide assume monetary policy le insignificant. there also good reason reminder circumstance tend forgotten. the current debate sometimes give impression swedish economy time situation almost overheating. but fact fairly recently, accord empirical estimates, attain level resource utilisation describe normal. thus, although estimate uncertain, swedish economy appear produce below, rather above, long-term capacity several year follow financial crisis. 7 [20] confidence inflation target unimportant possible maintain different policy? one thing rarely done, i think utmost importance, spell practical consequence criticism. it course easy agree riksbank need defend confidence inflation target, monetary policy would need expansionary repo rate would perhaps need negative. one may therefore draw conclusion say monetary policy wrong argue one following: either confidence inflation target important, least le important things, riksbank able conduct le expansionary policy still able safeguard confidence inflation target. the criticism rarely clear regard statement base on, interpretation base first claim – important maintain confidence inflation target. unfortunately, rarely develop detail reasoning. typically, criticism tend stop monetary policy inappropriate, reflection merit credible inflation target – particular advantage current target long apply – almost always lacking. essentially criticism concern whether inflation target when think it, criticism fact quite remarkable. what actually say even confidence inflation target begin fail quite clearly, riksbank maintain it. in sense, one argue discussion essentially whether inflation target, perhaps even whether pursue inflation-targeting policy all, although rarely express way. i think one early parallel. it long ago second half 1994, riksbank decide introduce inflation target, come force 1995. the reason delay decision january 1993 target come force give inflationary impulse arise krona allow float november 1992 time wane. during summer 1994, inflation inflation expectation begin rise.7 most analysts’ forecast point inflation overshoot target broad margin, various indicator show long-term expect inflation rate, never close 2 per cent, 4 per cent. the inflation-targeting policy thus face first real challenge riksbank begin raise repo rate. despite entirely logical measure prevail situation, meet strong criticism part society. a number member largely politically-appointed general council riksbank, body make monetary policy decisions, enter reservation decision. some even consider interest-rate monetary policy lead sweden “economic suicide”.8 the important measure, said, achieve 7 see bäckström (2003) description situation time. 8 see lo (1994). it add lo fairly soon afterwards come support inflation target support ever since. 8 [20] low real interest rate. the criticism live quite long time, probably quite essential demonstrate time inflation target take seriously. this time i remember riksbank urge best maintain confidence inflation target. the criticism largely due inflation-targeting policy new – i said, inflation target yet even come force. it le easy today, twenty year positive economic developments, inflation target cornerstone, see riksbank urge low ambitions. perhaps development positive long one feel existence credible nominal anchor long important. if so, i convince mistake. difficult see reasonable alternative policy conduct but development household debt house prices? don't give reason change monetary policy? the riksbank previously use repo rate try subdue upturn debt house prices. but fairly modest scale – – period confidence inflation target appear firmly rooted.9 in recent years, hand, sign confidence begin undermined, change condition rather drastically. it long possible both; riksbank force choose. i think absolute necessity case prioritise confidence inflation target. it riksbank's main task. in opinion, rather obvious problem house market deep currently low interest rate. house price household debt rise parallel almost constantly twenty years, time interest rate relatively high low (see figure 9). another observation underline claim interest rate play lead role development house price germany quite different sweden, despite rather similar monetary policy (see figure 10). a i see it, reasonable give advocate riksbank shall sacrifice main task – maintain confidence inflation target – perhaps attain ease regard house price debt, would case temporary unless measure taken. if attain long-term sustainable development swedish economy way around manage risk house credit market target measure house policy, taxation policy macroprudential policy. anything else would strange ultimately untenable allocation role economic policy. 9 see, example, jansson (2014). 9 [20] could confidence inflation target maintain le expansionary policy? a i noted, analyst would probably argue important defend inflation target, could do le expansionary policy, repo rate would need cut zero. this view i great understand for. however, many argument it. the expansionary policy conduct riksbank indeed lead inflation turn upwards long-term inflation expectation close 2 per cent (see figure 11). but upturn inflation bumpy fragile sign slow recent months. moreover, upturn fairly large degree base krona relatively weak sustainability rest assumption krona appreciate rapidly go forward. it probable development would look quite different high repo rate. and context significance repo rate half percentage point high underestimated. it particularly difficult imagine scenario krona case would strengthened, possibly quite significantly, economic activity would slow inflation inflation expectation would turn downwards. this relate different type criticism argue negative interest rate effect even counter-productive. the grind criticism appear inflation attain target despite repo rate negative. this course true, question one ask thing would look riksbank cut rate much did. of course never know certain, difficult see convince reason inflation would now, even higher, repo rate stay zero. and context risk strong krona appreciation need deal spring 2015 recalled. unclear argument regard exchange rate welfare before i continue, i would like say something one type criticism common recently. it appear base idea exchange rate regard measure welfare argue “swedes become poorer” krona weak, vice versa. a riksbank's expansionary monetary policy assume important explanation weak krona, riksbank thus consider contribute increase poverty. this take justification say monetary policy wrong. i difficulty understand link exchange rate welfare. a weak krona tend increase price good import. but import good include representative consumption basket inflation measure by. and problem today inflation high, rather reverse. it thus case weak krona significantly erode daily consumption. for man street weak krona noticeable become expensive travel abroad. this course unfortunate, nevertheless seem fairly far-fetched compare reduce welfare increase poverty. the side coin course swedish company find easy export 10 [20] able increase employment. a establish measure welfare gdp gdp per capita, consumption consumption per capita. negative policy rate panacea before i go on, let note conclusion negative repo rate whole expect effects. it probably contribute inflation high would otherwise fear might happen repo rate pass zero mark far realised. have say this, i would like point i see negative policy rate panacea problem monetary policy face recent years, environment global real interest rate low. there international discussion, mostly academic level, monetary policy become effective central banks’ policy rate make negative – is, low bind could principle eliminate entirely.10 but personally i regard practically implementable solution. negative policy rate already regard scepticism easy imagine opinion would cut far general public’s deposit rate also pass beyond zero mark – or, even worse, one various electronic money solution force people “pay save”.11 i definitely believe scope cut repo rate somewhat necessary. but one cannot ignore fact scope limited. it course also possible make purchase securities, even reasonable assume positive effect wane sooner late complication gradually increase. i would like emphasise, avoid misunderstanding, i still count inflation develop line riksbank's forecast attain 2 per cent safely within current forecast period. but nevertheless important necessary seriously consider evaluate alternative scenarios. it may take long attain target... the idea behind recent policy avoid exchange rate appreciate rapidly way hold inflation economic activity take drive force. thus, plan try permanently battle fundamentals.12 this far work relatively well, begin approach critical stage economic activity suppose take baton. one cannot escape fact inflation outcome somewhat worry recently. it mostly cpi show clear upturn. the underlie rate inflation measure cpif exclude energy price year develop le sideways, even show tendency decline slightly. the inflation outcome come month important. 10 see, example, goodfriend (2016). 11 for detail discussion problem negative policy rates, see alsterlind et al (2015) nessén (2016). 12 however, part i convince fundamental currently need lead significant krona appreciation real terms, see minute riksbank's monetary policy meet september october. 11 [20] the condition economic activity soon take main drive force behind inflation nevertheless look good, give positive development see real economy. but also reason consider possibility baton changeover might go smoothly hope believe. one reason could economic activity sweden continue develop favourably presently assume will. another reason could force currently hold back inflation sweden country strong persistent expect – inflation propensity fallen, least temporarily. the first step probably make monetary policy expansionary. but i noted, room manoeuvre become limited. it possible quantify exactly exhausted, somewhere limit. we cannot rule possibility sooner late reach situation ass long possible desirable make policy even expansionary. if find situation – i emphasise – consequence could accept take long desirable attain inflation target. i would like emphasise hypothetical case would question “giving inflation target”. the advantage inflation target 2 per cent i describe would course still apply would continue best attain it. the difference would open possibility could take long previously assumed, without make monetary policy expansionary. ... aim policy would change if find situation would mean suddenly start conduct completely different policy begin raise repo rate, instance. there would still reason conduct policy expansionary possible, avoid take long necessary attain target. however, one consequence would riksbank's communication become important. the damage situation monetary policy long make expansionary, despite inflation expect undershoot target quite long time, much le general public convince target abandoned, merely question take long normal attain it. clarify would difficult hopefully impossible task. here important realise inflation control central bank long run. inflation ultimately, often put, monetary phenomenon determine expansionary monetary policy average (see figure 12). digitalisation, globalisation structural change push inflation certain period time, period well quite long. however, effect structural change inflation last ever. in long run, monetary policy determine rate inflation economy “rational” long-term inflation expectation therefore still line central bank's target price stability. if public make presumption, negative consequence take long attain inflation target much le serious. 12 [20] conclude comment let round off. my purpose two things. firstly, i try put recent debate monetary policy perspective. i discuss criticism raise policy general negative repo rate particular. a i hope i make clear, gap criticism. i note early main argument often merely monetary policy various reason wrong. what i feel often miss discussion advantage inflation target long apply consequence would riksbank abandon it. it new phenomenon debate fail answer important questions. in mid-1990s, inflation-targeting regime relatively new, lars e.o. svensson, scientific adviser riksbank late member executive board, argue debate often lack structure. at swedish economics associations’ proceed february 1996 call debater answer follow question explicitly implicitly: (i) do apply inflation target riksbank, another inflation target, target? (ii) do make forecast riksbank make different assessment? (iii) do know good way attain target?13 these question appear relevant today twenty year ago. secondly, i discuss one view situation take long inflation attain target, despite riksbank everything avoid happening. this situation expect find in, nevertheless reason seriously consider examine it. if situation arise, would important clearly communicate inflation target abandoned, prevent long-term inflation expectation fall excessively. a central bank determine inflation long run – inflation monetary phenomenon – also good reason expectation long-term inflation remain line target. this important maintain smoothly-functioning price-setting wage formation, also monetary policy able counteract future economic downturns. communicate difficult hopefully impossible task. reference alsterlind, jan, armelius, hanna, forsman, david, jönsson, björn wretman, anna-lena (2015), ”how far repo rate cut?”, economic commentary, no. 11, sverige riksbank. ball, laurence m.

take distinction (moral) support advocacy stable monetaryunion – monetary union action accountability align – monetary union inwhich rule observe agreement kept. keep promise crucial ensuringpublic acceptance monetary union.my stability-oriented stance monetary policy issue could well factor, youmight expect sound note two caution regard current ecb policy.however, govern council fundamentally sensible agreement place makeany public pronouncement current monetary policy week lead monetarypolicy meeting. and since monetary policy meet come week, i shall refrain frommaking comment subject

dangerous. thecentral bank constantly step breach elect politician even go far toattempt influence democratic process would lead politicisation could jeopardise itsindependence.the fact accommodative monetary policy buy time politician is, best, side effect,but must become objective monetary policy decisions. and give monetarypolicy stance maintain must depend entirely require safeguard price stability.my fellow ecb govern council member would probably say much thing.the accommodative monetary policy make fiscal consolidation, well reforms, appearless urgent. i think institutional reform make euro area stable. andthis precisely i wish talk briefly today.2 assessment italian referendumin context, must, course, include initial, provisional assessment implicationsof italian referendum. a know, majority italian voter reject constitutional reform inyesterday’s referendum. 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech there cause concern reform italy stall again. and would troublingdevelopment, italy. for year now, italy plague anaemic growth, veryhigh government debt pile bad debt banks’ balance sheets.to quote italian finance minister, “no” would end world; however, allthe important italy’s political class send convince signal will tacklethe root cause economic woes. 3 the institutional architecture monetary union need reformsminister state dr merk,you invite u attend award ceremony prinz-carl palace, whichhouses office bavaria’s prime minister regard one munich’s beautifulbuildings.it noteworthy building’s architect, karl von fischer, 21 year oldand still student receive commission design building. however, patron,a french clergyman name pierre de salabert, find fischer’s blueprint complex – andpossibly expensive – force architect scale back design. what build themain section representative facade shorten wing branch left.ladies gentlemen, i tell story, i’m sure know already?well, reason somehow remind construction european economic andmonetary union. and i’m say architect monetary union novices. but itdoes appear impossible give builder comprehensive blueprints, iswhy monetary union initially build one wing: single currency. the secondwing – single fiscal economic policy – intentionally leave out.this leave u single monetary policy euro area largely autonomous nationalfiscal economic policies.now, architect well aware edifice decisive weakness: the risk ofaccumulating excessive debt great monetary union country theirown currencies.one reason member state monetary union design borrow intheir currency. they therefore cannot meet payment obligation simply printingmoney – solution which, stability-oriented central bankers, generally non-starteranyway.another great incentive borrow monetary union anyconsequences rely increasingly capital market fund pass othermember states.and member state pledge maintain sound public finances, introducedupper limit annual budget deficit public debt levels, agree “no bail-out clause”that would prevent one member state assume liability debt another. they alsoprohibited central bank print money help cash-strapped euro-area governmentsthis design ensure member state liable debt cannot passthem member community. at end day, people behave aresponsible manner take responsibility actions. or, put slightly morebluntly: member state must “pay way".all ultimately intend protect single monetary policy come pressure 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech inflate away excessive level government debt monetisation. the found father ofthe monetary union well aware would loud cry monetary policy action ifthe soundness public finance risk time.the debt crisis euro area show u maastricht framework unable preventsovereign debt crisis also fail effectively counteract unsound economicdevelopments severe loss international competitiveness excessive currentaccount deficits.during crisis, well aware, set much-publicised european rescuepackages crisis take measure – include eurosystem – inorder prevent crisis escalating. but time, measure underminedthe principle individual national responsibility.although “no bail-out” rule still applies, reality, element communitised liability beengaining ground. this upset balance action accountability because, naturally,the member state will hand control.and call great joint liability euro area, say, form europeandeposit insurance scheme european unemployment insurance fund, name twoexamples.since member state evidently still reluctant cede sovereignty right europeanlevel 25 year ago, i think increase communitisation liability thewrong route take. and i sceptical call build second wing, tospeak, basis initiatives.in recent article frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper (faz), horst seehofer, thebavarian state premier wrote, “europe treaty-based community; can’t always get whatyou wish". look proposal future development euro area, however, issometimes possible get exactly impression can.we need restore balance action accountability. and, mind, onlyway strengthen individual national responsibility decentralisedframework."united diversity” europe’s motto since 2000, highlight fact europeanintegration regional diversity contradiction terms. and must notforget principle subsidiarity, likewise enshrine treaties, also stipulatesthat task transfer european level cannot performedadequately responsibility lie national regional level.strengthening individual national responsibility decentralise framework imply restoringthe credibility “no bail-out” clause. that exactly lack run-up thecrisis. the example switzerland show credible bail-out regime government debtis fundamentally possible. of course, bail-out principle function possible, extreme cases, torestructure sovereign debt without jeopardise stability financial system. theeuropean rescue measure motivate least fact consequence adisorderly sovereign insolvency unpredictable.the fear escalation financial crisis lead european taxpayers’ money beingused first line defence. that wasn’t really fair, contravene principle is,first foremost, shareholder investor must bear consequence theirdecisions. and go least way explain increasingly critical attitude 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech member public towards economic financial system.this why, number year ago, bundesbank propose automatic extension bondmaturities government face fund difficulties.so far, large part fund available european stability mechanism (esm) rescue fundhas use buy holder expire government bonds. this mean originalcreditors hook european taxpayer expose risk instead. our proposal ofextending maturity exist bond three years, say, government appliesfor esm assistance, would keep burden responsibility original creditors. they couldbe make jointly liable debt restructure take place late date.incidentally, would reinforce discipline function capital market response tounsound public finance would therefore preventive effect. the great risk aninsolvency, high premium potential creditor demand compensationfor provide funding.but would irresponsible rely solely market impose fiscal discipline. this issomething founder monetary union also realised, stability growthpact also contain rule debt. but use rule interpret freely thatalmost excuse accept exceed deficit limits?in response european commission’s recent appeal member state moreexpansionary fiscal policy, eurogroup president jeroen dijsselbloem recently stress that,in event conflict interest fiscal expansion excessive deficits, thecommission adhere pact.in sense, european commission’s take rule bring mind famous line fromgoethe’s faust: “two souls, alas! dwell breast". one soul, were, toguard treaties, see political institution repeatedly turn notjust one blind eye, sometimes two.this conflict aim really resolve responsibility monitor compliance withthe fiscal rule transfer independent agency – proposal back boththe bundesbank finance minister wolfgang schäuble.ladies gentlemenas i say earlier, way bail-out principle work financial systemreally able cope debt restructuring. this mean ensure banks, particular, haveenough equity capital able sustain loss potential debt restructure withoutjeopardising solvency.in international bodies, therefore, argue risk-appropriate capital back ofgovernment bond cap large exposure lend public debtors.incidentally, sovereign nation public debtors. federal state local authoritiesalso borrow money, case local authority often municipal bank provide themoney, thereby build cluster risks.the premise action accountability must go hand hand apply equally localgovernment level. in germany, too, federal state technically liable debt incurredby local authorities; however, exert substantial influence federal supervisionand municipal revenue-sharing scheme. however, state-level instrument arenot always use targeted, stability-oriented way. nor insolvency code localauthorities. 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech lender evidently assume respective federal state cover debt insolventmunicipality. this explain local authority apparently finance even aprecarious financial situation form excess balance sheet debt, without incur largerisk premiums.overall, clearly insufficient incentive municipality avoid excessive debt. this isshown least fact cash advance often high level sometimes stillincreasing. while hardly cash advance record early 1990s, level hassince rise sharply currently stand €50 billion, although i add bavarianmunicipalities make scarcely contribution this.the steep rise cash advance mean federal state set localgovernment debt relief consolidation programmes.in opinion, order effectively avert danger derail local authority finances, wouldbe worth think set municipal cash advances, matter policy, thescope respective federal state part debt brake, stipulate that, on,cash advance take federal state. we make recommendation thateffect october monthly report.ladies gentlemenfiscal solidarity key prerequisite stable currency stable monetary union. and thisprerequisite responsibility lie member state regions.competitiveness economic prosperity member state also vital stability, andagain, primarily national level course set this. i emphasise itpresents member state special challenges. and apply thecountries crisis, also suppose paragon virtue germany.at events, long-term outlook growth

refugee labour market also mentioned.this make important set right economic socio-political course orderto boost economic momentum ensure sustainability public finances. and let addthat decision make past year fulfil requirement.4 conclusionladies gentlemenas swiss musicologist peter benary say – surely apply speech well– “every end comforting; infinity comfortless.” i would like, therefore, conclude myremarks.in article frankfurter allgemeine i mention earlier, horst seehofer wrote: “whenwords warn come bavaria, speak loyalty concern europe andnot hostility.” i would like adopt maxim – replace “bavaria” “the bundesbank",of course.the bundesbank integral part eurosystem. we commit european ideaand see advantage single currency. however, want preserve monetaryunion union stability, must plot course wrong direction.in context, critical comment communitisation liability risk without a1 5 / 6bis central bankers' speech correspond transfer right sovereignty european level direct againsteurope. rather, express concern joint liability without joint control could cause long-term harm european idea.with mind, i thank warmly award bavarian europe medal.i read, way, 200-year history, prinz-carl palace beenredesigned, rededicate rebuild number times, probably put build somestrain.like palace, monetary union long original state. it currently go atransition period, except

generally. stijn, together bryan kelly hannolustig, point issue government guarantee may distort systemic risk indicators. in theamerican economic review year, show price u option market imply thatthe price insure u financial sector stock market crash low, relative pricesof insurance individual banks’ stock price fall 2007–2009 financial crisis theus. thus, large amount tail risk actually miss cost financial sector crashinsurance crisis. in presence implicit explicit government guarantee,market crash insurance price may even fall guarantee likely activated.thus, fall crash insurance price could mistakenly interpret reduce risk, exactlywhen systemic risk rising. a anticipation future government intervention embed inmarket prices, reflect true underlie tail risk thus lead mismeasurementof

economic monetary union: cost unfinished bank union remark valeria sannucci deputy governor bank italy rome, 16 december 2016 over last years, europe undertake numerous reform different areas, fiscal bank financial stability, ambitious response urgent need resolve problem follow outbreak global financial sovereign debt crises. several initiative take strengthen european banks: definition application common rules, consolidation truly european authorities. the bank union vital element strengthen process. the single supervisory mechanism, complete extraordinarily short period time, entail extensive deep integration national authorities. while monetary union mostly consist share decision making, ssm envisage integration daily operational process carry national centralize level. the establishment ssm, follow single resolution mechanism, could prelude paradigm shift level european integration. however, yet materialized. on contrary, bank union still construction significant obstacle remain path completion. our presence today therefore provide timely opportunity discus remain done, go it, ultimately stress important complete project, repeatedly highlight researchers1 numerous representative eurosystem, first foremost ecb president. it important sake bank union project itself, also achievement broad european project. it accident original blueprint bank union rest three pillar (banking supervision, crisis management, deposit insurance): one integral part financial architecture need safeguard soundness stability bank system, break vicious circle bank sovereigns. this particularly important europe where, spite multiplicity sovereign state involved, aim achieve single european bank market european players. the first pillar bank union, single supervisory mechanism, avoid misalign incentive ensure appropriate regulatory supervisory standard enforce and, time, level play field cross-border banking. the second pillar, 1 among others, balassone f., s. cecchetti, m. cecioni, m. cioffi, w. cornacchia, f. corneli g. semeraro, 2016, ‘economic governance euro area: balance risk reduction risk sharing’, occasional papers, banca d’italia, 344; goyal r., p. koeva brooks, m. pradhan, t. tressel, g. dell'ariccia, r. leckow, c. pazarbasioglu, 2013, ‘a bank union euro area’, imf staff discussion note sdn/13/01, february; schoenmaker d. a. siegmann, ‘winners european bank union’, 2013, voxeu, 27 february; gros d. d. schoenmaker, ‘the case euro deposit insurance’, 2012, voxeu, 24 september. 2 incentive-compatible resolution framework, aim reduce moral hazard; also preserve financial stability, long adequate provision make eventual use public backstop large complex financial institutions.2 the third pillar, common deposit insurance scheme, would low probability systemic stress close channel contagion, i.e. would provide effective buff large number country-specific shocks, thereby low likelihood bank run overall systemic risk. if bank union remain today, result would neither compliant best practices, would achieve intend effects. in fact, dirk schoenmaker put it, immediate crisis past, 'governments start shop selectively bank union list’.3 in ‘à la carte’ bank union, absence common deposit insurance increase risk contagion, blunt implementation resolution framework public backstop place would heighten financial stability risks. a recently note senior deputy governor bank italy, lack common fiscal backstop ‘reflects unwillingness many european country consider possibility taxpayer country a may pay, even temporarily, crisis bank country b. accord view, banks, although supervise subject resolution european institutions, must ultimately remain national matter.’ 4 the outcome bank-sovereign nexus, bank union design counter, persists, within complex incomplete framework. european leader must therefore lose sight end goal instead complete project reasonable timeframe. the need press ahead make even urgent fact european bank financial system demonstrate resilience, stability still risk. indeed, risk europe’s macro-financial stability recently intensified. while true expansionary monetary policy stance euro area europe large support liquidity financial markets, curb tension government securities, 2 dewatripont m., 2014, ‘european banking: bailout, bail-in state aid control’, international journal industrial organization, vol. 34, issue c, page 37-43. 3 schoenmaker d., 2015, ‘firmer foundation strong european bank union’, bruegel work paper, 2015/13, november. 4 rossi s., 2016, ‘the bank union european integration process’, speech conference european bank union bank/firm relationship, april. 3 ease bank fund conditions, uncertainty nevertheless increase follow uk referendum and, though perhaps le so, italian referendum. nor, give recent political events, expect policy change unite states, fragility emerge economies, likely dispel medium term. european banks’ profitability business model extraordinary pressure, due sluggish growth, low interest rate and, differ extent across country banks, excess capacity, large stock non-performing loan difficult-to-value (level 3) assets. meanwhile, low nominal interest rate squeeze profit margin european insurance company pension funds. at recent hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament, ecb president warn lengthy period low interest rate create ‘fertile terrain’ financial-market risk call government take action risk associate rise debt level excessive valuations, result significant vulnerability european real estate markets. while solid today pre-crisis period, absence adequate, proportionate properly function safety net, europe’s bank also expose substantial risk individual stability. a common eu deposit guarantee scheme crucial component safety net set swiftly possible. in november 2015, commission present proposal european deposit insurance scheme (edis). the idea build exist national scheme gradually move towards european construction would fully place 2024. while introduction third pillar generally accept principle, controversy arise recently regard time negotiation standstill due opposition countries. introduce common deposit insurance enough, though. in order bolster public confidence ensure bank union capacity safeguard financial stability adverse circumstances, also need common public backstop cover resolution deposit insurance. furthermore, important acknowledge ability new eu resolution framework counter systemic crisis somewhat overstated, especially combine european commission’s approach competition state aid. a recent paper emilios avgouleas charles goodhart warn large-scale, bail-in centred, recapitalizations illustrate ‘danger over-reliance bail-ins’ provide 4 insightful description risk involve trigger bail-in process risk idiosyncratic.5 while bail-in tool actually well-designed address crisis individual banks, event systemic crisis use risk exacerbate threat financial stability rather stabilize system. in circumstances, possibility temporary public support, without necessarily involve banks’ creditors, consider favoured, dispel fear contagion prevent seed another crisis sown. of course, envisage public support exceptional circumstance undermine effort reduce form moral hazard lead excessive risk-taking banks. the risk imprudent behaviour still contain tackle way compatible safeguard financial stability, along line happen aftermath crisis, i.e. strengthen prudential framework, adapt structure remuneration scheme reduce incentive excessive risk-taking, make management fully liable event failure institution. at time, burden taxpayer could lighten require public fund recoup bank system late stage, financial stability long risk – envisage ‘key attribute effective resolution regime financial institutions’, draw financial stability board.6 to conclude, much do reduce risks, lag behind risk-sharing measures, natural complement. even already place, single resolution fund, path complete risk mutualization long. what cost unfinished construction? an incomplete bank union source risk itself. if neglect long, discourage banks’ reorganization consolidation process cost fund capital remain subject excessive uncertainty, likely undesirable effect banks’ ability support investment consumer spending. in transitional phase, bank still build adequate loss-absorbing buff government without traditional tool intervention, risk even greater. 5 avgouleas e., c.goodhart, 2016, ‘an anatomy bank bail-ins – why eurozone need fiscal backstop bank sector’, european economy, 2016.2., 5 december. 6 financial stability board, 2011, ‘key attribute effective resolution regime financial institutions’, principle 6.5. 5 we also remember complete bank union priority per se, conditional interventions. i refer, particular, much debate possible change prudential treatment sovereign exposures, among measure call order move forward creation edis. a draft report present committee economic monetary affair european parliament (econ)7 make entry force insurance phase edis conditional reduce risk bank sector. in regard, recognise change prudential treatment sovereign exposure could help break bank-sovereign nexus, i believe consider pre-condition for, alternative to, completion bank union. a clear timeline deposit insurance, single supervisory mechanism single resolution mechanism, would help reassure market soundness overall bank framework willingness member state pursue final design union. in meantime, single supervisory mechanism continue focus strengthen resilience bank sector. however, avoid over-calibration possible inconsistency different measure might impair ability european bank support real economy. a path must identify guide bank towards adequate level capital loss-absorbing capacity increase stability readiness withstand adverse market condition without compromise capacity finance economy sustain economic recovery. this especially true today banks’ profitability remain low recovery eu still struggle gain momentum. after substantially strengthen capital level recent years, eu bank require increase loss-absorbing capacity meet minimum requirement fund eligible liability (mrel). in regard policymakers face trade-off: one hand, large stock liability feasibly credibly absorb loss resolution contribute resolvability bank financial stability, simultaneously protect taxpayers; hand, build-up adequate buff loss-absorbing 7 see european parliament, committee economic monetary affairs, work document edis draft report proposal regulation european parliament council amend regulation (eu) 806/2014 order establish european deposit insurance scheme (com(2015)0586 – c8-0371/2015 – 2015/0270(cod)), rapporteur esther de lange. 6 capacity may costly banks, impair lend capacity real economy, require time. the review legislative framework, start european commission’s recent proposals, strike right balance. in event, indispensable avoid needlessly high mrel requirement disproportionate effective need resolution.8 **** let conclude two quotations. in recent speech emu forum, peter praet say ‘completing union sometimes frame term trade-off risk share risk reduction […] i believe route need follow move forward parallel […]. a european deposit insurance scheme would enhance overall depositor confidence … this foundation insurance: pool resource risk across large diverse group, overall shock-absorbing capacity system increases. in sense, risk share turn risk reduction’.9 in work paper publish month ago economic governance euro area, group researcher bank italy review measure take concern sovereign bank since 2010 conclude europe crossroads: ‘either find strength return root embrace second (and deeper) round reform base enhance risk sharing, risk run pro-cyclical excess may finally tear apart’.10 this forum may therefore provide valuable contribution enhance awareness policymakers dramatic, yet possible outcome piecemeal, short-sighted approach completion bank union. 8 bank italy, financial stability report no. 2 / 2016, november 2016, p. 36-37. 9 ‘the importance genuine bank union monetary policy’, vienna, 24 november 2016 10 balassone et al. 7 news conference page 1/5 berne, 15 december 2016 thomas jordan introductory remark thomas jordan lady gentleman it pleasure welcome swiss national bank’s news conference. i begin explain monetary policy decision assessment economic situation. i hand fritz zurbrügg, speak current development area financial stability announce date release new 20-franc banknote. after that, andréa maechler review situation financial market discus impact negative interest money capital markets. finally, – ever – please take questions. monetary policy decision let begin monetary policy decision inflation forecast. our monetary policy remain expansionary continue base two elements: negative interest rate willingness intervene foreign exchange market. we leave interest sight deposit snb –0.75% target range three-month libor remain unchanged –1.25% –0.25%. at time, remain active foreign exchange market necessary, take overall currency situation consideration. the snb’s expansionary monetary policy aim stabilise price development support economic activity. the negative interest rate willingness intervene foreign exchange market intend make swiss franc investment le attractive, thereby ease pressure currency. the swiss franc still significantly overvalued. compare september, new conditional inflation forecast revise slightly downwards short term. this mainly reflect fact inflation october berne, 15 december 2016 thomas jordan news conference page 2/5 november somewhat low expected. however, expectation medium-term development inflation remain essentially unchanged. we continue anticipate inflation rate –0.4% current year. for 2017, inflation forecast 0.1%, 0.2% previous quarter. for 2018, expect inflation 0.5%, compare 0.6% third quarter. the conditional inflation forecast base assumption three-month libor remain –0.75% entire forecast horizon. global economic outlook i would like turn economic development abroad, considerable bear inflation economic outlook switzerland. since last monetary policy assessment september, global economy develop line expectations. it continue recover capacity utilisation many country improve gradually. this especially evident labour market, job number rise unemployment declining. however, global economic growth moderate yet broad-based. international trade demand investment particular continue subdued. inflationary pressure abroad also remain low. although high energy price currently result mark increase inflation, core inflation remain low level number country central bank thus maintain expansionary monetary policy course. among advance economies, economic cycle progress furthest us. third-quarter gdp growth u significantly potential. private consumption drive force. the situation labour market continue improve well; u economy almost reach full employment. this also reflect robust real wage growth. inflation close target set u federal reserve. against backdrop, federal reserve decide yesterday raise key interest rate 25 basis points. this move confirmation – federal reserve’s view – world’s large economy gradually emerge protract period crisis. the major economic area also record favourable economic activity third quarter. the euro area japan continue register moderate growth, china, growth remain strong thank variety fiscal measures. in uk, economic impact brexit decision far prove le pronounce originally feared. however, country’s economic performance still expect impair outcome come quarters. our assessment international economic development next quarter remain largely unchanged since september. the snb expect moderate pace global growth continue 2017. it thus likely economic situation continue improve, particularly euro area, inflation also pick somewhat. berne, 15 december 2016 thomas jordan news conference page 3/5 our baseline scenario global economy still subject considerable risks, however. structural problem number advance economy – fragile financial system, high public debt low growth potential – could negatively affect outlook. add multitude political uncertainties. first, unclear direction economic policy u take follow presidential election. second, several country euro area important election come 2017. and third, exit negotiation uk eu likely complex arduous. swiss economic outlook i shall turn economic outlook switzerland. accord initial quarterly estimate, gdp switzerland grow annualised rate 0.2% third quarter. this small increase must also see context high growth second quarter. year-on-year, gdp rise 1.3% third quarter. initial quarterly estimate national account uncertain definition. the snb therefore take wide range additional information account assess economic situation. available indicator suggest gradual recovery since mid-2015, continue second half 2016. a key factor improve business household sentiment euro area advance economies, turn create favourable environment swiss export industry. overall, signal economic indicator consistent previous gdp growth forecast around 1.5% 2016 whole. development labour market support view. employment statistic show number job switzerland grow third quarter, too. up november, seasonally adjust unemployment rate year stable 3.3%. the outlook come year cautiously optimistic. over course 2017, export demand look set gradually strengthen further. for export industry, mean good capacity utilisation le pressure margins. we also expect gradual recovery labour market. various survey confirm assessment. together continue expansionary monetary policy, labour market development boost domestic demand. private consumption, too, likely make great contribution economic growth. overall, 2016, snb expect gdp growth 2017 roughly 1.5%. however, swiss economy also face major challenge come year. structural change continue affect several important industries. retail contend change distribution channel spend habit households. the financial sector push ahead regulatory adjustment manage transition new business models, manufacturing, digitalisation go particular focus attention. our country’s future welfare depend critically well master challenges. berne, 15 december 2016 thomas jordan news conference page 4/5 exchange rates, interest rate inflation expectation i review change monetary condition since middle year. the last half year shape surprise outcome number political events. the brexit decision lead significant devaluation pound sterling generate upward pressure safe-haven currencies. thank willingness intervene foreign exchange market, able cushion effect additional pressure swiss franc, often build phase increase market volatility. equally, neither u election italian constitutional referendum cause significant change value franc overall. on trade-weighted basis, real external value franc hardly change course year. an analysis nominal exchange rate since last assessment june show franc appreciate slightly euro. against dollar, meanwhile, depreciate somewhat. one reason appreciation u dollar swiss franc currency substantial increase long-term interest rate us, particularly follow presidential election. long-term yield swiss confederation bond also risen, yield increase le pronounce us. the interest rate differential u thus widened. short-term rate switzerland virtually unchanged, yield curve steepen result. inflation expectation switzerland remain stable. most households, company financial analyst anticipate inflation slightly positive short medium term. this view substantiate survey conduct snb’s delegate regional economic relations. despite weak inflation recent years, long-term inflation expectation change little remain firmly anchor range equate price stability. monetary policy outlook lady gentlemen, let summarise key points. even time turbulence witness last six months, monetary policy prove worth. the negative interest rate partially restore traditional interest rate differential currency thus make swiss franc investment le attractive. during period high volatility, willingness intervene foreign exchange market stabilise effect exchange rate. the two element monetary policy base – negative interest rate willingness intervene – help reduce pressure swiss franc. thus, despite period heighten uncertainty last months, franc remain quite stable overall. furthermore, negative interest rate lead low interest capital market, facilitate corporate financing. in words, expansionary monetary policy effective. the negative interest rate willingness intervene foreign exchange market continue necessary berne, 15 december 2016 thomas jordan news conference page 5/5 appropriate. this inflation still low, production capacity yet fully utilise swiss franc continue significantly overvalued. our monetary policy stabilise price development support economic activity switzerland. lady

financial stability board (fsb), help launch task force climate-related financial disclosure consultative report. in late 2015, request g201, fsb establish private-sector, industry-led task force, leadership michael bloomberg. it mandate develop recommendation voluntary, consistent, comparable, clear reliable disclosure around climate-related financial risk companies. the purpose provide information investors, lenders, insurer stakeholder need manage risks, seize associate opportunities. a who’ve opportunity read report seen, task force achieve great deal year. so behalf shareholders, creditor citizens, i thank task force member tremendous efforts, company make available important work. if want job do well, give busy people. public authority – like g20 fsb – could identify problem, need private-sector provide solution. this solution market, market. the task force member draw private sector across advance emerge g20 economies, include major companies, large investors, global bank insurers, major account firm credit rat agencies.2 a such, task force represent true cross-section prepare, demand use climate-related financial disclosures. let briefly recap financial stability imperative act climate-related financial risk from rise sea level severe storm intense droughts, climate change already present physical risk 1 the g20 asked, april 2015 communique, fsb “convene public- private-sector participant review financial sector take account climate-related issues”. 2 a full list task force member find at: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/about/# all speech available online

1980s around $50bn past decade.3 insurer therefore amongst great commercial incentive understand tackle climate change short term. their response london cut edge understand management risks. for example, lloyd’s london underwriter first use storm record mesh natural science finance order analyse change weather patterns. today lloyd’s underwriter require consider climate change explicitly business plan underwrite models. the big risk opportunity still come nearly every industry. public policy, consumer demand technological innovation drive shift towards low carbon economy. a year ago paris, 195 country commit limit rise global average temperature le 2°c, 117 country ratify commitment. so citizens, consumers, businesses, governments, international organisation take action. and entrepreneur develop disruptive technology create destroy value. but financial institution best position gain lose transition? which company industry most, least, dependent fossil fuels? which business vulnerable potential damage rise physical risks? in every case, firm governance, resource strategy manage, profit from, major shifts? at present, challenge investor currently don’t information need answer questions. this must change financial market go best: allocate capital manage risk seize new opportunities. without necessary information, market adjustment climate change incomplete, late potentially destabilising. but right information, financial market smooth transition 2-degree world. risk financial stability reduce transition low carbon economy begin early follow predictable path. 3 see carney (2016), “breaking tragedy horizon – climate change financial stability”, speech give lloyd’s london, september 2015. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/pages/speeches/default.aspx 4 4 of course, give uncertainty around climate, everyone agree time scale adjustment require achieve goal. but right information allow optimist pessimists, sceptic evangelists, back conviction capital. the main obstacle stand way smooth timely market-led adjustment absence quality information climate-related financial risk opportunities. a task force highlighted, significant number climate-disclosure regime – indeed count around 4004 – already exist. but exist scheme vary status, coverage ambition. for example, 80% fortune 500 company participate one exist schemes, remain case around third top 1,000 u company produce broadly comparable information climate-related financial risk face. the task force’s report – present today – show way forward. let highlight recommendation make major contribution. the first breakthrough disclosure framework sufficiently comprehensive use publicly-listed companies, whatever sector, across full set climate-related financial risk face. the recommendation design leverage, rather replace, exist disclosure regimes. so task force set firm comply effectively exist disclosure obligations, disclose climate-related financial risk opportunity mainstream financial reports. in turn, ensure consideration climate-related financial risk, opportunities, properly embed within, subject to, firms’ corporate governance risk management. report risk cannot remain niche activity. decision-useful, actionable information the disclosure recommendation deliver actionable information useful decision making. in particular, focus four area critical real-world business operate: governance, strategy, risk management, metrics. 4 see oecd (2015), “climate change disclosure g20 countries”. all speech available online www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/pages/speeches/default.aspx 5 5 the expectation qualitative narrative disclosure complement quantitative one case disclosure make financial statements. these group category revenues, expenditures, asset liability capital. more specifically, firms, energy giant consumer good producers, encourage disclose their: - direct carbon emission plus energy consumption, consistent manner (i.e. scope 1 2), complement emission reduction target company may set themselves. - supplemented, judge appropriate, upstream downstream (i.e. scope 3) emission at time, task force set sector-specific guidance sector big carbon footprint exposures. this ensure investor know much utility company invest low carbon

depression. resident haveendured terrible drought, periodic blackout fiscal crisis. i don’t need elaborate allof struggle puerto rico continue face. the island suffer viciouscycle. a employment declines, people move mainland find jobs. accordingly,economic activity tax revenue decline, force government raise tax cutspending, reduce employment prompt still resident move. at thispoint, outlook anyone live must bleak, may hard toimagine situation turn around anytime soon. and yet, history tell u turnaround,though inevitable, indeed achievable. lesson past crisesnew york city probably famous example municipality experience majorfiscal crisis, recover thriving. new york city’s experience viewed, retrospect,as major success, some, include myself, point hopeful example 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech could come pas puerto rico. but, important caveat new york city storyand applicability commonwealth.like puerto rico, new york city experience number year political economicpain result fiscal crisis 1970s. on political side, new york city resident losta large measure ability chart fiscal direction several years. decisionsabout tax spend policy remove elect city officials. the emergencyfinancial control board empower review fiscal decision local official anddemand change city’s budgets. part city’s tax base dedicate bondrepayment—essentially hand city’s creditors. for 10 years, city could notaccess debt market without support state.the economic pain also real. more 70,000 city government worker cut fromthe payroll 1975 1976. city resident face dramatic service reductions—fire housesclosed, school police precinct few resources, crime continue rise manyyears.it also important note new york isn’t u.s. city majorfiscal crisis. cleveland, philadelphia, washington, d.c. and, recently, detroit allstruggled manage budgets, ultimately reach point unable topay bills. a result, city lose fiscal autonomy one degree another. in thecase new york city, turn relatively well, short-run loss decision-makingpower lead strong economic rebound eventually restore city’s ability finance itsown choices.so, new york city’s experience really instructive puerto rico? with advantageof hindsight, seem almost obvious new york city’s fiscal crisis go bea detour. the city’s economy many fundamental strengths, need someassistance get back track. still, it’s worth point mean clear atthe outset crisis mid-1970s. then, many commentator look new york city andother large city outmode form economic activity, unlikely ever recover.while great measure economic activity cities, population change goodindicator attractive place seem be. by measure, new york city time wasseen poor prospects—the city’s population fell 10 percent 1970s. so, new york city’s eventual bright future far clear fiscal crisis unfolding.of course, every city face fiscal crisis track record. relative tocities similarly grim outlooks, new york city’s rebound much stronger. indetroit, hopeful signs, it’s soon tell thing turn out. both washington,d.c. philadelphia experience multiple decade population decline lead theircrises. these population decline reverse 2000s. washington, d.c.’s population actuallygrew 5 percent 2000 2010, rate even fast new york city. cleveland’s fiscal reforms, hand, le comprehensive, city neverreally turn around. it population 2010 le half level 1960.the different performance across city reflect complex interplay native endowments,economic condition fiscal outcomes. a puerto rico, fiscal woe many ourlargest city closely relate long-term economic transformations—essentially,changes industrial specialization occur particular places. in case ofnew york city, transformation manufacture services, take generationto complete. the city’s management transition far perfect, fiscal crisiswas major manifestation failure. the institution set respond crisis werecrucial ensure fiscal policy didn’t continue amplify problem associate theeconomic transition. for city turn circumstance around, must navigate economictransformation, identify define comparative advantage go forward, build 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech anew around source strength.the road recoverya successful fiscal reform first require regime local official recognize acceptthe reality change economic situation, set spend budget accordingly. this partis fairly straightforward, produce simple policy dictum borrowing—in itsforms—must strictly limited. of course, know actually get do aredifferent things, especially politics involved. a result, record suggest canbe extremely helpful kind independent fiscal monitor place ongoingbasis. it’s important monitor insulate direct influence politics, give itfreedom deliver objective analysis may time unpopular. in washington, d.c.,this take form office chief financial officer; new york city theindependent budget office, model congressional budget office. thesemonitors prove invaluable keep policymakers public inform budgetarymatters, provide apolitical expertise assist keep budget sustainablecourse. the second major component successful completion economic transformation, whichis critical factor reversing―rather simply halting―a city’s decline, establish avirtuous cycle rise growth strengthen fiscal outcomes. new york city hugebenefit comparative advantage finance—an industry poise sustainedgrowth post-fiscal-crisis period 1980s 2000s. still, city weather alot shock period, include 9/11 terrorist attacks, financial crisis andhurricane sandy. it’s also worth point new york city still prospering, even thoughemployment finance sector stagnated. this illustrate need city continuallylook new area growth, health care, technology, leisure hospitalityservices.this promesa (the puerto rico oversight, management, economic stability act)emphasizes long-term growth, new york feed focus identifyingimpediments commonwealth’s growth. since 2012, release two major reportsand several short analyses—most appear liberty street economics blog—presenting idea that, implemented, might help make island competitive andreverse economic decline. these idea range narrow technical tothe broad—from improve quality commonwealth financial report bolsteringgrowth education job train build island’s human capital.since i’ve identify manage ongoing economic transformation major component asuccessful plan puerto rico, let summarize theme front. most thesefeature important role commonwealth’s government, underscore fundamentalimportance get public policy right mean restore economic growth.first, important reduce cost business island way encouragingbusiness growth increase demand labor. we put forward many idea toconsider here, range one target hiring—such give puerto rico autonomyover set minimum wage policy—to general idea like streamline regulation. onething we’ve repeatedly emphasize need find efficiency island’s energyindustry. commercial customer island pay roughly 20 cent per kilowatt hour forelectricity—nearly double mainland average. island resident businesses, arewell aware, also burden exceptionally high water utility bills. it also important tothink hard supply labor—the willingness people work, education andskills bring market. labor supply equally important, le widelydiscussed demand side market. labor force participation low age inpuerto rico mainland. this crucial impediment growth, address 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech require innovative policy options. one idea address problem would extend theearned income tax credit puerto rico. in addition, structure commonwealth’s taxsystem create disincentive work formal sector, suggest tax reform couldproduce growth dividend well reliable source revenue. on top low laborforce participation well know deeply concern high level out-migration. in additionto lack labor demand, seem likely quality-of-life concern high crime ratesare play role decisions. this underscore

puerto rico start road recovery. in currentenvironment, it’s hard see beyond immediate crisis bright future puerto rico, butthat say place come back strong ever. get fiscalsituation order important first step. the factor lead crisis take many yearsto develop, history show successful recovery crisis also take time. it isimportant recognize fact stay course.before i conclude, let briefly discus
